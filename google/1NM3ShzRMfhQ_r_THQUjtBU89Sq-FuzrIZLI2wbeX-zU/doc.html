In a world that lives only on the continuum between actively rivalrous (things are really scarce right now) and potentially rivalrous (things are relatively plentiful right now), the anti-rivalrous doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. &nbsp;But this continuum isn&rsquo;t the whole story. &nbsp;There is an aspect of Reality that is intrinsically anti-rivalrous.<br><br>So - now to the objective side of the coin.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Taken from the &ldquo;objective&rdquo; sense, the rivalrous refers to phenomena in the world that both can be and are scarce. &nbsp;If there are three of us and there is only enough water for one of us, that water is rivalrous. &nbsp;One will drink and three will go thirsty (or, possibly, everyone will go thirsty- but only for a little while). &nbsp;The non-rivalrous refers to a phenomenon that can be scarce - but isn&rsquo;t (yet). &nbsp;If there are three of us and plenty of water for all, the water is non-rivalrous. &nbsp;Obviously, in this sense, the difference between rivalrous and non-rivalrous is contextual. &nbsp;Add more people or lose some of the water and a once non-rivalrous thing can become rivalrous. &nbsp;Subtract people or add water and a once rivalrous thing can become non-rivalrous. &nbsp;This is important. &nbsp;We might call this the &ldquo;rivalrous continuum&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By contrast, the anti-rivalrous is *intrinsically* not scarce. &nbsp;It can not be scarce (although it can be non-existent or unevenly distributed and it can be made &ldquo;scarce-like&rdquo; more on that in a bit). &nbsp;The very notion of &ldquo;anti-rivalrous&rdquo; is anti-rivalrous. &nbsp;The idea can be shared among three people or three million people - and there is nothing about the sharing that dilutes or reduces its presence or value. &nbsp;We can all &ldquo;have&rdquo; the idea without anyone losing anything (or, to be precise, without anyone losing anything except for the time and energy associated with rivalrous substrate necessary to communicate the anti-rivalrous).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Note that a rivalrous mind-set might object here that by &ldquo;giving away&rdquo; a valuable idea, I might be diluting its value. &nbsp;But this is an error stemming from a long habit of living in and with a rivalrous mindset. &nbsp;The rivalrous mindset sees everything through the rivalrous lens and, therefore, has a hard time conceiving of value that isn&rsquo;t in terms of winning a rivalrous game. &nbsp;While it is the case that I can use my exclusive awareness of an anti-rivalrous thing (like, say, an innovation in fusion energy that I just came up with) as leverage in a rivalrous strategy this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the notion is rivalrous. &nbsp;Only that it can be used as (or &ldquo;rendered&rdquo;) rivalrous. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is important. &nbsp; As far as we can tell, in the context of the Real, the anti-rivalrous is always bounded by communication. &nbsp;And communication is always bounded by some medium of communication - some rivalrous substrate (be that neurons, air, radiowaves, hard drive space, etc.). &nbsp;Conceptually, it is important to decouple the essence of the anti-rivalrous from the (as far as we know) necessity of some rivalrous medium. &nbsp;The process of ephemeralization is due to this decoupling. &nbsp;I can move a given anti-rivalrous idea from a &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; medium (say engravings in a stone tablet) to a &ldquo;light&rdquo; medium (say photons on an LCD screen) without losing anything in the idea. &nbsp;The idea is anti-rivalrous, communications can be rivalrous.<br><br>Close the communications and the anti-rivalrous can be used in rivalrous games. &nbsp;Open the communications and you begin to find yourself in an anti-rivalrous game. &nbsp;Moreover, the anti-rivalrous is the source of innovation and, hence, to moving the actually scarce to the potentially scarce (from rivalrous to non-rivalrous). &nbsp; We can call this the &ldquo;anti-rivalrous continuum&rdquo;. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So now we have a matrix of the subjective and objective senses of these three things and the notion of two continuua: [Rivalrous &lt;-- Non-Rivalrous] [Anti-rivalrous:: Non-rivalrous &lt;- Rivalrous]<br><br>The next step in the inquiry is to notice that the relationships among them aren&rsquo;t simple. &nbsp;For example, some might say that it is &ldquo;better&rdquo; to have a non-rivalrous disposition (&ldquo;sharing is caring&rdquo;). &nbsp;However, if we truly find ourselves in a rivalrous competition over real and actual scarcity, a non-rivalrous disposition will simply &ldquo;lose&rdquo; and be extinguished from the game. &nbsp;The reverse situation is much more subtle. &nbsp;If the context is non-rivalrous, selecting a rivalrous disposition is a particular move - sometimes known in game theory as &ldquo;defection&rdquo; or becoming a &ldquo;free rider&rdquo;. &nbsp;The problem here, of course, is that the rivalrous player in a non-rivalrous game will tend to convert the non-rivalrous game into a rivalrous game! &nbsp;i.e., turning a context where everyone can win into one where at least some must lose. &nbsp; If we select a meta-strategy that can state-switch from rivalrous to non-rivalrous, we will find a higher optimum (e.g., tit for tat).<br><br>If you have a default or ideological &ldquo;rivalrous&rdquo; mindset, this notion might land to you as simply &ldquo;being smarter than everyone else&rdquo; or &ldquo;not being the sucker&rdquo;. &nbsp;If you have a default &ldquo;non-rivalrous&rdquo; mindset, the rivalrous mindset would land as &ldquo;being an asshole&rdquo;. &nbsp;In any event, the foundational linkage between the rivalrous and non-rivalrous keeps these moves in constant play. &nbsp;Hence the tragedy of the commons - in non-rivalrous games, non-rivalrous players need to constantly try to police rivalrous players or the game will for sure change to rivalrous (and, thence, to either a static rivalrous equilibrium or some sort of collapse depending on the relative power of the agents and the strength of the context). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The situation of the anti-rivalrous (taken in the &ldquo;objective&rdquo; sense) is different. &nbsp;The leverage/power of an anti-rivalrous disposition in the context of anti-rivalrous phenomenon can be extremely powerful. &nbsp;This is a meta-game. &nbsp;While, for example, keeping language restricted to an elite might seem like a good move in a rivalrous game, any group that allows language the be shared widely will roundly outcompete such a &ldquo;language-limited&rdquo; strategy. &nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Thus: from the point of view of the rivalrous disposition, the anti-rivalrous aspect of the world is *THE* key to winning. &nbsp;But this means trying to capture an anti-rivalrous disposition within a rivalrous meta-container. &nbsp;I.e., get the scientists to cooperate, but always keep them dependent on funding. &nbsp;By contrast, the anti-rivalrous can have the result of ameliorating scarcity and, therefore, rendering the rivalrous strategy the losing strategy. &nbsp;From the anti-rivalrous point of view, the portion of the world that is on the Rivalrous continuum should be approached with a non-rivalrous disposition, supporting an anti-rivalrous disposition in the anti-rivalrous domain so as to generate a real movement of the rivalrous to the non-rivalrous.</span></p></body></html>
