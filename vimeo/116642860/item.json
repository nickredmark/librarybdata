  "description": "Press: Award Winning Documentary. I hour. \n\n“The double bind that we now face is this: on the one hand, we want to preserve our natural environment; on the other, everything we do to grow our economy and preserve our standard of living disrupts the natural environment and our relationships with it. Nora, like her father, suggests that we must raise our consciousness and learn to think in new ways to escape our pathology of wrong thinking...Nora Bateson presents viewers not only with an intellectually challenging and inspiring work of art, but also with a glimpse of evanescent hope.”\n--Marilyn Wedge, Huffington Post, 13 October 2011\n\n“Gregory Bateson taught us how to stop having the most fundamental old ideas: the static, separating, reductionist fictions that dis-integrate an integrated world. Nora Bateson's beautiful portrait of her father's key insights is a stunningly effective antidote for a new generation that now needs his wisdom more than ever.”\n -Amory B. Lovins, Chairman and Chief Scientist, Rocky Mountain Institute\n\n\"An Ecology of Mind is a spell-binding, lyrical, and very important film...\" \n--Rex Weyler - Co-Founder, Greenpeace International\n\n“The task she took on was hardly easy. Pinning Bateson down takes a fair amount of effort. Coming up with a simple definition of, say, systems theory is one thing. Doing so in a way that educates the average filmgoer without making her film feel like a mere academic exercise is something else entirely. Yet Nora Bateson manages to do so by always keeping the man she knew at the center. “ \n--Dan Webster, NPR\n\nAwards:\n\nWon Gold for Best Documentary, Spokane International Film Festival, 2011 Audience Award Winner, Best Documentary, Santa Cruz Film Festival, 2011 Winner, Media Ecology Association, John Culkin Award for Outstanding Praxis, 2011",

President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",
