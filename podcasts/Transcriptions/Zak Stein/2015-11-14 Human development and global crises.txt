Yeah, again, in the wake of that paper I wrote Katie, I can kind of bring her into the room here. We all met at bill Torbert house and had this little power. And one of the things I said there, I'll say here, which is that although we are sometimes in dialogues like this, we are so fundamentally on the same team, and it's critical to understand how essential it is we get our acts together as a team. Even though we have diverse perspectives, right, you have to understand that we're in the midst of a compounding kind of meta crisis at the global level. One of the crises is a crisis of capability, which is an educational crisis. And as the situation gets worse, we're going to have increasingly coercive measures used to change the nature of human capital, right? And the most obvious one is psychopharmacology. Right, which is an actual physical intervention into the central nervous system of over 6 million children in the United States. And this is because we have a psychology that does not understand development organically or development at all.
So there's a way which we are debating. But there's a more much more profound way in which one of our tasks is to change the way we think about what it means to change people's minds. And that requires thinking deeply about developmental psychology and development of measurement, and trying to supplant what has become a human capital management system on a global scale. That is decimating the life prospects of up and coming generations. And so it's an urgency and urgency I feel to ally and to build a way forward for human development as a field, if only so that the educational systems up tomorrow are dignified.
