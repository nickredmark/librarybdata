What I want to talk about is the way that we've got kind of addicted to a simplistic way of thinking about intelligence, right. And actually, many people have an allergy to thinking about it in the more complex way. And, you know, Howard Gardner, Kurt Fisher, who I studied with at Harvard, all they wanted to do is talk about it in a more complex way. And they have very little interest in anything like general intelligence and thought it was actually a concept that was dangerous. Right? Howard Gardner once said to me that intelligence is the most political of all the psychological concepts, right? Because it becomes the meritocracies kind of yardstick. And so yeah, so that's a little bit of a preamble to like okay, let's deliberate thinking about intelligence from the IQ and started thinking about intelligence in a more complex way.
