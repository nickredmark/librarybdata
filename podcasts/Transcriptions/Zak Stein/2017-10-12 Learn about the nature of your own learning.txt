One of the most important things you can focus on is the nature of development itself and the nature of your own learning. So learn about the nature of learning scientifically, but also learn about your own unique learning needs and patterns, right? So not everyone can sit with a book for 45 minutes, but they can do 15 minutes, get upstairs space, walk around 15 minutes, get upstairs in space walk around, right? So you need to learn how you work. And a lot of research can help with that things like the neuro hacker resources, all of these things should be grist for that mill. But one of the things that you see with people who go post conventional and kind of become self actualized and move up to these higher levels of that they're very reflective about their own learning. They know how they learn when they learn best, I know what excites them, they know how to follow investigative patterns independently. And so the reflective and so they create these virtuous cycles of learning for themselves naturally throughout life.
