Obviously, in this sense, the difference between rivalrous and non-rivalrous is contextual.  Add more people or lose some of the water and a once non-rivalrous thing can become rivalrous.  Subtract people or add water and a once rivalrous thing can become non-rivalrous.  This is important.  We might call this the “rivalrous continuum”."

What's of course happening for us is [...] historical factors have [...] undermined the experience of sacredness and all of the ways in which we can cultivate an ecology of psychotechnologies for enhancing religion, because we do not have a worldview [...] that legitimates or encourages that.\n\nAnd so people are forced - as I said - to cobble together, in a dangerously autodidactic fashion, their own personal responses to perennial problems, without traditions, guidance, communities well worked out [...] practices, well vetted, well developed. And so [...] they're often bereft when they face the perennial problems.\n\nSo, responding to the mean crisis has two components to it, and that's why I call it \"awakening from the meaning crisis\", because it has not only the response of trying to rearticulate a new world view in which the projects of enhancing religio again gets validation, is properly situated encouraged, facilitated, legitimated etc. but we also need to understand what the set of practices, the ecology of psychotechnologies would look like, that would allow us to address the perennial problems."
