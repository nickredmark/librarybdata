    "description": "Press: Award Winning Documentary. I hour. \n\n“The double bind that we now face is this: on the one hand, we want to preserve our natural environment; on the other, everything we do to grow our economy and preserve our standard of living disrupts the natural environment and our relationships with it. Nora, like her father, suggests that we must raise our consciousness and learn to think in new ways to escape our pathology of wrong thinking...Nora Bateson presents viewers not only with an intellectually challenging and inspiring work of art, but also with a glimpse of evanescent hope.”\n--Marilyn Wedge, Huffington Post, 13 October 2011\n\n“Gregory Bateson taught us how to stop having the most fundamental old ideas: the static, separating, reductionist fictions that dis-integrate an integrated world. Nora Bateson's beautiful portrait of her father's key insights is a stunningly effective antidote for a new generation that now needs his wisdom more than ever.”\n -Amory B. Lovins, Chairman and Chief Scientist, Rocky Mountain Institute\n\n\"An Ecology of Mind is a spell-binding, lyrical, and very important film...\" \n--Rex Weyler - Co-Founder, Greenpeace International\n\n“The task she took on was hardly easy. Pinning Bateson down takes a fair amount of effort. Coming up with a simple definition of, say, systems theory is one thing. Doing so in a way that educates the average filmgoer without making her film feel like a mere academic exercise is something else entirely. Yet Nora Bateson manages to do so by always keeping the man she knew at the center. “ \n--Dan Webster, NPR\n\nAwards:\n\nWon Gold for Best Documentary, Spokane International Film Festival, 2011 Audience Award Winner, Best Documentary, Santa Cruz Film Festival, 2011 Winner, Media Ecology Association, John Culkin Award for Outstanding Praxis, 2011",

President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",

President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",

      "bio": "Nora Bateson\nFilmmaker, writer, educator. President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",

President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",

President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",

President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",

President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",

President of the International Bateson Institute, Sweden, USA, Canada\n\nNora Bateson, is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. An international lecturer, researcher and writer, Nora wrote, directed and produced the award-winning documentary, An Ecology of Mind, a portrait of her father, Gregory Bateson. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems. \n\nThe IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. Nora is the president of the International Bateson Institute, directing research projects that require multiple contexts of research. interdependent processes. Asking, “How we can create a context in which to study the contexts?” An impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”. \n\nAs an educator she has developed curricula for schools in Northern California, and produced and directed award winning multimedia projects on intercultural and ecological understanding. Her work, which has been presented at the world’s top universities, is described as “offering audiences a lens through which to see the world that effects not only the way we see, but also the way we think”.  Nora’s work in facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions is part of her research into what she calls, “the ecology of the conversation”. Her speaking engagements include keynote addresses and lectures at international conferences and universities on a wide range of topics that span the fields of anti-fascism, ecology, education, the arts, family therapy, leadership and many more aspects of advocacy for living systems--she travels between conversations in different fields bringing multiple perspectives into view to reveal larger patterns.\n\n\nMemberships and awards: \nBoard Member: Tallberg Foundation, Fellow of Lindsifarne, Bateson Idea Group (BIG), Human Potential Foundation, Awards: Sustainable Thompkins Ecology Award, Winner Spokane Film Festival, Winner Santa Cruz Film Festival, Media Ecology Award.",

These are just a few of the questions discussed and answered on Collective Insights as Neurohacker cofounder Jordan Greenhall joins Daniel for an intriguing conversation. Greenhall sets the foundation for why incentives are the way they are today and why our society should make a transition from Game A to Game B. As a way to accomplish this and help people gain more sovereignty, Greenhall looks at the emergent cryptoeconomic systems being developed and how they might apply in different areas such as healthcare. He also discusses the history of U.S. education and why we need to rethink how people learn in order to promote a greater degree of sovereignty.",

      "description": "Jordan Greenhall is the CEO of Neurohacker Collective and is now in his seventeenth year of building disruptive technology companies.\n\nJordan graduated from Texas A&M and  Harvard Law School where he spent time with Larry Lessig, Jonathan Zittrain and Cornel West examining the coevolution of human civilization and technology.\n\nIn 1998, Jordan became an early employee crafting strategy and product for MP3.com, then at InterVU (acquired by Akamai) and then finally in 2000 launching and leading the online digital video revolution as founder and CEO of DivX.\n\nAfter navigating two financial crises and an IPO, he left the helm at DivX to return his attention to the big picture. Jordan participated in the Aspen Institute and the Santa Fe Institute where he served on the Board of Trustees for five years.\n\nAfter one week on an early Neurohacker Collective stack, he was convinced about the power and potential of this new technology and joined Daniel Schmachtenberger and James Schmachtenberger to bring it to the world.\n----\nThe topic is Sovereignty. Sovereignty is an individual’s capacity to respond to the world. The three elements of sovereignty are perception, sense-making and meaning-making, and action.\n\nJordan defines sovereignty in his essay as, “It is the ability to be present to the world and to respond to the world — rather than to be overwhelmed or merely reactive. Sovereignty is to be a conscious agent.”\n____\nKey Highlights\n\n- Why Jordan is excited about Donald Trump\n\n- What is sovereignty?\n\n- The historical transition underway, the factors which could lead to an apocalyptic moment, and how it might end a utopian future\n\n- Three key elements of sovereignty\n\n- Where to start if you want build sovereignty\n\n- How to scale from individual to collective sovereignty\n\n- The role of blockchain in accomplishing global sovereignty\n\n- What is Qualia and Qualia Mind?\n_____\nIf you want to try Qualia and Qualia Mind, head over to neurohacker.com.

      "title": "How Russia's Election Meddling Revolutionized Propaganda | Jordan Greenhall",
      "description": "New videos DAILY: https://bigth.ink\n\nJoin Big Think Edge for exclusive video lessons from top thinkers and doers: https://bigth.ink/Edge\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRussian hacking is less \"guys-in-hoodies-doing-big-nefarious-things\" than it is a few dozen people trying hundreds of smaller things to see what catches on and gets sent up the information ladder. Jordan Greenhall explains that what the Russian hacking units are doing is being ever changing and ever fluid and essentially flooding misinformation into parts of the internet—governments and companies and individuals included—so that the traditional American \"top down decision making\" process gets confused. After all, you're much more likely to believe an email coming from your boss than one coming from \"vlad@moscowhackercollective.biz\".\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJORDAN GREENHALL\n\nJordan is now in his 17th year of building disruptive technology companies, and is the co-founder and CEO of Neurohacker Collective. \n\n\r\nEarly in his career, he helped start the online digital video revolution as co-founder and CEO of DivX. After somewhat successfully navigating two financial crises and an IPO (and going down in flames at Stage6), he left the helm at DivX to return his attention to the big picture. He tried his hand at capitalism – combining Angel investment at the sharp edge of the Schumpeter wave — with participation in a number of think tanks and institutes; most notably, the Aspen Institute and the Santa Fe Institute where he served on the Board of Trustees for five sweet years.\n\n\r\nThis exposure led him to the conclusion that humanity is in the midst of a world historical transition which will likely kill all of us (see Mad Max) but just might end in a truly amazing future (see Star Trek). Getting there is going to require many things of us – most notably a significant upgrade of our individual and collective capacity for thought and action.\n\n\r\nAlthough he has long benefitted from entheogens, Jordan had not spent much time on nootropics or other Neurohacking techniques. After one week on an early NHC stack, he was convinced about the power and potential of this new technology and co-created Neurohacker Collective to bring it to the world.\n\n\n\n\r\n \n\n\r\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nJordan Greenhall: All right. So let's do Russian hacking. And what I want to do is I want to put quotes around \"Russian hacking\" because we're actually talking about a question of how we go about making sense of everything all together. So \"Russian hacking\" is not an event as much as it is a phenomenon that describes a very large number of things that different individuals, depending on the particular location in the social field, interpret differently.\n\n\r\nSo yes I think this is an excellent example of this new emergent mechanism of how we go about doing social control. And it's interesting because if you're looking at \"Russian hacking\" from the blue church perspective you're actually thinking about something that isn't actually how it's working and you're going to be making particular mistakes. So you will think I think, I mean certainly I'm defining the blue church so certainly if you are in the blue church modality you will think that there is some kind of hierarchical control structure with a small number of decision-makers, we will call them the Russians, who are principally responsible for the behavior of the system under investigation. So you are looking for an expertise hierarchy, somebody who is in charge and how their expertise hierarchy is percolating downward in its downward causation fashion to generate the results of what you're seeing.\n\n\r\nAnd that's actually not an appropriate evaluation of what's actually going on. Instead \"Russian hacking\" and the degree to which there is a specific understanding on the part of the Russians, which there certainly is they're clearly, what is the phrase somebody used—“punching up”?—They're clearly dramatically more effective right now than one should expect them to be given their actual capacity and power in the world because of the higher quality strategy in this new decentralized environment is I think actually recognizing the obsolescence of that notion of a top down decision-making framework where one of the primary strategies is to find people who are operating in that fashion and throw effectively sand in their eyes, create obfuscation mechanisms that cause top down decision making trees to have a hard time either understanding what's coming up to them or having their actuation potentials move down while simultaneously being part of a very large d...\n\nFor the full transcript, check out https://bigthink.com/videos/jordan-greenhall-how-russias-election-meddling-created-a-new-kind-of-propaganda",

      "description": "Jordan Greenhall talks about “Combining Intuition with Rational Mind – a more effective solution in Business” in this episode of the Intuitive Leadership Mastery Podcast with host Michael Light. Jordan is now in his seventeenth year of building disruptive technology companies. Classic “Ready Player One” style 80’s nerd. Comics, science fiction, computers, way too much TV and role-playing games. Oh, so many role playing games. Naturally, these interests led to a deep dive into contemporary philosophy (particularly the works of Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda), artificial intelligence and complex systems science in college in the early 90’s and then, as the Internet was exploding into the world, a few years at Harvard Law School of all places where he spent time with Larry Lessig, Jonathan Zittrain and Cornel West examining the coevolution of human civilization and technology.\n\n\n\nHere are some of the topics discussed in the podcast:\n\nJordan’s creative and writing process that lets him write in depth new ideas such as in his viral article “Situational Assessment 2017”. And the role of intuition in this.\nWhy getting inside your opponent’s OODA loop is key in politics or business.\nObserve – Intuition helps observe\nOrient – make meaning – intuition\nDecide – Intuition helps you make faster decisions\nAct – Inspired Actions, Play and Feedback help faster actions\nThe highest bandwidth OODA loop wins.\nWhat is a meme is and why it matter to your business + the dark arts of copywriting\nThe medium is the message – the change in tech is a phase quality shift – changes the game and unpredicabile\nWhy fighting the “last war” is a mistake in politics or business\nWorld Culture War II: The opportunities in the dramatic current changes in sense and nature of identity, meaning, and purpose\nActions to take now\nResources:\n\nJordan’s Situational Assessment 2017: Trump Edition https://medium.com/deep-code/situational-assessment-2017-trump-edition-d189d24fc046#.dtku79bam\nJordan’s Situational Analysis 2017 https://medium.com/deep-code/situational-assessment-2017-trump-edition-d189d24fc046#.15mdrg3qk\nVinital Roy – redefined reality as how much is shared – how realized it is\nA meme https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme is “an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture”. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Memes are the cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.\nThe Selfish Gene by Richard Dwakins https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Science-ebook/dp/B01GI5F2FS/?tag=abundant0e-20\nThe Meme Machine Susan Blackwell https://www.amazon.com/Meme-Machine-Popular-Science/dp/019286212X/?tag=abundant0e-20\nTrust Me, I’m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator by Ryan Holiday https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0074VTHH0/?tag=abundant0e-20\nThe Zeitgeist https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist_(film_series)\nThe Medium and the Message: Understanding the Information World by Marshall McLuhan https://www.amazon.com/Medium-Message-Understanding-Information-World/dp/1635358566/?tag=abundant0e-20\nThe OODA loop by John Boyd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop\nThe 7 Day Startup: You Don’t Learn Until You Launch by Dan Norris https://www.amazon.com/Day-Startup-\nLearn-Until-Launch-ebook/dp/B00NZFKB8S/?tag=abundant0e-20\nWar in Age of Intelligent Machine by Manuel De Landa https://www.amazon.com/War-Intelligent-Machines-Manuel-Landa/dp/0942299752/?tag=abundant0e-20\nLearn more about Jordan Greenhall at:\n\n*Website: http://neurohacker.com/\n*Profile: http://neurohacker.com/jordan-greenhall/\n*Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/neurohackercollective/\n\nGet show notes and transcript at:\nhttp://intuitiveleadershipmastery.com/podcast/combining-intuition-with-rational-mind-a-more-effective-solution-in-business/",

      "description": "Taking stock of America in the early 21st century and thinking about how to create the best governing system possible starts with utilizing modern digital technologies.\n\nParticipants include: \nJordan Greenhall - Entrepreneur & Angel Investor\nTanja Aitamurto - Deputy Director of the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Stanford University\nMichel Bauwens - Founder of P2P Foundation\nBret Weinstein - Evolutionary Theorist & Professor at The Evergreen State College\nJohn Robb - Author of \"Brave New War\"\nJake Dunagan - Global Foresight Lead & Managing Director of verynice.co\nJim Rutt - Former Chairman of Santa Fe Institute \nDavid Hodgson - Founder of Hummingbird Labs\n\nAbout this series: American politics is paralyzed and polarized, and many Americans worry that we aren’t moving quickly enough to rise to the many challenges of the 21st-century. This inaugural season of Reinvent America series spanned the gamut of fields that were ripe for reinvention and pulled together can-do innovators who worked in virtual roundtables on next generation ideas about how to solve our most pressing problems.\n\nAbout Reinvent: Reinvent gathers top innovators in video conversations to fundamentally reinvent our world.",

      "description": "Amidst all of the big changes and uncertainty we're experiencing in the world today, we can come to all kinds of conclusions about what it all means and how we fit into the picture. One common story we hear from well-intentioned activists fighting against wealth inequality and climate change: the accumulation of wealth is evil. The rich are destroying the planet. The 1% meme has even held some ground since the days of Occupy Wall Street, taken up as a rallying cry by Democratic Socialists. \n\nI wonder if there's another story. Speaking for myself, I have all kinds of twisted narratives around money. I need to be making enough to feel worthy and attract a mate. If I'm not providing, I have no value. Wealth accumulation is for the greedy and I'm not so I'll do my best to avoid it, etc. \n\nToday (for my first livestream!) my guest is Jordan Hall. Jordan has made the rounds on various podcasts and YouTube channels  discussing a wide range of things, namely the idea of cultivating sovereignty as a necessary step in the path to becoming a more effective agent in the world. \n\nBefore he started studying complexity at The Santa Fe Institute and writing posts on Medium about our failing institutions, Jordan was a highly successful tech entrepreneur. Jordan's wealth gave him the freedom to enter rooms and ask questions that would have been unthinkable had he been working a traditional 9-5. \n\nWhat is money? How do we rid ourselves of unhelpful, debilitating stories our wealth? Is it possible to ethically create wealth in the current climate?  \n\nJoin us for what is sure to be a mind-bending, heart-opening conversation. \n\n___________\n\nAll of my links:\nwww.linktr.ee/collinofzion",

      "description": "QUALIA NOOTROPIC 10% OFF CODE WF10: http://bit.ly/2jkzRhW\nSHOW BONUS: http://www.wellnessforce.com/Qualia \nASK A QUESTION: http://www.wellnessforce.com/voice\n\n\"We fully believe that optimized human beings lead to a better world. People being productive and creative in whatever it is that is theirs to do. But in many ways, our modern world works against us.” - Daniel Schmachtenberger, Co-Founder of The NeuroHacker Collective \n\nOn this special episode of Wellness Force Radio, Daniel shares far beyond how Nootropics like Qualia can provide a comprehensive hardware upgrade for radical cognitive enhancement and emotional resilience, but also how he believes it is creating the building blocks towards a better planet.\n\nYou, The N Equals One - http://nuerohacker.com/ref/28/\n\nIn a world of mass distractions, responsibilities, cumulative stressors and more notifications than ever in the palms of hands, millions of Americans have long since met their cognitive and emotional capacity. \n\nCognitive capacity is a nuanced relationship between many variables. Optimizing for one variable of cognitive function at the expense of other critical ones would not give us the result of comprehensive enhancement of human capability. For instance, having drive without the ability to focus well, or willpower without emotional resilience. For that reason, The Neurohacker Collective have designed a formula that deliberately balances subjective effects to give meaningful enhancement in a comprehensive way – a whole system upgrade called Qualia.\n\nIf you're here reading, you felt the call towards Qualia. If you're in the contemplation phase or in the process of learning, this is an optimal time for your N=1.\n\nWhat is N=1?\n\nN-of-1 or single subject clinical trials consider an individual patient as the sole unit of observation in a study investigating the efficacy or side-effect profiles of different interventions. The ultimate goal of an n-of-1 trial is to determine the optimal or best intervention for an individual patient using objective data-driven criteria.\n\nYour N=1\n\nFrom baseline to Qualia for 4 weeks, here are the 5 steps to start your own personal N=1 experiment in emotional resilience and cognitive performance: \n\nInspired Action: Order your 30 day supply of Qualia - http://nuerohacker.com/ref/28/\n\nBaseline: Once your Qualia is received, take a baseline memory, reason, concentration and/or comprehensive cognitive test(s) on either Quantified Mind or Cambridge Brain Sciences and mark the date\n\nStage 1: Begin stage 1 of Qualia on an empty stomach each morning for 30 days. Download the Qualia Quick Start Guide for full directions on stage 2 and total program here: http://wellnessforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quickstart-Guide.pdf\n\nJournal: Each day for 30 days, journal for 5-7 minutes after your meditation session, or at minimum, during the same time each day.\nAfter 30 days: Congrats, you did it! How do you feel? What did you learn about yourself and Qualia? Now, reassess the same tests again for memory, reason, concentration and/or comprehensive cognitive performance (then email Josh and tell him how you feel!) \njosh (at)wellnessforce.com",

      "description": "Source:\nhttps://www.spreaker.com/user/angelalevesque/daniel-schmachtenberger-on-emergence-our\n\nWhy is studying whole systems so important? What can we gain from studying our subjective experience of reality? Daniel Schmachtenburger has spent his life blending different fields to bring together a new story of the evolution of our universe. Join us as we explore the concepts of emergence, synergy, and self-organization.  And how understanding these as individuals and within our scientific communities, assist us in understanding the nature, breadth, and urgency of our global challenges. \n\nAbout the Guest: \n\nDaniel has a trans-disciplinary science background within a whole systems, complexity, and integral framework. He loves solving seemingly intractable problems by reassessing the foundational data and axioms of a field and then restructuring it from the ground up. \n\nHe began seriously studying health and neurology when afflicted with neurological and autoimmune illnesses that had no known solutions in either allopathic or complementary medicine. The insights that led to his healing came from developing a new model for understanding physiology and pathology, which he then applied to helping many people address various forms of complex illness and optimize their capabilities beyond their previous healthy baselines. \n\nDaniel was the academic dean for a college of mind-body medicine and has consulted for many cutting edge integrative doctors and medical clinics to help find novel solutions for complex cases. He created and ran a cutting edge think tank developing complex systems solutions for environmental and social issues, and has directed a transdisciplinary group of scholars on a philosophy of mind project addressing core questions of mind/brain interface and developing an axiomatic reformulation for the epistemology of neuroscience. \n\nHe has a significant background with and love for nootropics, meditation, depth psychology,psychedelics,  and all effective tools for evolving states and stages of consciousness and evolving the human experience.",

Information is strategic.The current information ecology is controlled by large tech companies whose goals may be radically different from the goals of the individuals using the platforms.When it comes to critical issues like climate change, nuclear weapons stocks, and even foreign interference in U.S. elections, there is very little clear information, which impedes our decision making—that information scarcity is devastating when our survival as a species hangs in the balance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDANIEL  SCHMACHTENBERGER\n\nDaniel Schmachtenberger is a social philosopher whose central focus is civilization design: Developing new capacities for sense-making and choice-making, individually and collectively, to support conscious sustainable evolution.

Charles Eisenstein joins our host, Daniel Schmachtenberger, to explore the many facets of humanity that will contribute to large-scale healing of our earth and civilization. We take a look at things we do every day that are contributing to the breakdown of our relationships with each other and with our planet. In order to restore our meaning in life, we need to take care to heal the root of our addictions and patterns and understand the interconnectedness of life and earth. Deep down, we all want what is best for ourselves and each other, but often sacrifice exposing the truth out of fear of losing our belonging and sense of security. Listen in to find out what kind of conversation needs to happen to create a more beautiful world for everyone.\n\nFor full show notes visit: https://neurohacker.com/restoring-humanity-exploring-our-connections-to-earth-each-other",

      "title": "Session 1 - The Universe Story",
      "description": "Marc, Barbara, and Daniel sit down together to reflect on Barbara’s session from the Center for Integral Wisdom course, Becoming a Future Human. Marc points out that we are locating ourselves in this unique moment in time, reminding us that we might not actually survive as a species if we do not become a Future Human. Facing the fact that each of us is going to die is what Marc calls the First Shock of Existence. Facing the potential extinction of our entire species and destruction of the biosphere is what Marc calls the Second Shock of Existence. The only response to this Second Shock is a transformation of identity in which we actually become the Future Human.\n\nBarbara introduces her famous term, Conscious Evolution, in this conversation. Even though evolution has been happening for billions of years, we are the first generation to be conscious of evolution and conscious that we are affecting evolution; not only that, we are evolution self-aware.\n\nDaniel notes that the universe story that Barbara shared is scientifically literate and also has purpose and meaning while giving us a place and role in the universe. As systems evolve to greater and greater complexity on the exterior, the capacity for greater interior subjective experience deepens as well. More and more complex biology leads to the development of the neocortex and with that the capacity for abstraction and to put oneself outside of the present moment and contemplate the past and the future. With these capabilities, we are able to take greater responsibility, not just for ourselves, but for our impact on the whole.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n-What the Goldilocks Principle is\n\n-That Future Humans are alive now and you are probably one of them; otherwise, you wouldn’t care about this course\n\n-The universe isn’t a fact, it’s a story and we’re the stars of that story\n\n-The definition of prima facie\n\n-Why it is critical that we start taking greater responsibility, not just for our own lives, but for the whole\n\nView the entirety of this course: https://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

Can you imagine having command over your mental focus, creativity, memory, and even your emotions? What a different world it would be if we humans held the power optimize our consciousness, and as a result, our psychological relationship to each other, and to the planet we all inhabit. \n\nOur guest Daniel Schmachtenberger has dedicated his life to figuring out simple solutions to complex problems. The world is a complicated place. Health and happiness tend to elude many of us, due to how overwhelming it can be to figure it all out. Most of us have a desire to make a positive contribution to the world and to derive meaning from our lives, but often don’t know where to start.  \n\nBut to effect positive change globally, we each need a method by which to improve ourselves on a micro level, before branching out to make the monumental changes we likely need to thrive, or perhaps even survive, as a species.

The catch is that we as individuals have to get our biology and mindset in order first.\n\nHis mission is gaining momentum through Neurohacker Collective, an organization dedicated to discovering the most cutting-edge technologies for human performance. Their flagship product, Qualia, has taken the nootropic and smart drug world by storm and has quickly emerged as one of the most widely respected, highly studied brain supplements on the market.

      "title": "Session 6: Becoming Fully Human",
      "description": "Barbara begins by saying that Daniel’s session felt like a self-portrait of a Future Human to her. Having considered Daniel an evolutionary son for a long time now, Barbara feels proud seeing his ability to respond to the complexity of the current global situation with such grace, charm, and even pleasure. Marc reminds us of the importance of embodying the teachings; this is the place in history where there can’t be a split. We must become the teachings, as each of these teachers illustrates so beautifully.\n\nMany subjects are covered in this conversation, from reconciling autonomy and communion, and certainty and uncertainty, to using technology to address the next level of connectivity between human imaginal cells around the world. Marc brings up the concept of “tantra,” or the principle of non-rejection, where nothing is left out and everything has a place at the table in a higher level of consciousness. They note that this recurring theme of embracing elements of humanity that have been rejected and integrating them has been even more prominent in the course than they had even realized before they sat down together.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    How human history can be traced through the lens of different approaches to reconciling the split between autonomy and communion\n    How Unique Self is the place where the split between autonomy and communion disappears\n    How technology can address the neural net membrane and connectivity of the human imaginal cells around the world\n    Why both Liberals and Fundamentalists don’t practice tantra very well\n    How certainty and uncertainty can be reconciled and how Barbara practices that in meditation\n    This course is a post-Liberal and post-Fundamentalist course, emergent by nature, which takes the best of both and integrates everything in a higher way\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

There, Daniel is focused on developing processes and technologies for advancing medicine and human optimization. He is particularly focused on personalized medicine, adequate approaches to complex illness, and deepening our knowledge of how the human regulatory systems function, how they break down, and how they can be supported to function with greater resilience.\n\nI’m so inspired to share this hour-plus podcast with you as resilience is a core principle of the PIVOT process. Daniel is a fascinating expert on this and so much more. So, fasten your seat belts because this hour-long plus podcast is filled with incredibly special and thought-provoking conversation about everything from sleep, to memory, to genetics, to performance and recovery, to the dynamics of longevity and even the definition of life!\n\nTo learn more about Daniel’s and the collective’s work, and the reference to a Harvard Business Review study visit adammarkel.com/podcasts.",

      "description": "“Man is not going to wait passively for millions of years before evolution offers him a better brain.” - Corneliu Giurgea\r\n\r\nIn this episode of humanOS Radio, I spoke with Daniel Schmachtenberger. Daniel is a social engineer, an evolutionary philosopher, and he works with a group called Neurohacker Collective, who is dedicated to optimizing human performance.\r\n\r\nIn this interview, we discuss current research investigating human cognitive enhancement and nootropics. We also talk specifically about the cognitive enhancer Qualia, which is a carefully formulated nootropic stack Daniel helped design.\r\n\r\nMEDIA\r\nSoundcloud :: https://soundcloud.com/humanOSRadio\r\niTunes :: https://goo.gl/SDAiNm\r\nGoogle Play :: https://goo.gl/7qqTKk\r\nYouTube Channel :: https://goo.gl/egvdpb\r\nStitcher :: https://goo.gl/LaERkp\r\nImage Credit: http://tinyurl.com/jzba5m2\n\r\n\r-Video Upload powered by https://www.TunesToTube.com",

      "description": "Listen; The full Episode with show notes & references here,\nhttp://corebrainjournal.com/\n\nNeurohacker Insights For Brain Systems\r\nComplex and whole systems science, combined with exponentially increasing computational power, is about to pour light over our previously resigned expectations of just feeling \"OK.\"  The silver bullet mentality is a broken mentality in every area.\r\n- Daniel Schmachtenberger\r\nBeyond Reductionistic Thinking - Into Systems Complexity\r\nThis interview with Daniel Schmachtenberger, my friends, of more than 80 Episodes now, is directly targeted, in critical concordance, with our overall philosophy and mission objectives here at CBJ.  If you're new here, you'll love him and his Neurohacker insights.  If you're an old timer [!] with us since launching last April, you will love it. If you remain perplexed about the interface between neuroscience and street utility, be prepared for inclusive, actionable thinking. Daniel is amazing, with articulate insights on the evolution of mind science. \r\n\r\nDaniel Schmachtenberger is a consummate polymath with a background in systems science and human behavior and is the founder of the Emergence Project. He is the anchor of the scientific team at Neurohacker and provides sustained vision and informed for the larger Neurohacking movement.\r\n\r\nEd Note: This is a replay, published earlier and republished here because it was so well received previously. Daniel makes a difference - and he tells you how you can connect on a deeply nutrient level with these outstanding protocols for brain health and cognitive improvements.\r\nComplexity, Reality & Neurohacker Insights\r\nAfter accumulating comprehensive inventories on behavioral influence, coupled with an already widespread literacy of complex systems and whole systems science, he then founded The Emergence Project to begin working with a host of luminaries to tackle global-scale problems with global-scale solutions. Concurrently, he researched the epistemological frontier of neuroscience, delving deeply into integrative medicine as well as emergent neurotech tools and psychological techniques to optimize solutions on both sides of the mind/brain interface.\r\n\r\nMind science evolution provides a metaphor for the evolution of humankind.\r\nNeurohacker Ideas are Timely - Daniel's Overview:\r\n\"In many ways, our contemporary technical prowess works against us. Yes, we have access to a level of information that would have seemed like pure magic to folks even a few centuries ago. But this doesn’t come for free – our always-on, connected-info lifestyle immerses us in a barrage of demands on our attention and processing power. Even at their best, our poor hominid brains are overwhelmed by the pings and buzzes of social media.\r\n\r\nAnd we are not positioning ourselves to be at our best. Consider, for example, real nutrition. For hundreds of thousands of years, our tool using hunter-gatherer ancestors had access to food that provided a vast diversity of nutrients from topsoil that was robust and healthy and part of a whole, complex biologic system, without actually any toxicity in the environment. These days most of our food is produced, processed and transported in a complex soup of chemistry that we don’t come close to fully understanding.\r\nNeurohacker Insights Beyond Nutrition\r\nAnd even if we eat the healthiest food, which most of us don’t even come close to, even the very healthiest food grows in minerally-depleted soil that leaves our needs unmet.\r\n\r\nOr consider pollution and our toxic environment. We spend much of our time indoors, not getting enough vitamin D and breathing in a host of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from all of our modern building materials.",

      "description": "This week’s guest is Daniel Schmachtenberger of the Neurohacker Collective – one smart dude!  Must be the nootropics.  We have an awesome conversation about what it will take for us to thrive through our Age of Transition and into the emergent world that works for all, not just a few of us. \n\nHis company: http://neurohacker.com \nHis blog: http://civilizationemerging.com \n\nSome Topics We Discuss:\n• How he got started in complex systems thinking while working in (and watching the failures of) wildlife conservation;\n• How he understands his work as participating in the emergence of a planetary renaissance;\n• A vision for how to move beyond finite win-lose games with in- and out-groups between warring cultures and into infinite win-win games;\n• His critiques of negative interest currency, universal basic income, and other system-wide economic incentives;\n• His argument for why giving ecosystems economic value isn’t enough to stand up against a wave of exponential technology;\n• How change can come from everywhere at once to vault us into a new era of whole-planet thinking that does not (continue to) collapse “complex” into merely “complicated”;\n• The role of automation in worldwide economic transformation;\n• How the next evolutionary transformation will emerge from the appearance of new ways to coordinate and align our senses, information processing, and action in the world – closing the loop between what we know and what we can do with it;\n• How we can heal the broken information ecology, and what that means for the surveillance conversation;\n• What incentives can we use in a totally redesigned global economy that benefits everyone?\n\nSelect Daniel Quotes:\n\n“We have a system where structural violence and externality are implicit throughout the system completely, so participation with that at all requires it.”\n\n“It was clear that nothing less than a discrete, nonlinear phase-shift was adequate, so…what are the necessary and sufficient criteria of the post-transition world?  And how do we support that emergence?”\n\n“If you’re getting interested in economics as a philosopher, it just means you’re gaining insight into how structural incentive and structural value systems and disposition work.  Which means you are NOT being a good philosopher if you are not thinking about those things.”\n\n“We don’t know how to do civilization without war…we’re really talking about getting off win-lose game theory completely.  It’s unprecedented.  But unprecedented shit is actually the precedent of the universe, if you have a very long view.”\n\n“Economics can be seen as the interface layer between our values and the way we build the world.”\n\n“If we are gaining the power of gods, then without the love and wisdom of gods, we self-destruct.”\n\n“Are the things that we THINK we’re optimizing for the right things at all? … How do I create an INTEGRATED system design that tends to everything that matters here?”\n\n“The forty weeks of a baby in utero, if it continued, would kill itself and the mom.  And the phase shift of leaving the birth canal and umbilical cord cut – it’s not predicted by the forty weeks before, if you didn’t know that thing was going to happen.”\n\n“Anything you can write a process for, no human wants to spend their whole life doing.”\n\n“The omni-win-win system actually outcompetes the win-lose system, while obsoleting win-lose dynamics itself.”\n\n“We are living in a world where we have an amazing amount of sensory input possible, right?  We can see stuff from the Hubble, we can see stuff in electron tunneling microscopes, and we can see input from everywhere around the world on the Internet – but that’s decoupled from sense-making, so I can’t tell if it’s fucking true or not!  I can’t put it together with the things I know.  And so I have a tremendous amount of sense input that I can’t make sense of.  Then, to the degree that I make sense of something – like, okay, CO2 is actually a problem – then I have no idea how the fuck to act on it.  And then do the degree that I act on things – like I go buy this laptop that we’re talking on, that comes from an industrial supply chain that affected life on six continents – I actually have no sense coupling to what the fuck was affected and HOW it was affected to inform if I want to make that choice or not.”\n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/future-fossils/id1152767505?mt=2\n\nSubscribe on Stitcher:\nhttps://www.stitcher.com/podcast/michael-garfield/future-fossils\n\nSubscribe on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/2eCYA4ISHLUWbEFOXJ8C5v\n\nSubscribe on iHeart Radio:\nhttps://www.iheart.com/podcast/269-FUTURE-FOSSILS-28991847/\n\nJoin our Facebook Discussion Group for daily news and conversations:\nhttp://facebook.com/groups/futurefossils\n\nSupport the show (and an avalanche of other mind-expanding media):\nhttp://patreon.com/michaelgarfield",

      "title": "42 Different Ways To Build A Better Brain, The Problem With Modern Smart Drugs, Hacking Your...",
      "description": "For the full show notes, visit: https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/neurohacker\n\nMy guest on today's podcast believes there's a big problem in the field of nootropics, smart drugs and cognitive enhancement: namely that the entire movement has followed some pretty extreme reductionist tendencies.\n\n When it comes to popping pills and using biohacks and self-quantification to make your body and brain smarter, research has indeed proliferated. There is a dizzying plethora of scientific findings focused on individual neurotransmitters, mechanisms, parts of the neurotransmission cycle, cell walls, receptor sites, brain/blood flow, and hundreds of other isolated variables.\n\n In other words, there are lots of parts and plenty of “findings” and “mechanisms.” But to date, there exists no prevailing meta-theory of the complex interactions that make up the whole of cognitive enhancement. Many various disconnected insights have so far fallen short of addressing the complex dynamics of all the interacting parts. For this reason most nootropic, smart drug and brain biohacking products are developed to narrowly optimize one aspect of cognitive capability, only to have unexpected drawbacks, deleterious side effects and impacts on other areas. By performing a principled meta-analysis and synthesis of existing research, we can better understand the complex dynamics and emergent homeostatic relationships within the brain and from these kinds of insights we can yield a truly advanced complex meta-theory of cognitive enhancement.\n\n Daniel Schmachtenberger, my guest on this podcast, wants to do just this. Daniel began seriously studying health and neurology when he became afflicted with neurological and autoimmune illnesses that had no known solutions in either allopathic or complementary medicine. The insights that lead to his healing came from developing a new model for understanding physiology and pathology, which he then applied to helping many people address various forms of complex illness and optimize their capabilities beyond their previous healthy baselines.\n\n Daniel was the academic dean for a college of mind-body medicine and has consulted for many cutting edge integrative doctors and medical clinics to help find novel solutions for complex cases. He created and ran a cutting edge think tank developing complex systems solutions for environmental and social issues, and has directed a transdisciplinary group of scholars on a philosophy of mind project addressing core questions of mind / brain interface and developed what he calls \"an axiomatic reformulation for the epistemology of neuroscience\". He has a significant background with and love for psychedelics, nootropics, meditation, depth psychology, and all effective tools for evolving states and stages of consciousness and evolving the human experience.\n\n Daniel focuses in bringing together the best scientific research on each individual mechanism and pathway supporting cognitive development, and integrating them into a whole systems view, a complex framework of integrative neuroscience and one of the most comprehensive nootropic stacks ever made called \"Qualia\".\n\n During our discussion, you'll discover:\n\n -What a \"dream nootropic\" would look like if it were to target every single component of cognitive enhancement...[16:55 & 68:45]\n\n -How&nbsp;nootropics can go beyond an acute effect and actually chronically change your brain structure or \"wiring\", including neuron and synapse development, increased mitochondrial ATP, healthier cell structures and increased neural complexity...[21:00 & 49:30]\n\n -How you can actually induce the creation of new brain stem cells to heal things like traumatic brain injury, excitotoxicity and oxidative damage to the brain...[24:54]\n\n -Two easy ways to test how your central nervous system and memory recall is responding to certain compounds you consume...[27:45]\n\n -My personal experience with the \"God pill\" that Daniel developed...[42:45]\n\n -What makes something a \"nootropic\" compound vs. just a nutrient or a vitamin or a smart drug...[47:00 & 59:35]\n\n -The little-known substance know as the \"love drug\" that can increase euphoria and empathy...[50:18]\n\n -A compound that can be bound to caffeine to cause caffeine to last longer without a crash...[52:20]\n\n -The ittle-known effects a nootropic can have that you&nbsp;may not know about, such as decreased tendency to procrastinate, increased stress resilience, lucid dreaming and beyond...[55:20 ]\n\n -How Vitamin D delivered in a form called \"Microencapsulated Cholecalciferol\" can act on specific brain targets...[61:25]\n\n -Which form of magnesium is best for neural targeting...[74:55]\n\n -Why it's absolutely crucial that you include something called \"choline donors\" when you consume a nootropic...[78:00]\n\n -The actual clinical research behind the Qualia formulation that Daniel helped to develop, and why it must be taken as a 1-2...",

      "description": "Neurohacker.com\nThrough his deep knowledge of neurochemistry and experience in the design of a nootropic product to enhance cognitive functions, Daniel Schmachtenberger explores with Ferananda Ibarra the question of can nootropics empower WE Spaces by enhancing individual flow states? How do they affect empathy and social intelligence and to what extent is the individual affected by the collective and conversely, how does the collective affect the individual? This question led Daniel and Ferananda into a conversation on how the optimization of individual capacity can influence the collective in powerful and emerging ways. Given how we are witnessing a rise of complexity and growth of exponential technologies, the fragility of nature is driving humanity to potentially catastrophic tipping points. What then are the viable alternatives and how can the practices of We-Spaces provide for better collective sensemaking and understanding? Daniel shares a taste of his work on Integral Civilization Design and offers visions of different scenarios and possibilities for humanity collectively in this time of transition.",

No overriding the body’s natural functioning or tinkering with parts in isolation. We work to support the health of the body’s systems as an integrated whole, helping to increase its capacity and resilience.\n\nAll of our products are designed to help the body more effectively regulate its own biochemistry and restore homeostatic balance. Our goal is to support the integrity of those internal processes in becoming more robust and fully-functioning over time, producing lasting benefit even after discontinued use.",

      "description": "In this conversation, Daniel talks about Barbara’s beautiful ability to reclaim motherhood on behalf of all humanity and the desire to give future generations more than we had. Barbara reminds us that we are at a birthing moment. When we are ready to give birth, it is messy and cannot be stopped, and her hope to ease the birthing process is to facilitate connection for social synergy on the planet at the present time.\n\nMarc adds a third element, saying not only do we have a need to provide for future generations as the mothers and fathers of the future, as well as a need for social synergy and connection right now, we also have all these different levels of consciousness on the planet all together currently. We need to create a story in which Christians, agnostics, and atheists, and everyone else feels welcome. As people grow up to new levels of consciousness, there are two things that can prompt a shift to the next level. First, a dissatisfaction with how things are currently, and second, a new story that is exciting and attractive.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    The importance of asking the right questions\n    That when we focus on our innate yearning to create, it is a powerful way to move beyond perceived differences\n    The importance of having a vision to move towards, both individually in personal therapy, and collectively as a species\n    The psychology of synergy is an under-acknowledged and great topic for researchers to explore\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

Charles Eisenstein joins our host, Daniel Schmachtenberger, to explore the many facets of humanity that will contribute to large-scale healing of our earth and civilization. We take a look at things we do every day that are contributing to the breakdown of our relationships with each other and with our planet. In order to restore our meaning in life, we need to take care to heal the root of our addictions and patterns and understand the interconnectedness of life and earth. Deep down, we all want what is best for ourselves and each other, but often sacrifice exposing the truth out of fear of losing our belonging and sense of security. Listen in to find out what kind of conversation needs to happen to create a more beautiful world for everyone.",

      "description": "In this delightful conversation from the Center for Integral Wisdom's course Becoming A Future Human, Daniel remarks that Marc brought in so many key pieces that if fully understood and embodied within humanity, could alleviate much of the social problems that currently exist.\n\nThey point out that the three of them coming together to create this course is the evolutionary process in action. If they did not love each other, they could not do this. By loving each other, they create a synergy that moves the evolutionary story forward. If they egoically claimed this story, then they couldn’t move it forward. They honor each other’s uniqueness, and in witnessing each other shine with divine pride from sharing their teachings, they are radically loving each other. Synergy is really another word for outrageous love.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n-Why acknowledging that evolution has an interior is a major step towards addressing philosophical materialism\n\n-What synergy is and the central role it plays in evolution\n\n-Barbara’s Three E’s of Evolutionary Consciousness\n\n-A mistake people often make about the role of randomness in evolution\n\n-The distinction between randomness and disaster\n\n-How Unique Self-ends comparison and competition\n\n-How to reclaim the word obligation\n\nJoin the entire course: \nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

      "description": "Take a look at the group discussion in the third session of the Center for Integral Wisdom's course, Becoming a Future Human. In response to the Second Shock of Existence, Marc says we need a fundamental transformation of identity and a reworking of our essential understanding of how core structures work. Daniel agrees, saying we need to change the structures that condition and incentivize the problems that we are trying to solve; otherwise we will keep trying to solve problems that continue to be conditioned. This conversation centers around future structures and what those might look like, such as synergistic self-governance. It also addresses the importance of shifting our identity to technology as an extension of who we are.\n\nWhen Barbara ran for Vice President of the United States in 1984, she proposed a Peace Room as sophisticated and well-funded as the War Room that would map, track, and connect what’s working in the world. She has experimented with versions of synergistic democracy in her Synergistic Convergence events and brought her experience to this dialogue.\n\nLooking at the complexity of fundamentally redesigning our systems and structures, Barbara notes that sometimes all of this can feel too complex to do, but then she remembers the exquisite complexity of the human body. If a body, with its trillions of cells and all the networks and systems that allow it to function properly, can exist, why can’t human systems be fundamentally redesigned for what we are truly capable of?\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n-Why it is important to move beyond false dichotomies and understand the co-arising nature of reality\n\n-Why it is important to re-envision our relationship to technology\n\n-Why it is important to let go of our core structures of thought and to re-imagine ourselves\n\n-More about Barbara’s vision for a Peace Room and what future governance structures might look like\n\n-The importance of evo-mimicry\n\nView the entirety of this course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

They continue to explore the themes of suprasex, the Co-creative Masculine, discovering vocation, and how to expand our love lists beyond romantic partners.\n\nDaniel remarks that one of the great teachings of suprasex is the question it begs: what am I committed to create in the world that is as significant as creating human life, that engages as much of my capacity, and that I am as committed to?\n\nIn this session you will:\n\n-Consider who your own evolutionary family is\n\n-Learn what it means to be telerotic\n\n-Why it is so attractive when we see people congruently living their teachings\n\n-Why it’s important not to become suprasexually promiscuous\n\nView the entirety of this course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

      "description": "This conversation re-emphasizes the importance of tying together our personal and collective evolution. What you do affects the entire world. Your personal life and all of humanity are inescapably linked. You need and are needed by the whole; you affect and are affected by the whole. Not only is this more clearly evident than ever before at this current time, it is also more true. With globalization and our interconnected planetary systems and technologies, as well as all of our global crises, such as climate change and ocean acidification, there is no “away” or someplace to which we can escape. That is a part of the uniqueness of the time we are alive in.\n\nIn this conversation, Marc and Barbara explain why they refer to sacred texts, bringing up the importance of transcending and including. Rather than dismissing the Great Traditions, the evolutionary impulse is to reclaim the beautiful parts, divesting them of the parts that are no longer relevant, and evolve them. Evolving the Great Traditions is the ultimate devotion. Every generation does this. Barbara adds that this is not just about going back because it’s important; there’s something there that takes us forward. There are also many people who cannot locate themselves in a Great Tradition. They are also welcome.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    What Marc means when he says that the process of evolution is to transcend all dualities/splits and to externalize interiors\n    How pathological evolution happens\n    What it means to wake up, show up, and grow up\n    What are the stages of growing up\n    What are the Three Divine Forces and how do they relate\n    What it means to be a religious dual-citizen\n    The importance of aggregating, integrating, and evolving\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

      "title": "Session 8: Pleasure",
      "description": "In this group discussion, Daniel points out that much of the work that Marc does, and that is important for Future Humans to do, is to reclaim that which has been disowned, shamed, or distorted. Just as we won’t be able to make it through unless we reclaim our relationship with the ecosystem and biosphere, we won’t make it through without reclaiming sexuality, eros, relationship, and pleasure.\n\nMarc, Barbara and Daniel continue the conversation, looking at the different levels of pleasure, adding in new principles of pleasure, and seeing how that relates to their own lives, historical eras, and the pleasure of co-creating this course together.\n\nMarc reminds us that as long as we live in a society where there is a clash between our deepest experience of pleasure and society’s views on pleasure, we are never going to be able to actually transform consciousness. We can only transform consciousness at the root. Daniel emphasizes the importance of this, saying one of the characteristics of a dominator culture is that children are taught not to trust what feels good to them and thus they stop trusting themselves and look to authority for direction. These are some of the reasons why reclaiming the Source Code of pleasure is essential in becoming the Future Human.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    A new principle of pleasure: pleasure absolutism\n    Why it is important to explore all levels of pleasure and how level 6 is needed more than ever now\n    What level of pleasure Marxism absolutizes\n    How different epochs in history can be freeze-framed as absolutizing one level of pleasure\n    How you can do a pleasure check to see where you are on the levels of pleasure\n    Why it is important to address sexuality\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

      "title": "Session 9: Reconciling Paradox",
      "description": "Marc begins this discussion by saying that laughter is a phenomenon that allows us to nullify false dichotomies and hold paradox. When we stop laughing, we get lost in one half of the paradox and getting lost in one half of the paradox is what Marc calls the source of evil. When we absolutize one side, we call that extremism. Holding paradox is the key to evolution, a central mechanism of evolution, and that is why this is a great topic to conclude this course.\n\nThis conversation continues with a discussion about the overview perspective, and the importance of learning to put all the many perspectives and snapshots of a house, for example, into an integrated perspective that cannot be found in any single snapshot or in a random scattering of different snapshots. How those pieces fit together is essential. The conversation also explores the classical philosophical debate surrounding volition and determinism.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    Why being able to hold paradox is critical to evolution and to becoming a Future Human\n    What the overview effect is\n    The definition of ecstasy\n    How sexuality holds paradox from a higher order of being\n    What integral methodological pluralism means\n    A story about King David that exemplifies this teaching\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

      "title": "97 - Zak Stein on Love in a Time Between Worlds: A Metamodern Metaphysics of Eros",
      "description": "Listen to the full episode here::\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/22684128/\n\nThis week’s guest is Dr. Zak Stein, an author and educator whom I met as fellow students of the work of philosopher Ken Wilber over ten years ago. Zak took the road of serious high academic scholarship while I was learning the less laudable and messier way through immersion in the arts and entertainment world, but here we are converging to discuss one of the most important issues of our time: the need for a new human story that includes both modernity’s rigorous scientific inquiry and postmodernity’s revelation of how everything we know is framed by language, culture, and perspective. Without some clever, soulful balance of the two we’re stuck in a “post-truth” era where our need for answers to our fundamental questions leads us backwards into “isms” instead of forwards into something more good, true, and beautiful than what has come before.\r\n\r\n\r\nZak’s answer (like so many other guests on Future Fossils) is to get MORE rigorous about the scope and limits of the world disclosed by science, MORE honest with ourselves about the context-bound claims we can make on knowledge, and MORE open to how all “reality” starts in direct experience, as conscious subjects – where we meet to make new, open-ended, ever-more refined, evolving answers to the questions:\r\n\r\nWhat is human? What is love? What are we here to do?\r\n\r\n\r\nRead Zak’s new paper, “Love in a Time Between Worlds: On the Metamodern ‘Return’ to a Metaphysics of Eros”:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zakstein.org/love-in-a-time-between-worlds/ \r\n\r\n\r\n‘Where modern scientists often critique the claims of metaphysics as unverifiable and thus untrue, postmodernists critique both science and metaphysics for making truth claims in the first place. Either way, to call an idea or theory “metaphysical” has become another way of saying it is unacceptable. Often with comes with some implication that the theory is a kind of superstition, which means metaphysics is taken not as an attempt to engage the truth but rather as a kind of covert power play or psychological defense mechanism. I argue the opposite: metaphysics is what saves us from a descent into discourses that are merely about power and illusion. Believe it or not, there are metaphysical systems that survived postmodernism and popped-out of the far end of the 1990’s with “truth” and “reality” still intact. These include object oriented ontology and dialectical critical realism, among others.’\r\n\r\n\r\nZak is also the Co-Presdient and Academic Director at the Center for Integral Wisdom:\r\n\r\nhttps://centerforintegralwisdom.org/ \r\n\r\n\r\n…and on the scientific advisor board at Neurohacker Collective:\r\n\r\nhttps://neurohacker.com/ \r\n\r\n\r\n— In this episode we discuss:\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Mumford, Ken Wilber, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Jurgen Habermas, Seth Abramson, Timothy Morton, Rudolf Steiner, Alfred North Whitehead, Hanzi Freinacht, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Jordan Greenhall, and many other luminaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-wing and authoritarian political thought is resurgent today because of the absenceof reasonable discourse about metaphysical realities during a time when exactly these realties are being put in question due to the apocalypse of global capitalism and the accompanying planetary transition into the Anthropocene.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way we answer questions like, “What is the human?” will determine the next century because of the emerging power of new technologies that render the human mailable in unpresented ways, which has been made clear by writers like Yuval Harari.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The difference between metaphysics and science is not about what you can see and what you cannot see. It is about what you are paying attention to when you are seeing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“What we call postmodernism is just modernism with the volume turned WAY up.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference between modern, postmodern, and metamodern views on science and the realities disclosed by science.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to cut a definition of the human out of our education systems?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relevance of Rudolf Steiner’s metaphysics and pedagogy in 21st Century education – especially its attention to subjectivity and interiority.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow fundamentalism, nationalism, racism, and other regressive movements in society are symptoms of a postmodern assault on consensus reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the absence of metaphysics, there’s a vacuum of meaning…what can step into that is not always pretty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“After postmodernism, we can’t return to some pat, totalizing answer for everybody. After postmodernism, when we begin to build a new coherence, it’s always going to be a polycentric and dynamic and always renegotiated coherence. And that’s what science ought to be, which is to say, knowledge building, and not knowledge finding. Period.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ideas matter – and right now, we live in a context where ideas matter only insofar as they can be leveraged for clicks on websites that generate advertisement revenue.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen did we start gladly giving our decision-m",

      "description": "In this episode, we're talking to Zak Stein, philosopher, futurist, and author of Education in a Time Between Worlds. We discuss how global systems are expanding beyond the capacities and institutions that the era of capitalist nation states used to manage them, and how as a result we are living in a time between worlds. We explore how this transition needs new ways of doing society, and new ways to prepare people for life in this new society. We discuss the idea that behind a philosophy of education lies a philosophy of self, and how under capitalism, the philosophy of self that has increasingly permeated society and schooling is of humans as economic actors, whose highest purpose is to produce economic value that can be commodified within the price system. As such, the very ego structures open to human subjects under capitalism - and that education instills in young people - reflect this economic outlook, what Zak calls \"reductive human capital theory\". We go on to ponder what ego structures might be possible under a future system where individual and collective identities are less entwined with economic value production. \n\nWe also discuss the fact that for many, work is an unfortunate necessity for survival, while for a select few, work is a deeply engaging process of discovering and giving one's innermost talents. We note how school often prepares children for this life of \"unfortunate necessity\", with education seen as a chore, rather than a space for experimentation and advancement of unique abilities and talents. We consider the issue of purpose, and how society often struggles to give children satisfactory answers as to why they should learn, which can destroy motivation, particularly for the most reflective and sensitive kids. Zak suggests that this inability to connect education to a valid purpose may explain the explosion of diagnoses of ADHD, as children struggle to focus on work that seems fundamentally meaningless to them. \n\nFinally, we consider issues with the current model of education. We note how standardised testing fails many, including Zak, whose dyslexia made him a terrible test taker in school. We consider that in our current education system, the most responsible, reflective people often don't rise, while the power hungry, schematic minds who are good at ticking boxes do. We connect to this the fact that the 2008 financial crisis was orchestrated by many of the \"best minds\" produced by the world's \"top universities\".\n\nIf this all sound bleak, dont worry. We also note how there is hope - in a time between worlds, as the flaws with the old way become increasingly impossible to ignore, opportunities are open for people to explore, participate and collaborate in creating the new. \n\nZak can be found here\n\nhttp://www.zakstein.org/",

      "description": "Get the audio version on iTunes here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/circling-and-authentic-relating-guide-podcast/id1339731324?mt=2\n\nIn episode 05 of the Circling Guide podcast, I join my friends and partners David Swedlow and Darrell Duane to talk about Zachary Stein on meta-modernist philosophy, healing the masculine/feminine split, free will, cults, Burning Man and more. In particular, we discuss the impact of a new philosophy called \"meta-modernism\" on the practice of Circling. Full video below or listen on iTunes from any Podcast app (I recommend Podcast Addict). Please leave your comments and feedback below!\n\nOn this podcast I/we argue that so-called \"meta-modernism\", which is among other things an \"include and transcend\" of both Modernism and Post-modernism (which are loosely correlated to right/left politics), is a very good context (a higher-level frame) for understanding the practice of Circling.  And vice-versa as well, that Circling can be a powerful tool, or application, into the meta-modernist world-view, which is even more attractive as it takes these ideas to ground-zero, into the streets as it were and into the heart-space, devoid of the over-intellectualization that kills many of these movements, or at minimum limits their reach.  We discuss all this within a \"topical circle\", speaking from our own experience.  David in particular shares a powerful experience he recently had at a workshop by Hazel-Grace Yates called \"Healing the Divide\" (previously the \"cock project\").\n\nThis podcast includes a 9-minute clip from Michael Garfield's Future Fossils Podcast, Episode 97 (see below).\n\n*  Zachary Stein excerpt from Michael Garfield Future Fossils podcast, episode 97.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/future-fossils/id1152767505?mt=2\n*  Zachary Stein website http://www.zakstein.org/\n*  Hazel-Grace Yates and \"Healing the Divide\" https://www.drhazelgraceyates.com/\n* Michael Garfield https://michaelgarfieldart.com/",

Defines a realistic, as distinct from virtual, consideration of the nature and role of a foundational ethics as applied in interpersonal situations, and how this leads to healthier, thriving, outcomes. \n\nForrest Landry a philosopher, founder, writer, researcher, scientist, engineer, and craftsman.  He has a unique set of skills in large scale systems design and worked on many software projects in the business and government sectors. His most original and insightful work is in the area of metaphysics – the study of what is, what is the nature of being, what is the nature of knowing, and by what means we make good choices. His foundational work “The Immanent Metaphysics” reflects a decades long effort to restore legitimacy to the practice of metaphysics and construct a rigorous, coherent and precise statement of Ethics.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

      "description": "Becoming Agile People in organizations has two parts: 1) recovering what is natural about the human condition and 2) developing new ways of working together. One is a kind of unlearning– we unlearn the old social conditioning, and re-connect with our natural human enthusiasm for being together. There is an evolutionary dynamic underlying the complex processes of human relating. This is the basis of self-organization that we can trust. There is also the challenge for us to become more than we have been before. This is part of the adventure and never ending story that emerges as we build trust with each other.",

      "description": "Please join our host Lama Tantrapa in discussing integral process philosophy with Bonnitta Roy - who once served as the President of the National Qigong Association. Now she is an associate editor of the internationally acclaimed Integral Review Journal.\n\nHer Insight Training program is dedicated to helping people tap into the transformational power of the mind in its natural state. Insight Training workshops activate intuitive awareness by cultivating the ability to perceive the world directly, and the capacity to experience equanimity. When mind is in its natural state, we can discover what is possible that has never been possible before.",
