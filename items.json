I hour. \n\n“The double bind that we now face is this: on the one hand, we want to preserve our natural environment; on the other, everything we do to grow our economy and preserve our standard of living disrupts the natural environment and our relationships with it. Nora, like her father, suggests that we must raise our consciousness and learn to think in new ways to escape our pathology of wrong thinking...Nora Bateson presents viewers not only with an intellectually challenging and inspiring work of art, but also with a glimpse of evanescent hope.”\n--Marilyn Wedge, Huffington Post, 13 October 2011\n\n“Gregory Bateson taught us how to stop having the most fundamental old ideas: the static, separating, reductionist fictions that dis-integrate an integrated world. Nora Bateson's beautiful portrait of her father's key insights is a stunningly effective antidote for a new generation that now needs his wisdom more than ever.”\n -Amory B. Lovins, Chairman and Chief Scientist, Rocky Mountain Institute\n\n\"An Ecology of Mind is a spell-binding, lyrical, and very important film...\" \n--Rex Weyler - Co-Founder, Greenpeace International\n\n“The task she took on was hardly easy. Pinning Bateson down takes a fair amount of effort. Coming up with a simple definition of, say, systems theory is one thing. Doing so in a way that educates the average filmgoer without making her film feel like a mere academic exercise is something else entirely. Yet Nora Bateson manages to do so by always keeping the man she knew at the center. “ \n--Dan Webster, NPR\n\nAwards:\n\nWon Gold for Best Documentary, Spokane International Film Festival, 2011 Audience Award Winner, Best Documentary, Santa Cruz Film Festival, 2011 Winner, Media Ecology Association, John Culkin Award for Outstanding Praxis, 2011",

Rather than attempting to be a\nfinal work on the subject, the intent is to provide potent seed ideas for further reflection\nand development. Concepts presented herein are best treated as points of departure for\nthese deeper considerations on the part of the reader.\n\nIt is inherent in the nature of effective metaphysical consideration to emphasize clarity,\nprecision, and essence. A dicipline of clarity and exacting precision is necessary to reveal\n(and avoid) the traps of hidden assumptions and implicit expectations. This dicipline is\nbest facilitated by direct positive statement with a careful, dispassonate, and sensitive\nattention to the complete meaning and connotation of each word used.\n\nTherefore, to provide the greatest possible value, a large portion of this book has been\nformatted as a series of related 'aphorisms' or statements of principle. Although this is not\nthe usual prose form of philosophical literature, it has the significant advantage of ensuring\nclear access to essential concepts and ideas. Individual aphorisms contain only as much\ntext as is needed to gracefully outline those notions which are of maximum significance\nand importance.\n\nTo allow maximum emphasis on essentials in a minimum of text, this book does not\ncontain much in the way of explanation, historical background, metaphor, or statement of\nimplication. Requiring a reader to wade through too much of this type of content would\nobscure too much of what is really important. While such content aids understanding in\nthe short-term , it often results in long-term misunderstanding (times change, and such\nexternal references do not keep up). As such, these aspects are made available in\nsupplemental books, recordings, and transcripts.\n\nBy focusing only on those ideas that are of primary significance and importance, the text\nmay seem to some readers to be more intense, dense, and 'technical' than standard prose.\nIn recognition of the need for deep clarity, a certain amount of special terminology must\nbe allowed for. The selective use of appropriate terminology frees the reader (and the\nauthor) from painful error, misunderstanding, and confusion. While a simplified and\nnon-specialist terminology may be preferred for general audiences, the hidden and implicit\ncomplexity of a \"common language\" format precludes the distillation of essential notions\ninto precise expressions of concept. Although ultimately the Axioms of this metaphysics\nare very simple, a full knowledge of their meaning, implications, and applications, is much\nmore involved and complex.\n\nThe emphasis on precise expressions of meaning is not, however, to be construed as an\nattempt to prove, logically or analytically, the general validity and applicability of the any\nof the assertions herein. It is not an attempt to \"convince\" anyone of anything. Readers\nwho are looking to be convinced that some metaphysical proposition is 'absolutely true'\nwill need to do their own work to determine, prove, and validate their own ideas of truth.\n\n2 Introduction\n\nThe process of learning and the finding of Truth is more effective when one searches for\nwhat is true, rather than for that which is false. It is far less useful and meaningful to \"be\nconvinced\" of something, or to spend all of one's time to try to find a way to disprove or\ncontradict some assertion that is disliked. Such rejection is usually based on a\nmisunderstanding, and thus fails to attain anything other than a common confusion. It is\nfar more effective to consider, for each assertion made, the insight that it offers, and the\nmanner in which such insight may be applied. It is hoped that the reader will recognize\n(and eventually come to trust) that there is a reason for every word and statement, every\nparticularity of phrasing in these aphorisms.\n\n#### To search for meaning is to find it.\n\n#### To fail to search for meaning is to be without it.\n\nThe aphorisms in this manuscript refer to one another and are mutually interdependent.\nSome aspects of the meaning of each aphorism will only become clear when reading other\nareas of the text. As such, the reader is encouraged to always continue forward and\ndevelop comparisons, rather than become 'stuck' at any particular point in trying to\nunderstand one individual statement. The reader should not expect to immediately\ncomprehend all of the aspects of the various meanings and implications of each statement\nmade. Reading through the entire manuscript more than once is necessary to complete\nunderstanding.\n\nAlthough the aphorisms have been sequenced in such a manner as to encourage a gradual\nbuilding of understanding and concept, there is no requirement that they be read in a\nspecific order. The reader is encouraged to occasionally skip around and read those\nsections and areas of the book that seem 'more interesting' in the moment.\n\nEven though the reader may skip many sections in following their interests, those sections\nthat are chosen for reading should be read very slowly and with total feeling and\nthoughtfulness. Do not try to 'skim' or read quickly through any part of this text. Skipping\ntext is not skimming text. Approach each statement with full attention and when you are\notherwise at peace of mind. Consider the meaning (and phrasing) of each statement fully\nand completely from multiple viewpoints before proceeding to the next.\n\nBy design, aphorisms implicitly contain several meanings and concepts in addition to those\nideas more overtly stated. In most cases, individual assertions can be interpreted in more\nthan one manner, and many of the statements presented have carefully considered and\nmulti-layered meanings. Wherever possible, each interpretation and connotation has been\nconsidered (and assured) to be metaphysically valid in multiple contexts.\n\n```\nIntroduction 3\n```\n\nEach individual aphorism is intended to be a basis for deep reflective consideration. Such\nmeditation will reveal insights into concepts and aspects which are (for brevity) merely\nimplied. It is better to read a little bit at a time, at some consistent interval (a few\naphorisms at least once daily), than it is to attempt to read many pages at once in one\nsitting (as with a normal book). It is a good practice to meditate for a short interval both\nbefore and after attempting to read any portion of this book.\n\nAlso, to get more value from the content, the reader is encouraged to consider each\npassage on more than one occasion, at varying times of the day and season. In re-reading\n(within a changed context), one is likely to find that points which seemed confusing at first\nare now much easier to understand. Due to the integrative nature of this metaphysics,\nsome of the deeper implications will only become apparent on multiple meditative\nreflections and re-readings. Some connections between ideas, reflections, and\ncontinuations will only be known when one has read far enough into the text to have\nencountered alternate ends of the same thought.\n\n4 The Nature of Metaphysics\n\n#### The Nature of Metaphysics\n\nMetaphysics is an inquiry into the nature of the relation between self and reality.\n\nMetaphysics is organized thinking that attempts/purports to describe the common aspects\nof the relations between self and reality. The basic questions of metaphysics include:.\n\n- What is the nature of existence, creation, and interaction?\n- What is the nature of the known, the knower, and of knowing,\n  or between the known, the unknown, and the unknowable?\n- What is the nature of causality, of choice, and of change?\n- What is the nature of the personal (self, soul, mind, spirit, that which is subjective),\n  and of the impersonal (world, substance, body, physical reality, that which is\n  objective),\n  and what is the nature of the relation/interaction between them?\n- What is the nature and basis of value, purpose, and meaning?\n\nPhysics is organized thinking that attempts/purports to explain the common correlated\ncontent of the perceptions of many selves in the context of a particular physical world.\n\nA metaphysics is not a physics. Each has its own means, ends and values. Although\nmetaphysics is often considered as an extension of physics, it is more correct to assert that\nphysics is a particular instance of a more general metaphysics.\n\n```\nPhysics (explanations) is an answer to a Why question.\nTechnology (prediction) is an answer to a How question.\nMetaphysics is an answer to a What question.\n```\n\nPhysics and technology (when combined together as per the scientific method) refer to a\ncollection of theories, and are thus subject to falsifiability and disproof. Metaphysics, as a\ndescription of the nature of meaning, measurement, and interaction, is not a theory, is not\nscientific, and is not falsifiable, in the conventional sense of these terms. A description\n(and/or metaphor) is evaluated on the basis of significance, completeness, and relevance,\nrather than on the basis of a fixed procedure or methodology (a form of logic).\n\nA true metaphysics makes no predictions and provides no explanations; it is merely a\ndescription of the foundations of being in terms of patterns of correlations of\nmeaningfulness (a system of metaphors and definitions).\n\n```\nThe Nature of Metaphysics 5\n```\n\n```\nPhysics is the study of the interactions within a given domain.\nMetaphysics is the study of the relationships between domains.\n```\n\nIn common usage, the meaning of the term \"domain\" is similar to the notions of \"objective\nreality\", \"world\", \"universe\", and \"dimension\" (as in the notion of 'a space' in which things\nhappen). Here, the concept of domain extends to include any realm or class of thought,\ntheory, and/or imagination. For example, any single language is a domain. Each system of\nmathematics or field of scientific study is a domain. Each individual and personal dream is\na domain.\n\nHowever, in more technical considerations, the notion of 'a domain' must be regarded as\nabstract, rather than as a concrete reference. A domain is not a container or context in\nwhich a certain type of things are content; rather it is a reference to the combination of a\ncertain set of ideas. A domain (as a notion) does not refer to a total collection of things so\nmuch as it refers to a common context (or type) of consideration of three or more\nmutually associated (and usually fundamental) defining concepts.\n\nThe term Eventity refers to the combination of the meanings of an entity (thing) and an\nevent. Each interaction, comparison, and being, is an eventity. In some contexts, the\nmeaning of the term 'eventity' is also to be considered as a combination of the concepts of\nidentity and relation.\n\nThe Principle of Identity : two eventities which cannot be distinguished by any property,\nlogic, measurement, or interaction, (i.e. two eventities which cannot be distinguished even\nin principle), must be the same (in both identity and beingness). That which is\nindistinguishable by any means, mode, or method, must be the same. No semantic\nreference is to be assigned to that which is indistinguishable.\n\nFor example, if two \"things\" are in all characteristics alike (position in space and time, all\nproperties, energies, characters, etc., or any other forms of dimensioned information) or\nhave the same values for all defined/known (dimensional) measures, then, by the principle\nof identity, they are the same in both consideration and beingness. If they are not two (or\ndifferent, if one cannot tell them apart) then they are (must be) the same and have\ncommon instance.\n\n6 Triplication and Type Isomorphism\n\n#### Foundational Triplication and Type Isomorphism\n\nThe philosophical development of this Metaphysics has as its basis two ideas; that of\nfoundational triplication and of type isomorphism.\n\n```\nThe idea of foundational triplication is to model all that is real, and particularly the\nfoundation of each and every domain, in terms of at least three essential concepts,\nwhich although inseparable, are always mutually distinct.\n```\n\n```\nThe idea of type isomorphism is to consider that the essential concepts of each domain\nare those which have similar patterns of correspondence^1.\n```\n\nIsomorphism : literally \"one shape\"; a term used to describe two concepts as having a\ndeep sameness because they both belong to the same abstract class or type.\n\nThe principles of foundational triplication and of type isomorphism (and the Immanent\nmetaphysics based on them) are in contrast to the prevailing philosophical and scientific\nheritage of Western Culture, which may also be described as based on two ideas; that of\ndualism and that of physical monism.\n\n```\nThe idea of dualism is to model all that is real in the terms of a fixed Cartesian\nseparation of mind and soul from body and matter; an absolute separation of the\nsubjective from the objective.\n```\n\n```\nThe idea of physical monism is to consider as real only that which exists in a manner\nwhich can be studied/ evaluated in a quantitative and objective manner (the Scientific\nMethod).\n```\n\nDualism and physical monism, in combination with each other, are the basis for most of\nthe metaphors and explanations of/for worldly phenomena. They are the basis for most of\nthe attendant assumptions commonly in consensus usage today. These are the very\nassumptions about which a careful clarity is required when examining the ideas of this\nmetaphysics.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The identification of isomorphisms is not arbitrary, but may depend on the exact context in which the\n   concepts are considered. Considering the same (literal) concept in a different (semantic) context may result in\n   varying associations of aspect and modality. As such, it is especially important to remain aware of the\n   assumptions and perspective in which one considers a given concept.\n\n```\nThree Modalities 7\n```\n\n#### Three Modalities\n\nMetaphysics realizes greater generality in referring to the 'types' of basic domain concepts\nand predicates rather than to the concepts themselves. As such, metaphysical thinking\noften considers the class (or type) of each of the fundamental predicates as they appear in\neach domain, rather than to be referring only to the specific instances of those predicates\nin themselves. The fundamental concepts in each domain are seen as instances of a more\ngeneral set of concept classes (types), which themselves are related to one another in\nspecific patterns.\n\nThe term class refers to a general category to which many eventities (concepts, beings,\nrelations) may belong. This usage of the term 'class' is borrowed from the language of\ncomputer science, and has much of the same meaning as found within the software\ndevelopment process for certain languages.\n\nThe term instance refers to a specific proper member of a category or class.\n\n```\nThe term class has the connotation of context (a general whole).\nThe term instance has the connotation of content (a specific part).\n```\n\nThe modalities define a terminology for the role that each of the archetypal terms play in\neach specific domain, rather than to the specific instances of those archetypal terms in\n\nsome particular domain^1.\n\nThe fundamental consideration of any domain can be (must be) resolved into exactly three\nconcepts, each of which are primal and necessary to the very essence of that domain. This\nis known to be true for all domains.\n\nThese three concepts (the modalities), which form the most basic foundation and logic of\nthat domain, have a definite and describable pattern of roles that each plays with respect\nto the other two, and in the domain as a whole. The basic pattern of roles is common to\nthe foundations of all domains. The same pattern of roles between these three\nfundamental, necessary, and intrinsic concepts will be found as the essence of all domains.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. For this initial description (as a rough simplification), the term \"domain\" refers to any instance of a world\n   (or universe) which may be (is) experienced by a self. There is no world that is completely independent of all\n   selves and there is no self which is completely independent of all worlds.\n\n8 Three Modalities\n\nThe term 'modality' is generally used to refer to a specific type of role, as selected from a\nfinite set of available types. Three such types, (or roles), and the relations between them,\nare both necessary and sufficient to provide a complete description of this metaphysics\n(The IDM or Immanent Domain Modality metaphysics).\n\nIn that the general pattern of relative roles is common to the foundations of all domains,\neach of the three roles is given a specific name, a modality, which is then used to refer to\nthe class of all concepts that have that type of role.\n\nThe three modalities are the three terms used to refer to each of the three primal roles that\nform the essential basis necessary to the consideration of each domain. To consider the\nmodality of a concept is to consider the essential role that concept plays with respect to\nother primal concepts.\n\nThe names given to the three roles (modalities) that domain primal concepts have with\nrespect to one another are \"the immanent\", \"the omniscient\", and \"the transcendent\".\n\nWithin the lexicon of this metaphysics, the term \"the immanent modality\" refers to the\nentire class of all immanent modal concepts, (as instantiated within their respective\ndomains). The omniscient and transcendent modalities are similarly defined, as references\nto classes of concepts.\n\nThe absolute description of the relative nature that each of the three modalities plays with\nrespect to the other two; i.e., the pattern common to all domains, is defined by the three\nAxioms. Insofar as the Axioms define the pattern of the three roles, then it is ultimately\nthe Axioms which define the exact meanings of the three modalities (and also, eventually,\nof all of the metaphysics itself).\n\nSince the Axioms are formulated in terms of the modalities (since no more primal concepts\nexist with which to formulate them), the exact definitions of the modalities themselves are\nnecessarily abstract, and thus are not specific to any particular domain, including that of\nthe IDM metaphysics itself. (The modalities are abstract; the Axioms are concrete).\n\nTherefore, no exact and final (closed/complete) definitions can be given for the\nmodalities, aside from those which are implicit and inherent within the Axioms (and all of\ntheir pure theorems), in whatever language they are expressed. For this reason, the pattern\nof the meaning of each of the three modalities must often be expressed in a metaphorical\ncharacter, in the language of whatever domains one happens to be interested in\nconsidering (see appendix). In this manner, eventually, with a large number of role\ncorrespondences to known systems, the essential nature of the pattern of meaning of each\nof the three modalities becomes clear.\n\nAlso, it is to be understood that the concept of a metaphor and the concept of an\nestablished system of correspondences is essentially equivalent in use (isomorphic) in this\ncontext. In effect, the modalities constitute the basis of a system of correspondences, the\ntotality of which, for some large set of domains, will give particular meaningfulness to\neach.\n\n```\nThree Axioms 9\n```\n\n#### Three Axioms\n\nWhere the foundations of any domain can be subsumed by three necessary and sufficient\nconcepts, known as the modalities, so too does the relationships between these three have\na consistent pattern and form. This form/pattern, common to the foundations of all\ndomains/worlds, is described by the three Axioms.\nAll of the descriptive power of this metaphysics ultimately descends from the Axioms.\n\n```\nAxiom I : The immanent is more fundamental\nthan the omniscient and/or the transcendent.\nThe omniscient and the transcendent are conjugate.\n```\n\n```\nAxiom II: A class of the transcendent will precede an instance of the immanent.\nA class of the immanent will precede an instance of the omniscient.\nA class of the omniscient will precede an instance of the transcendent.\n```\n\n```\nAxiom III : The (classes/instances) of the immanent, omniscient, and transcendent\nare distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.\n```\n\nIn that the Axioms are statements of the relations between the modalities, the Axioms\nthemselves are also associated (have a one-to-one correspondence) with the modalities. In\nthis manner, the Axioms are fully self-describing.\n\n```\nAxiom I has the nature of the omniscient modality.\nAxiom II has the nature of the immanent modality.\nAxiom III has the nature of the transcendent modality.\n```\n\n```\nThe Axioms are (and represent) the concept of pure form, without quality.\nThe Modalities are (and ultimately represent) pure quality without form.\n```\n\nThese concepts, taken together as different representations of the same fundamental\npattern, are the basis of all considerations of the IDM metaphysics.\n\n10 Relations, Domains, Identities\n\n#### Relations, Domains, Identities\n\nThe being and concepts of relation, domain, and identity are distinct, inseparable, and\nnon-interchangeable.\n\n```\nA relation is that which divides, but which is itself indivisible.\n```\n\n```\nAn identity is that which has distinction, but which is otherwise indistinguishable.\n```\n\n```\nA domain is that which contains (includes), but which is itself uncontained and\nuncontainable.\n```\n\n```\nThe concept of relation has the nature of the modality of the immanent.\nThe concept of domain has the nature of the modality of the omniscient.\nThe concept of identity has the nature of the modality of the transcendent.\n```\n\nRelation is more fundamental than identity and/or domain. The relationship between the\nparts (identities, instances) and the whole (the domain, a class) is more basic than the\nconsideration of either the wholes or the parts.\n\nWhere domains appear to contain (seem to be contained/nested within) one another, an\nidentity on one level (domain) of conception is a relation in the next level (domain) of\nconception. Similarly, relations become domains, and domains become identities.\n\n```\nInteraction, Existence, Creation 11\n```\n\n#### Interaction, Existence, Creation\n\nThe concept of 'universe', as a class, is to be understood only and exactly as the combined\nmeanings of the instances of the concepts of existence, interaction, and creation (neither\nmore nor less). The concept of universe itself is not to be considered as the total\nsummation of the instances of the beingness of (only) existing things and the (single)\nspace-time that they live in. The meaning and being of 'universe' is abstract, not concrete.\n\nThe notion of universe is a specific instance of the more general concept of a 'domain'.\nThe notion of 'a domain' is not a 'container' or context in which a certain type of relations\nand identities are defined as content, so much as it is a placeholder or combined reference\nto three commonly associated fundamental defining notions. To understand the nature of\nthe universe is to understand fully the nature and implications of only (the class concepts\nof) creation, interaction, and existence. This is at once necessary, and sufficient.\n\nCreation, existence, and interaction are distinct yet inseparable from one another. The\nbeing of one necessarily involves the other two. Any consideration of one implies the (at\n\nleast implicit) consideration of the other two^1.\n\nThe concepts of creativity, interaction, and existence have no opposites. For every\ndomain, there cannot be zero or negative degrees of creativity, interaction, and/or\nexistence (i.e., the degrees of each are always positive).\n\n```\nInteraction has the nature of the immanent modality. Interaction precedes existence.\nExistence has the nature of the omniscient modality. Existence precedes creation.\nCreation has the nature of the transcendent modality. Creation precedes interaction.\n```\n\nReality is not prior to perception. Perception is not prior to self.\n\n```\nA multiplicity of self (aspects) yields an event of perception.\nA multiplicity of perception (knowing) yields an identity of existence.\nA multiplicity of existence (memory) yields an identity of self.\n```\n\n```\nCreation involves the scale of the microscopic.\nInteraction involves the scale of the mesoscopic.\nExistence involves the scale of the macroscopic.\n```\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. For example, existence without perception (a special case of interaction) has no semantic value of its own.\n   To hypothesize the existence of a thing for which there is no conceivable interaction, direct, indirect, (that one\n   cannot see it, touch it, sense it, smell it, measure it with any instrumentation, etc), would be meaningless. What\n   does existence really mean if there is no way to personally establish its existence in one's own subjective\n   context? Any form or establishment of an ontological status relies on and implements a relation, an immanent\n   interaction of perception. A claim of existence prior to perception is un-provable and non-demonstrable.\n\n12 Objective and Subjective\n\n#### Objective and Subjective\n\nWhen considering the concepts of interaction, expression, and perception together (as a\ntriple) interaction is immanent modal, expression is transcendent modal, and perception is\nomniscient modal.\n\nA single comparison, as the simplest form of theory, objectifies a link between a sameness\nand difference and a content and a context, with respect to a given subject. There can be\nno comparison which does not implicitly imply the concepts of the subjective and the\nobjective, a content and a context, and a sameness and a difference. Complex theory\nconsists of many comparisons.\n\nThe Intrinsics of Comparison : The six concepts of sameness, difference, content,\ncontext, objectivity, and subjectivity, when taken together as a group.\n\nAny comparison will assume a sameness of content or a sameness of context as to be\ncomparison. Also, the concept of comparison will assume a difference of content or a\ndifference of context. The concept of comparison will also implicitly assume the\ndistinction and instantiation of objectivity (what is) and subjectivity (who is). These are\nthe intrinsics of comparison.\n\nThe concepts of content and context represent more about a way of thinking about\ninteraction (subjective), whereas the concepts of sameness and difference are more about\ninteraction itself (objective).\n\nThe sameness/difference of eventities is itself always an eventity, one which is always\nmore objective (less subjective) than the eventities which are compared.\nComparison is an objectification of a sameness and a difference.\nComparison is a subjectification of a content and a context.\n\nThe very event of perception (observation) itself has (cannot not have) both subjective\naspects and objective aspects. Each perception and observation, and each expression and\ncommunication event, must (cannot not) create and define both the objective and the\n\nsubjective (an Axiom III relation)^1. Everything (and every process) has both a subjective\nand an objective aspect.\n\n```\nThere is no objectivity that does not end in subjectivity.\nThere is no subjectivity that does not end in objectivity.\n```\n\n```\nNothing can be purely objective or subjective.\nAll experiences have both objective and subjective aspects.\nNo experience (or expression) is completely objective or completely subjective.\n```\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. For example, in communication there is an inherent aspect of subjectivity in the minds perceiving a\n   message. There is an inherent aspect of objectivity in the coordination of subjectivity, as found in the common\n   shared external references (the language used as a basis or \"carrier\" of communication meaning; the shared\n   context of all participants). Similar considerations apply to comparison, which may also be modeled as a\n   special type of communication event.\n\n```\nObjective and Subjective 13\n```\n\nThe concepts of objectivity and subjectivity are defined in terms of the relationship\nbetween self and reality (interaction, perception, and expression). The objective is\nconjugate with the subjective. The being of the objective and the subjective,\nand the nature of the concepts of objective and subjective experience,\nare distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.\n\n```\nThe essence of experience has the modality of the immanent.\nThe essence of objectivity has the modality of the omniscient.\nThe essence of subjectivity has the modality of the transcendent.\n```\n\n```\nObjectivity is defined in terms of comparable forms.\nSubjectivity is defined in terms of non-comparable feelings.\n```\n\n```\nThe meaning of objectivity has common basis with the meaning of\n'that which is perceived or is perceivable' (physical content).\nThe meaning of subjectivity has common basis with the meaning of\n'that which is invisible or is transparent' (non-physical context).\n```\n\nObjectivity and subjectivity are degrees/metrics, not states of being or condition.\nObjectivity is not an attribute of any single perception. Objectivity can only be associated\nwith clusters of related perceptions. Perception, observation, experience refer to a\nsingle/simple condition of being, without aspect; whereas objectivity can only be\nconsidered as an aspect of complexes of many related perceptions.\n\nObjectivity is the product of the degree of\n\n```\n1) the intensity of the self-to-world interaction,\n2) the degree of macroscopic consistency of the self-to-world interaction, and\n3) the degree of microscopic potentiality in the self-to-world interaction^1.\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. Un-patterned form, unpredictability, and randomness are as necessary for the establishment of a degree of\n   objectivity to any perceived actuality as are the consistent correspondences formed by a consensus among\n   multiple observers in common communication.\n\n14 Being, Existence, and Reality\n\n#### Being, Existence, and Reality\n\nThe concepts and the meanings of (objective) 'being' (to be objective), 'to be real', and 'to\nexist', are considered identically distinct, and non-interchangeable concepts. On any finite\nor relative scale, these three notions are not synonymous. The concepts of being, reality\nand of existence are considered distinct concepts, with very dissimilar meanings and\ndefinitions. Each of these meanings has a different semantic basis, and as such, to say\nanything about any one is to have asserted little or nothing with respect to the other two.\nThe scope of application of each is distinct from that of the other two.\n\nTo assert existence implies both necessary actuality and necessary potentiality. With any\nexisting thing, there must always be at least a possibility of secondary or additional\ninteractions within that same context with any and all other existing things.\n\nThe meaning of the term 'existence' is always relative to a particular world (even if it is\nconsidered independent of any specific self). The term existence cannot be considered to\nhave meaning without implicit reference to a world (shared objective context). The term\nobjectivity has no meaning without implicit reference to some (specific) self (shared\nsubjective context) even if it is considered independently of any specific world.\n\n```\nThe meaning of 'to exist' is to make an assertion\nthat the omniscient modal aspects of a given set of interactions\nare common and shared for all of those interactions.\n```\n\n```\nThe meaning of 'objectivity' is to make an assertion\nthat the transcendent modal aspects of a given set of interactions\nare common and shared for all of those interactions.\n```\n\nThe meaning of the term 'objectivity' is in reference to certain characteristics of a (large)\ncollection of perceptual interactions, relative to some implicit self. The meaning of the\nterm 'exists' is in reference to that which is presumed to have (at least the potentiality of)\nan actuality without any perceptual interactions at all (zero observations).\n\nThe meaning of the term 'real' is in reference to the beingness of a single instance of an\ninteraction (exactly one). To be real is interdependent with considerations/references to\ndomains/worlds and selves/observers. This is in contrast with the notions of both\nobjectivity (inherently involves many interactions) and existence (inherently involves no\ninteractions).\n\n```\nBeing, Existence, and Reality 15\n```\n\nThe notion of 'Reality' refers to the beingness of an instance of a set of interactions\n(perceptions, observations, experiences). Multiple instances of that which is 'real' together\nform the class of that which is 'reality'. The notion of 'to be real' cannot be further\nanalyzed.\n\n```\nInteraction is simple. Reality is complex.\n```\n\nThe term 'real' can only be applied to the identity of the beingness of the interaction itself.\nThe term 'reality', then, can refer only to the quality of the instance-beingness of a (an\narbitrary) collection of interactions.\n\n```\nThe term 'existence' has the nature of the omniscient modality.\nThe term 'reality' has the nature of the immanent modality.\nThe term 'objectivity' has the nature of the transcendent modality.\n```\n\nAs per their counterparts, 'that which is (objective) being' has the nature of the\ntranscendent, 'that which is real' has the nature of the immanent, and 'that which exists'\nhas the nature of the omniscient.\n\n```\nExistence is characterized in the terms of independence^1.\nReality is characterized in the terms of interdependence.\nObjectivity is characterized in the terms of dependence.\n```\n\nAll perceptions (comparisons in themselves) regardless of their 'type', are simply real. The\nstable patterns of comparisons of perception are reality. All Interactions are Real. Reality\n(an experience of a world) is constructed out of consistent sets of comparisons of those\ninteractions (consensus, objectivity).\n\nOnly the content of that set of comparisons 'exists'. The context of those comparisons (the\nself), does not exist, although it is an inseparable aspect of all that is real.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The concepts of dependence, independence, and interdependence are triple. They are distinct, inseparable,\n   and non-interchangeable. Typically, dependence has the nature of the transcendent, interdependence has the\n   nature of the immanent, and independence has the nature of the omniscient.\n\nThe specific associations between a triple of concepts and the modalities depend on the specific context of\nconsideration in which that triple is used. Where the context of the usage of a triple shifts, the modal\nrelationships can change. If a given triple frequently occurs or is used in only one context of consideration, the\nmodal associations will seem to be constant. Abstract concepts (such as dependence, independence, and\ninterdependence) tend to have more fluid associations.\n\n16 Being, Existence, and Reality\n\nInteraction neither exists, nor is created. Interaction Is. Interaction cannot not Be^1. And\nBEing is always Being-with (and therefore doing, and therefore becoming). Yet\ninteraction itself is not something, nor is it nothing. Interaction is real, but it does not exist.\nInteraction is the basis of all existence and creation and is more basic/fundamental than\n\neither existence or creation. It is in-between, in all that is both being, and becoming^2.\n\nThe concept of 'real' refers to an intrinsic aspect of interaction. The concept of reality\nrefers to an intrinsic of stable (with respect to the subjective/self) patterns of comparisons\nof interaction.\n\n```\nThe concept of 'real' (perception) is inherently simple (an instance).\nThe concept of 'reality' (experience) is inherently complex (a class).\n```\n\nTo make assertions such as the following: \"there exists only one world\" or even \"there\nexist more than one world\", \"many domains exist\", etc., would be applying the concept of\n\nexistence outside of its range of meaning^3. There is no (single ultimate) ground\ndomain/world in which all other domains are established as either existing or not.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The degree of intensity of interaction is always positive (never zero).\n2. Interaction is without any kind of existential status whatsoever. The ontological status of interaction is\n   defined in terms of beingness, but cannot be defined in terms of, or based only on the terms of, existence (i.e.,\n   that which is existential). A single interaction cannot be considered to have any degree of (or establish any\n   degree of) objectivity.\n3. One can, however, assert \"there are many worlds\", or \"many worlds are real\", for the meaning of being is\n   different from that of existing. Being is immanent (or in the case of worlds, transcendent), whereas existing is\n   omniscient.\n\n```\nErrors of Extrema 17\n```\n\n#### Errors of Extrema\n\nThe Errors of Extrema of Self:\n\n```\nPrejudice : To refer to when expression is ultimately/absolutely independent of\nperception.\n```\n\n```\nReaction : To refer to when expression is ultimately/absolutely dependent on\nperception (where reaction is mechanistic/deterministic).\n```\n\nThe Errors of Extrema of World :\n\n```\nRealism : To refer to when perception is ultimately/absolutely independent of\nexpression.\n```\n\n```\nIdealism : To refer to when perception is ultimately/absolutely dependent on\nexpression.\n```\n\nThere is neither absolute dependence nor absolute independence; there is only\ninterdependence (interaction). In that only/ultimately interaction is real, none of the\nextrema are valid. In that to be real (interdependent) is more basic and fundamental than\nboth existence (independence) and objectivity (dependence), any existing objective theory\nof reality must (cannot not) inherently reject the four absolute extrema.\n\nWhere reality is complex (many perceptions and expressions as interactions), the\ntransformations of perception and expression (knowing and understanding, attitude and\nbelief), must also inherently involve (cannot not involve) degrees of interdependence\nrather than (strict/absolute) dependence or independence. There can be no simple\nattitudes or beliefs; all of them are ultimately complex.\n\nSelf spans multiple domains (sets of perception and expression pairs) and they\nco-influence one another. Consciousness is a higher order (transcendental) coherency\nlinking the transformations of perception and expression.\n\n18 Symmetry and Continuity\n\n#### Symmetry and Continuity\n\nPrimary Operators: Where there is assumed a sameness of subjective context,\nthe following four definitions hold about the nature of the objective:\n\n```\nContinuity refers to where there is a sameness of content and a sameness of context.\n```\n\n```\nDiscontinuity refers to where there is a difference of content and a sameness of\ncontext.\n```\n\n```\nSymmetry refers to where there is a sameness of content and a difference of context.\n```\n\n```\nAsymmetry refers to where there is a difference of content and a difference of\ncontext.\n```\n\nThe notions of symmetry and continuity are considered to be truly fundamental to any\nphilosophic, scientific, or metaphysical consideration of the nature of self, reality, and the\nrelation between them. In asserting distinctness, inseparableness, and\nnon-interchangeableness, the notion of foundational triplication asserts that there is a\nfundamental notion of continuity inherent in the very basis of all considerations of theory\nor of being. In asserting that the basis concepts of a domain will have similar patterns of\ncorrespondences across changing domain contexts, the notion of type isomorphism asserts\nthat there is a fundamental notion of symmetry inherent in the very basis of all\nconsiderations of theory or of being.\n\n```\nThe notion of foundational triplication is ultimately a notion of continuity. The notion of\ntype isomorphism is ultimately a notion of symmetry.\n```\n\n```\nThe Root Tautology 19\n```\n\n#### The Root Tautology\n\nThe Root Tautology : Comparison is isomorphic with interaction and relation^1. The\nconcept of comparison is isomorphic with the concept of interaction and the concept of\n\nrelation^2. All relations are interactions and are comparisons. All comparisons are\ninteractions and are relations.\n\nThe meaning and essence of perception, as that which crosses the boundary of self, is the\n\nsame as the essence and meaning of comparison^3. Perception and expression (each\nindividually and together) are considered to be notions of the most basic type of\ninteraction and relationship between self and reality.\n\nThe notions of relation, interaction, and comparison are basic primitive concepts. As per\nAxiom I, they are the ultimate coordinating basis of the descriptions, metaphors, and\ndefinitions of this metaphysics and are the prime examples of the nature of the immanent\nmodality.\n\n```\nTo say that something is objective is to assert that it has both a high degree of\nsymmetry across transformations of perception, and a low degree of continuity across\ntransformations of expression.\n```\n\n```\nTo have a perfection of existence is to have complete symmetry in/of all\ntransformations of (personal) perception and zero continuity in all transformations of\nexpression. Existence is an observable, completely independent of the self.\n```\n\n```\nTo say that something is subjective is to assert that it has both a low degree of\nsymmetry across transformations of perception, and a high degree of continuity across\ntransformations of expression.\n```\n\n```\nTo have a perfection of creation is to have zero symmetry in/of all transformations of\n(personal) perception and total continuity in all transformations of expression. Creation\nis unobservable, totally unique, and isomorphic with a totality of self (i.e., a concept of\nGod).\n```\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. This is an assertion about the very being of comparison, as directly isomorphic with the very being of\n   interaction and the very essence of the nature of relation itself.\n2. This is an assertion about the theory of comparison, interaction, and relationship, as a basis of theoretical\n   understanding. As such, anything which is inherent in the nature of any one of these three is in essence also\n   (necessarily) inherent in the others.\n3. The concept of comparison is considered to be a special case of the more general concept of interaction.\n   Interaction itself is considered to be a special case of the more general concept of relationship. A\n   measurement (an observation, regardless of kind) is an interaction.\n\n20 Basis of Law\n\n#### The Basis of Law\n\nAll knowledge of law, of dynamic process, both inner and outer, revolves around two\nfundamental concepts: that of symmetry and that of continuity. Where there is a concept\nof lawfulness, as a class, instances of this class (laws) will be of (only) two\nbasic/fundamental types. Any instance of a law will either be a law of symmetry, or a law\nof continuity.\n\n```\nThe basic beingness, nature, and lawfulness of all World\nis defined by, and founded upon, the concept of Symmetry.\nThe basic beingness, nature, and lawfulness of all Self\nis defined by, and founded upon, the concept of Continuity.\n```\n\n```\nObjectivity has its basis in terms of symmetry. Subjectivity has its basis in terms of\ncontinuity.\n```\n\n```\nThe law of symmetry is the law of intradomain relations.\nSymmetry is a sameness of content where there is a difference of context.\nIt is the law of existence, of world, the law of physics, of substance, and of form.\n```\n\n```\nThe law of continuity is the law of interdomain relations.\nContinuity is a sameness of content where there is a sameness of context.\nIt is the law of creation, of self, of change, and of feeling.\n```\n\nParallel Aspect; 1st: That which is external to the boundary of self, which is objective\n(has the nature of existence), also has the nature of the omniscient modality. As such, the\nbasis of the lawfulness of that which is the content of perception will be defined in terms\nof symmetry. The deep lawfulness of the content of perceptions will be defined by the\nnature of symmetry laws.\n\nParallel Aspect; 2nd: That which is internal to the boundary of self, which is subjective\n(having the nature of creativity/ creation), also has the nature of the transcendent\nmodality. As such, the basis for the lawfulness of that which is the context of perception\nwill be defined in terms of continuity. The deep lawfulness of the context of perceptions\nwill be defined by the nature of continuity laws.\n\n```\nLaw of symmetry will apply to all that is of content.\nLaw of continuity will apply to all that is of context.\n```\n\n```\nBasis of Law 21\n```\n\n(^) The Two Principles of Ontological Dynamics:\nThe objective aspects of interaction are defined by\na symmetry of content and an asymmetry of context.\nThe subjective aspects of interaction are defined by\na discontinuity of content and a continuity of context.\nThe Four Theorems of Being :\nObjective content is symmetric.\n(Example: The law of conservation of matter and energy).\nObjective context is asymmetric.\n(Example: The arrow of time).\nSubjective context is continuous.\n(Example: The nature and persistence of self identity).\nSubjective content is discontinuous.\n(Example: The necessary diversity of thoughts and perceptions).\nThe Incommensuration Theorem : Where applied to an absolute degree,\nthe following theorems hold for any interaction (any comparison) in any domain:\nWhen something is absolutely symmetric, it must also be intrinsically discontinuous.\nWhen something is absolutely asymmetric, it must also be intrinsically continuous.\nWhen something is absolutely continuous, it must also be intrinsically asymmetric.\nWhen something is absolutely discontinuous, it must also be intrinsically symmetric.\nNothing anywhere at all can be both absolutely symmetric and absolutely continuous.\nNothing anywhere at all can be both absolutely asymmetric and absolutely\ndiscontinuous.\nAnalysis, as a process of division, emphasizes discontinuity to find symmetry.\nSynthesis, as a process of joining, emphasizes continuity, and will find asymmetry.\nAnalysis has the nature of the omniscient. Synthesis has the nature of the transcendent.\nNothing (no interaction nor comparison) can be both perfectly/absolutely symmetric and\nperfectly/absolutely continuous. The concepts of symmetry and continuity are\nfundamentally and irreducibly incommensurate. Furthermore, nothing (no interaction nor\ncomparison) can be both perfectly/absolutely asymmetric and perfectly/absolutely\ndiscontinuous. The concepts of asymmetry and discontinuity are also fundamentally and\nirreducibly incommensurate.\nNo comparison can regard content as both\nperfectly symmetric and continuous,\nor perfectly asymmetric and discontinuous.\nApplies at all scales, as well as for all positions in all domains.\n\n22 Basis of Law\n\nOne can conceptually examine the meanings of symmetry and continuity in the terms of\nparts and wholes.\n\n```\n'Wholes' have the meaning of 'that in the large scales' or of the macroscopic.\n'Parts' have the meaning of 'the small scales' or of the microscopic.\n```\n\nSimilarly, the concepts of symmetry and continuity can be expressed in terms of\nmicroscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic.\n\n```\nSymmetry is an assertion about the parts (the microscopic) that is made from the\nperspective of the whole, (the macroscopic and/or the mesoscopic).\n```\n\n```\nContinuity is an assertion about the whole (the macroscopic) that is made from the\nperspective of the parts, (the microscopic and/or the mesoscopic).\n```\n\n```\nChoice, Change, and Causality 23\n```\n\n#### Choice, Change, and Causality\n\nThe very fabric of the universe -- the fabric of consciousness -- is made up of change,\ncausality, and choice. The beingness and reality of (the doing of) a/any/the/all\nworlds/selves is composed completely and entirely of only change, causality, and choice.\nChange, causality, and choice are the composition and basis of all-that-is.\n\n```\nCausality is defined as the subjective perception (context) of a consistency between\ntwo objective contents.\n```\n\n```\nChoice is defined as the objective expression (content) of a consistency between two\nsubjective contexts.\n```\n\n```\nChange refers to the continuity of content and asymmetry of context of the\ninteraction/definition of the subjective and objective.\n```\n\nChange, causality, and choice are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable concepts.\nChange, causality, and choice, although having identically distinct natures,\nare always found in intimate mixture with one another.\n\n```\nChange is never found in the complete absence of both causality and choice.\nCausality is never found in the complete absence of choice and change.\nChoice is never found in the absence of change and causality.\n```\n\n```\nChange (complexity and consciousness) has the nature of the immanent modality.\nCausality (actuality and conservation) has the nature of the omniscient modality.\nChoice (potentiality and evolution) has the nature of the transcendent modality.\n```\n\n```\nA class of choices is needed to beget an expression of one instance of change.\nA class of changes is needed to beget the perception of one instance of causality.\nA class of causality is needed to beget one choice.\n```\n\nExperiences and expressions are more basic than self and reality. Choices lead to changes,\nwhich become causes, which beget new choices, etc. All of these are inherently and\nirreducibly both objective and subjective. Both Reality and Self are inherently and\nirreducibly both objective and subjective, although reality must appear to be (as causal)\nonly objective, and self must appear to be (in choice) only subjective.\n\n24 Choice, Change, and Causality\n\nPerception which has an omniscient basis at the (objective) macroscopic limit (theory of\nphysics, particular to a world) will regard all forms of choice as a form of, or derived from,\ncausality.\n\nPerception which has a transcendent basis at the (subjective) microscopic limit will regard\nall forms of causality (conservation, existence) as a form of, or derived from, choice\n(creation, in terms of ethics).\n\nWithin an immanent basis, at the mesoscopic limit (the boundary of the conscious and the\nunconscious), all perception will appear to be purely causal, and all expression will appear\nto be purely chosen (created, in terms of aesthetics). All is ultimately in terms of change.\n\nComparisons of changes (events) will modify (change) the apparent ratio of the degree\nthat the change has a causal aspect to the degree that the change has a chosen aspect.\nThe more one goes into the world, the more that being seems to be defined by causality.\nThe more one goes into the self, the more that being is defined by (experience of) choice.\nOn the boundary between self and world, one finds only change.\n\nParallel Aspect; 1st: To the extent that events and dynamics seem remote and external to\nthe self, or are larger in scale than (the scale of) the self, or are regarded as 'unconscious'\n(as external to the consciousness awareness of the self), these events and dynamics will\nappear to be causal, objective, or reactive, with respect to that self.\n\nParallel Aspect; 2nd: To the extent that events and dynamics seem to be close and\ninternal to the self, or are smaller than (the scale of) the self, or of which the self is aware\n(as internal or within the 'conscious' awareness of the self), these events and dynamics will\ntend to appear be chosen/ (at least in being stochastic), subjective, or volitional/responsive\nwith respect to that self.\n\n```\nSix Intrinsics 25\n```\n\n#### Six Intrinsics\n\nThe concept and being of perceiver, perception (the action of perceiving), and perceived\nare distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.\n\n```\nThe perceiver has the nature of the transcendent.\nPerception has the nature of the immanent.\nThe perceived has the nature of the omniscient^1.\n```\n\nIn practice, the reality of the perceiver and the perceived depends/descends from the real\nnature of the perceiving (one cannot not perceive). Perception is more basic than the\nperceiver and/or the perceived. In theory, insofar as that which is not real is regarded as\nbeing illusion, the being of both the perceiver (self) and the perceived (world) must be\nregarded as illusionary (since neither of these are the action of perceiving/perception\nitself; the relation between self and world (which is real) is neither self nor world).\n\n```\nPerception has the nature of the immanent modality.\nPerceiver has the nature of the transcendent modality.\nPerceived has the nature of the omniscient modality.\n```\n\nFor example, the event of vision (as an interaction) can be understood as a dynamic of\nperception, which begets recognition, which begets knowing. This dynamic is consistent\nwith Axiom II.\n\nAny consideration of interaction, perception, expression (between self and reality) will\nultimately rest on and resolve into specific meanings of exactly six aspects, irreducibly\n\nintrinsic^1 to the consideration itself.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. In the IDM metaphysics, the term \"intrinsic\" is used to distinguish against (and avoid) other possible\n   interpretations/ connotations, (particularly those which indicate ideas of \"causality\" or of \"predication\"). The\n   six intrinsics model is a view of the essential meaning of the term 'interaction', and is itself neither more nor\n   less fundamental than the concept of interaction.\n\n26 Six Intrinsics\n\n1st Intrinsic: The distinction of subject and object (patterned and pattern-less, form and\nfeeling)), is an omniscient modal context. In all interactions there is always a difference\n(discontinuity) between the subjective and the objective.\n\n2nd Intrinsic: The fixed characteristic of the structure of the object (i.e., the platonic\neternity), is an omniscient modal content. In all interactions there is always a degree of\nobjectivity (symmetry) with fixed characteristics.\n\n3rd Intrinsic: The irreversibility of change, is an immanent modal context. In all\ninteractions (continuity) there is always a subjective irreversibility (asymmetry).\n\n4th Intrinsic : The direction of the flow (of change) is an immanent modal content. In all\ninteractions there is always a flow (continuity) of change with direction (asymmetry) and\ndegrees of intensity.\n\n5th Intrinsic : The transformation of information is a transcendent modal context. In all\ninteractions there is always a dynamic of abstraction and/or instruction.\n\n6th Intrinsic : The specification of (addition of non-local and/or non-deterministic)\ntransformation attributes is a transcendent modal content. In all interactions there is\nalways a specification of the details (specified information, gauge values) added or\nremoved.\n\n```\nSix Intrinsics 27\n```\n\nFor interactions which are perceptions, the flow of change is from the objective towards\nthe subjective, the dynamic is one of abstraction, and overall, details (information, gauge\nvalues) are removed. For interactions which are expressions, the flow of change is from\nthe subjective towards the objective, the dynamic is one of instruction (to put into\nstructure or form), and overall, details are added.\n\nThe intrinsics of distinction and fixed characteristic are defined in terms of causality.\nThe intrinsics of irreversibility and direction are defined in terms of change.\nThe intrinsics of transformation and specification are defined in terms of choice.\n\nThe concept of a measurement is isomorphic with the concept of an observation, a\nperception, and an interaction. Comparison is more than a comparison of 'things'; a\ncomparison is a comparison of interactions. There are no purely static things; there are\nonly interactions. All of these have (and are) being.\n\nOne cannot observe just one thing.\nOne cannot not (must always) observe at least one something.\nOne cannot completely observe any one thing.\n\nAnything which has being, has as its being six distinct and intrinsic aspects. There can be\nno being which is incomparable. As with the intrinsics of comparison, all being will always\nhave content and context, sameness and difference, and subjectivity (quality) and\nobjectivity (form).\n\nAny concept of an event of measurement will involve six intrinsics. These are inertia (here\nused with the combined meanings of mass, pattern, form, shape, and/or structure), space,\nforce, time, probability, and possibility. All six of these will be considered, at least\nimplicitly, in any consideration of any measurement.\n\nThe six intrinsics of a measurement can be grouped into two common classes, those which\nrepresent content aspects of a measurement and those which represent context aspects of\nmeasurement. Pattern, force, and probability are content aspects of measurement. Space,\ntime, and possibility are context aspects of measurement.\n\nContent triaxial: With the concept of physicality, the class concept of 'content'\nis composed of the instance concepts of force, inertia, and probability.\n\nContext triaxial: With the concept of physicality, the class concept of 'context'\nis composed of the instance concepts of time, space, and possibility.\n\n28 Six Intrinsics\n\nWhere pattern, force, and probability are the content of a perception,\nthese will be defined by symmetry law.\nWhere space, time, and possibility are the context of a perception,\nthese will be defined by continuity law.\n\nWhere the incommensuration theorem asserts that the fundamental basis of consideration\ncannot regard anything as being both wholly symmetric and wholly continuous, then that\nwhich is known or defined as symmetric must also be discontinuous. The concept of\n\ndiscontinuity is isomorphic with the concept of quantization^1.\n\nThe concept of content has common basis with the concept of quantization (symmetry).\nThe concept of context has common basis with the concept of non-quantization\n(continuity).\n\nAt the scale of the absolute microscopic scale of a domain,\nthe pattern, force, and probability aspects of a perception must be quantized (symmetric,\ndiscontinuous).\nAt the scale of the absolute macroscopic scale of a domain,\nthe space, time, and possibility aspects of a perception must be continuous\n(non-quantized; asymmetric).\n\nThe metrics of Force in time have the nature of the modality of the immanent.\nThe metrics of inertia (pattern) in space have the nature of the modality of the omniscient.\nThe metrics of probability in possibility have the nature of the modality of the\ntranscendent.\n\nThe six intrinsics of interaction have direct one to one correspondence with the six\nintrinsic metrics of any physical domain. In that the essential nature of all measurement\n(as in the method of science) is itself necessarily an interaction, so does each of the six\nintrinsics of interaction provide the essential foundations of the metrication basis of all\nmeasurements.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The concept of quantization is here used in the same manner as it would be used in the science of Quantum\n   Mechanics: to break up into distinct and discrete units or parts.\n\n```\nSix Intrinsics 29\n```\n\n1. The metric of space corresponds to a difference between the subjective and the\n\nobjective^1 (discontinuous with each other, yet in symmetric relationship to each other).\n\n2. The metric of mass/inertia/pattern^2 corresponds to objective content with fixed\n   characteristics (symmetric and discontinuous).\n\n3. The metric of time corresponds to subjective irreversibility^3 , a subjective flow of\n   asymmetric continuous change without (physical) direction or intensity.\n\n4. The metric of force corresponds to an objective asymmetric flow of continuous change\n\nwith direction and intensity^4.\n\n5. The metric of possibility corresponds to a dynamic of abstraction and/or instruction^5\n   (instruction as 'to put into form').\n\n6. The metric of probability^6 corresponds to the specification of gauge^7 values added or\n   removed.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The concept of space is an abstraction of the meaning of the distinction between subject and object. While\n   the concept of space may relativize the nature of origin and scale (the subjective position and size of the self,\n   i.e. the distance from \"here\", or one's 'point of view'), it does not (cannot) remove the necessity of the\n   application/ instance of origin, scale, and distance altogether.\n2. The concept of mass (inertia) is an abstraction of the meaning of the fixed characteristic (pattern, form,\n   structure, and content) of the objective. The concept of 'information' (i.e., fixed pattern) which is perceived is\n   itself inseparable from the essence of the meaning of measurement.\n3. The concept of time (the arrow of time) is based on, and is an abstraction of,\n   the characteristic irreversibility of the being of an interaction.\n4. The concept of force is based on and is an abstraction of the concept of the aspect of direction in\n   interaction. There can be no force which is not without direction. Within the context of the objective and\n   subjective (see space above), this distinguishes between perception, as an interaction, and expression, as an\n   interaction.\n5. The concept of possibility is an abstraction of the meaning of transformation, as an intrinsic aspect of all\n   interactions (i.e., the mediation of the interaction itself). In the context of perception, the transformation is\n   referred to as abstractive; in the context of expression, the transformation is referred to as \"instructive\".\n6. The concept of probability is based upon the concept of the specification aspects (complementary to\n   transformation) of interaction. The probability of an event within the domain is not defined by the domain, but\n   is rather defined by adding information/ detail to it.\n7. 'Gauge constants' refer to that 'information' which is added or removed in the process of either abstraction\n   or instruction (together having the meaning of transformation).\n\n30 Six Intrinsics\n\nThe difference between the subjective and the objective, and the objective content with\nfixed characteristics, are the aspects of interaction which have the nature of the\nomniscient modality.\n\nSubjective irreversibility and the flow of change with direction and intensity\nare the aspects of interaction which have the nature of the immanent modality.\n\nThe dynamic of abstraction and/or instruction and the specification of gauge values added\nor removed, are aspects of interaction which have the nature of the transcendent modality.\n\nAs a fundamental relation (simple), interaction, perception, expression is (are) not in itself\n(themselves) further analyzable. Relations such as these cannot be analyzed except into\nterms of other dependent and secondary relations (made complex), implementing the\nmodel elements listed above. For example, there is no \"medium\" of perception (light needs\nno aether to propagate), as a form or substance (mass/ inertia/ pattern) which is more basic\nthan the perception itself.\n\nInteraction can only BE interaction when it directly and intrinsically involves all of the\nmodel aspects listed above. All other \"interactions\" are, and can only be, assumed (they\nare not known). For example, it is not possible to 'see' a ray of light that is not intersected\nby the eye. There are no \"interactions\" which are between \"objects\" which are only\nobjective. All interactions are between a subjective subject and an objective object.\n\nIn considering space, time, and possibility, as defined in terms of the interaction itself,\nthese concepts cannot be considered as an independent context in which events occur, but\nrather must be thought of as coordinating contexts occurring as an aspect of the beingness\nof the event. Time is relative to perception; perception is not relative to time. Time is\n\ndefined by perception, perception does not occur in time (it 'creates' time)^1.\n\nSpace, time, possibility, probability, force, and pattern are aspects of interaction. The\nbeingness of an interaction establishes the beingness of space, time, and possibility.\nInteractions do not \"happen in a context\", rather, there is a context (that context is, has\nbeing/reality) to the degree that there is an interaction.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. As an extension of this, events do not happen in a place, at a location, in a given moment of time. Rather\n   they have (as aspects of themselves) position, duration, and possibility, which may be aligned via\n   coordination/comparison with these same aspects of other events (eventities) so as to create a common\n   context of comparison (what most people think of as these metrics -- as an objective context).\n\n```\nActuality and Potentiality 31\n```\n\n#### Actuality and Potentiality\n\nIntradomain relations are always relations of actuality. Interdomain relations are always\nrelations of potentiality.\n\nThere is no meaning of the concept of a 'force' between domains. The concept of force is\nonly applicable within domains, never across them. Only probabilities exist between\ndomains. To consider the 'between-ness' of domains is to consider a transcendental\nrelationship, whereas 'force' is a concept derived from an immanent modality.\n\nWhere the potentiality of an eventity is the same, it must be distinguished by its actuality.\nWhere the actuality of an eventity is the same, it must be distinguished by its potentiality.\n\nPotentiality and quality increase as measure and scale decrease.\nActuality and form increase as measure and scale increase.\n\nAnything that is actual will be quantized. Anything that is potential will be continuous.\n\nThe degree of potentiality is measured in terms of\nthe number of, and degree of, interdomain relations.\nThe degree of actuality is measured in terms of\nthe number of, and degree of, intradomain relations.\n\nThe concept and being of potentiality, actuality, and complexity are distinct, inseparable,\nand non-interchangeable. Potentiality has the nature of the transcendent. Complexity has\nthe nature of the immanent. Actuality has the nature of the omniscient.\n\nParallel Aspect; 1st: Dynamics which tend to increase the degree of objectivity in the\nself-to-world relation will result in a proportional increase in the degree of actuality of that\nworld, and a decrease in the degree of potentiality of what that world could be. These are\nprocesses which tend to place the self in a more omniscient modal relation to a world.\n\nParallel Aspect; 2nd: Dynamics which tend to increase the degree of subjectivity in the\nself-to-world relation will result in a proportional increase in the degree of the potentiality\nof that world, and a decrease in the degree of actuality of what that world is. These are\nprocesses which tend to place the self in a more transcendent modal relation to a world.\n\n32 Content of World\n\n#### Content of World\n\nWhere there is a context of perception, there must (cannot not) be a content of that\nperception. This remains true regardless of the nature of the shift of objective context.\n\nWherever attention is moved, one shall always find substance. Where there is the feeling\nof mind, there cannot not be the form of world. Mind negates absence, separation,\ndiscontinuity. Consciousness and subjectivity can only be continuous, can only have\ncontinuity.\n\nWithin the context of a world, from the perspective of a present moment (the now), there\nshall always be a past that one remembers. Where one moves to consider any place\nbeyond one's current limits of vision, one shall always find content there. No world will\never have an 'edge' for which there is nothing beyond. Where one changes scale to\nconsider the small details of something in the world, one always finds finer and finer\ndetails. Where one looks for other possibilities, other sequences of events, one always\nfinds other sequences.\n\nThere cannot not be other possibilities, probabilities, and potentialities.\nAny potentiality can be made actual.\nThere cannot not continue to be creation (evolution), in all worlds, in all domains.\nCreation is an aspect of events, rather than their source.\n\nNo interaction in perception can be so asymmetric as to be (completely/absolutely)\nwithout possibility (and means) of expression. Where one perceives and has feeling, one\ncannot be fully silent (secret). In all the worlds in which one perceives and has feeling,\nthere cannot not be a possibility of expression, a form and a symbol of the self (body)\nprojected as substance within that world.\n\n```\nKnown, Unknown, Unknowable 33\n```\n\n#### The Known, the Unknown, and the Unknowable\n\nAs per the intrinsic and irreducible nature of being itself, with the being of knowing and\nthe known, there must also always be the unknown and the unknowable.\n\nWhen considered from the perspective of the impersonal, the objective, the concept of the\nknown has the nature of the omniscient, the concept of the unknown has the nature of the\nimmanent and the concept of the unknowable has the nature of the transcendent.\n\nWhen considered from the perspective of the personal, the subjective, the known is\nimmanent, the unknown is omniscient and the unknowable is transcendent.\n\nOnly the being of interactions in the immanent modality can be known. The being of\ninteractions between eventities viewed in the omniscient modality can only be\nhypothesized, never known. The absence of interactions between eventities in distinct\ntranscendent domains can not be hypothesized or known, and are unknowable.\n\nThe known, the unknown, and the unknowable are distinct, inseparable, and\nnon-interchangeable. The concept of the unknown is more basic than the concept of the\nknown and/or the concept of the unknowable.\n\nThere can be no firm or absolute line drawn between the known and the unknown.\nThere can be drawn a fixed and absolute logical line between the unknown and the\nunknowable.\n\nMany experiences of the unknown precede one experience of the known.\nMany experiences of the known precede one experience of the unknowable.\nMany experiences of the unknowable precede one experience of the unknown.\n\n34 Great Mystery\n\n#### The Great Mystery\n\nThe Great Mystery refers to the unknowable as well as the unknown. The true mystery,\nthe deeply mysterious is that which is inherently inexplicable but which is not therefore\nparadoxical (nonsense). Although elements of the Great Mystery cannot be explained or\nreduced to pure reason, it is that from which all reason and reasonableness arise.\n\nThe limits of knowing, the boundaries of a domain and of the self, are three. These three\nlimits or mysteries, are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable. They define the\nboundaries and distinctions between the known, the unknown, and the unknowable.\n\nThe Mystery of the Horizon refers to the macroscopic limit of a domain, beyond which is\nthe unknown and unknowable; that place which is so far away in time and space as to be\ninto the absolute elsewhere.\n\nThe Mystery of the Infinitesimal refers to the microscopic limit of the domain; that scale\nat which knowledge of definite state or quality becomes impossible (Heisenberg\nuncertainty limits).\n\nThe Mystery of the Subconscious refers to a mesoscopic limit in the nature of the\nknowledge of one's subjective self; that quality of which oneself is.\n\nThe Mystery of the horizon has the nature of the omniscient.\nThe Mystery of the infinitesimal has the nature of the transcendent.\nThe Mystery of the subconscious has the nature of the immanent.\n\nThe Mystery of the subconscious is more fundamental than the mystery of the horizon or\nthe mystery of the infinitesimal. Any consideration of the mystery of the horizon, or the\nmystery of the very small (the infinitesimal) presupposes a consideration (at least\nimplicitly) of the mystery of the subconscious. In that consideration presupposes\nconsciousness, it involves also the subconscious and the unconscious.\n\n```\nGreat Mystery 35\n```\n\nThe unknowable, Mystery (awe) does not have or admit measure, degree, quantity, or\nvalue. Mystery cannot be regarded as finite.\n\nMystery is neither conserved nor diminished by any degree of knowing, understanding,\nreason, or science. While knowing can affect the unknown, it cannot affect the\nunknowable. The quality of the mysterious (that which is awe inspiring) in the universe is\nunchanged regardless of one's degree of knowing (or unknowing) of the dynamics of\nworldly causality.\n\nIrreducible Uncertainty : No amount of communication or interaction (familiarity) in any\ndomain or world will ever allow one to predict with certainty what will be said next, what\nwill happen next. Communication and self are emergent. There are always some aspects of\nthe content of these which are indeterminable and surprising.\n\nThe Veil of Secrecy : The omniscient cannot ever contain, or view/observe, the\ntranscendent. In that the process of knowing is itself immanent, one cannot directly know\nthe transcendent from within the perspective of the omniscient. It can only be that\ntranscendent can perceive/know the omniscient, never the reverse.\n\n36 Theory of Creation\n\n#### Theory of Creation\n\nContext has no source. Context has no position, no location. Context is not observable.\nOnly content can be 'observed'. Context can be made 'observable' only by 'converting' it\ninto content. For example, one never observes objective time; rather, one observes a\nclock.\n\nCreation is real, yet it does not exist. The ontology of the class of creation is distinct from\nthe ontology of the class (concept of) existence. The concepts of being real and of existing\nare not the same; nothing about one implies anything about the other.\n\nCreation is not actual. As Creation/creativity is neither a pattern, nor a space, it is also\nneither a force nor a time. Creation/creativity has the nature of probability and possibility.\nCreation is potentiality, rather than actuality.\n\nCreation (creativity) is not observable. It cannot be seen or measured and has no definite\nproperties. Creation, by its very nature, must always seem to have happened somewhere\nelse, or at some other time. Creation in itself is always and necessarily invisible,\ntransparent, and ultimately unknowable.\n\nCreation is like the silence between the words, the space between the letters; always\npresent within looking, but never (available to be) directly observed.\n\nCreation does not have a source. Creation does not have a location. Creation IS, without\ncoming from somewhere, or from someone, or from something. Creation is the objective\ncontext of existence as a content.\n\nThere is (and can be) no single self which is the sole source of (all) creation (for any\ndomain, world, or universe). Imagination, knowledge, healing, and creativity are\neventualities that are without source. They never come from just one place or from any\none single person/self. They come from many places, many times, and many people. No\none ever does anything completely by themselves.\n\nCreation does not have a measure or degree. Creation is formless and structureless.\nCreation consists of, and has being purely in terms of, quality.\n\nCreation is not conserved and is not subject a to law of conservation. Without form, the\nconcept of conservation (as a symmetry of form or measure) cannot be applied to\ncreation.\n\n```\nTheory of Creation 37\n```\n\nBoth creation and choice are necessarily/fundamentally cooperative processes. In the\nsame manner that all of causality is existential, all of choice is creative. Personal choice is\nthe participation of self in the universal aspect of creation.\n\nCreation is unbounded and formless. Creation cannot be constrained or modified by\nanything which exists. Nothing which exists can prevent creation from being. Creation IS,\nand cannot not be.\n\nCreation is not repeatable. Creation has no process, and is not causal. Creation always and\ninherently involves domain/world transcendent relationships.\n\nThe concept of creation is isomorphic with the concept of potentiality. As such,\ncreation/potentiality cannot ever be fully subsumed or contained within a/any space.\n\nCreation is not an event, but rather is an aspect of all events. Creation does not have a\ntime. Creation does not have a location. There has been (and there can be) no event which\nmay be called 'the creation of the universe'. Rather creation is an aspect of events. All\nevents have creative/ creation aspects. There is no event that does not have potentiality\n(creativity, novelty) as a fundamental and inseparable aspect of that event.\n\nCreation is not a process, and it is not a being. It does not have dynamics or components\n(or personality). Rather creation is an aspect of all process. All components are creative,\nnot created.\n\nThe question of whether something is 'created' or 'found/discovered' is dependent on the\nplacement/position of the arbitrary boundary of self. Depending on how one chooses to\nconsider the totality of all being (all that is real) and divides it into aspects which are to be\nconsidered as self and not-self, one also chooses to consider that one has either \"created\"\nor \"discovered\" something in any given image/domain. If, as an extreme view, one were to\nconsider all of beingness as subjective (an idealism), then one may assert that one has\n'created everything' (self as deity). If one were to consider an opposite extreme (a\n'realism'), then one may assert that one has created nothing (self as only substance). In the\nIDM metaphysics, neither extreme view is considered valid.\n\nTo be a realist is to consider that subjective content is continuous with objective content.\nTo be an idealist is to consider that objective content is symmetric with subjective content.\n\n38 Theory of Creation\n\nCreation, although not a process, typically involves the microscopic boundary of a\ndomain. The entrance of creative potentiality occurs through the scale of the very small,\nbut at no particular position/locus in time and/or space.\n\nThe strength of a potentiality, or creative manifestation, is defined in terms of the degree\nof organization and coherency of large numbers of microscopic eventualities. The\nexamination of any small finite collection of microscopic eventualities will have a lesser\nappearance of potentiality than that of the entire aggregate, proportional to the degree of\nrectification used.\n\nTo be clear is to allow creation. The degree of creation aspect is proportional to clarity,\ntransparency (emptiness/potentiality), and inversely proportional to simplicity.\nEvents of greater degrees of synthesis and complexity have stronger aspects of\ncreation/creativity.\n\nThe quality of positivity has the nature of the immanent modality. The quality of\nconstancy (symmetry, equality, conservation) has the nature of the omniscient modality.\nThe quality of increase (continuity, inequality, evolution)) has the nature of the\ntranscendent modality.\n\nThe nature of creation is to always be increasing.\nThe nature of interaction is to always be positive.\nThe nature of existence is to always be constant.\n\nThe law of the constancy of heat is omniscient modal.\nThe law of the positivity of temperature is immanent modal.\nThe law of the increase in entropy is transcendent modal.\n\n```\nSelf of Choice 39\n```\n\n#### Self of Choice\n\nThe concept of energy is isomorphic with the concept of changes of state.\nTo refer to objective energy is to refer to the potentiality of changes in actuality.\nTo refer to subjective energy is to refer to the actuality of changes in potentiality.\n\nExistence (the universe) abhors a vacuum (the absence of mass).\nConsciousness abhors stasis (the absence of force).\nSpirit (deity) abhors fixation (limitation, closure, boundary; the absence of probability).\n\nOne's being, the eventity of self, is the product of\nthe sum of all of the choices that one has made, and\nthe sum of all of the choices that one could make.\n\nSelf is the appearance of the aggregation of that aspect of interaction which is choice.\nReality (world) is the appearance of the aggregation of that aspect of interaction which is\ncausality.\n\nThe being of the world is realized (as actuality) in terms of symmetry and discontinuity.\nThe being of the self is realized (as potentiality) in terms of continuity and asymmetry.\n\nIn the same manner that world, existence, and causality are mutually inseparable, the\nconcepts of self (consciousness), creation, and choice are mutually inseparable.\nExperience (perception, causality), and creativity (choice and expression) are together\nmore basic and intrinsic than both self (belief and personality) and reality (objective\notherness).\n\nThe existence, reality (being), and objectivity (and subjectivity) of both self and world are\ncreated out of interaction.\nAll experience and expression (interaction) is known and understood in the terms of\nchoice, change, and cause.\n\nA/any/the/all worlds and selves change. There can be no world or self, nor any part of\nworld/self that does not have some non-zero positive degree of change and evolution. One\ncannot not change. Nothing cannot not change.\n\n40 Self of Choice\n\nThe essence of the concept of choice is resolved into exactly three necessary and\nsufficient concepts.\n\nChoice is a process of potentiality, selection, and consequence^1.\nWithout any of these, there is no choice (an impossible condition).\n\nThe strength of feeling that one has choice is the (multiplicative) product of\na) the degree to which one perceives (the form of) that they have a range of options to\nchoose from,\nb) the degree that each option has actuality/consequence (power), and\n\nc) the degree that the selection of such option is perceived to be unconstrained^2.\n\nChoice, freedom, and potentiality although real, have no position or substance.\nChoice/freedom/potential have no size or location and cannot be analyzed, deconstructed,\nor decomposed into simpler parts.\n\nSelf does not own or have choice; rather self is the evolving context of many choices.\n\nThe self arises out of the many common contexts of choice^3.\nThe nature of choice is more basic, more fundamental, than the nature of self.\n\nA/any/the/all worlds will contain some degree of selfness, and these selves will always\nhave some positive (non-zero) degree of effective choice with/within/in that\nworld/domain. All effective choice will have causal consequences and implement\nreal/actual changes.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. For choice to be choice, it must have consequences. A choice that has no effects, or whose effects can be\n   completely undone, is not actually a choice at all (i.e., is meaningless, by Principle of Identity).\n\nNote: If there is a potentiality and selection of \"not choosing\", when such selection has real consequences and\neffects, such selection must necessarily also be considered a choice.\n\n2. The beingness of choice, the idea of free will and self-determination, is the feeling sense that one has of\n   choosing something without external influence, without reason, without any external or logical compulsion,\n   aside from the feeling of desire from deep within the self.\n\nUltimately, there will always be an aspect of personal choice which is not dictated by anything external to\noneself. From an external perspective, there will always has a certain irreducible degree of non-determinism\n(appearance of randomness) in one's choices.\n\n3. Technically, it is better to assert that 'choice makes self' or that choice has Self. Self is an intrinsic of\n   choice. The IDM metaphysics regards the idea 'self has or makes choice' as inherently inaccurate. Choice is\n   not 'owned' or 'had' by the self so much a singularity of self (the common context of selection) is the outcome\n   of a multiplicity of choices. In the terminology of Axiom II, Self is Truly Owned by Choice, rather than the\n   reverse.\n\n```\nSelf of Choice 41\n```\n\nThere is no particular 'source' (no location, no scale) for the content (specification) of a\nchoice. Choice is not 'a property' of any system (domain or self), so much as an intrinsic of\nall systems.\n\nNeither choice, nor change, nor causality, has the nature of being deterministic and/or\ncompletely logical.\n\nChoice cannot be explained. It can only be described.\nChoice can never be a subject of physical theory; it can only be a topic of metaphysical\ntheory.\n\nChoices must appear, at some level of abstraction, to be fundamentally unpredictable to\nall others, and thus, indistinguishable from pure/true randomness in the domain. The\nactuality of the perception of \"an-other's\" choice (as choices not made by the self) is also\n(must be, must appear to be) indistinguishable from pure randomness. Choice is not\nrandom, however, in that it is subjectively meaningful, whereas true randomness is not.\n\n42 Six Paths\n\n#### Six Paths\n\nThe totality of the relationship between self and reality is understood in terms of six\n\nsubjects, six paths^1. These may be known as spirituality, religion, science, technology,\nmysticism, and magic.\n\nArt is the combination of technology, religion, and the working of magic.\nPhilosophy is a combination of science, spirituality, and mysticism.\nMetaphysics is the integration (and unifying basis) of all six paths into a common whole.\n\nGreatness has aspects of form (as in ideas) and feeling (as in arts).\nThe most effective philosophies, the greatest ideas of an age,\nhave equal components of science, spirituality, and mysticism.\nThe most effective arts, the greatest works of art in an age,\nhave equal components of technology, religion, and magic.\n\nThe greatest ideas of an age involve a scientific perspective, in that there needs to be a\ndiscipline, rigor, and clarity of thinking. A great idea involves spirituality, in that it requires\nhigh degrees of acceptance and openness, (a beginner mind), to be appreciated in the\ncontext of one's previous assumptions, presuppositions, and beliefs.

Clarity, and Metaphor\n\n#### Simplicity, Clarity, and Metaphor\n\nThe concepts of simplicity and clarity are distinct, even though they may often appear in\nthe same context. In thinking about metaphysics, one must proceed with an emphasis on a\nclarity of essence rather than submit to a desire or drive for a simplicity of appearance. As\na metaphor for how the concept of simplicity is distinct from clarity, and of how clarity\ncan sometimes be more valued than simplicity, consider a sphere of pure black coal as\ncompared to a large multi-faceted diamond. The sphere of black coal perhaps represents\nthe simplest possible physical object. In contrast, the large diamond represents a clear, yet\ncomplex, physical object.\n\nThe sphere, although very simple, will not let light pass through it, for coal is not\ntransparent. Despite the complexity of the diamond, however, it does pass light. In this\nway, one can see that the ability to transmit light (a metaphor for understanding) is not\ndependent on complexity, nor on the materials used, for both coal and diamonds are made\nof just carbon. The beauty of the diamond, and how it makes prisms and sprinkles of light,\ndepends on a detailed technology of careful faceting (very complex). Light, which\ntypically represents love and spirituality in symbolic terms, is made beautiful by the\nclarity, and to some extent the complexity, of the diamond. Simplicity cannot, therefore,\nbe the one and only end of all considerations of metaphysics (nor of spirituality,\nenlightenment, etc). As another similar metaphor, consider that the important aspect of a\nchandelier is its clarity, and not its simplicity. A chandelier is made more impressive by the\ndegree that it is complex and consists of many multifaceted parts.\n\nThe value and sophistication of a metaphysics is in the power and insightfulness of its\nmetaphors (the clarity of its descriptions and definitions).\n\nThe power of a metaphor is proportional to the dis-similarity and diversity of the\nperceptions, ideas, and concepts the metaphor links across different symbol systems,\nlanguages, or levels of self.\nThe power of a metaphor is proportional to the degree of completeness by which these\nperceptions, ideas, and concepts are linked together.\nThe power of a metaphor is inversely proportional to the amount of subjective time that it\ntakes to make the necessary connections between perceptions, ideas, and concepts.\n\nThe clarity (potency) of a metaphysical description, definition, or metaphor (and of the\nwhole of a metaphysics) is measured by the degree to which the understanding of the\nessence of being is reflected in one's innate knowing of the essence of being. Assertions of\nmetaphysics are 'meta-physical' only insofar as they transparently connect and reflect an\nessential personal knowing of being with an essential impersonal understanding of theory\n(the physical with that which is not physical). Therefore it is essential to the nature of\nmetaphysics itself to be a clear description of the nature of the connection between the\npersonal (self) and the impersonal (world), in both theory and in being.\n\n```\nSimplicity, Clarity, and Metaphor 49\n```\n\nIn the practice of spirituality, philosophy, and art, clarity (not simplicity) is the more\nessential value. This is particularly true when examining and presenting the deeper\nconcepts of metaphysics. To say that a concept of metaphysics, or a theory of physics, has\n'elegance' and grace, is not to say that it is demonstrably simple so much as it is to say that\nit is profoundly clear.\n\nThinking about metaphysics and philosophy will tend to encourage the reader to\nfrequently examine implicit and hidden assumptions. Clarity is especially important when\nexamining one's underlying assumptions. The reader is advised to exercise discipline in\ntheir thinking, and to maintain a clear openness. When allowing a release of expectations,\nit becomes possible to gain new and valuable insights.\n\nThe essence of what it is to be in a domain is the same as the essence of what it is to use a\nlanguage. Events occur within domains in the same sense that messages occur within\ncommunication.\n\nJust as the synthesis of multiple languages grants the speaker a deeper knowing (including\na knowing of the essential nature of language), so also does the use of multiple levels,\nchannels, and interchanges of interaction with a reality grant a deeper knowing (including\na knowing of the essence of reality). The depth of such knowing obtained is greater than\nthe sum of its components. The self which is knowledgeable about many worlds has\ngreater wisdom in each of them.\n\nIn that there will always be limitations in translating the fullness of some ideas in one\nlanguage into terms of another language, so also will some qualities of being in one domain\nbe particular to that domain and none other. The domain of an Immanent metaphysics has\naspects particular to itself.\n\nTo be able to think about, within, and upon, different types of foundations is important.\nThe choice of the language (assumptions, subjective context) used in consideration has a\nprofound effect on the trend and effectiveness of one's thinking.\n\n50 Observation of Metaphysics\n\n## The Observation of Metaphysics\n\nMetaphysics is at once the most abstract and theoretical form of study imaginable, and yet\nalso the most concrete and practical form of knowledge possible. In considering only\nessence, metaphysics has very general applicability. In being about essence, it is at the\ncenter of everything, at the core of the very nature of being itself. The knowledge and\ntruths developed from metaphysics are more certain, firm, unchangeable, and substantial\nthan literal physical 'concrete'. The descriptions and correspondences of metaphysics are\nabsolute, even while they are also relative.\n\nFor example, metaphysics is abstract in that it considers expression and choice\nindependently of who is choosing or what is chosen. A knowledge of metaphysics cannot\nbe used to describe any particular perception, expression, or experience, for the study is\nnot about specific people, places, or things. The descriptions of metaphysics do not cover\nanyone's personal viewpoint, or the individual basis of anyone's choices. However, the\nconcepts, descriptions, and principles of metaphysics are applicable to any and all\ninstances of choice; they apply to all choices, made by everyone, everywhere.\nMetaphysics is specific in that anything that is inherent in the essential nature of choice\nitself is applicable to every choice that one makes. In that choices are involved in all\naspects of life, a true knowledge of metaphysics is inherently and eminently practical,\npotentially influencing and enhancing the process of life itself.\n\nMetaphysics is a search for fundamental symmetries (invariants) and continuities\n(intrinsics) in the relation between self and reality. For example, the invariants and\nintrinsics of experience would be those notions and descriptions which remain applicable\neven when changing either the content or the context (or both) of experience (as in the\ndefinition of symmetry).\n\nFor example, as soon as someone makes an assertion \"I experienced X\", some aspects of\nmetaphysical principle and insight are immediately applicable regardless of how rarified,\nspecial, spiritual, or mystical that experience may be. Anything which inherently intrinsic\nto the nature of any experience is validly applicable to all experiences. For descriptions of\nessence to be applied, it only matters that a notion of \"experience\" has been used at all. It\ndoes not matter who (as a subject), or what (as an object), the assertion regarding\nexperience happens to refer to.\n\nHowever, to develop the concepts of metaphysics, a metaphysicist must do more than\nsimply \"have experience\", she/he must also intellectually think about and reflect on the\nnature of experience in itself. Rather than being a reflection on what is (or has been)\nexperienced, a metaphysicist would reflect on the 'fact' that there are these events called\n'experiences' at all.\n\n```\nObservation of Metaphysics 51\n```\n\nThe reflection of a metaphysicist is more than the practice of the scientific method. As\naspects of knowing and experience, the metaphysicist must also consider the nature of\nmeasurement, observation, and objectivity, prior to assuming the usage of these notions in\na given practice of thinking and reflection. As such, to study metaphysics is to seek the\nintrinsic, essential, and invariant aspects of experience (perception, measurement,\nobservation, causality, etc). It involves a consideration of the very basis on which knowing\nitself rests, including that particular method of knowing which is called 'the scientific\nmethod'. For example, one cannot use the scientific method to 'prove' and 'validate' the\ncorrectness of the use of the scientific method itself. Metaphysics extends beyond, and yet\nprovides a semantic foundation for, a more conventional physics.\n\nTo study metaphysics is to consider and describe the essential nature of perception,\nexpression, knowing and knowledge, etc., as they are in themselves. It is an attempt to\ndevelop comprehensive and essential descriptions of these notions. For example, part of\nthe aim of metaphysics is to consider experience, regardless of 1) who is having that\nexperience (i.e., as the subjective context of experience), 2) what they are experiencing\n(i.e., as the subjective content of experience), 3) why they are having that experience, and\nnot some other, 4) when they have it, 5) where they have it, or even 6) how (i.e., the\nprocess, method, or sensory channel, by which) they have that experience.\n\nAn interest in metaphysics is an interest in the nature of experience as a relation between\nself and reality. Questions like \"What is experience?\", and \"How is the process/concept of\nexperience related to other processes/concepts?\", are central to the study. Where\nconsidering perception, it does not matter how rare or dis-similar the content of a person's\nperception is relative to the norm, the nature of the inherent aspects of the process (and\nconcept) of all of perception will be the same.\n\n52 Reformation of Metaphysics\n\n## The Reformation of Metaphysics\n\nMetaphysics begins as an inquiry into the nature of the relationship between self and\nreality (world). It is this relationship which is the essence of the study. Insofar as this\nrelationship is not a 'thing' this conception of metaphysics is in keeping with tradition as\nthe study of that which is 'beyond' the physical.\n\nAs a generalization, the concepts of self and world (reality) can be considered as 'the\nsubjective' and 'the objective'. Metaphysics is, therefore, a study of the relationship\nbetween subjectivity and objectivity. A successful metaphysics (as contrasted with a\nsuccessful physics) will be one which provides a clear description of the essential nature\nof this relationship. Metaphysics emphasizes description (what relationship is), rather than\nexplanation (why relationship is). It is a consideration of the being of the relationship\nbetween the subjective and objective in terms of intrinsic aspects: those characteristic\ndescriptions (and patterns of description) which are both necessary and sufficient\n(complete) for that relationship to be semantically meaningful in all contexts. Metaphysics\ndoes not attempt to account for how or why these intrinsic patterns of description have the\nform and qualities that they do.\n\nTo consider the nature of what the essence of a relationship is, it is necessary to consider\nit in terms of what it does. This is, in effect, a methodology by which being is considered\nin the terms of doing. The study of metaphysics is, therefore, directly involved with both\nontology and epistemology.\n\nOntology is the study of beingness. It considers the nature of what something is in itself.\nEpistemology is the study of knowing and the nature of knowledge. The essential\nquestions of epistemology are \"how does one know?\" and \"what is knowing, known, and\nknowledge?\". Insofar as epistemology is about methodology and process (a doing; the\nprocess of knowledge), then metaphysics is effectively the application of epistemology (a\ntechnique of knowing) to ontology (being in itself). Thus, metaphysics studies (a doing)\nthe being of relationship (the relationship between self and world).\n\nMore generally, metaphysics extends to consider the relationship between being and doing\nitself. As such, metaphysics (as a being) considers (as a doing) the being and doing of\nrelationship (a relationship which is itself between 'things' which are also in themselves a\nbeing and a doing). Therefore, for a metaphysics to truly be effective, the scope of its\ndescription must include a description of the nature of the process of its own description\n(metaphysics is a relationship as well as being about relationship). Metaphysics must be\nable do coherently describe itself; it must be as semantically complete when it is its own\nsubject as well as when it is its own object.\n\n```\nReformation of Metaphysics 53\n```\n\n(^) As a case example of the above, consider the nature of consciousness (as in relation to 'the\nsubjective' above). Consciousness is never 'just consciousness', rather it is always\n'consciousness of'. It is always a consciousness of something, even when that something is\nitself. The subject (the observer, consciousness) is never without an object (the observed;\nthat which is regarded as being other than self). Being, as the being of consciousness, is\nnever without doing, ('consciousness of' is an activity). Thus, as an observation (a\ndescription) on the nature of consciousness, metaphysics can include a concept of\ninseparability between being and doing; that the being of something (in this example, of\nconsciousness) can be described in terms of its doing (in this example, the action of\nconsciousness as being always 'consciousness of').\nAs a second example, consider the nature of existence (as in relation to 'the objective' as\nused above). Historically (until very recently) the connotations associated with the term\n'existence' implicitly included an idea of independence: that something will 'be existing'\nregardless of anyone's observation of it (a doing). In actual practice, however, the\nindependent significance of the term 'existence', or the absolute independent existence of\nany 'thing' has never been directly substantiated. Insofar as practice in itself\n(pragmaticism) must ultimately be considered as more significant (more real) than the\nphilosophy of realism, metaphysics must consider the nature of the significance of this\nterm 'existence' (the being of that which exists) in terms of the manner by which it is\npragmatically established (in other words, a doing). Metaphysics cannot consider ontology\n(being and existence) independently of (without relationship with) epistemology (a doing),\nthe manner by which the metaphysicist (as a subject) comes to know about the existence\nof the object (as objective).\nTherefore, insofar as the nature of relationship itself is primal to the study of metaphysics\n(by these examples and many others; hence the definition), the significance of a concept\nor a description (a being) cannot be considered independently of the manner by which it is\narrived at (a doing). In order to consider significance, or something as being significant, it\nmust be positively distinguished from non-significance (that which is non-significant). In\nthis essay, this requirement is known as the 'principle of identity': that which cannot be\ndistinguished must be the same. The significance of a term, concept, or state of being can\nonly be established by some method or activity (a doing) which can, at least in principle,\ndistinguish between it and that which is not it. A definition which does not distinguish\nbetween that which is defined, and that which is not (everything else) is not a definition (it\nhas zero semantic content; it is not meaningful). Minimally, the actuality of an identity\nmust be defined in terms of the possibility of its distinguishability (being is comparison;\ncomparison is a doing).\nAs such, Metaphysics must consider (it cannot not consider) 'that which exists' (being) in\nterms the manner by which that existence is established (a doing). In more pragmatic\nterms, the actuality of the semantic meaningfulness of the concept 'X exists' cannot not be\ndefined by (at a minimum) the real possibility of interacting with X. To claim that X exists\nis to claim, at a minimum, that it is at least possible in principle to interact with X. In other\nwords, X must have measurable properties (a potentiality of interaction) in order for the\nassertion 'X exists' to have any semantic meaningfulness.\n\n54 Reformation of Metaphysics\n\nSuppose, for example, that someone were to propose that there is this substance 'Q'.\nSuppose that they were to further claim that even though they had some of this Q on hand,\nthat it was in the nature of Q to have no measurable properties: \"Q has no shape, color, or\ndensity\" and \"Q is invisible and undetectable to all instruments, scientific or otherwise,\ndirectly and indirectly\". If no one has any means by which they could interact with Q, by\nwhat basis can it be claimed to exist? What is the personal functional significance of\nsomething which, by never interacting with anything, will never interact with oneself.\nWhen there is no possibility of distinguishing between the states of \"Q exists\" and \"Q does\nnot exist\", there is no significance in the difference; pragmatically, they are the same.\n\nThe actuality of existence cannot be considered independently of the possibility of\ninteraction. Furthermore, it is the action of measurement (a doing) which is the very basis\nof the meaning of 'X exists' (a being). The significance of the concept of existence,\ntherefore, is not independent of interaction, but is rather dependant on the concept of\ninteraction. The concept of existence cannot be considered without having already (at\nleast implicitly) involved the significance of the concept of interaction. The concept of\ninteraction is fundamental to the concept of existence. The notion of interaction (doing) is\nmore fundamental than the notion of existence (being). These two notions (being and\ndoing) cannot be considered separately (in either being or doing).\n\nThis idea of relationship and inseparability is so basic to the nature of these examples (and\nmany others) that it is regarded as an Axiom of this metaphysics:\n\n```\nAxiom I: Relationship (doing) is more fundamental than identity (being).\n```\n\nIn returning to the relationship between the subjective and the objective, Axiom I asserts\nthat the nature of both the subjective and the objective must be considered, understood,\nand defined in the terms of the relationship between them. Axiom I asserts that to consider\nthe being of the subjective, the objective, and their relationship, there must be a 'doing', a\nmethodology; that beingness cannot be, or even be considered as being, independent of\ndoing. There is no true independence; there is at best interdependence or dependence.\n\nAs the primary example of a methodology of this type, consider the philosophers program\n(a process) by which only those things which cannot be doubted would be considered as\n'truth'. By defining Truth as \"that which cannot be doubted\", Rene Descartes established a\nbasis of methodology (a doing) specifically designed to cut away all that was false leaving\nonly (the being of) Truth as the remainder. This methodology is an epistemology -- a\ntheory of truth -- which when enacted and implemented would identify to the philosopher\nall of those truths which could be known with certainty; those things which would provide\na basis for all other forms of knowing. Truth in this sense is intended to be the 'bedrock\nfoundation' (an ontology, a being of Truth) upon which all other forms of knowing (itself\nas a process) could be built.\n\n```\nReformation of Metaphysics 55\n```\n\nNote that this theory of truth (an epistemology) posits as a principle that there are only\ntwo ontological states of being: a dualism of truth and falsity. Furthermore, the concept of\n'having doubt' in Descartes' methodology included the notion of 'can be doubted in\nprinciple'. As such, anything which could be doubted on the basis of any principle\n(reasonable or not) would be regarded as 'doubtful' and therefore as 'not-truth' (possibly\nfalse, and therefore as not-certain). By this methodology, Descartes was searching for that\nwhich could be known with absolute certainty, without any possible doubt -- anything\nwhich could not, even in principle, be doubted.\n\nAfter much examination (books on the history of philosophy can describe the details),\nDescartes arrived at his famous dictum: \"I think, therefore I am\" as being the only thing\nwhich could be known with absolute certainty. In effect, the dictum is a description of a\nrelationship between doing (thinking) and being ('I am') which is so infinitesimally small\nthat it cannot be disturbed (a doing) without inherently damaging its very nature (its\nbeing). It is a ring between the subjective and the objective (between epistemology and\nontology) which is so infinitely microscopic as to be atomic ('inherently un-splitable', as\nper the etymology of the term 'atom'). At this scale of relationship which is infinitely\nmicroscopic, the relationship between being ('I am') and doing ('I think') is described as a\nbeing in itself (that self as an object, the perceived, and self as a perceiver are the same as\nthe process of perception; a relationship). Descartes concluded that this monism of\nidentity (the dictum itself, or rather, what it represented) was the only thing which could\nbe known with certainty, and therefore as absolute Truth (that which cannot be doubted,\neven in principle).\n\nHowever, in the context of the present essay, it is noted that there are in fact at least three\nother absolute certainties of truth. In particular, anything which is inherent in the very\nprocess of doubt itself, which is intrinsic to that process -- or more generally, to any\nprocess at all -- must also be (cannot not be) considered as Truth. For example, the being\nof doubt -- as a process (a doing) -- inherently involves an assumption of both truth and\nfalsity as notions in themselves. Doubt (as a process) also assumes that there are two\nsubjective states: unknown and known. Doubt, as a method of enacting and instantiating a\ntheory of epistemology (a theory of knowing in the terms of both knower, as subjective,\nand known, as objective) is understood to distinguish between truth and falsity, as aspects\nwhich are objective (things as they are in themselves), and known/unknown as aspects\nwhich are subjective (things as they are perceived to be). Finally, the dynamic of doubt\nmust also implicitly assume that there is a distinction between doubt as a process and that\nwhich is doubted as a being.\n\n56 Reformation of Metaphysics\n\nThese intrinsic aspects of doubt can be described in various terminology. For example, the\nconcepts of truth and falsity can be considered as being about, in essence, the concepts of\nsameness and difference. Truth is where there is a sameness of being and principle. Falsity\nis where there is a difference between being and principle. The epistemology of doubt can\nalso be regarded as a transition, a movement, from the unknown to the known in terms of\ntime. Doubt (and Descartes' method in general) can be regarded as a means from moving\nfrom antecedent states (the unknown that is before) to consequent states (the known\nwhich is after). Also, in distinguishing between the action of doubting and the being of that\nwhich is doubted, there is a distinction between content and context, the subjective and\nthe objective.\n\nAll of these notions are inherently involved in the process of doubt. Insofar as these\nnotions are intrinsic to the being of doubt as a process (a doing), any action of doubt\ncannot not instantiate (already pre-assume) these notions as objective, as things other than\ndoubt, and which therefore are not -- in themselves -- doubtful. Thus, the intrinsics of\ndoubt cannot be doubted, for the very action of doubting them requires that they have\nalready been established as assumed (not doubted). The intrinsics of doubt are beyond\ndoubt and therefore, by Descartes' own definition, they cannot be regarded as other than\nabsolute Truth (as that which cannot be doubted). There is more to absolute truth than\none's own thinking about one's own being.\n\nThe action of doubt and its intrinsics as a process, can be understood more exactly as an\ninstance of the process of comparison. The concept of comparison involves as its intrinsics\nthree pairs of other concepts: sameness and difference, content and context, subject and\nobject. These intrinsics, which are inherent in the relationship between doing and being\n(between subject and object) are generally inherent in the nature of relationship itself (and\ntherefore of both being and doing). They provide the basis of metaphysical description and\nare at the root of both epistemology and ontology. The persistent presence of these sets of\nconcepts at all levels of consideration is formalized as its own Axiom:\n\n```\nAxiom III: Intrinsic in all relationship, being, and doing are three concepts (being,\ndoing, and relationship themselves being examples) which are distinct, inseparable, and\nnon-interchangeable.\n```\n\nAs a last example of this relationship between being and doing, (a metaphysics of the\nrelationship of subject and object; self and world), consider the process by which these\nconcepts themselves are developed. It is an examination of the being of metaphysics in the\nterms of the doing of metaphysics.\n\n```\nReformation of Metaphysics 57\n```\n\nA detailed examination of metaphysical process (for example, as written in this essay)\nbegins with a consideration of the relationship between being and doing. Eventually, this\nrelationship itself is defined as a being, a being which is then (by inseparability) related to\na doing. For example, epistemology can be considered as a theory about the nature of\ntheory, including itself among the theories to be so considered. At this point, the\nrelationship between the being of relationship and the doing of relationship may itself be\nconsidered as a being, which again is related to a doing. This process of regress proceeds\nthrough multiple levels of consideration until it is realized that the dynamics of explanation\nat a given meta level are exactly isomorphic (the same as) the dynamics of explanation at\na previous meta level. In actual practice of meta-theorization, there is a point at which the\ndescription 'wraps'; that the method of description includes a description of the method of\ndescription.\n\nThis type of regressive structure, where multiple levels of meta-consideration are\ninvolved, is inherent in the nature of process, and it occurs frequently. Comparison can be\na comparison of comparisons, which are themselves comparison of comparisons, etc, etc.\nThere is a common mutual reciprocity between doing, being, and the relationship between\nthem (the concept of comparison can easily hold all three roles in succession). Insofar as\nthis relationship is known to be basic and inherent in the nature of process itself (the doing\nand being of truth; a being of sameness across multiple levels of consideration), it also is\nconsidered to be an Axiom of this metaphysics:\n\n```\nAxiom II: The concepts of being, doing, and relationship undergo a definite sequence\nand progression of transitions when moving from one level of meta-consideration to the\nnext; this sequence forms a closed ring of exactly three such steps.\n```\n\nThe manner in which the Axioms are described here can be further refined by additional\nprogressive applications of these concepts to themselves and to other domains of\nconsideration (extending the space of examples). Insofar as the dynamics of the Axioms\nare themselves directly tied into the nature of both epistemology and ontology, the Axioms\nthemselves have a direct epistemological and ontological status. Insofar as it is not\npossible to not involve the three Axioms in all process (doing) and being (relationship)\nthey are necessarily considered to be 'Absolute Truth' as the basis inherent to the nature\nand consideration of truth itself. As such, these Axioms form the most basic level of the\nmetaphysical consideration and description of the nature of the relationship between self\nand reality.\n\n58 Meaning of the Modalities\n\n## The Meaning of the Modalities\n\n#### Introduction\n\nThis essay will present metaphorical and connotative descriptions of the modalities.\nAlthough such general purpose descriptions of each of the modalities are inherently\nimprecise, they are helpful in gaining an initial understanding of the typical usage of each\nmodality. These metaphors and common language descriptions can be used to gain deeper\ninsight into the more abstract meanings and patterns of relationships inherent in each\n\n#### modality. On the Refinement of Modality Semantics\n\nThroughout most of the IDM metaphysics, these particular terms -- omniscient, immanent,\ntranscendent -- are used in somewhat nonstandard ways. They each have special meanings\nand semantic qualities in addition to those more commonly assumed. Further, their usage\nis specific to their roles.\n\nThe terms for the three modalities were chosen from the whole of the English language\ndue to the fact that these three words happen to have connotations fairly similar to those\nultimately required by the Axioms. Because they are each 'semantically near' to the\nnecessary meaning, they were 'borrowed' and then recast with new meanings.\n\nThis policy of using existing language terms and then recasting and refining their meanings\nhas significant advantages, despite the inherent risk of additional confusion. Coining\ncompletely new terms would have made much of the IDM metaphysics more difficult to\nunderstand. By using terms which are near approximations to the required meanings, the\nreader may at least gain some initial understanding of what is intended by the author.\nThen, as understanding develops with additional exposure, the meanings of the modal\nterms will take on additional refinements.\n\nTo help dispel some of this potential confusion, this essay will consider the conventional\nusage and definitions of the three modality terms, (as found in most dictionaries), and\ncompare these to their usage in the IDM metaphysics.\n\n```\nMeaning of the Modalities 59\n```\n\n#### The Semantics of the Immanent Modality\n\nWithin common dictionaries, one may find these two definitions.\n\n```\nImmanent: As existing or remaining within. As present throughout the universe.\n```\n\n```\nImminent: As about to occur; impending.\n```\n\nThe term immanent as used within the IDM metaphysics takes something of the meaning\nof both of the terms 'immanent' and 'imminent' as defined above. In that the concepts of\nrelation and interaction are inherent within all events, there is a strong correspondence to\nthe conventional meaning of 'immanent'. To the degree that 'that which is of experience'\n(itself a process of interaction) involves an infinitely small duration of time, or is a\nreference to that which is in one's immediate experience in the here and now, the IDM use\nof the term immanent strongly corresponds to the meaning of 'imminent'.\n\nThe metaphysics adds to these conventional meanings the idea of the immanent as being a\ndefining concept (i.e., as a basis of definition) when considered in the sense of being (i.e.,\nas when used in theory), and as central when a part of a process (i.e., the action of doing).\n\nThe term immanent is often used to refer to that which is immediate and intrinsic in one's\nown perception or expression. The immanent reflects a sense of being within a world, as a\nparticipant, and of experiencing it directly in first person terms. The immanent modality is\noften used to connote the simplest possible concept of interaction or of relation between\nself and a world (i.e., either a dreaming or 'waking' world/reality). The idea of the basic\n\"here and now experience\" (or expression) between self and reality is generally regarded\nas immanent modal, the emphasis being upon the concepts of 'basic' and of the absolute\nimmediacy of time.\n\nThe concept of the immanent often is used to refer to the center of a continuum,\ncoordinate system, or transformation. Immanent descriptions start with what is most\nknown, and move towards that which is most unknown (i.e., things that are very small or\nvery far away). The quality of knowing (and of understanding) is itself often considered to\nbe of an immanent modal character.\n\n60 Meaning of the Modalities\n\n#### The Semantics of the Omniscient Modality\n\nWithin common dictionaries, one may find something similar to this definition for the term\n'omniscient'.\n\n```\nOmniscient: As having total knowledge; knowing everything.\nAs a referent to the quality of having infinite knowledge.\n```\n\nThe redefinition of the term 'omniscient' is consistent with the original meaning in that one\nis indeed \"all knowing\" when perceiving a domain from a frame of reference that is\nexternal to it. In the metaphor of the photograph for example, one can see the entire photo\nat once, and thus has total and complete knowledge of the image that is the photograph.\nAs another example, if one were to have the perspective of a god, as used in western\nreligious theology, one would be able to see, and have access to, this entire reality \"at\nonce\". This would be perspective, and therefore a knowing that is omniscient. The central\naspect that allows this type of knowing is the difference in frames of reference.\n\nThe term omniscient carries the connotation of a point of view which includes all of the\ndomain viewed, where the perceiver is not (a part of/in interaction with) the thing(s) so\nperceived. A perception/description of any thing is omniscient modal when it is defined in\nterms of structure and when it has an external viewpoint. The action of description,\nnaming, explanation, etc., are all omniscient activities. For example, the classical scientific\nperspective is a largely omniscient perspective. The theories of science are often posited in\nomniscient descriptions and explanations (i.e., as the formulations of science).\n\nAnother example of the omniscient is found in the religious idea of a deity (God) that\ncreated the world. To say \"god has made and has total control over this world\" is to assert\nan omniscient 'God' in relation to this world. Also, any concept of deity that created the\nworld and departed, (i.e., that god is not still here creating this moment), is an omniscient\nconcept of theology.\n\nThe term omniscient carries the connotation of something that is considered without time,\nand has fixed form/ structure. For example, a photograph is a perception of something in\nan omniscient manner, as the content of a photograph is considered unchanging. The\nthings and events in the photograph are timeless.\n\nOmniscient relations typically have only matter and space (static structural) components.\n\nOmniscient descriptions begin with the largest scales and tend towards the unit size (i.e., a\nmovement from the macroscopic to the microscopic boundaries of the domain).\nOmniscient systems are defined externally to themselves.\n\nAny statement that defines the relationship between two specific/particular things (things\nwhich are not of the self of the observer), or that applies in a well defined context, is a\nstatement of the omniscient mode. (Note: The qualifier of 'distinct specification' is\nimportant to this association).\n\n```\nMeaning of the Modalities 61\n```\n\n#### The Semantics of the Transcendent Modality\n\nWithin common dictionaries, one may find definitions, and aspects of definitions, similar\nto these found for the term 'transcendent'.\n\n```\nTranscendent:\nAs to exist above or independently of (material experience of the universe).\nTo rise above or across; surpass, exceed.\nAs designating knowledge that is beyond the limits of experience.\nAs that which is concerned with the a-priori or intuitive basis of knowledge.\nAs asserting a fundamental irrationality or supernatural element in experience.\nAs a referent to that which is above and beyond the ordinary experience.\n```\n\n```\nTranscendent (as used in mathematics):\n```\n\n```\nAs not capable of being determined by any combination of a finite number of\nequations with rational number coefficients. As not expressible as an integer or\nquotient of integers.\n```\n\nEach of these definitions of transcendent carries the connotation of being outside or\ncompletely removed from the frame of reference that is one's given world. In this respect,\nthe IDM usage of the term 'transcendent' is consistent with the original meaning in that it\nrefers to any relation mode where the context of the relation is completely outside of the\nframe of reference that defines the domain. These relations are not experiential (that\nwould be immanent) but are beyond the consideration of the experiential altogether, not\nbeing dependent upon the frames of reference that they connect.\n\nWithin the IDM metaphysics, the term transcendent carries the connotation of situations\nwhere a relation has no time or space components at all, but is based upon other measures\nof similarity and difference altogether. A transcendent relationship is one that has \"no\nposition\" or no specific point of reference or context. For example, a statement that is\n\"true\" at all locations is a transcendent statement. Other examples of \"transcendent type\"\nrelationships include the relation between the position of the hardware and the position of\nthe software in the \"same\" computer. The structure that exists in a transcendent\nrelationship is completely \"from the inside towards the outside\", or from the microscopic\ndomain boundary towards the \"unit size\" (and/or the macroscopic domain boundary) of\nthe domain. Transcendent systems are defined internally to themselves and have no\nexternal structure.\n\nTranscendent relations have typically only possibility and probability (or pure strength\ntype) components.\n\nThe traditional concept of transcendence does not just mean moving into another\n'dimension', but rather to getting outside of a given frame of reference altogether.\n\n62 Meaning of the Modalities\n\n#### A Computer Science Metaphor\n\nFor an example of something of the nature of the transcendent modality as used within the\nIDM metaphysics, consider the relationship between a typical computer program and\nsome component of the hardware of the computer.\n\nConsider that from the perspective of the software, the hardware has no locus, no position.\nA programmer does not find physical transistors in the data and files representing the\nprogram logic. Where the hardware is invisible to the program, and yet supports it \"at all\npoints\" the relation to the program to the hardware is effectively transcendent, as viewed\nfrom the perspective of the program code.\n\nAdditionally, from the point of view of the hardware, the \"location\" of the software is\nsimilarly in-specific and invisible. This concept of having no relative position in time or\nspace, (i.e., of being another frame of reference altogether), is characteristic of the\ntranscendent modality.\n\nThe fact of having no common relative position is not to say, however, that the software\nand the hardware of a computer are completely independent. The program code\naffects/determines the connectivity and state of the hardware, and the hardware\nimplements the software. A change of state in the hardware can definitely affect the state\nof the software (for example, if one were to turn the computer power off). This relation of\ntwo domains, one of software and one of hardware, is said to be one of conjugation.\n\nAdditionally, neither one completely controls the other; there is an interdependence of\ncausality. The software does not completely determine the state of the hardware, and the\nstate of the hardware does not completely define (at the level of description native to the\nsoftware) the internal state of the software.\n\nIn that both hardware and software descriptions must be used to characterize the whole\nsystem, each has an equal \"degree of realness\" associated with it. They are both worlds\nunto themselves, and the being of one world does not exclude the internal reality of the\nother.\n\nAll of these aspects of the relationship between software and hardware are characteristic\nof the transcendent modality as used within the IDM metaphysics.\n\n```\nMeaning of the Modalities 63\n```\n\n#### A Photographic Metaphor\n\nInsofar as the IDM metaphysics is an inquiry into the relationship between the self and the\nworld, the modalities of the IDM metaphysics refer to the various types of relationship\nthat selves can be in with respect to their worlds. As such, the three modalities are\nessentially 'names' of basic relationship types.\n\nConsider, for a moment, the sorts or types of relationships involved in looking at a\nphotograph. Imagine, for example, that one had a picture of two people sitting on a beach.\n\nThe relationship between the viewer and the photograph, as an object in the hand, is an\nimmanent one, in the frame of reference of the the viewer.\n\nThe frame of reference of the person holding the photograph is different than the frame of\nreference the photo depicts. For example, a person depicted within a photograph cannot\n\"see\" the person viewing the photo. One cannot see those people who will later be looking\nat the photo when the photo is taken. Insofar as the viewer has a \"position\" that is external\nto the frame of reference depicted within the photograph, the viewer is in an omniscient\nmodal relationship to the depicted contents of the photograph.\n\nAdditionally, the structure depicted by the photograph, i.e. its frame of reference and\neverything within it, is defined from the outside only, by the material of the photograph\nitself. This structure is completely determined/specified, is fixed and static, and has no\nvector of time. These situational attributes typically characterize the omniscient modality.\n\nThe relation between the viewer and the photograph itself is an immanent mode relation.\nThe relation between the viewer and someone depicted within the photograph is an\nomniscient mode relation. Note however, that the relation between someone within the\nphotograph and someone else who is also within the photograph is an immanent mode\nrelation.\n\nImagine that there is another/additional photograph of the same scene, taken from a\ndifferent position (i.e., that there were two photographers that day). For a moment,\nimagine that there is one photograph in each hand, and that one can see both of them at\nonce. The relation of the sameness of someone depicted within the first photograph to\nsomeone depicted within the second photograph would be a transcendent modal relation.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. However, a caution in thinking in this way is that, by Axiom I, the immanent mode defines both the\n   omniscient and the transcendent modes relative to the immanent. If the omniscient was totally fixed structure\n   (as pure stasis), and the transcendent is total absence of structure (or pure dynamism), and these were\n   considered as extreme end points of a single continuum with the immanent in the middle (as the origin), then\n   the origin would define the end points, and not the other way around (as one would ordinarily assume).\n\n64 Meaning of the Modalities\n\nThe relations between two photographs are determined by the content of these\nphotographs only, (i.e., they do not depend on the particular context of the photographs,\nwhere they happen to be, etc). There is no specific frame of reference defined between\nthe photos, for it makes no difference how far or near the actual photos may be (in the\nframe of reference of the viewer). As such, there is no structure, specification, or vector of\nspace necessarily \"including\" both photographs at all; any such context is purely dynamic.\nThese situational attributes characterize the transcendent modality.\n\nOne could think of the relations between the self and the photograph (the immanent\n\nmode) as being a mixture of the transcendent and the omniscient^1. One's relation (i.e.\nperceptual interaction) to any given photograph has both time and space type vectors.\nSuch a relation contains elements of both staticism (it remains the same photo) and\ndynamism (no photograph lasts forever), and has both context (one cannot view a\nphotograph in the dark) and content (a blank photograph is not worth looking at)\ndependencies. The structure of the relations is only partially specified and has some\nlatitude for change, depending on the purposes of the viewer.\n\n#### A Dream of the Modalities\n\nTo deeply understand the nature of the three modal concepts as used in the IDM\nmetaphysics, it is especially helpful to consider the process of dreaming, as a metaphor.\nThis process of dreaming is something which everyone experiences, and as such, provides\na common semantic basis for the understanding of metaphysics. However, in that the\nnature of one's dreaming is intensely personal, there is something of this metaphor which\nextends beyond the merely metaphorical. The nature of the modalities as expressed here is\nabout one's very being, and thus immediately applies in a totally literal and individual\nsense. As such, rather than just reading this essay as a metaphor to understand the\nsemantics of the three modalities, one may also recognize that this describes an entry point\nfor the application of metaphysics directly to one's own actual life.\n\n```\nMeaning of the Modalities 65\n```\n\nThere are three perspectives, or ways of experiencing, one's dreams:\n\n```\nThe first perspective is that of the dreaming person, the one who experiences the dream\ndirectly, living within it. Within the IDM metaphysics, this way of\nexperiencing/perceiving is called an immanent modal relationship between the dreamer\nand the dream.\n```\n\n```\nThe second perspective is that of the dreamer, the one who 'created' the dream, and is\nstanding outside of it. For example, consider a daydream: The aspect of the person who\nfeels that they are 'in control' of everything (all events) that occurs in/within/with the\ndaydream^1. This aspect of self is the one who knows for sure what is going to happen\nnext, and may attempt to awaken the self from dreaming if that outcome is not liked.\nThe IDM metaphysics defines this all knowing or controlling aspect of self as being or\noperating in the omniscient modality with respect to the dream.\n```\n\n```\nThe third perspective is that of the 'awake self' who remembers the dream the next\nmorning. This aspect of self stands apart from both the dreaming aspect of the self, and\ndreamer/creator aspect of the self. When one remembers a dream in the morning, one\nusually remembers from the perspective of the dreaming self, rather than that of the\ndreamer self. However, if the dream had been especially lucid, then the person\nremembering the dream in the morning will have a memory in the omniscient\nperspective as well (usually combined with the immanent perspective). Note, however,\nthat the perspective of the person remembering the dream is neither that of the\ndreamer, nor the dreamed. The IDM metaphysics refers to this third perspective or\naspect of self as being/operating in a transcendent modality.\n```\n\nRelations between selves and worlds have intrinsic aspects and modes. Any given self can\nhave, or be in, any one of the three modes, (relative to the framework of a given world/\ndomain) depending on the point of view (relation) of the self. In the IDM metaphysics,\nthese aspects have been classified into three types and given a specific modality\nterminology. All three modes are always present.\n\nAs an example of the use of these perceptual modes consider the process of daydreaming.\nPart of the self is creating the daydream and \"controls\" all that goes on within (one has the\nfreedom to imagine whatever they want). This overseer is the omniscient fraction of self.\nThe part of self that is within the daydream as a character or participant (in full dreaming\none experiences that reality) is the immanent fraction of self. The part of self that may\nremember \"other\" daydreams and sees the connections between these, that has an\nexperience of both the waking world and the dreaming world, is the transcendent fraction\nof self. All three fractions together compose the \"complete self\", which straddles all three\nof these characteristics.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. In a similar manner, the conventional description of \"A God who watches and creates everything in this\n   reality\" is a classic description of a 'self' operating in the omniscient mode with respect to this domain or\n   reality. It is especially interesting to note that both of these examples are valid comparisons to dreams under\n   the Domain Continuum Hypothesis (that domains differ only in degree, never in essence).\n\n66 Meaning of the Modalities\n\n#### The Modalities of Imagination\n\nAs another metaphor, consider the act of imagination in the statement \"One (can) imagine\noneself imagining what is imagined\". Note that some form of the word \"imagine\" is used\nthree times, in three different ways.\n\nIn imagination, there are three distinct levels of experiencing referred to: 1) the passive\nexperience of oneself imagining that one can or does imagine something/anything, 2) the\nactive experience of oneself imagining something, and 3) the passive experience of\nwhatever content is 'actually' imagined.\n\nEach of these levels of experience is always implicit in a/any/the/all acts of imagination,\nregardless of who is imagining or what is being imagined, or even when/where this\naction/event occurs. Each of the three represents an instance of a modality of the IDM\nmetaphysics.\n\nThe first experience of imagining is the perspective of the transcendent mode. It posits the\npossibility of a class of possible imagination actions/events. This is the perspective of the\nperson who is common to, and yet apart from, all imaginative acts. It may, for example,\nrepresent the aspect of self currently in the action of reading this paragraph now.\n\nThe second experience of imagining is the perspective of the omniscient mode, which\nrepresents an instance of actualities. It is the part of self which is active in the process of\nimagination itself. It is the part that \"does\" the event of imagination.\n\nThe third experience of imagining is the immanent perspective, which experiences the\ncontent of whatever is imagined in any given event of imagination.\n\nIn all acts of imagination, these three modes, experiences, and aspects are inherent,\nintrinsic, and inseparable from the process/event of imagination itself.\n\nNote that an aspect of this metaphor is the implicit idea that the modes are not places or\nthings. The modes are ways of seeing and are not 'things' in themselves. There is no 'thing'\nor 'place' or 'self' that is 'the transcendent' for example.\n\nAlso, none of the modalities ever occur in isolation. One can always shift the perspective\nto change the mode of any relation. Returning to the dreaming metaphor for a moment,\nwhile it is true that with respect to the 'awake self' within this Earth Object domain the\ndomain of dream is transcendent, it is also true that with respect to the 'dreaming self'\nwithin the dream domain, the waking reality is transcendent. This relativity is inherent in\nthe specifications of the modalities, and is often considered in terms of a conjugation as\ndescribed by Axiom I.\n\n```\nMeaning of the Modalities 67\n```\n\n#### An Optical Metaphor for the Modalities\n\nConsider an arrangement where one may in one hand hold a photograph and in the other\nhold a modern hologram. Although both represent images, the nature and applications of\neach is very different.\n\nTo demonstrate this difference, consider, for example, what would happen to the seen\nimage were each to be cut in half and discarded. The photograph, as expected, would\nshow only part of the original image. The remaining part, would suffer no loss of detail.\nThe hologram, in contrast, would continue to show the whole image (albeit distorted to\nmatch the new frame shape), but there would be some loss of detail. The hologram image\nwould seem a bit more fuzzy. In effect, the photograph lost macroscopic structure and\nretained the microscopic, whereas the hologram lost microscopic detail but retained\nmacroscopic structure.\n\nIn terms of the modalities, the photograph has the nature of the omniscient. The hologram\nhas the nature of the transcendent. The light used to view each of these, has the nature of\nthe immanent. In the sense that both the hologram and the photograph are complexes, the\nlight used to view them is structurally simple. For the photograph, light, through the\nagency of a lens, has point source and point destination (i.e., simple structurelessness).\nThis is similar to the use of a laser for the making of a hologram, which is also\nstructureless (in color as well as in origin). These three -- light, photographic\nrepresentation, and holographic representation -- make good examples of the natures of\n\n#### the modalities immanent, omniscient, and transcendent, respectively. Identifying\n\n#### Modality Correspondences\n\nTo effectively identify those concepts which are the modes of an arbitrarily given domain,\nit is necessary to establish that the selected concepts are exactly essential to that domain\n(i.e., to have selected the correct number or quantity of concept), and that well developed\n(tested) role correspondences have been observed for each (i.e., to have selected the\ncorrect quality of concept).\n\nOften this is a process of iterative trial and error, where conceptual aspects of a given\ndomain are abstracted and tested against the modal templates for a good fit. To show\ncorrectness, each of the abstracted concepts needs to be demonstrated as being necessary\nto any possible consideration of the domain, and that the three concepts together are\nsufficient for any such consideration (being careful to have well scoped domains). Then,\nthe role of each of the concepts with respect to the other two is considered in detail,\nparticularly as they are used in careful (complete) descriptions of the process of the\ndomain being considered. Where both the implicit connotations and strict lexical\nformulation of all such descriptive statements remain correct when substituting instances\nof terms of equivalent modality for some other domain, then the modalities of each of the\nthree domain essential terms is said to be well associated.\n\n68 Meaning of the Modalities\n\nUltimately, it is the Axioms which define and distinguish the modalities, even while the\nAxioms are best described in the terms of the modalities. To consider the (meaning of)\nAxioms as being defined/described in terms of (the meaning of) the modalities is the\npractice of theory. To consider the Axioms as defining/describing (the meaning of) the\nmodalities is the theory of practice. To know and understand the IDM metaphysics\nrequires both the practice of theory and the theory of practice.\n\nThe Theory of Practice :\n\n```\nAxiom III (as the being of Foundational Triplication) is an assertion that there are three\nmodalities, or three terms/concepts, which together subsume the essence of a domain,\nand which fill (or have) the roles of the modalities of immanent, omniscient, and\ntranscendent. Axiom III does not in itself identify which domain essential concept is\nassociated with which modality, but only that such associations are always strongly\ndefinable.\n```\n\n```\nAxiom I (as the essence of the Practice of Theory) distinguishes the immanent modality\nfrom the omniscient and transcendent modalities. The immanent modality is that term\nwhich (in a context which is both objective and non-temporal) is used as the necessary\nbasis for the definition/description of both the omniscient and the transcendent terms,\nand/or that which can only be (completely/accurately) defined/described in terms of\nboth the omniscient and the transcendent terms. Axiom I has the effect of\nnaming/identifying the term with an immanent modal association, even though it does\nnot identify which of the two remaining terms are to be associated with the omniscient\nand transcendent modalities.\n```\n\n```\nAxiom II (as the essence of the Theory of Practice) distinguishes the omniscient\nmodality from the transcendent modality. The omniscient modal term is identified by\nbeing that term which in practice (in a context which is both subjective and temporal)\nnecessarily follows from the being of the term with an immanent modal association\n(that term already identified by Axiom I). The transcendent modal term is identified by\nbeing that term which in practice necessarily precedes the being of the term with an\nimmanent modal association.\n```\n\n```\nMeaning of the Modalities 69\n```\n\nPresuming that the three essential foundation concepts of a domain have already been\nresolved and identified into three named concepts, the modal class of each of the domain\npredicates may be identified by a close match to the structure of the usage (and relations)\nof that concept with that of the generic modality. For each modality, the pattern of usage\nwill typically be some analogue of what follows:.\n\n```\nAn immanent modal concept is that concept which, in the context of theory, has the\nrole of either defining both of the other two concepts, or which can only be fully\ndefined by statements in terms of both of the other two concepts in a theoretical/model\ncontext domain external to the domain so described and modeled.\nIn the context of practice , the immanent modality will be that aspect of all instances of\nthe domain fundamental dynamic which subjectively follows (in time) the occurrence\nof a transcendental aspect and which precedes an omniscient aspect.\nIn the context of metaphysics, the immanent modal concept will be the one which has a\npattern of the structure of its relations which most closely match that of Axiom II.\n```\n\n```\nAn omniscient modal concept is that concept which, in the context of theory, has the\nrole of referring to that which is a (known/necessary) static (fixed) consequent to/of a\nclass of the processes described by, or referred to by, the immanent modal concept in\nthe action context of process within a domain.\nIn the context of practice , the omniscient modality will be that aspect of all instances\nof the domain fundamental dynamic which subjectively follows (in time) the\noccurrence of an immanent aspect and which precedes a transcendent aspect.\nIn the context of metaphysics, the omniscient modal concept will be the one which has\na pattern of the structure of its relations which most closely match that of Axiom I.\n```\n\n```\nA transcendent modal concept is that concept which, in the context of theory, has the\nrole of referring to the (unspecified or incompletely specified) class of implicit\nassumptions/process which is/are a necessary precondition(s) to the class of processes\ndescribed by, or referred to by, the immanent modal concept in the action context of\nprocess within a domain.\nIn the context of practice , the transcendent modality will be that aspect of all instances\nof the domain fundamental dynamic which subjectively follows (in time) the\noccurrence of an omniscient aspect and which precedes an immanent aspect.\nIn the context of metaphysics, the transcendent modal concept will be the one which\nhas a pattern of the structure of its relations which most closely match that of Axiom\nIII.\n```\n\n70 Meaning of the Modalities\n\nThe Practice of Theory : The modal types for domain predicates can (usually) also be\nidentified with a construction by analogy (type isomorphism). When a series of common\nsemantic relations are established between the basic predicates of one domain to the\nfundamental predicates of other domains (which have known and well established modal\ncorrespondences) the modality correspondences may be identified by their common\nimplications.\n\nThe degree of confidence (the strength associated with the technique of establishing\ntransitive modal correspondences) is in proportion to the product of the number,\ndifference, and degree of the domains mutually corresponded.\n\nMore specifically, the degree of confidence in any given allocation of modal roles to\n(presumed) domain essential concepts is defined as the integral of the product of the\ndegree of correctness of both the connotative and formulaic aspects of domain descriptive\nstatements (in terms of those essential concepts), across all possible instances of modal\nisomorphic substitutions of those essential concepts, and the relative degree of\ndissimilarity of the domain which provides these substituting instances.\n\nThe total degree of the semantic resolution of the meaning of the pure modal concepts\nthemselves, (and also the total degree of confidence in all other developed (domain) modal\ncorrespondences), is considered to be (very strongly) proportional to the total number of\nidentified correspondences between the identified three domain essential concepts and the\nthree modalities.\n\n```\nNature of Objectivity 71\n```\n\n## On the Nature of Objectivity\n\n#### Abstract\n\nThis essay is an expansion and explanation of the meaning of the term objectivity. It is\npossible to comprehensively define the term 'objectivity' (and its usage) purely in terms of\nthe concepts of interaction/comparison.\n\nIn defining objectivity, this essay specifies a comprehensive criterion for the phrase\n'objective reality' that is general to all domains. In this way, the following specification\nprovides a template for the establishment of 'what is reality' in a way that resolves the\nformal nature of the 'subjective' to 'objective' split identified in conventional\ninterpretations of the mind body problem.\n\n#### The Three Rings of Verification\n\nTo consider metaphysics is to consider the question \"What is the relation between 'the\nworld out there' and my experience of it?\". A core aspect of the question is \"what is\nrequired in one's subjective experience for one to regard something as objective, and\ntherefore as being 'real' and external to one's perceptions of it?\". In answering this latter\nquestion, (and in this way, providing some clarity about what is considered 'real'), the\nfollowing three (subjective) metrics (aspects of all experience) are to be considered.\n\nThe Three Rings of Verification :\n\n```\nThe degree of the 'intensity': the intensity of one's experience relative to other\nexperiences of the self.\n```\n\n```\nThe degree of 'consistency': the degree that aspects of the experience can be formed\ninto 'closed consistent rings'.\n```\n\n```\nThe degree of 'novelty': the degree that the experience is potentially surprising,\nunpredictable, or novel relative to all the subjectively prior experiences of the self.\n```\n\n72 Nature of Objectivity\n\nThe first component, intensity, (called the first ring of verification), identifies the necessity\nof at least some subjective experience and interaction for something to be regarded as\nobjective.\n\nFor example, if one were to simply declare that one has an imaginary friend named Fred,\nothers would have very little reason to believe in the 'reality of Fred' because their only\ninteraction and knowledge of Fred is via the claim of only one person. In this example, if\none cannot see, hear, touch, smell, or detect Fred using any ordinary senses, then the\n'degree of impingement' of 'Fred' upon one's 'total subjective experience' consists of only a\n\nstatement of claim and an awareness of the claimant^1.\n\nNote that another's perception of Fred is not completely absent, but is very indirect. In\neffect, the claimant may (apparently) see Fred, and then tell others. In that anyone else\nwould have no direct perception aside from the claim of perception, the perception of\nFred is indirect, and dependent on a trust in the assertion of the claimant.\n\nIn a similar manner that the perception of Fred is in doubt, the attempt to express\nsomething to Fred would also be in doubt. How could one know that Fred was ever aware\nof anything expressed towards him? In these circumstances, the sum of 'all interactions' of\noneself and Fred would have a very low apparent degree of intensity. Low intensity\nequates to 'not very real'.\n\nFor sake of explanation, consider how the situation would be different if one could\npersonally interact (see, touch, smell, hear, and converse) with Fred (i.e. by being in a\nsuggestible state, under hypnosis, taking drugs, etc.). If one were to 'see' Fred often, (i.e.\nthat the frequency of contact was high), or if Fred was somehow especially obvious in\nones experience (by being very nearby, yelling loudly, etc., i.e. that the density of contact\nin sensory channels was high), then the intensity of the experience would be quite large\n(as compared to the total intensity of all other subjective experiences). As a marked\n'hallucination', Fred would be considered more 'real' due to the more direct nature of one's\nexperience.\n\nAs may be remarked, this first requirement for something to be considered as objectively\nreal is not enough, by itself. To this degree, Fred as described to this point is still only an\nillusion, perhaps merely a hallucination, that only one person can see. To have some sense\nof contact, interaction, or perception is necessary, but it is not sufficient to consider\nsomething as objectively real.\n\n---\n\n1 In the example using Fred, the author is not attempting in this essay to discuss 'selves', 'minds', or\n'consciousness'. While all of these are concepts that one would naturally associate with 'human people' (Fred),\nthe example is intended only to introduce and describe the deeper metaphysical implications of the concept of\nobjectivity. It is not necessary to consider the concept of objectivity in 'human' or 'personality' terms at all, for\nthe concept of objectivity has a deeper basis than that which would be found in any particular type of self or\nreality (world). Concepts associated with mind and human consciousness are described in their own terms\nelsewhere in the IDM metaphysics.\n\n```\nNature of Objectivity 73\n```\n\nIn summary, objectivity (the reality of something in a world of experience) is in part\ndefined in terms of the degree of the intensity of interaction. Intensity is a function of the\nfrequency of interaction, (the number of incidences of a perception per unit of subjective\ntime), and the density of interaction, (the number of sensory channels affected, and the\nsubjective degree/completeness to which each channel is affected). An intensity of\nexperience is necessary, but not sufficient, (as the first criterion) for something to be\nconsidered objectively real.\n\nThe second component, consistency, (called the second ring of verification), identifies the\nnecessity of some type of 'closed rings' through which all interactions are consistent.\n\nIn continuation of the example above, to hear Fred say something, and then to ask what\nsomeone else heard Fred say, and they described essentially the same statement, then one\nwould feel fairly confident that even though Fred may be a hallucination, at least it was a\nshared hallucination. There is a ring (triangle) of consistent interactions between Fred and\noneself, Fred and another, and that other and oneself. If there were several other people\npresent, and they all reported the same things about Fred, then the 'degree of consensus\nreality' increases in proportion to the number of closed and consistent rings of interactions\nthat are so formed (one for every active triple of people present).\n\nFurthermore, the 'type' or 'size' of the rings is also important. For example, a photograph of\nFred forms a triangle of consistent comparisons of experience between the camera's view\nof Fred and one's own view of the camera, and one's own view of Fred. A larger degree of\n'reality' is conferred upon Fred by a photograph due to the larger amount of information in\neach visual experience that is consistently matched (which is much larger than the\ninformation content found in the simpler linguistic statements that one may hear others\nmake).\n\nThe triangle/ring of comparisons formed with a photograph also cross time as much as\nthey cross space. A photograph represents Fred 'as he was' at the time the picture was\ntaken. This can then later be compared to Fred 'as he is now'. In part, the\npermanence/reality of Fred is in proportion to the amount of subjective time between\n'when the photograph was taken' and 'when one presently sees Fred'.\n\nIn summary, greater degrees of objectivity are proportional to the size of the closed rings\nof interaction (in either time or space), the number of component interactions (the amount\nof information) in each ring, the number of such consistent interaction rings which are\nformed, and the degree of diversity (the number of different types) of the rings formed\n(i.e. a set of interaction rings encompassing many levels and channels of perception are\npreferred over a set that has only a few different types of interaction). Each of these\naspects/proportions (singly and together) is also necessary, but not sufficient, to regarding\nsomething as objective.\n\n74 Nature of Objectivity\n\nThe third component, novelty, (called the third ring of verification), identifies the\nnecessity of some type of inherent unpredictability (surprise) in all that is to be considered\nobjective (a part of the world, and not a part of oneself).\n\nIn continuation of the example above, if Fred did nothing that one did not expect, then\nthere would be little reason to suppose that Fred was not something in the direct control of\none's own mind. For example, if Fred exhibits no novel behavior, makes no decisions of\nhis own, performs no creative or unpredictable actions, develops no self determined\nproperties (such as personality) that one could not have predicted beforehand, and if one\nalways and already knew what 'Fred was going to do', then there would be no reason to\nregard Fred as not being some aspect of one's own subjective being. If the state of one's\nown knowingness of 'Fred' is so complete, how would one know that Fred was not\nexternal to oneself at all?\n\nIn part, the root meaning of 'to be objective' is to assert \"whatever that thing is, it is not a\npart of oneself\". Therefore, it is also a requirement that Fred' must exhibit aspects of\nbeing, behavior, and properties (details) that oneself cannot, and could not have predicted,\nexpected, or otherwise known in advance. Fred has to do (and be) things that one did not\nexpect, for one to have a sense of 'otherness' in connection to Fred. Otherwise one would\nnot know Fred as a being not a part of oneself.\n\nNovel and unpredictable behavior is a necessary criterion to distinguish 'reality' from 'a\nsimulation of reality'. To declare that there is something independent of one's own mind is\nto ascribe to it properties and characteristics that are not of one's self, in order to make it\ndifferent than the self.\n\nFor example, the properties of a rock must be discovered, and not created, if the rock is to\nbe considered a part of 'reality'. If the self determines or specifies (i.e. by decision, choice,\ncreativity, etc.) all of the properties and characteristics of a rock (i.e. its color, weight, fine\nsurface details, etc.), then that rock is imagined, a part of a dream, and not objective at all.\nA real rock must have properties and aspects that are somehow determined by the rock\nitself, regardless of what one may wish, expect, or choose.\n\nSurprise is a function of the difference of expectation and realization. The degree of\nsurprise is the (multiplicative) product of the degree of expectation and the degree of\nrealization. One must both have an expectation (i.e. as a prediction of a subjective\nexperience anticipated in the 'future' of the self), and some manifest realization in\nexperience (that can be compared to one's former expectations), to determine surprise.\nWithout a degree of expectation and a degree of realization, no comparison of surprise is\npossible.\n\n```\nNature of Objectivity 75\n```\n\nIf Fred's actions are somewhat unpredictable, exhibiting personality characteristics of his\nown (characteristics that one cannot see the origins of), then Fred is to be regarded as an\n'independent being', inherently separate from self.\n\nAny novel behavior and properties (which are not self determined) contribute to an\n'objective external independent reality' of that 'thing'. An objective something will seem\nmore real, exactly because one cannot automatically control or define it. The extent that\nsomething is not under one's own personal/subjective control (influence) is proportional to\nthe degree that it is independent of one's own personal existence.\n\nIn summary, greater degrees of objectivity are proportional to the number of surprising\ndetails, and the degree to which they are surprising/unexpected (as measured with respect\nto the expectations of a 'self'). The greater the number and diversity in these interactions,\nand the greater the degree that they seem to be defined by criterion not affected by the\nchoices of the self, the more 'real' that something will be with respect to oneself.\n\nFinally, the total degree to which something is considered 'an objective part of a world' is\nthe product of these three individual measures/degrees (rings of verification). Where any\none of these three necessary and sufficient aspects is completely absent, the degree of\n'objective reality' of the 'thing' is considered to be completely absent (i.e. as totally\nsubjective or 'not real'). Only the three together are sufficient for the concept of a\nfundamental objectivity/reality to be defined.\n\n#### Reality Via Comparisons\n\nAs a practical example of the use of the three rings of objectivity, consider the action of\nreading and writing posts to an Internet email group (a world of interaction). Consider\nwhat would be necessary to determine that some other correspondent was in fact a real\nmember of that email community (i.e., an objective part of the email list world).\n\nUnder first ring considerations, one may know that they have had some degree of\ncorrespondence (subjective interactions) with another member of the list. One can read\nposts and one can add posts to that list, (and if anyone answers or comments then one can\nknow that one has been heard as well). With respect to the totality of all information that\none can perceive using the 'sensory channel' of an Internet email box, the posts from the\nemail list constitute a definite positive nonzero percentage of all sensory input (i.e. as a\nmeasure of relative intensity).\n\nUnder second ring considerations, one can established closed 'rings of interactions' in the\nform of email posts and replies. For example, someone can quote a portion of a letter that\nthey also received from the email list and forward it back to the list, or to their own email\nbox, at which point they can compare that 'copy' with the posts that they have received\n'directly'. Correlations of this type can be extended in number where such a quoted section\npasses through many email forwardings before reaching one's own email box, (where\nseveral different people all send quoted mail from the list).\n\n76 Nature of Objectivity\n\nOne could also use another channel of interaction altogether. For example, one might call\nanother correspondent on the phone. If in listening to their discussion of the email list one\nfinds points of correspondence which are consistent with what one has oneself perceived\nabout that list, there would be strong grounds for believing that the list, (or rather the posts\nupon it), were/are real.\n\nUnder third ring considerations, one cannot (ever, even in principle) totally predict what\nanyone is going to say, or what type of response one will receive from the email list as a\nresult of one's own posts. One may expect that one will receive posts from the list, and\none's expectation may be met in the realization of posts 'actually subjectively perceived\n(i.e. read), but the potential to be surprised will always persist. The properties and\ncharacteristics of the email list are, (in the inability of oneself to know them, or determine\nthem beforehand), therefore considered to be 'external' to oneself. If everyone on the\nemail list wrote only and exactly what one expected them to say, and posted precisely\nwhen one felt that they would post, then one would begin to wonder if the computer was\nsomehow reading one's mind, or that one was dreaming, or that one was going crazy and\ntherefore hallucinating all of the posts (i.e. not seeing what is 'actually there'). Absolute\nand total precognition leads directly to a sense of unreality.\n\nConsidering that all three rings of verification are met (to varying but nonzero degrees)\none can ascribe a fairly strong degree of reality to all of the readers upon the email list,\nand to the list itself. One would hope that each of the correspondents, using similar\nconsiderations, would also regard one (as the author of posts to the list) as being a real and\n(to some extent) free and independent personality.\n\nThus, in conclusion to the above metaphor, one may assert that the three rings of\nverification do provide a coherent, complete and realistic method of defining 'the external,\nobjective, and independent reality'. Any perceptual experiences which (within systemic\ncomparisons) are consistent with the three rings are necessarily regarded as 'objective' and\n'not part of self'.\n\n```\nNature of Objectivity 77\n```\n\n#### Implications\n\nThe definition of 'objective reality' is inherently and fundamentally based upon interaction,\nin the form of perception and comparisons of perception, and is therefore partially and\nintrinsically relative to the perceiver/interactive self, even though the definition is itself\nabsolute. This method of consideration makes a strong implicit claim that it is possible to\nconsistently define objectivity in terms of interaction (i.e., as partially subjective), in a\nmanner that is coherent with the conventional assumptions associated with those terms.\n\nAlthough the above presentation of a definition of objective reality uses the terms\n'communication' or 'sensory channel' and 'self' as if these terms were well defined and\nstatic, it is not necessary to the definition of objectivity as presented here to make these\nassumptions. If the above definition were posited in terms of a 'self' that 'had' some\n'boundary of self across which sensory information flowed' then the boundary of self\nwould be a variable, and not at/in a/some fixed 'position' or locus.\n\nThe above definition, although presented in terms of this \"world\", is really general to all\npossible communication channels, subjective interactions, domains, realities, etc. In other\nwords, the above three rings of verification can be used to establish the 'reality' of\nanything, regardless if it is apparently a part of the/this 'normal physical universe'\n(whatever that means) or not. Thus, this definition, by being 'domain general', is properly a\ncomponent of a foundational metaphysics, which applies to all domains, and is therefore\nnot just a part of physics per se, as a subject applied to only 'this' domain/world. Note that\nnone of these rings required any specialized definitions of 'time', 'space', 'matter', or\n'energy' for example.\n\nFinally, where the above definition of 'objective reality' is defined in terms of the various\naspects of subjective interactions with the self, consciousness as the\ncommunication/sensory channels themselves cannot be objectively defined (something\ncannot be defined by that which it defines). The term consciousness cannot be defined in\nterms of either 'real' or 'not real' (as where one or more of the three degrees have a metric\nof exactly zero, or the 'absence/negation of reality').\n\n78 Incommensuration Theorem\n\n## Incommensuration Theorem\n\n#### Statement of the Intrinsics of Comparison\n\nWhere discussing the concept of comparison in the common usage terms (i.e., where\nholding the terms subjective and objective as implicit), it is apparent that exactly four\nother concepts are both necessary and sufficient for the formal consideration of the\nconcept of comparison. These concepts are 'sameness', 'difference', 'content', and 'context'.\nAny process of comparison involves all four of these terms as intrinsics. Where there is\ncomparison there must be sameness, difference, content, and context. No comparison can\nbe defined without implicitly making reference to all six of these concepts. As such, the\ncollection of these six abstract concepts will be hereafter referred to as 'the intrinsics of\ncomparison'.\n\n#### Concept Inseparability\n\nIn consideration of the meanings of the intrinsics of comparison, certain statements of\ninseparability are apparent. For example, it is clear that the concepts of sameness and\ndifference are inseparable. Whenever one appears, the other is implicit. Where there is\nsameness, there must also be difference. Where there is difference, there must also be\nsameness.\n\nFurther, the concepts of content and context are inseparable. Where there is content, there\nmust also be context. Where there is context there must also be content.\n\nThis inseparability of the concepts of content and context, and the concepts of sameness\nand difference, is assumed as being fundamental to, and irrevocably inherent in, all\ndiscussions of the concept of comparison, or of anything that is defined in terms of\ncomparison.\n\nWhere the above concepts of comparison, sameness, difference, content, and context, are\ninseparable, it is also clear that they are distinct concepts with distinct meanings. For\nexample, the meanings of these terms are not interchangeable in any formal statement,\nwithout changing or altering the fundamental meaning of that statement.\n\nIt is understood that similar aspects of distinctness and non-interchangeability will apply\nsimilarly to any terms that are defined in terms of these.\n\n```\nIncommensuration Theorem 79\n```\n\n#### The Mutual Applicability of the Intrinsics\n\nIt is clear that some of the intrinsic concepts of comparison are applicable to one another.\nIn particular, the concepts of sameness and difference can be applied to the concepts of\ncontent and context. Also, (the concepts of) content and context can be applied to (the\nconcepts of) sameness or difference. As it turns out, there are four primary concepts\nwhich are formed from these specific applications (i.e., as second order compounds and\nconjugations).\n\nWhere there is a sameness of subjective context, the following definitions hold about the\nobjective.\n\n```\ncontinuity is a reference to a sameness of content\nwhere there is a sameness of context,\n```\n\n```\ndiscontinuity is a reference to a difference of content\nwhere there is a sameness of context,\n```\n\n```\nsymmetry is a reference to a sameness of content\nwhere there is a difference of context,\n```\n\n```\nasymmetry is a reference to a difference of content\nwhere there is a difference of context,\n```\n\n#### On the Formation of the Tertiary Compounds\n\nClearly the concepts of symmetry and continuity are not the same, for 1) there are discrete\nand non-continuous things which are symmetric, and 2) twisted continuous things that are\nnon symmetric. For this reason, it is valid to consider the formation and inter-applicability\nof these compound concepts of the intrinsics of comparison, and their opposites, to one\nanother. However, in considering the mutual compatibility and applicability of the\nsecondary compounds to form tertiary conceptual compounds, certain conflicts become\nimmediately apparent.\n\nFor example, some of these tertiary compound candidates can be rejected since the\nduplicate application of the same concept to itself is of no semantic value. In this way four\npotential candidates are discarded from the list of potentially valid mutual applications.\n\nAnother of these conflicts concerns the mutual applicability of the types of comparison to\none another in the terms of 'opposite meanings'. Some of the pairs of these concepts are\nmutually incompatible as they are clearly opposites of one another. For example, the\nconcept of continuity with the concept of discontinuity asserts that for the same context,\nsomething is both identically the same as and identically different than itself. Clearly\nsomething (in this case content) cannot both be the same and be different in the same way\nat the same time.\n\n80 Incommensuration Theorem\n\nIn the same way that the formation of a single compound concept out of 'sameness of\ncontent' and 'difference of content' would be invalid as it violates concept distinctness (as\ndefined earlier). A compound that assumes that the context is both the same and different\nviolates distinctness. For example, it would be problematic to assert that for the same\ncontent, its context is both the same and different. Thus, there is the limitation (in the\nformation of compound concepts of the four types of comparison) that something cannot\nbe both the same and different in the same way at the same time.\n\nInsofar as there are two pairs (of the four concepts which are available) which are\nopposites to one another, then clearly they will not be mutually compatible or applicable.\nIn this way two additional potential third compound candidates can be dropped from the\nacceptable list of mutual applications. Other potential candidates will also be dropped\nwhere they violate the requirement of distinctiveness.\n\nIn addition, due to the inseparability and distinctiveness of the intrinsic concepts of\ncomparison themselves, the formation of the compounds of using these are subject to\ncertain limits. In particular, one of these limits is 1) where the concept of content appears,\nthe concept of context must appear also, and 2) where the concept of context appears, the\nconcept of content must also appear. This, however, is not a problem as the definitions of\nthe terms always ensures that there will be an even matching of a content with a context\nand a context with a content, wherever these appear.\n\nHowever, in a very similar manner (as in the immediately above paragraph), two more\ncandidates for tertiary compound concepts must be rejected. This is a more subtle\nlimitation. In the same manner that the concepts of content and context are inseparable,\nconceptually distinct, and non-interchangeable, the concepts of sameness and difference\nare also inseparable, distinct, and non-interchangeable. In particular, where the concept of\nsameness appears, the concept of difference must appear also, and vise versa. The\n'number of appearances' of each concept must match the number of appearances of its\nopposite.\n\nFortunately, all of these limitations can be accounted for fairly easily by noting that when\nany one of the concepts in each of the concept axis domains appears, its mate must appear\nalso. All that is needed to determine whether the third order compounds of the intrinsics of\ncomparisons are valid is to check that all of the concepts 'add up' or 'cancel out' under the\ninseparability relationships. In this way, the four compounds formed by the four types of\ncomparison can be checked rather readily.\n\nIn summary form, the above limitations could be organized into three basic sets: where\n[!x] indicates an invalid application to self, [!y] indicates an invalid mutual application of\nopposites, and where [!z] indicates an invalid assumption of the separability of sameness\nand difference. As such, the results of the consideration of all candidates for the formation\nof the third compounds of the intrinsics of comparison may be listed as follows.\n\n```\nIncommensuration Theorem 81\n```\n\n```\nTable of Tertiary Conjunctions:\n```\n\n```\n[!x] continuity and continuity (ss & ss)\n[!z] continuity and symmetry (ss & sd)\n[!y] continuity and discontinuity (ss & ds)\ncontinuity and asymmetry (ss & dd)\n[!x] symmetry and symmetry (sd & sd)\nsymmetry and discontinuity (sd & ds)\n[!y] symmetry and asymmetry (sd & dd)\n[!x] discontinuity and discontinuity (ds & ds)\n[!z] discontinuity and asymmetry (ds & dd)\n[!x] asymmetry and asymmetry (dd & dd)\n```\n\nFrom the above list, it is clear that there are only two remaining combinations which are\nmutually compatible; 1) continuity with asymmetry and 2) symmetry with discontinuity.\nAll other combinations are, for various reasons, incompatible with one another.\n\n#### The Incommensuration Theorem\n\nConcept inseparability and the associations as defined, require that an\neventity/comparison is either 'continuously asymmetric' OR it is 'discontinuously\nsymmetric'. An eventity/comparison cannot be 'discontinuously asymmetric' nor\n'continuously symmetric'. This constitutes the fundamental result of this essay, and is\ncalled the 'Incommensuration Theorem':\n\n```\nThe concepts of symmetry and continuity cannot both be simultaneously and\nfundamentally applied to any eventity/comparison.\n```\n\n```\nThe concepts of asymmetry and discontinuity cannot both be simultaneously and\nfundamentally applied to any eventity/comparison.\n```\n\nAny absolute application of the concept of comparison must ultimately be continuous and\nasymmetric, or symmetric and discontinuous.\n\n82 Symmetry and Continuity\n\n#### Symmetry and Continuity\n\nThe concept of symmetry is about invariance of content with transformations of context.\nTo make this abstract definition a little easier to understand, consider the following\nmetaphors and examples.\n\nConsider a black square drawn on an otherwise blank page. Imagine that the paper is now\nrotated so that the top becomes the bottom. In this transformation, flipping the square end\nover end, the context of the square has changed. Imagine the perspective of the square\nlooking out at the room. In this view, the ceiling becomes the floor and the floor becomes\nthe ceiling. The context of the square has changed, but the square remains visually\nunchanged. The content remains the same, but the context has changed.\n\nConsider the basis of any scientific theory (a knowledge of this world). The fundamental\nlaws are all derived from, and based upon, the concept of symmetry. For example, the\nscientific experiment of measuring the boiling point of water will discover that it is 100\ndegrees Celsius. The results of this experiment do not depend on whether it is done\nsomewhere in the USA or somewhere in France. It is reasonable to expect to get the same\nresult regardless of the location in which the experiment was performed. The content (the\nresult of the experiment) is the same even though the experiment is done in different\nplaces (a different context). The universality of the 'natural laws of science' is thus an\nimplication of the concept of symmetry.\n\nAs another example, consider something which is in a closed and sealed bottle for one\nday. With the passage of time, the bottle is still the bottle, and the materials inside will\nremain there. There persists the same amount of material, even though the context of time\nhas changed. This symmetry of material content in the context of time is the law of\nconservation of matter. The basic physical laws of conservation of matter and energy are\nsymmetry laws. The very dynamics of the equations that serve as the foundations of\ntechnology, are all ultimately based on concepts of symmetry.\n\nTo assert continuity is to state that an infinitesimal change in context will always and\nnecessarily result in an infinitesimal change in content. Continuity is where the content of\na change is not (is never) 'drastic' or sudden, given any arbitrarily slight change in the\ncontext. It is an assertion that changes in content are only partially sensitive to changes in\ncontext.\n\nFor example, in ordinary mathematics, a \"continuous function\" is one where the curve is\neverywhere connected to itself. A discontinuous curve refers to a function that will make\na jump from one value to another, with no intermediate steps. Such a curve is\ndisconnected. One could describe a discontinuous function by saying that there exists an\ninfinitely small region along the X axis (a sameness of context), where the value of the\nfunction (the content) changes abruptly. The ratio of change of content over change of\ncontext is infinite, indicating a break. Discontinuity is an abrupt shift of content while the\ncontext is the same.\n\n```\nSymmetry and Continuity 83\n```\n\nTo consider a continuity of self is to assert a wholeness to the self; that there is no part of\nself that is disconnected from, or rejected by, another part of self. To say that one has\ncontinuity of self is to essentially be a healthy, whole integral being.\n\nConsider the work of a therapist. The main job of the therapist is to help the patient to\nknow and accept all parts of self. A good therapist helps one to nurture and love oneself\nfully (in all aspects). This may require learning how to live well, and how to coordinate\nand balance all personal behaviors, beliefs, feelings, and attitudes. The primary job of the\ntherapist is to get one to love, nurture, and accept all aspects of oneself into an integrated\nand healthy functioning whole.\n\nConsider a phone conversation where one person abruptly, with no indication or\nforewarning, hangs up. One second, one is pleasantly involved in a conversation and in the\nnext, silence. There is no significant environmental difference between the instant when\nthe conversation was alive and the instant that it was not (i.e., the context is still much the\nsame). The infinitesimal period of time that it took for the disconnection to happen (a\nsameness of context), is not in itself different, even though the content (the conversation)\nhas shifted a lot (from being to not being).\n\nTo recognize how implicit this idea of continuity is in a culture, consider the use and\nlanguage of the many ideas deeply held within religion, mysticism, and spirituality. Some\nof the deepest values, mythos, and beliefs relate to how one connects to deity, spirit, and\nthe land. Continuity in a culture is about how one connects to one's ancestors and heritage\nthrough shared practices and rituals (rites of passage).\n\nQuality and feeling are best considered in terms of continuity. For example, one could\nthink of a spectrum of colors. Each color fades into the next. There is no boundary\nbetween them, no discrete place where one begins and another ends. All colors have a\ncommon spectrum and come from a common energy. The commonality is a form of\ncontinuity. Additionally, they are all part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is always\na continuous field of energy without exact boundary.\n\n84 Law and Locality\n\n#### Law and Locality\n\nAlthough most of the examples for continuity have an inherently subjective nature, this is\nnot to imply that the concept of continuity and of discontinuity are absent from formal\nconsideration within the objective physical sciences. The quantum theory, for example,\nconsiders an inherently non-continuous process called 'the quantum jump'.\n\nThere is a parallel between the incommensuration theorem and the Bell Theorem of\nphysics. In essence, the Bell Theorem states that any physical theory of reality cannot\nboth assert that reality is \"lawful\" and that reality is \"local\". According to the Bell\nTheorem, reality can be either completely lawful and somewhat non-local or it can be\ncompletely local, and somewhat non-lawful. The concepts of lawfulness and of locality\ncan be regarded as special cases of the more general concepts of symmetry and continuity\n(respectively).\n\nIt is an inherent assumption of science that, given similar environmental conditions, the\nresults of a physical procedure performed in one place and time will be the same as the\nresults of the same procedure implemented in other places and times. This constancy of\nthe results of empirical experiments (a sameness of content) performed in different times\nand places (a difference of context) is an expression of the concept of symmetry. Science\nassumes that the essential nature of the dynamics of physical process is everywhere the\nsame in the universe.\n\nScience regards the 'laws of physical process' as invariant under transformations of\nchanging times and position. In that the methodology of science itself depends on the\nnotion of repeatable observations, the scientific method itself inherently involves an\nimplicit assumption of symmetry. As such, the mathematical expression of the laws of\nnature (as discovered by the methodology of science) are all based on notions of\nsymmetry. For example, the conservation of matter and energy is a symmetry law. The\nfoundations of the theories of relativity are based on ideas of a sameness of various types\nof relationship under circumstances of changing position and momentum. The ultimate\nassertion of symmetry of science is to assert that the same physical laws (as content) apply\neverywhere (an invariance) in the universe (a context). As such, for science to regard the\n\nuniverse as lawful is to assert a fundamental notion of symmetry^1.\n\nThe notion of locality as used within science is essentially an assertion that no physical\ninfluence, interaction, or signal can travel faster than the speed of light. To assert locality\nis to assert that all physical process involve dynamics which do not have instantaneous\ntransits across space (a jump between arbitrarily separated points in zero time). If an\ninteraction spans any distance, then it must also span some nonzero duration.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. Any aspects or process of the physical world which are real and yet which are inherently not repeatable (or\n   observable) would be non-lawful and non-symmetric in time and space and therefore ultimately outside of the\n   scope of study available to the method of science. To assert that something is real is different than asserting\n   that it exists or that it is objective.\n\n```\nLaw and Locality 85\n```\n\nThe metrics of time and space are contextual metrics, and interaction and substance\n\n(physical matter) is regarded as being a 'content' within that context^1. This notion that\nthere is no influence, interaction, or signal (all of which are content) which can\ninstantaneously cross an arbitrary distance of space (a context) is equivalent to the notion\nof continuity. For any small change (a process, interaction, or signal, as a content) there\nmust be a corresponding change in the context of that interaction (in time and space). The\nnotion of locality, in asserting that there can be no abrupt instantaneous changes, is a\n\nspecial case of the concept of continuity^2.\n\nHowever, the incommensuration theorem regards symmetry and continuity to be mutually\ninconsistent. They cannot be simultaneously applied to the same immanent modal identity.\nA theory of reality is a theory of being, and thus must be formulated from an immanent,\nrather than omniscient, basis. Therefore, the notion that reality is absolutely lawful is\ninconsistent with the notion that reality is absolutely local. In effect, a conception of\nreality must either allow 1) multiple mutually inconsistent sets of different physical laws\nwhich are applicable in different places and times (failure of lawfulness and symmetry), or\n\n2. inherently non-local interactions and changes which are fundamentally\n   non-deterministic (failure of locality and continuity). No theory of reality can assert both\n   total generality, and total determinism.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. Technically, it is incorrect to identify the concept of interaction directly with content. By the root tautology,\n   the notion of interaction is equivalent to comparison, and therefore both content and context are to be regarded\n   as intrinsic aspects of interaction. Thus, neither content nor context can be identified as interaction and\n   comparison itself. The concept of change (in the sense of physical process), however, can be directly\n   regarded as a content, thus restoring the logic of this essay.\n2. To assert absolute locality is to assume a total continuity of interaction at all scales, down to and including\n   the (microscopic) scale of absolute zero in both distance and duration. It is to require that theories of physical\n   reality are defined in terms of deterministic law rather than in terms of causal law. However, the scientific\n   method can only make observations about causality. It inherently cannot (even in principle) make any direct\n   observation or assertion about continuity or locality. The scientific method cannot make any direct\n   observation about symmetry either, even though it must implicitly assume an inherent symmetry in reality in its\n   practice. No single experiment could ever possibly validate the absolute and universal truth of either\n   continuity (the all interaction and change is local) or symmetry (that reality is lawful).\n\n86 Consistency and Completeness\n\n#### Consistency and Completeness\n\nIn considering each and every statement P defined within a formal system, the notion of\nconsistency can be defined as \"that there is no statement P which is both true and false\".\nSimilarly, the notion of completeness can be defined as \"that there is no statement P which\nis neither true or false\".\n\nThe notion of consistency is a special case of the more general concept of symmetry. To\nassert that a given statement P is consistent is to assert that the content, the truth or falsity\nof P, does not change with changes of context, the method by which P is considered (a\nmethod of derivation using other statements of the same formal system). To assert that a\nformal statement is 'internally consistent' is to assert that, for all statements within that\nformal system, that there is no statement which is true when derived by one method and\nthen false when derived using another method. When considering the truth and falsity of a\nstatement as its content, and the method of derivation as context, the notion of\nconsistency is strictly equivalent to the concept of symmetry.\n\nThe notion of completeness is a special case of the more general concept of continuity. To\nassert that a given formal system is complete is to assert that there are no discontinuities of\ncontent. An inherent discontinuity is an implied (sharp) boundary between statements\nwhich have content, a truth or falsity value, and those which do not have a truth or falsity\nvalue because they cannot be proven by any method (using any sequence of other\nstatements in the formal system). To assert completeness of a formal system is to assert\nthat there is a continuity of content; that all expressions within the language of the formal\nsystem (the context) have a truth or falsity value (the content).\n\nInsofar as the incommensuration theorem asserts that the concepts of symmetry and\ncontinuity cannot be simultaneously applied when making comparisons of statements\nwithin the language of a formal system, the concepts of absolute consistency and absolute\ncompleteness are also mutually incompatible.\n\n```\nCausality and Determinism 87\n```\n\n#### Causality and Determinism\n\nThe concepts of causality and determinism are distinct.\nThey cannot be used interchangeably.\n\nThe notion of determinism (as per the inherent nature of the concept) is to assert that\nthere can be a complete and absolute specification of all values of the three content\nmetrics (pattern/mass, force, and probability) for all values of the three context metrics\n(time, space, and possibility).\n\nThe notion of Causality refers to persistent perceived relation of association between\nthree events: the observing self, the observed cause, and the observation of the effect.\n\nThe concept of objective causality applies to the degree that both the antecedent and the\nconsequent are themselves objective. The concept of subjective causality applies to the\ndegree that either the antecedent and/or the consequent is subjective.\n\nTo assert determinism is to assert that there is a fixed, exact, and well-defined microscopic\nstructure/pattern to all eventities in a domain. Unlike the concept of causality, the concept\nof determinism does not require any reference to basis concepts of observability, observer,\nor temporality.\n\nTo assert causality is to assert a consistent pattern of observations of relations between\nmesoscopic eventities using the basis concepts of observer and temporality. Unlike\ndeterminism, the assertion of causality is to make no claim as to the nature, being, pattern,\nor degree of structure/form of the microscopic aspects of eventities in a domain.\n\nThe concept of causality requires the aspect of an observer self to be present, whereas the\nconcept of determinism does not. The concept of causality is time asymmetric (with\nrespect to the observer self), whereas determinism requires no unique (non-spatial)\nconcept of time, The concept of causality does not require a detailed microscopic\nspecification of all events (including that of the observer self), whereas the concept of\ndeterminism does require such specification (to be possible, at least in principle).\n\nA/any/the/all worlds are to some non-zero and positive degree causal.\n\nNo world/domain is purely and completely deterministic and/or logical^1. Neither\nexperience nor creativity is determined (they are not deterministic).\n\nThe (form of the) content of experience is at once proscribed by causality and described\nby choice. The (form of the) content of expression (creativity) is at once proscribed by\nchoice and described by causality.\n\n---\n\nNote; Science is based upon observation. As such, it can only establish assertions of causality. It cannot\nestablish or validate any claim about the determinism of any eventity. Determinism cannot be perceived or\nobserved, and as such, any claims about absolute possibility are ultimately unscientific. Despite popular\nmisconceptions, the natural law of science is always causal law, not ever deterministic law.\n\n88 Science and Mathematics\n\n#### Science and Mathematics\n\nMathematics is organized thinking about the interactions and interdependencies of pure\nrelations.\nMathematics is an inquiry and description of the nature of pure abstract relationship.\n\nIn this way mathematics is distinct from physics, which considers interactions (not\nrelations) within a specific domain. Mathematics is considered in a manner which is purely\nomniscient modal, whereas physics is considered in a manner which also has elements of\nboth the immanent and the transcendent modality. Science is immanent when involved in\nexperiment (in the scientific method) and transcendent when asserting a relationship\nbetween theory and reality (a belief that a mathematical model corresponds to natural\nlaw).\n\nScientific knowledge is not mathematical knowledge. Scientific knowledge is based on the\nscientific method. The scientific method is based upon experiment (expression and\nperception), and measurement, whereas mathematics requires no experiment (is\ndeterministic).\n\nAll scientific knowledge is of the causal type. There is, and there can be, no scientific\nknowledge of the deterministic type (due to the very nature of the scientific method itself).\nIn that experiments are always finite (bandwidth limited), the infinite specification\nnecessary to establish determinism can never be obtained. Insofar as experimentation\ninvolves a scientist (observer), science can only establish causal relations.\n\n```\nPhysical and Non-Physical 89\n```\n\n#### Physical and Non-Physical\n\nThe concept of 'the physical' refers to an existence which is both actual and deterministic.\nA deterministic existence is a concept that an actuality has a definite and specific form\n(objective content) pattern in all levels of detail (in scale) for all times and places,\nregardless and independent of the subjective context in which that pattern is observed.\n\nThe concept of the physical is an assertion that the total space-time structural pattern of a\nworld is completely defined in all aspects (regardless of the frame of reference of one's\nperspective on it), and that this world is an actuality (for it can be perceived). In other\nwords, the structure of the physical is completely defined at all scales and for all\nobservers, regardless of their position in time or space or of motion through time and\nspace; and that furthermore, this structure is objectively perceivable (i.e. is an actual\nobservable).\n\nThe concept of 'the non-physical' refers to a creation which is both potential and\nnon-deterministic. A non-deterministic creation is a concept of a potentiality that has a\ndefinite and specific subjective context in all levels of abstraction for all times and\npossibilities, but which has absolutely no specific or defined form (objective content).\n\nThe concept of the non-physical is an assertion that the total possible-time semantic\nmeaning of a world is completely defined in all environments, regardless of the structure\nof one's expectations of it; and that this world is a potentiality (it cannot be perceived).\nThe semantics of the non-physical is completely defined at all abstractions and for all\nexpectations, regardless of the position or motion in and through time and/or possibility.\nThe semantic of the non-physical is not objectively perceivable (i.e. it is a potentiality).\n\n90 Cartesian Dualism\n\n#### Cartesian Dualism\n\nIn distinguishing causality from determinism, there is established a strict difference\nbetween the nature of causality and the nature of the physical. Determinism and\nphysicality are consistent with one another in that both (implicitly) involve infinite detail\nof (microscopic) specification. As such, the consideration of science (finite) can extend\nonly into the nature of reality and causality. It cannot consider the nature of the physical\n(infinite) in any direct sense (nor can science consider creation (also infinite), nor even\nchoice (non-visible, non-repeatable)).\n\nIn that there is a distinction between causality and the physical, there is also a distinction\nbetween choice and the non-physical. Choice is to some extent personal, and though it\ninvolves the random and dynamic, it is not absolutely chaotic. Choice is personal, whereas\nthe pure non-physical (creation) is ultimately impersonal. In comparisons within any given\ndomain, the energy (potentiality) involved in a choice is always finite, whereas the energy\n(potentiality) involved in creation is always infinite (the ratio of any number to zero (the\n\"empty domain prior to creation\") is always infinite).\n\nTo the degree that there is an assumption of interaction (finite), 1) reality is different from\nphysicality and 2) self is different from pure non physicality/dynamicism, creation. In\nconsidering interaction, there is the idea that the self (soul), which to some extent\nresembles the non-physical and non-deterministic, can interact with a reality, which to\nsome extent resembles a physical and deterministic system. The resemblance between the\nself (soul) and the non-physical, and the resemblance between reality and the physical, are\ninversely proportional to the degree of interaction assumed between self and reality.\n\nThe degree of interaction between self and reality, however, can never be zero or infinite.\nTherefore, interaction and consciousness are neither purely physical nor non-physical;\nneither deterministic nor non-deterministic, and are (to some extent) both causal and\nnon-causal (i.e., a composition of choice).\n\nConsciousness, in itself, belongs neither to reality nor to the self exclusively, but is shared\nbetween them in the form of interaction. Consciousness is not an illusion, nor is it in\nconflict with conventional science. It is both the absolute deterministic physical model and\nthe absolute indeterministic non-physical models that are illusions.\n\nAs such, neither the realistic nor the idealistic arguments can ever be resolved by (any)\nlogic, perception, experience, or experiment. This is due to the fact that no sensory\ninteraction, fact of experience or objective measurement could ever encompass the\ninfinitely small or the infinitely large equal to the presumed absolute nature of the reality\nitself.\n\n```\nKnowledge and Understanding 91\n```\n\n#### Knowledge and Understanding\n\nThe concept of knowing is distinct from the concept of knowledge, for the former refers to\nthe nature of one's being in relation to a world, whereas the latter refers to the content of\none's subjective state. To say that one has knowledge of something is to say that one has\ninformation about something (static), but is not to say that one is in the process of knowing\n(dynamic).\n\nKnowing and understanding are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable. The\nphrases \"to know\" and \"to understand\" cannot be used interchangeably; they are not the\nsame.\n\nKnowing is the selective abstractive transformation (filtering) of perception.\n\nUnderstanding is the selective instructive^2 transformation (filtering) of expression.\n\nPerception is simple. Knowing is complex.\nWhere perception is defined by a single form (simplicity),\nknowing is defined by many feelings (complexity).\nExpression is simple. Understanding is complex.\nWhere expression is defined by a single feeling (simplicity),\nunderstanding is defined by many forms (complexity).\n\n```\nKnowing is a transformation of outer form into inner feeling.\nAny process that converts from an outer/ external form into an inner/internal form\n(feeling) is a process of abstraction (as \"from structure\"). Knowing is fundamentally a\nperceptive process.\n```\n\n```\nUnderstanding is a transformation of inner feeling into outer form.\nAny process that converts from an inner/ internal form (feeling) to an outer/external\nform, is a process of instruction (as \"into structure\"). Understanding is fundamentally\nan expressive process.\n```\n\nNo degree (even a very large degree) of knowing is equivalent to any degree (even a very\nsmall degree) of understanding. Similarly, no degree of understanding is equivalent to any\n\ndegree of knowing. Understanding cannot replace, or create, knowing^3. Knowing cannot\nreplace, or create, understanding.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The concept of falsifiability is applicable to questions of why and of how, but it cannot be applied to\n   questions of what (description). Metaphysics, insofar as it is descriptive and definitive, is generally not so\n   much itself the subject of logic or of proof, as it is an attempt to provide a basis for logic and proof.\n2. The term 'instructive' is here used in the manner of \"to in-struct\" or as in 'to put into, add, or create\n   structure').\n3. Due to the nature of communication, this book can only convey understanding; it cannot convey knowing.\n\n92 Zero Positive\n\n#### Zero Positive\n\nThe essence of an act of measurement constitutes a domain. Domains are zero positive.\nAll numerical (zero-positive) measurements involve as their concepts a zero, a unit, and an\nextent. These concepts correspond with position, scale, and direction, respectively.\n\n```\nPosition has the nature of the omniscient modality.\nScale has the nature of the transcendent modality.\nDirection has the nature of the immanent modality.\n```\n\nThe zero is representative of the limit of the microscopic boundary of a measurement\ndomain.\nThe unit defines the nature of the meaning of the mesoscopic scale.\nThe extent is representative of the limit of the macroscopic boundary of a measurement\ndomain.\n\n```\nZero has the nature of the transcendent.\nUnity (the unit) has the nature of the immanent.\nInfinity (extent) has the nature of the omniscient^1.\n```\n\nIn any scale of measurement, the absolute microscopic corresponds to the infinitesimal\nnumber (continuity), zero, the mesoscopic refers to the unit (one), and the macroscopic\nrefers to infinity (symmetry).\n\nFor example, light is zero positive. There is an absolute limit (zero) to 'how much dark' is\npossible in any given space, yet there is no limit to how much light is possible in that same\nspace. The two concepts 'light' and 'dark' cannot be considered/defined using equivalent\ncontexts of meaning, and thus, cannot be considered as being in symmetric opposition to\none another. Only various degrees of light-ful-ness (being) are defined; there is no \"dark\"\n(non-being, zero semantic value). Where no meaning can be given to the contrast class of\nthat which is infinite, the concept of dark can have no independent meaning (definition,\nsemantic basis) of its own.\n\n```\nThe concept of similarity has common basis with the concept of continuity\n(via their basis in definition with the concept of \"being the same\").\nThe concept of proximity has common basis with the concept of symmetry\n(as \"to be near one\" is to equally have one be near the other).\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. Due to a shift in the context of consideration (Axiom II), the modalities of the position, scale, direction\n   triple are phase shifted with respect to the triple of zero, unit, and extent.\n\n```\nZero Positive 93\n```\n\nTheory consists of an object domain, a model domain, and a correspondence domain\n(the set of correspondences between the object domain and the model domain is itself a\ndomain).\n\n```\nThe object domain has the nature of the transcendent.\nThe correspondence domain has the nature of the immanent.\nThe model domain has the nature of the omniscient.\n```\n\n```\nThe object domain is described in terms of interactions.\nThe correspondence domain is described in terms of comparisons.\nThe model domain is described in terms of relations.\n```\n\nThe notions of relation, of comparison, and of interaction are themselves also distinct,\ninseparable, and non-interchangeable. All three are zero positive metrics.\n\n94 Nature of Inquiry\n\n#### The Nature of Inquiry\n\nWithin a language domain (within communication), there are exactly six classes of\nquestion:\n'how', 'why', 'who', 'what', 'where' and 'when':\n\n```\nQuestions of who are resolved in terms of a class of the subjective.\nQuestions of what are resolved in terms of a class of the objective.\nQuestions of how are resolved in terms of an instance of a subjective content.\nQuestions of why are resolved in terms of an instance of a subjective context.\nQuestions of when are resolved in terms of an instance of an objective content.\nQuestions of where are resolved in terms of an instance of an objective context.\n```\n\nQuestions of why, how and who are always relative (in relation to) to a particular self.\nQuestions of what, where and when are always relative (in relation to) to a particular\nworld.\n\n```\nQuestions of why and how have the nature of the transcendent modality.\nQuestions of who and what have the nature of the immanent modality.\nQuestions of when and where have the nature of the omniscient modality.\n```\n\nThe six types of question have direct one-to-one correspondences with the six types of\nprimary domain metrics.\n\n```\nA why type question corresponds to a consideration of possibility.\nA how type question corresponds to a consideration of probability.\nA who type question corresponds to a consideration of force.\nA what type question corresponds to a consideration of mass (inertia/pattern).\nA where type question corresponds to a consideration of space.\nA when type question corresponds to a consideration of time.\n```\n\n```\nNature of Inquiry 95\n```\n\nThe six question types group into three axis pairs which represent convolutions of two\nother primary concepts. These pairs are abstraction and instruction, the subjective and the\nobjective, and the spatial and the temporal.\n\n```\nAn answer to a question of why always refers to an abstraction.\nA 'why type assertion' is one which, given a specified instructed eventity X,\nprovides/specifies/corresponds/defines an abstract eventity Y.\n```\n\n```\nAn answer to a question of how always refers to an instruction.\nA 'how type assertion' is one which, given a specified abstract eventity X,\nprovides/specifies/corresponds/defines an instruction eventity Y.\n```\n\n```\nAn answer to a question of who always refers to that which is subjective.\nA 'who type assertion' is one which, given a specified objective eventity X,\nprovides/specifies/corresponds/defines a subjective eventity Y.\n```\n\n```\nAn answer to a question of what always refers to that which is objective.\nA 'what type assertion' is one which, given a specified subjective eventity X,\nprovides/specifies/corresponds/defines an objective eventity Y.\n```\n\n```\nAn answer to a question of where always refers to that which is spatial.\nA 'where type assertion' is one which, given a specified temporal eventity X,\nprovides/ specifies/ corresponds/ defines a spatial eventity Y.\n```\n\n```\nAn answer to a question of when always refers to that which is temporal.\nA 'when type assertion' is one which, given a specified spatial eventity X,\nprovides/ specifies/ corresponds/ defines a temporal eventity Y.\n```\n\nThe process and being of the questions of how and why, of abstraction and instruction,\nexpression and perception, and possibility and probability, refer to (and are specified in\nterms of) relations of similarity between domains.\n\nThe process and being of the questions of who and what, of the objective and the\nsubjective, statement and self, and inertia and force, refer to (and are specified in terms\nof) relations of inclusion between eventities and domains.\n\nThe process and being of the questions of when and where, of space and time, and the\nproscriptive and the descriptive, refer to (and are specified in terms of) relations of\nproximity between eventities.\n\n96 Inclusion, Proximity, Similarity\n\n#### Inclusion, Proximity, Similarity\n\nThe three concepts of inclusion, proximity, and similarity provide the necessary and\nsufficient basis for considering the type of any instance of a comparison, perception, or\nrelation. There is no perception, relation, or comparison which cannot be completely\nrepresented in and resolved into at least one or more of these pure types of \"relations of\nsimilarity\", \"relations of proximity\", and \"relations of inclusion\". For example, all\ncomparison can be ultimately and fundamentally resolved into the three aspect types of\n\"comparisons which establish inclusion\" (i.e., containment; one thing inside of another),\n\"comparisons which establish proximity\", and \"comparisons which establish similarity\".\n\nThe concepts of similarity, proximity, and inclusion are distinct, inseparable, and\nnon-interchangeable concepts. All three notions are zero positive metrics. Relations of\ninclusion are more basic than relations of proximity and/or relations of similarity.\n\nSimilarity and proximity are conjugate^1.\n\n```\nThe relation type of inclusion (containment) has the nature of the immanent modality.\nThe relation type of proximity has the nature of the omniscient modality.\nThe relation type of similarity has the nature of the transcendent modality.\n```\n\nThe essence of the meaning of similarity is always (at least implicitly) in reference to a\ncollection of transformations (operators on forms/states). These transformations are\ntypically across (transcendent to) domains. Similarity can have no meaning independent of\nthese transformations.\n\nThe essence of the meaning of proximity is always (at least implicitly) in reference to a\nspecific domain (a context of form). Proximity cannot be considered independently of this\ndomain basis.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. Expressed mathematically, the concept of conjugation may be expressed as I = O \\* T where I, O, and T are\n   all strictly positive (I > 0, O > 0, T > 0). The implications of changing the relative values of these three\n   variables with respect to one another express the dynamic of conjugation. For comparison, the concept of\n   opposition would be formulated as I = O + T, with the only limitation being that I > 0 (with a possibility of O\n   and T taking negative values or zero).\n\n```\nInclusion, Proximity, Similarity 97\n```\n\nThe Axioms are a defining basis for, and are defined by, the triple concepts of inclusion,\nproximity, and similarity.\n\n```\nAxiom I is a statement of proximity.\nAxiom II is a statement of inclusion.\nAxiom III is a statement of (dis) similarity.\n```\n\nThe concept of relation can be understood in terms of the concept of proximity.\nThe concept of identity can be understood in terms of the concept of similarity (an\ninstance).\nThe concept of a domain can be understood in terms of the concept of inclusion (a class).\n\n98 Triplication\n\n#### Triplication\n\nThe Law of Three : A relation is always a relation of at least three. For every pair of\nconcepts, there is always at least one more. For every interaction or comparison, there are\nalways at least three intrinsic aspects.\n\nFor every sameness there is a difference. For every difference there is a sameness. For\nevery way that there is for something to be the same, there are at least two ways for it to\nbe different. For every way that it is different, there are at least two ways in which it is the\nsame.\n\nEvery instance is an instance of at least two classes. Every class has at least two instances.\nWhere the immanent is a class, the omniscient and the transcendent will be instances.\nWhere the immanent is an instance, the omniscient and the transcendent will be classes.\n\nFor every whole, there are at least two parts.

To be interexclusionary is to imply a\n\nsymmetry in being and a continuity in doing^1.\n\nParallel Aspect; 1st: Eventities which have an interexclusionary nature can only have\n\ntheir existence described in terms of external unicity^2. Anything which can only be\n\ndefined as unique by external measurements must have an interexclusionary nature^3.\n\nParallel Aspect; 2nd: Eventities which have an intercompositional nature can only have\ntheir existence described in terms of internal unicity.

Nothing is either purely and absolutely interexclusionary or purely and absolutely intercompositional.\n   Everything (every eventity, interaction, relation, or comparison) is to some extent interexclusionary and to\n   some extent intercompositional.\n2. Unicity: In reference to the quality of being unique, rather than to the degree that something is relatively\n   unique (uniqueness).\n3. Example: Where all electrons have the same measurable properties, distinct instances of electrons can be\n   distinguished only by their position.\n4. Example: Photons can only be distinguished by their properties, where many photons can be in the same\n   space at the same time.\n\n```\nIntercompositional and Interexclusionary 101\n```\n\nEventities which have an intercompositional nature are distinguished\n(as unique instances) only by their content (inner pattern).\nEventities which have an interexclusionary nature are distinguished\n(as unique instances) only by their context (outer pattern).\n\nAll interactions are unique, either by content or by context.\nWhere content is identical, context must be different.\n\nWhere context is identical, content must be different^1.\n\nForm is interexclusionary. Feeling is intercompositional.\nObjectivity is interexclusionary. Subjectivity is intercompositional.\n\nWith respect to the self, the concept of 'instance' is regarded as a content,\nin terms of a difference, and as being unique and interexclusionary.\nWith respect to the self, the concept of the class is regarded as a context,\nin terms of sameness, and as being non-unique and intercompositional.\n\nAll that is qualia is intercompositional,\nhas the nature of non-local context,\nand is understood in terms of continuity.\nAll that is quanta is interexclusionary,\nhas the nature of local content,\nand is understood in terms of symmetry.\n\nPerception is interexclusionary in space (position) and actuality.\nExpression is intercompositional in possibility and potentiality.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. For example, the concept of a 'particle' is isomorphic with the concept of an interaction. Interactions have\n   two aspects (two types), the intercompositional (fermions) and the interexclusionary (bosons). The\n   interexclusionary have the aspect of the omniscient (existence, actuality), are quantized, and are defined by\n   symmetry. The intercompositional have the aspect of the transcendent (potentiality, creation), are asymmetric\n   (directed waves), and are defined by continuity. The actuality of the boson grows out of the virtuality of the\n   fermion, much as the virtuality of the fermion grows out of the actuality of the boson.\n\n102 Ontology\n\n#### Ontology\n\nOn the basis of the Root Tautology, the following three principles may be established:\n\nThe Absolute Ontology Principle: Interaction is considered to be ultimately and\n\nindependently 'real', in some irreducible sense, in all formulations of theory^1. There IS, in\nsome irreducible sense, always interaction.\n\nThe Principle of Absolute Unity : There is always some method of considering\n\ninteractions as being the same, identical, or equivalent, in all formulations of theory^2.\nThere IS, for each interaction, in some irreducible sense, a manner in which it is part of an\n(at least two, arbitrary) abstract whole(s).\n\nThe Principle of Absolute Unicity : There is always some method of considering\ninteractions as being different from one another (i.e., as at least 'distinctly instanced') in all\nformulations of theory. There IS, for each interaction considered as a part of an abstract\nwhole, in some irreducible sense, a manner in which it is distinct from all others (unique)\nin that abstract whole. All identity is distinct, every distinction is an identity.\n\nThe absolute ontology principle establishes the nature of the concept of instances of\ninteractions within some class, while the principle of absolute unity and the principle of\nabsolute unicity establish the nature of comparisons of interactions within that class. All\nthree principles are necessary and intrinsic within any concept or consideration of\ncomparison. In that the concept of an interaction and the concept of a comparison are\nisomorphs, the three principles could be stated more formally for all contents and\ncontexts, explicitly in terms of comparison and its near allied predicates.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The meaning of the term ontology is usually taken to refer to the philosophical study of the nature of\n   beingness in itself.\n2. This principle asserts that for any instance of a thing, there has to be some manner in which the thing is like,\n   or comparable to, any other thing. There is always some manner by which to regard any two things as being\n   similar, or the same as, one another.\n\n```\nOntology 103\n```\n\nThe Absolute Ontology Principle : There is assumed to be a class of instances\nof comparable comparisons.\n\nThe Principle of Absolute Unity : There is assumed to be a class of instances\nof comparisons of comparisons such that all instances of the comparisons are the same.\n\nThe Principle of Absolute unicity : There is assumed to be a class of instances\nof comparisons of comparisons such that all instances of the comparisons are different.\n\nWhile the principle of unity and the principle of unicity may initially seem contradictory,\nthere is always a sense in which they are consistent with one another for any given pair of\ninteractions. Interactions are always implicitly compared in terms of their various aspects.\nThe interactions themselves are considered to be complex rather than simple. As such,\nthere may simultaneously be a sense in which various aspects of a pair of interactions are\nthe same and in which the various other aspects of those interactions are different. The\ndifference and sameness of interactions are the differences and sameness of aspects of\nthose interactions. The concepts of difference and sameness are relative concepts (with\nrespect to the various selected aspects of interaction), and not absolute ones. The IDM\nmetaphysics regards these concepts (difference and sameness) as being self evident.\n\n```\nThe absolute ontology principle has the nature of the immanent modality.\nThe principle of absolute unity has the nature of the omniscient modality.\nThe principle of absolute unicity has the nature of the transcendent modality.\n```\n\nThe concepts of existence, reality, and objectivity may be resolved by the principles of the\nIDM metaphysics.\n\n```\nThe concept of the real is taken to refer to an application of the absolute ontology\nprinciple, independently of its possible associations with any particular self or domain.\n```\n\n```\nThe concept of existence is taken to be an application of the principle of absolute\nunity, relative to a specific domain, and independent of its possible association with any\nparticular self.\n```\n\n```\nThe concept of being is taken to be an application of the principle of absolute unicity,\nrelative to a specific self, and independent of its possible association with any particular\ndomain (world).\n```\n\nInteractions are always in some sense (omniscient) the same, are symmetric, and are\nconstant. Interactions are also always in some sense (transcendent) distinct (as different),\nand are asymmetric (as non-constant, in-equivalent, or increasing).\n\n104 Scope of Theory\n\n#### The Scope of Theory\n\nWhere theory is defined most immediately in terms of the mesoscopic, the concept of\nsymmetry becomes an assertion about the macroscopic made from the perspective of the\nmesoscopic, and the concept of continuity becomes an assertion about the microscopic\nmade from the perspective of the mesoscopic.\n\nEmpirical measurement happens only at the scales of the mesoscopic. Extrapolation of\ntheory is used to consider the scales of the microscopic and that of the macroscopic. As\nsuch, effective theory is developed from the middle outward, rather than from the top\ndown (religious ideas of emanation, philosophies of idealism) or from the bottom up\n(atomic physical monism, philosophies of realism). Life happens between. Effective\ntheory also begins between.\n\nEventities within domains are considered in terms of both scale and location. The concept\nof scale is equally as fundamental as the concept of location (position in the domain,\ndefined by proximity, relative to other eventities). The concept of a scale is not a position\nor a thing, nor even a direction in conventional spatial terms.\n\nThe degree of lawfulness of the microscopic aspects of a domain are conjugate with the\ndegree of lawfulness of the macroscopic aspects of a domain. No domain/world can be\nregarded as completely lawful at both the microscopic and the macroscopic scales of\nbeing. No theory/description of the real can be both correct across the whole span of the\nworld and also assert finite dependence of its elements.\n\nNo theory will ever be able to completely explain, predict, or model, all observable\n\nbehavior and phenomena (interactions, change) in a world (domain)^1. An assumption of\nlocal consistency must eventually result in a realization of global inconsistency. Perfect\n\ncontinuity must preclude perfect symmetry^2.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. Note: this also includes the IDM metaphysics. A metaphysics is not a theory of everything so much as it is a\n   comprehensive description of the foundations of domains.\n2. An assumption of global consistency will also eventually force a realization of local inconsistency. An\n   assumption of consistency cannot hold at the absolute extrema of all scales (from the scale of identically zero\n   to the scale of identically infinite). An assumption valid for one scale of being is not therefore valid for all\n   scales of being.\n\n```\nNo Universe 105\n```\n\n#### There Is No Universe\n\nIn that all members of the class 'that which exists' must have a non-null possibility of\ninteracting (i.e., there is a non-zero positive potentiality of interactions (direct or indirect)\nbetween any pair of existences), so must the concept of continuity (of potentiality) be\ncommonly applied to all members, and to the class itself.\n\nIn that the nature of the beingness of any member of the class of that which is existing is\nthe same as that of any other member, so must the concept of symmetry (of actuality) be\ncommonly applied to all members and to the class itself.\n\nIn that the concept of perfect symmetry and the concept of perfect continuity are\nthemselves fundamentally incommensurate, so must the class of existence be itself\nincomplete and non-absolute (i.e., finite and indefinite). Thus, there can be no single all\nembracing class of \"universal\" existence.\n\nIn that the conventional concept of 'universe' is taken to be the abstract class of all\nabstract classes of unity (i.e., a presumed totality of all existences within all domains), 'the\nuniverse' explicitly cannot be given an ontological status of its own, in terms of being,\n\nreality, or existence, as defined^1.\n\nThere is no single context that encompasses all other contexts and contents.\nThere is no single domain that encompasses all other domains.\nThere is no single frame of 'the all of reality'.\nThere is no one single material universe containing and subsuming all.\nThere is no single root substance that is within all other substances.\nThere is no single final fundamental actual substance in any world or domain.\nThere is no fundamental unit or atom of substance.\nNor can all of existence be made of any finite set of things, materials, substances, or\nexistences.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The concept of 'the universe' implicitly requires an assumption of an omniscient modal concept containing a\n   transcendent modal concept. In that the concept of universe is in direct contradiction to Axiom II, it is\n   considered to be 'ill formed' and internally inconsistent as a metaphysical concept.\n\nAs such, metaphysics cannot ever consider 'the universe', but can only consider 'creation', 'interaction', and\n'existence'.\n\n106 No Universe\n\nThere is no 'super-domain' which includes as members all other domains as sub-entities.\nThe idea of 'a universe' cannot be fully realized, even in principle.\nAny attempt to formulate such will result in paradox.\nThe transcendent cannot be contained within the omniscient.\n\nThere is no single fundamental ground of being.\nThere is no single fundamental lawfulness common to all causality,\nin any world, domain, or universe.\nThere is no one single 'real' reality/ universe.\n\nThere is no universal context. There is no universal domain. There is no universal\n\nlanguage^1.\n\nThere is a universal content. There are universal symbols (the three modalities). Each\nmodality is exactly one primary universal symbol. Of universal symbols, there can be no\nfewer than three, and when three, they will always correspond to the three modalities.\n\nNo possible experiment done within a domain (the universe) can demonstrate the closure\nof the domain (universe). Neither the universe, nor any part of it, can be regarded as a\nclosed system, immutable to change. There are no worlds or domains with fixed and\nimmutable boundaries. No domain is ever fully closed. There are no closed systems. There\n\nare no 'complete' domains. All domains are open^2.\n\nThe universe is locally consistent but globally inconsistent. For any domain, there will be\nlaws of local conservation (symmetry base principle). No concept of domain global\n\nconservation, however, can be so consistently defined^3.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. In considering that there is no absolute (all encompassing) context, a universal language would necessarily\n   be defined as a language in which all statements made using that language would be understood in a manner\n   completely independent of (both objective and subjective) context. However, in that all representations are a\n   content of a domain and therefore at least minimally (objective) context dependent, there can be no absolute\n   universal language.\n2. These statements are to be regarded with the related implications regarding monism and cosmology.\n   This lack of closure applies to all of the domain metric variables, without exception.\n3. The concept of conservation cannot be validly applied to anything which has a purely transcendental\n   character. For example, love is not conserved. Value is not conserved. Having one love or value does not\n   carry any necessary impact on the possibility of having more than one love or value.\n\n```\nNo Control 107\n```\n\n#### There Is No Control\n\nAll interactions have co-lateral aspects. No interaction (or energy) is ever perfectly or\ncompletely co-lateral, and no interaction is not at least partially co-lateral.\n\nCo-lateral energy : in the ideal case, this refers to an interdomain relation in which a\nchange in the state of one domain implies and defines a change in the state of another\ndomain, in a manner which depends only on the form of the change (i.e., is completely\n\nindependent of the relative strengths of the energies involved in the respective domains)^1.\n\nInteraction cannot prevent interaction, but only beget it. Choice always begets choice.\n\nNo form of control is absolute; all process has some aspect of a cooperative nature. There\nis no control, there is only influence. It is fundamentally impossible to completely and/or\nabsolutely control or constrain anything, in any domain, under any circumstances, ever.\n\nThere are no absolutely asymmetric interactions. No interaction, no relation, can ever be\nfully and completely asymmetric. While it is possible for relations and interactions to be\nnearly asymmetric, it is impossible for such relations to be fully, absolutely, and wholly\nasymmetric. Every action has at least some reaction.\n\nNo perception is perfectly omniscient (or objective).\nNo expression is perfectly transcendent (or absolute).\n\nChoice cannot (completely/ absolutely) fix or limit other choice.\nChoice can only enable other choice (both within domains and across them).\n\nNothing within a world can prevent the creation of new events, the creation of a/the\nworld(s). Instances of relations cannot ultimately limit the beingness of other instances of\nrelations.\n\nThe entrance of any new life into a world/reality always occurs through the microscopic\nboundary. All birth begins at the smallest scales of existence.\n\nThe universe is open and unbounded at the microscopic scales,\neven while it must appear to be closed and bounded at macroscopic scales.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. For example, consider a conventional light switch; an event within the domain of the mechanical will define\n   the pattern of energies (state) in the domain of the electrical, even though there is no relationship between the\n   amount of mechanical energy required to set the switch and the amount of electrical energy which is controlled\n   by the switch.\n\n108 Subjectivity and Consensus\n\n#### Subjectivity and Consensus\n\nSubjectivity is irreducible. One cannot consider subjectivity purely in terms of objectivity.\nThe/an/any/all action and concept of observation/perception is inseparable from the action\nand concept of subjectivity and objectivity.\n\nAs an aspect of perception, subjectivity is not observable. There shall always be some part\nof subjective experience which cannot be accessed (or perceived or observed) by any\nother (regardless of the method used or the technique practiced). There shall always be\nsome part of subjective experience which is not available by/to any other, and cannot be\nperceived, accessed, or observed in any other, in any manner, even in principle.\n\nWithin the context of theory, neither subjectivity nor objectivity can be described or\nexplained purely in terms of the other. Subjective experience (or choice) does not arise\njust from objective being (causality) any more than objective being (causality) arises just\nfrom subjective experience (or choice). Neither is more fundamental than the other. The\ninteraction between the subjective and the objective (perception and expression) is more\nfundamental than either the subjective and/or the objective.\n\nA context of subjectivity cannot be defined purely in terms of content objectivity. No\nobjective content can be defined purely in terms of subjective context. Both subjectivity\nand objectivity must be considered as (and in terms of being) inherent and irreducible\naspects of all events, all interactivity, all communication.\n\nThere can be no objective theory (theory of physics) that will completely account for all\n(and all aspects of) subjective experience. There can be no subjective theory (religious\nrevelation, mysticism) which can account for all (and all aspects of) objective experience.\n\nNo amount of objective process will replace any amount of subjective experience;\nno amount of subjective choice will replace any amount of objective expression.\nThey are of equal value.\n\nAll Interactions (perceptions, expressions) are inherently unique in their instance.\nNo interaction can replace, or take the place of, any other. No experience can replace any\nother experience. All experiences (interactions) are equally valued.\n\nNo degree (even a very large degree) of knowing is equivalent to\nany degree (even a very small degree) of understanding.\nNo degree of understanding is equivalent to any degree of knowing.\nUnderstanding cannot replace, or create, knowing.\nKnowing cannot replace, or create, understanding.\n\nThere is no world that is completely independent of all selves and there is no self which is\ncompletely independent of all worlds. No single domain can account for, or be the source\nof, all subjective/self experience.\n\n```\nSubjectivity and Consensus 109\n```\n\nThe concept of consensus (a degree of objectivity of a world) is isomorphic with the\nconcept of a consistency of comparison. To create this consistency, there must be defined\na correspondence of the content of experience between multiple selves. To create (to\nknow that there are) alignments in the content of experience, a different order, level, or\n\nmeta-perception (experience) is necessary (intrinsic)^1. A multiplicity (at least more than\none) of domains/worlds is necessary to create alignments of experience (objectivity,\nconsensus) in any specific world.\n\nAll of objective reality is constructed via correspondences. There is no concrete absolute\nground of all being. There are only varying levels and degrees of correspondence between\n\nexperiences of consciousness^2.\n\nIn that a multiplicity of differing levels (domains) of interaction are necessary to establish\na consensus reality/world, correspondences of subjective experience (subjective because\nof their inter-domain character relative to any specific domain) are as much inherently a\npart of the foundation (composition basis) of objectivity as is any material aspect, (i.e.,\nwhat is defined on an existential basis, perfectly intra-domain). The degree of objectivity\n(an alignment between various multiple domains of self and world) is in part proportional\n\nto, and in part conjugate with, the degree of alignment in subjectivity^3.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. This is consistent with the second ring in the concept of objectivity (See Page 13). The meta-perception is a\n   coordination point (agreement) for the formation of an objectifying comparison. A constellation of such\n   coordination points provides a basis for the formation of stable consistent worlds.\n\nAs an example, consider as a metaphor a spaceship engaged in a docking procedure with a stationary space\nstation. The pilot will use visual feedback (i.e. interactions in the domain of electromagnetism) to guide the\ncraft to/towards the dock, so as to couple the ship and the station into one mechanical unit (i.e. a mechanical\nalignment in the domain of physical materials). In this example, the electromagnetic domain acts as a\nmeta-domain for establishing a correspondence in the domain of physical material.\n\n2. To understand the nature of consensus reality, consider a metaphor of sending e-mail from one computer to\n   another. An e-mail message is not transmitted by sending the physical computer, hard drive, etc. Rather there\n   is established a temporary correspondence between what the sender sees on the computer screen and what the\n   reader sees on their computer screen.\n3. Synchronicity, and co-incidence, are as much a part of what establishes (is necessary to establish) a\n   consensus universe (domain) as physical (i.e. as having substance). The part which is proportional is defined\n   by the contribution to the second ring of objectivity. The part which is conjugate is defined by the third ring of\n   objectivity.\n\n110 Mass and Energy\n\n#### Mass and Energy\n\nTo refer to a measure of energy is to refer to a difference of potential states. The concept\nof a state, structure, or configuration/pattern, and ultimately the concept of matter/mass\nitself, has the nature and essence of the modality of the omniscient. The concept of a\nrelation between states, a comparison of possibilities in terms of probability, (potentiality)\nand ultimately the concept of energy itself, has the nature of the modality of the\ntranscendent. The concept of measurement, interaction, transformation of states, force,\npower (and strength) and ultimately the concept of observation itself (light) has the nature\nand essence of the modality of the immanent.\n\nOnly things of Actuality can be measured/determined objectively. Potentiality, and\nanything of its kind (class/modality of the transcendent), can never be measured or\ndetermined (defined) objectively. Assessments of potentiality and improbability are of an\nintrinsically subjective nature.\n\nAn instance of observation (structured in no dimensions immanent) resolves an instance of\nan actuality (structured in one dimension; omniscient) from a class of potentialities\n(structured in two dimensions; transcendent). The event of selection itself does not have\nposition within either of the dimensions of the class of potentialities or within the\ndimension of the selected actuality. The selection/observation in itself is more basic than\neither the selected or the selector.\n\nThe more confined and isolated, the more dynamicism and potentiality will be developed.\nThe smaller and more confined an interaction is, the more energy will be required to\nperceive it.\n\n```\nDomain Constants 111\n```\n\n#### Domain Constants\n\nThe Planck constant and the speed of light are fundamental metrics of a domain in that\n\nthey define the microscopic and macroscopic limits of a domain^1. These constants define\nthe very limits of what can be known as a part of the domain from a perspective within\nthe domain (i.e., what is within the context of the domain as its content). Both of these\nconstants define and separate that which is actually known and potentially knowable from\n\nthat which is ultimately and irreducibly unknowable^2.\n\nThe degree to which a domain (and all eventities existing within that domain) will admit a\ndegree of objectivity (for an observer within that domain) is proportional to the span (in\nterms of orders of magnitude) between the C constant to the H constant of the domain.\n\nThe C constant is the omniscient modal macroscopic domain limit, (the analogue of the\nspeed of light, generalized and abstracted to any arbitrary domain). It defines that limit\n(boundary) at which changes in actuality (position/form) are no longer definable as being\npurely within the domain.\n\nThe H constant is the transcendent modal microscopic domain limit, (the analogue of the\nPlanck constant, generalized and abstracted to any arbitrary domain). It defines that limit\n(boundary) at which changes in potentiality (abstraction/scale) are no longer definable as\nbeing relevant to the domain.\n\nThe speed of light defines what is unknowable in terms of context. In that time and space\nare context metrics, the speed of light defines a boundary between which times and spaces\nare knowable (static) and which are (intrinsically) unknowable. The Planck constant\ndefines what is unknowable in terms of content. In that dynamic and static aspects of\npattern (energy/mass; momentum and position) are metrics of content, the Planck constant\ndefines a boundary between which dynamics are knowable, and which are (intrinsically)\nunknowable.\n\nThe degree of difference -- the span in orders of magnitude between the speed of light (the\nmacroscopic/context domain limit) and the Planck constant (the microscopic/content\ndomain limit) -- defines the total degree of structuralization of the domain, the total\nsubjective intensity or bandwidth that the domain has in communication involvement with\nthe self.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. The concept of 'this universe' as it is commonly used, is an instance of a domain (regardless of the\n   (incorrect) assumptions of 'specialness' or 'singularity').\n2. These constants are intrinsic to all domains; every domain will have some representation of these two\n   constants in some manner or other. However, each domain may have their own specific values for these\n   constants, particular to itself.\n\n112 Aspects of Time\n\n#### Aspects of Time\n\nThe degree to which time is regarded as objective is proportional to\nthe degree that time seems to resemble a dimension of space.\nThe degree to which time is regarded as subjective is proportional to\nthe degree that time seems to resemble a dimension of possibility.\n\nThe linear model of time has three aspects, past, present, and future. The image of the past\nas known in the present has the nature of the omniscient. Perception in the present has the\nnature of the immanent. The expectation of the future, as defined in the present, has the\nnature of the modality of the transcendent.\n\nFrom the perspective of the immanent self (the scale of the mesoscopic, the absolute\nboundary of consciousness and unconsciousness), past and future are asymmetric and\nconjugate to one another (and are defined in the terms of continuity). From a perspective\nwhich is purely omniscient (at the scale of the absolute macroscopic limit of a domain)\npast and future will appear to be symmetric. From the perspective of the absolute\nmicroscopic limit of a domain, past and future are identical, and are defined in terms of a\nstrict discontinuity of moments.\n\nFor all self perception in the present it must seem (cannot not seem) that the past is static,\n\nfixed, has fixed form, and could, at least in principle, be fully knowable and known^1. For\nall self perception in the present, it must seem (cannot not seem) that the future is\ndynamic, free, unknowable, and has no form. It must appear to all in the present that the\nfuture cannot ever, even in possibility, be fully known.\n\nThe past is the known. The present is the unknown. The future is the unknowable.\n\nThe single actuality of the one present arises out of a multiplicity of potential futures.\nThe one single existence of the past arises out of the multiplicity of interactions in the\npresent. The quality of one's future arises from the plurality of one's past.\n\nTime is an aspect of all events, as an intrinsic of those events. Energy (potentiality,\nrelations of system states) is an aspect of perception, rather than perception being an\naspect of energy. All of perception/experience involves time. An experience does not\nhappen in time; time is an aspect of an experience.\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n1. Even the past cannot be fully known: a person born into a life can only rely on \"histories\", \"signs\", and\n   \"records\" of what came \"before\", all of which are incomplete abstractions of the \"original real events\".\n   Beyond this indirect level of certainty, no definite meaning can be assigned to the past having an exact and\n   definite (knowable) state. Varying degrees of probabilistic prediction can be reached, but only with an\n   accuracy which diminishes the farther away one tries to extrapolate from the current here and now, in time,\n   space, domain of abstraction, and scale.\n\n```\nAspects of Time 113\n```\n\nTime is an aspect of events in the same manner that a horizon is an aspect of perception\n(one cannot not have a horizon). One's perception relative to one's self is always zero\nmotion. In the same way, the 'speed of light' is always a constant (consistent).\n\nWhere the incommensuration theorem asserts that the fundamental basis of consideration\ncannot regard anything as being both wholly symmetric and wholly continuous, that which\nis known or defined to be continuous must be asymmetric.\n\nContext and potentiality are asymmetric, and have direction/directivity. Aspects of\ninteraction/measurement/comparison which are contextual will have\ndirectivity/asymmetry.\n\nWithin perception, there is (cannot not be) an arrow of time that distinguishes past from\nfuture. Within perception, there is (cannot not be) an arrow of space, which distinguishes\nnear from far. Within perception, there is (cannot not be) an arrow of possibility.\n\nThe essence of the concept of evolution has the same basis as the essence of the necessary\nasymmetry of potentiality.\n\n114 The Being of Time\n\n#### On the Nature of the Being of Time\n\nBasically, asking whether or not time does or does not exist is similar to asking whether\nthe horizon does or does not exist. When one asks the same conventional questions about\nthe existence or non-existence of time one has the same sort of problems that one would\nfind if one would ask those same questions about the horizon.\n\nWith respect to self, the horizon is always in the same place, somewhere far away. When\none tries to move toward the horizon, it moves with one's perspective, because it is an\nelement of one's perception. The horizon is created out of perception, more than it is\ncreated out of anything that \"exists\" apart from ourselves.\n\nIn the same way, time is created \"out of perception\". With respect to a person, time is\nalways moving exactly in one direction, straight forward. When one tries to \"catch up\"\nwith time, or change the direction of the flow of time, one has the same sort of problems\nthat one would if one were trying to \"catch up\" with the horizon. The net effect is that the\nhorizon is in the same \"place\", no matter how fast one is moving or where one is standing.\nIn consideration of theories like general relativity, the same sort of phenomena shows up.\nRegardless of the motion of the observer, his sense of time is always exactly the same,\nalways straight forward.\n\nIn the same way that the horizon exists as an aspect of one's perception on the surface of a\nworld, time exists as an aspect of one's perception in a domain. In the same way that the\nhorizon does not have any sort of substantial or objective nature beyond an effect of the\nevent of perception itself, time does not have any sort of substantial or objective nature\nbeyond being an aspect of perception itself.\n\nWhere considering from a transcendental perspective, as assuming that one is standing at\n'all locations at once', there would be no effective concept of 'a horizon'. Similarly, when\nin a transcendental orientation with respect to a domain, time becomes 'simultaneous' and\nhas no effective realization. However, it is intrinsic to the nature of being in interaction\nwith a domain to have a self at a locus. Similarly, it is intrinsic to the nature of having an\ninteraction with a domain that time will be an aspect of one's experience. Any act of\nperception will create a (subjective) sense of time, in the same way that the simple act of\nperception creates a personal horizon.\n\n```\nThe Being of Time 115\n```\n\nIn a similar manner as with the horizon, one cannot extend the concept of time to be\nconsidered as an objective context (i.e., independent of one's subjective perception). For\nexample, map makers do not extrapolate 'the horizon' to any particular location on the\nmap. On modern maps, one does not usually find a circle or a line with the label 'the world\nends here'. As such, it is unreasonable to try to extrapolate from one's personal sense of\ntime to a framework more inclusive of other people (or anything outside of ourselves) in\nsome fundamental manner. Similarly, to regard the external frame of reference of time as\nin some way more basic than the time frame of reference that is within self is to allow the\nreal existential difficulties to begin. Instead of taking one's own natural, internal frame of\nreference and using that as the basis of time, one is expected (conventionally) to start with\nan external reference, and then try to derive a sense of time from the external reference.\n\nAs an inherent aspect of interaction, (i.e. of both perception and of expression) time is\ninherently both subjective and objective. Wherever self is, wherever self interacts (and has\nbeing), that self will have time (and the arrow of time).\n\nTime cannot be found in an equation, or in anything more \"objective and solid\", than the\nprocess of the perceptual interaction itself (which is rather insubstantial). What physics\nmust assume to implement the scientific method itself (including the assumption of\nsubjective time) cannot be studied by physics. Physics cannot study the assumption and\ntechnique of (and the correctness of the assumption and technique of) the scientific\nmethod by using the scientific method. Physics cannot study that which it must assume.\n\nIn that measurement, as realized in the scientific method, is an interaction, it therefore has\nand assumes all of the intrinsics of interaction. Along with notions like content and\ncontext, the subjective and the objective, notions like force and time are intrisnsics of\ninteraction. In that it is inherent to the nature of time to be a common context of both the\nsubjective and the objective, the concept of time is of a purely metaphysical nature (if\ntime were only the context of the objective, it could be claimed to have a purely physical\nnature). Time is not another dimension of space. It is a common coordinating aspect\n(context) of directivity in interaction. Time is not only physical, it is also metaphysical.\nPhysics, as the study of the physical, cannot define, or study, that what it must assume to\nbe before it begins.\n\nIf one defines time with respect to the interaction between self and world, there is a \"time\"\nbasis with respect to each self in whatever domain that self happens to be \"in\". The above\nscenario follows easily because each \"self\" has its own frame of reference that is \"made\"\nout of the very process of perception (as a special case of interaction) itself. Because time\nis defined with respect to the interaction, each interacting self will have its own past,\npresent, and future.\n\n116 The Being of Time\n\nOne cannot \"run away\" from this frame of reference any more than one can run away\nfrom the horizon. Similarly, one may understand why the speed of light is a constant if one\ncompares it to one's horizon (as a metaphor), because both of these terms are defined with\nrespect as a relation of (interaction to) self.\n\nThe \"linear time\" stream that one may call 'the consensus universe' is a reconstructive\nalignment of all of these \"times\", in the same way that a common space is constructed out\nof all of the immediate interactions to form the/a \"consensus domain structure\".\n\n```\nModality Correspondences 117\n```\n\n## Table of Modality Correspondences\n\nNote: Some of these correspondences are context dependant and will shift depending on\nthe mode of consideration.\n\nTranscendent Immanent Omniscient\nassociative. logical\nbecoming doing being\nbosons. fermions\nbottom up. top down\nchoice change causality\nclarity. opacity\ncoherency structure significance\ncomparisons interactions relations\ncomplexity. simplicity\nconnotative. denotative\nconsciousness perception attention\nconsistency. completeness\ncontent. context\ncontinuity comparison symmetry\ncorrespondence object model\ncreation interaction existence\ncreativity. experience\ndeeply well fully\ndependence interdependence independence\ndescriptive. proscriptive\ndiversity plurality unity\ndoing. being\ndreamer dreaming dreamed\ndynamic. static\ndynamicism. stability\nempirical. analytic\nenergy (strength) force power\nentropy temperature heat\nepistemology. ontology\nethics. morality\nexpansive. constrictive\nexpression. perception\nfaith. reason\nfeeling. form\nfreedom. limitation\nfrequency. density\nfuture present past\nh_constant. c_constant\nhologram point/light photograph\nidealism. realism\nidentity relation domain\nimplicit. explicit\ninduction. deduction\ninequality positivity equality\ninfinite. finite\ninfinitesimal subconscious horizon\n\n118 Table\n\nTranscendent Immanent Omniscient\ninfluence. control\ninstance. class\ninstruction. abstraction\nintercompositional. interexclusionary\ninterdomain. intradomain\ninternal boundary external\nintuition. intellect\ninvisible. apparent\njoy intensity pain\nknower knowing known\nlimitation stasis vacuum\nmetaphysical. physical\nmicroscopic mesoscopic macroscopic\nmodalities. axioms\nmultiple (plural). single\nmysticism and magic religion and spirituality science and technology\nmythic. factual\nnovelty intensity consistency (rhythm)\nobjective real exist\nobserver observation observed\nopen. closed\noriginality effectiveness generality\npart. whole\npassive. active\nperceiver perception perceived\nperfection. permanence\npersonal. political (impersonal)\nphotons. electrons\nPlanck constant. speed of light\npossibility selection consequence\npotentiality. actuality\nprecision. accuracy\nprediction description explanation\nprivate. public\nprobability potentiality possibility\nprobability in possibility force in time mass in space\nprobable potential possible\nquality. quantity\nquestion directive assertion (answer)\nrelative. absolute\nrespond act react\nsameness. difference\nscale direction position\nself relation world (reality)\nsignificance communication information\nsimilarity inclusion proximity\nsimultaneous time linear time cyclic time\n\n```\nModality Correspondences 119\n```\n\nTranscendent Immanent Omniscient\nsubject. object\nsubjective. objective\nsufficiency. necessity\nsymbolic language literal\nsynthesis. analysis\nthrough. across\nto create. to find or discover\ntransformation and specification irreversibility and direction distinction and characteristic\ntransparency reflection adsorption\ntransparent illumination opaque\ntrine monism dualism\nunderstanding consciousness knowing\nunknowable unknown known\nvalue meaning (significance) purpose\nwell. fully\nwhy and how who and what when and where\nwithin. without\nwork through work with work on\nzero unit extent\n\n120 Index\n\n#### Endnote: A Readers Covenant\n\nThe author asks that the reader not attempt to simplify this material for re-presentation to\nothers. Beyond a certain natural point, a concept cannot be simplified further without\ndamaging its essence. Most of the content herein has already been distilled to the\nmaximum extent possible and cannot be further simplified. Each word of each statement\nhas been carefully considered and selected for maximum correctness and utility of\nmeaning. The omission of a single word, via misquoting, or even a slight change of\nordering, can subtly damage and distort the intended meaning.\n\nDistortions of significance (a loss of clarity when attempting to oversimplify an idea) can\noccur in ways that remain unnoticed, even though they eventually cause much\nmisunderstanding, and if unchecked, mis-application. Therefore, the tendency (and the\ncommon desire) to simplify these concepts must be avoided. Keep the aphorisms intact.\nTo realize the best possible long term benefit of these ideas (in our culture), leave the\naphorisms and essay concepts as is, unchanged.\n",

    "description": "For the full show notes visit: https://neurohacker.com/how-we-lost-our-sovereignty-and-how-to-get-it-back-with-jordan-greenhall\n\nWhat is sovereignty, how have we lost it, and why do we need it? These are just a few of the questions discussed and answered on Collective Insights as Neurohacker cofounder Jordan Greenhall joins Daniel for an intriguing conversation. Greenhall sets the foundation for why incentives are the way they are today and why our society should make a transition from Game A to Game B. As a way to accomplish this and help people gain more sovereignty, Greenhall looks at the emergent cryptoeconomic systems being developed and how they might apply in different areas such as healthcare. He also discusses the history of U.S. education and why we need to rethink how people learn in order to promote a greater degree of sovereignty.",

Jordan participated in the Aspen Institute and the Santa Fe Institute where he served on the Board of Trustees for five years.\n\nAfter one week on an early Neurohacker Collective stack, he was convinced about the power and potential of this new technology and joined Daniel Schmachtenberger and James Schmachtenberger to bring it to the world.\n----\nThe topic is Sovereignty. Sovereignty is an individual’s capacity to respond to the world. The three elements of sovereignty are perception, sense-making and meaning-making, and action.\n\nJordan defines sovereignty in his essay as, “It is the ability to be present to the world and to respond to the world — rather than to be overwhelmed or merely reactive. Sovereignty is to be a conscious agent.”\n____\nKey Highlights\n\n- Why Jordan is excited about Donald Trump\n\n- What is sovereignty?\n\n- The historical transition underway, the factors which could lead to an apocalyptic moment, and how it might end a utopian future\n\n- Three key elements of sovereignty\n\n- Where to start if you want build sovereignty\n\n- How to scale from individual to collective sovereignty\n\n- The role of blockchain in accomplishing global sovereignty\n\n- What is Qualia and Qualia Mind?\n_____\nIf you want to try Qualia and Qualia Mind, head over to neurohacker.com.

    "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RfyHqkb8YJY/mqdefault.jpg",
    "description": "New videos DAILY: https://bigth.ink\n\nJoin Big Think Edge for exclusive video lessons from top thinkers and doers: https://bigth.ink/Edge\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRussian hacking is less \"guys-in-hoodies-doing-big-nefarious-things\" than it is a few dozen people trying hundreds of smaller things to see what catches on and gets sent up the information ladder. Jordan Greenhall explains that what the Russian hacking units are doing is being ever changing and ever fluid and essentially flooding misinformation into parts of the internet—governments and companies and individuals included—so that the traditional American \"top down decision making\" process gets confused. After all, you're much more likely to believe an email coming from your boss than one coming from \"vlad@moscowhackercollective.biz\".\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJORDAN GREENHALL\n\nJordan is now in his 17th year of building disruptive technology companies, and is the co-founder and CEO of Neurohacker Collective. \n\n\r\nEarly in his career, he helped start the online digital video revolution as co-founder and CEO of DivX. After somewhat successfully navigating two financial crises and an IPO (and going down in flames at Stage6), he left the helm at DivX to return his attention to the big picture. He tried his hand at capitalism – combining Angel investment at the sharp edge of the Schumpeter wave — with participation in a number of think tanks and institutes; most notably, the Aspen Institute and the Santa Fe Institute where he served on the Board of Trustees for five sweet years.\n\n\r\nThis exposure led him to the conclusion that humanity is in the midst of a world historical transition which will likely kill all of us (see Mad Max) but just might end in a truly amazing future (see Star Trek). Getting there is going to require many things of us – most notably a significant upgrade of our individual and collective capacity for thought and action.\n\n\r\nAlthough he has long benefitted from entheogens, Jordan had not spent much time on nootropics or other Neurohacking techniques. After one week on an early NHC stack, he was convinced about the power and potential of this new technology and co-created Neurohacker Collective to bring it to the world.\n\n\n\n\r\n \n\n\r\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nJordan Greenhall: All right. So let's do Russian hacking. And what I want to do is I want to put quotes around \"Russian hacking\" because we're actually talking about a question of how we go about making sense of everything all together. So \"Russian hacking\" is not an event as much as it is a phenomenon that describes a very large number of things that different individuals, depending on the particular location in the social field, interpret differently.\n\n\r\nSo yes I think this is an excellent example of this new emergent mechanism of how we go about doing social control. And it's interesting because if you're looking at \"Russian hacking\" from the blue church perspective you're actually thinking about something that isn't actually how it's working and you're going to be making particular mistakes. So you will think I think, I mean certainly I'm defining the blue church so certainly if you are in the blue church modality you will think that there is some kind of hierarchical control structure with a small number of decision-makers, we will call them the Russians, who are principally responsible for the behavior of the system under investigation. So you are looking for an expertise hierarchy, somebody who is in charge and how their expertise hierarchy is percolating downward in its downward causation fashion to generate the results of what you're seeing.\n\n\r\nAnd that's actually not an appropriate evaluation of what's actually going on. Instead \"Russian hacking\" and the degree to which there is a specific understanding on the part of the Russians, which there certainly is they're clearly, what is the phrase somebody used—“punching up”?—They're clearly dramatically more effective right now than one should expect them to be given their actual capacity and power in the world because of the higher quality strategy in this new decentralized environment is I think actually recognizing the obsolescence of that notion of a top down decision-making framework where one of the primary strategies is to find people who are operating in that fashion and throw effectively sand in their eyes, create obfuscation mechanisms that cause top down decision making trees to have a hard time either understanding what's coming up to them or having their actuation potentials move down while simultaneously being part of a very large d...\n\nFor the full transcript, check out https://bigthink.com/videos/jordan-greenhall-how-russias-election-meddling-created-a-new-kind-of-propaganda",

And for Greenhall, the election of Donald Trump is merely a bi-product of profound changes in the nature of how we understand the world and how we relate to each other. The underlying mediating structures of society have outlived their usefulness, according to Greenhall. And if he’s right, we’d better be prepared to strap in and hang on; the next 10 years is going to get really, really interesting -- and fast.\n\nwww.futurefrontiers.co\nIG: @future.frontiers",

    "description": "Jordan Greenhall talks about “Combining Intuition with Rational Mind – a more effective solution in Business” in this episode of the Intuitive Leadership Mastery Podcast with host Michael Light. Jordan is now in his seventeenth year of building disruptive technology companies. Classic “Ready Player One” style 80’s nerd. Comics, science fiction, computers, way too much TV and role-playing games. Oh, so many role playing games. Naturally, these interests led to a deep dive into contemporary philosophy (particularly the works of Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda), artificial intelligence and complex systems science in college in the early 90’s and then, as the Internet was exploding into the world, a few years at Harvard Law School of all places where he spent time with Larry Lessig, Jonathan Zittrain and Cornel West examining the coevolution of human civilization and technology.\n\n\n\nHere are some of the topics discussed in the podcast:\n\nJordan’s creative and writing process that lets him write in depth new ideas such as in his viral article “Situational Assessment 2017”. And the role of intuition in this.\nWhy getting inside your opponent’s OODA loop is key in politics or business.\nObserve – Intuition helps observe\nOrient – make meaning – intuition\nDecide – Intuition helps you make faster decisions\nAct – Inspired Actions, Play and Feedback help faster actions\nThe highest bandwidth OODA loop wins.\nWhat is a meme is and why it matter to your business + the dark arts of copywriting\nThe medium is the message – the change in tech is a phase quality shift – changes the game and unpredicabile\nWhy fighting the “last war” is a mistake in politics or business\nWorld Culture War II: The opportunities in the dramatic current changes in sense and nature of identity, meaning, and purpose\nActions to take now\nResources:\n\nJordan’s Situational Assessment 2017: Trump Edition https://medium.com/deep-code/situational-assessment-2017-trump-edition-d189d24fc046#.dtku79bam\nJordan’s Situational Analysis 2017 https://medium.com/deep-code/situational-assessment-2017-trump-edition-d189d24fc046#.15mdrg3qk\nVinital Roy – redefined reality as how much is shared – how realized it is\nA meme https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme is “an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture”. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Memes are the cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.\nThe Selfish Gene by Richard Dwakins https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Science-ebook/dp/B01GI5F2FS/?tag=abundant0e-20\nThe Meme Machine Susan Blackwell https://www.amazon.com/Meme-Machine-Popular-Science/dp/019286212X/?tag=abundant0e-20\nTrust Me, I’m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator by Ryan Holiday https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0074VTHH0/?tag=abundant0e-20\nThe Zeitgeist https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist_(film_series)\nThe Medium and the Message: Understanding the Information World by Marshall McLuhan https://www.amazon.com/Medium-Message-Understanding-Information-World/dp/1635358566/?tag=abundant0e-20\nThe OODA loop by John Boyd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop\nThe 7 Day Startup: You Don’t Learn Until You Launch by Dan Norris https://www.amazon.com/Day-Startup-\nLearn-Until-Launch-ebook/dp/B00NZFKB8S/?tag=abundant0e-20\nWar in Age of Intelligent Machine by Manuel De Landa https://www.amazon.com/War-Intelligent-Machines-Manuel-Landa/dp/0942299752/?tag=abundant0e-20\nLearn more about Jordan Greenhall at:\n\n*Website: http://neurohacker.com/\n*Profile: http://neurohacker.com/jordan-greenhall/\n*Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/neurohackercollective/\n\nGet show notes and transcript at:\nhttp://intuitiveleadershipmastery.com/podcast/combining-intuition-with-rational-mind-a-more-effective-solution-in-business/",

    "title": "The Rivalrous, the Non-Rivalrous and the Anti-Rivalrous",
    "description": "﻿It seems useful to spend some time on the notions of the “rivalrous,” the “non-rivalrous” and the “anti-rivalrous”.  Both in terms of getting to some clarity and specificity but what is meant with these ideas and in terms of getting some nuance on how to use them in life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn initial distinction is that each of these three terms have meaning in two distinct senses: an interior/subjective sense and an exterior/objective sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaken in the *subjective,* the “rivalrous” refers to a mind-set or a disposition that is biased towards “winning” in some kind of rivalrous game.  It is strategic.  While it can be cooperative - it cooperates only as part of a larger strategy that is careful to ensure that if / when it comes to win/lose, it is the one that wins.  By contrast the “non-rivalrous” refers to a mind-set or disposition that is biased towards sharing in and/or protecting some kind of non-rivalrous commons.  It is cooperative without a larger strategy - even to the point of self-harm.  In three-player repeated games, they might map to “saints”.  Within this context, there is an interesting disposition we might think of as the “protector rivalrous”.  Or “tit-for-tat” this disposition is in some sense default non-rivalrous but is sensitive to defection and will shift to a strong rivalrous (even to the extent to self-harm) disposition when it believes that it is in relationship with a rivalrous player.   There are likely many different variations on this kind of complex mixture - so nuanced is the tension between the rivalrous and the non-rivalrous.\r\n\r\nFrom the subjective sense, the “anti-rivalrous” refers to a mind-set or disposition that is biased towards curiosity, exploration and collaboration.  It tends to be oblivious to or ineffective in rivalrous games.  It tends to be generative and creative in non-rivalrous games.  The anti-rivalrous disposition can’t really be understood without looking at the “objective” side of the coin. In a world that lives only on the continuum between actively rivalrous (things are really scarce right now) and potentially rivalrous (things are relatively plentiful right now), the anti-rivalrous doesn’t make much sense.  But this continuum isn’t the whole story.  There is an aspect of Reality that is intrinsically anti-rivalrous.\r\n\r\nSo - now to the objective side of the coin.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaken from the “objective” sense, the rivalrous refers to phenomena in the world that both can be and are scarce.  If there are three of us and there is only enough water for one of us, that water is rivalrous.  One will drink and three will go thirsty (or, possibly, everyone will go thirsty- but only for a little while).  The non-rivalrous refers to a phenomenon that can be scarce - but isn’t (yet).  If there are three of us and plenty of water for all, the water is non-rivalrous.  Obviously, in this sense, the difference between rivalrous and non-rivalrous is contextual.  Add more people or lose some of the water and a once non-rivalrous thing can become rivalrous.  Subtract people or add water and a once rivalrous thing can become non-rivalrous.  This is important.  We might call this the “rivalrous continuum”.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the anti-rivalrous is *intrinsically* not scarce.  It can not be scarce (although it can be non-existent or unevenly distributed and it can be made “scarce-like” more on that in a bit).  The very notion of “anti-rivalrous” is anti-rivalrous.  The idea can be shared among three people or three million people - and there is nothing about the sharing that dilutes or reduces its presence or value.  We can all “have” the idea without anyone losing anything (or, to be precise, without anyone losing anything except for the time and energy associated with rivalrous substrate necessary to communicate the anti-rivalrous).\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that a rivalrous mind-set might object here that by “giving away” a valuable idea, I might be diluting its value.  But this is an error stemming from a long habit of living in and with a rivalrous mindset.  The rivalrous mindset sees everything through the rivalrous lens and, therefore, has a hard time conceiving of value that isn’t in terms of winning a rivalrous game.  While it is the case that I can use my exclusive awareness of an anti-rivalrous thing (like, say, an innovation in fusion energy that I just came up with) as leverage in a rivalrous strategy this doesn’t mean that the notion is rivalrous.  Only that it can be used as (or “rendered”) rivalrous.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is important.   As far as we can tell, in the context of the Real, the anti-rivalrous is always bounded by communication.  And communication is always bounded by some medium of communication - some rivalrous substrate (be that neurons, air, radiowaves, hard drive space, etc.).  Conceptually, it is important to decouple the essence of the anti-rivalrous from the (as far as we know) necessity of some rivalrous medium.  The process of ephemeralization is due to this decoupling.  I can move a given anti-rivalrous idea from a “heavy” medium (say engravings in a stone tablet) to a “light” medium (say photons on an LCD screen) without losing anything in the idea.  The idea is anti-rivalrous, communications can be rivalrous.\r\n\r\nClose the communications and the anti-rivalrous can be used in rivalrous games.  Open the communications and you begin to find yourself in an anti-rivalrous game.  Moreover, the anti-rivalrous is the source of innovation and, hence, to moving the actually scarce to the potentially scarce (from rivalrous to non-rivalrous).   We can call this the “anti-rivalrous continuum”.    \r\n\r\n\r\nSo now we have a matrix of the subjective and objective senses of these three things and the notion of two continuua: [Rivalrous <-- Non-Rivalrous] [Anti-rivalrous:: Non-rivalrous <- Rivalrous]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the inquiry is to notice that the relationships among them aren’t simple.  For example, some might say that it is “better” to have a non-rivalrous disposition (“sharing is caring”).  However, if we truly find ourselves in a rivalrous competition over real and actual scarcity, a non-rivalrous disposition will simply “lose” and be extinguished from the game.  The reverse situation is much more subtle.  If the context is non-rivalrous, selecting a rivalrous disposition is a particular move - sometimes known in game theory as “defection” or becoming a “free rider”.  The problem here, of course, is that the rivalrous player in a non-rivalrous game will tend to convert the non-rivalrous game into a rivalrous game!  i.e., turning a context where everyone can win into one where at least some must lose.   If we select a meta-strategy that can state-switch from rivalrous to non-rivalrous, we will find a higher optimum (e.g., tit for tat).\r\n\r\nIf you have a default or ideological “rivalrous” mindset, this notion might land to you as simply “being smarter than everyone else” or “not being the sucker”.  If you have a default “non-rivalrous” mindset, the rivalrous mindset would land as “being an asshole”.  In any event, the foundational linkage between the rivalrous and non-rivalrous keeps these moves in constant play.  Hence the tragedy of the commons - in non-rivalrous games, non-rivalrous players need to constantly try to police rivalrous players or the game will for sure change to rivalrous (and, thence, to either a static rivalrous equilibrium or some sort of collapse depending on the relative power of the agents and the strength of the context).  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation of the anti-rivalrous (taken in the “objective” sense) is different.  The leverage/power of an anti-rivalrous disposition in the context of anti-rivalrous phenomenon can be extremely powerful.  This is a meta-game.  While, for example, keeping language restricted to an elite might seem like a good move in a rivalrous game, any group that allows language the be shared widely will roundly outcompete such a “language-limited” strategy.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThus: from the point of view of the rivalrous disposition, the anti-rivalrous aspect of the world is *THE* key to winning.  But this means trying to capture an anti-rivalrous disposition within a rivalrous meta-container.  I.e., get the scientists to cooperate, but always keep them dependent on funding.  By contrast, the anti-rivalrous can have the result of ameliorating scarcity and, therefore, rendering the rivalrous strategy the losing strategy.  From the anti-rivalrous point of view, the portion of the world that is on the Rivalrous continuum should be approached with a non-rivalrous disposition, supporting an anti-rivalrous disposition in the anti-rivalrous domain so as to generate a real movement of the rivalrous to the non-rivalrous.",

    "description": "Commitments:\n\n* I choose the path of Sovereignty.  I choose to take full responsibility for myself in relationship with myself, other people and the world.  I accept that this path is never ending and that the simple choice to undertake it is the first of many (often challenging) steps.\n* I choose to always endeavor to find the highest and best relationship with all others.  I will seek to find a way of being in relationship that elevates both their Sovereignty and my own Sovereignty ongoingly.\n* I will apply Rules Alpha and Omega in my relationships with all who are in earnest and are in good faith trying to play game~b.\n* I will treat this community with respect and care.\n* I will take the time and undertake the effort necessary to realize these Commitments without compromise or excuse.\n* I understand that we are all learning and that this thing is hard.  I will practice compassion, humility and forgiveness for myself and others.\n\nPrinciples:\n\n* The Principle of Curiosity.  Curiosity before knowing.  If you already know how to do this thing, please just do it (elsewhere).  This is not a place to market your program or beat the drum of your preferred ideology.  It is a place where people can come and explore how to step into this new possibility themselves.  A primary virtue, therefore, is curiosity.  Be curious and play with curiosity.\n* The Principle of Discernment. Learn how to listen carefully.  Both to find the signal and upregulate it and to find the noise and downregulate it.  The effort here is more about building capacity in Discernment than in trying to get to the “truth” or the “right answer” in this Facebook group.  This is more of a place of practice than of content.\n* The Principle of Focus.  Focus on game~b.  There is a fundamental assumption here that Game A and game~b are different and that Game A is not “the way”.  Accordingly, this is not a place for trying to play Game A better.  This is not a place to discuss Game A politics, policies or current events.  This is a place to begin to learn how to play game~b. It can actually be quite hard leaving the buzz and salience of the Game A world behind.  Practice focus.",

    "description": "Amidst all of the big changes and uncertainty we're experiencing in the world today, we can come to all kinds of conclusions about what it all means and how we fit into the picture. One common story we hear from well-intentioned activists fighting against wealth inequality and climate change: the accumulation of wealth is evil. The rich are destroying the planet. The 1% meme has even held some ground since the days of Occupy Wall Street, taken up as a rallying cry by Democratic Socialists. \n\nI wonder if there's another story. Speaking for myself, I have all kinds of twisted narratives around money. I need to be making enough to feel worthy and attract a mate. If I'm not providing, I have no value. Wealth accumulation is for the greedy and I'm not so I'll do my best to avoid it, etc. \n\nToday (for my first livestream!) my guest is Jordan Hall. Jordan has made the rounds on various podcasts and YouTube channels  discussing a wide range of things, namely the idea of cultivating sovereignty as a necessary step in the path to becoming a more effective agent in the world. \n\nBefore he started studying complexity at The Santa Fe Institute and writing posts on Medium about our failing institutions, Jordan was a highly successful tech entrepreneur. Jordan's wealth gave him the freedom to enter rooms and ask questions that would have been unthinkable had he been working a traditional 9-5. \n\nWhat is money? How do we rid ourselves of unhelpful, debilitating stories our wealth? Is it possible to ethically create wealth in the current climate?  \n\nJoin us for what is sure to be a mind-bending, heart-opening conversation. \n\n___________\n\nAll of my links:\nwww.linktr.ee/collinofzion",

One is a kind of unlearning– we unlearn the old social conditioning, and re-connect with our natural human enthusiasm for being together. There is an evolutionary dynamic underlying the complex processes of human relating. This is the basis of self-organization that we can trust. There is also the challenge for us to become more than we have been before. This is part of the adventure and never ending story that emerges as we build trust with each other.",

Now she is an associate editor of the internationally acclaimed Integral Review Journal.\n\nHer Insight Training program is dedicated to helping people tap into the transformational power of the mind in its natural state. Insight Training workshops activate intuitive awareness by cultivating the ability to perceive the world directly, and the capacity to experience equanimity. When mind is in its natural state, we can discover what is possible that has never been possible before.",

    "description": "QUALIA NOOTROPIC 10% OFF CODE WF10: http://bit.ly/2jkzRhW\nSHOW BONUS: http://www.wellnessforce.com/Qualia \nASK A QUESTION: http://www.wellnessforce.com/voice\n\n\"We fully believe that optimized human beings lead to a better world. People being productive and creative in whatever it is that is theirs to do. But in many ways, our modern world works against us.” - Daniel Schmachtenberger, Co-Founder of The NeuroHacker Collective \n\nOn this special episode of Wellness Force Radio, Daniel shares far beyond how Nootropics like Qualia can provide a comprehensive hardware upgrade for radical cognitive enhancement and emotional resilience, but also how he believes it is creating the building blocks towards a better planet.\n\nYou, The N Equals One - http://nuerohacker.com/ref/28/\n\nIn a world of mass distractions, responsibilities, cumulative stressors and more notifications than ever in the palms of hands, millions of Americans have long since met their cognitive and emotional capacity. \n\nCognitive capacity is a nuanced relationship between many variables. Optimizing for one variable of cognitive function at the expense of other critical ones would not give us the result of comprehensive enhancement of human capability. For instance, having drive without the ability to focus well, or willpower without emotional resilience. For that reason, The Neurohacker Collective have designed a formula that deliberately balances subjective effects to give meaningful enhancement in a comprehensive way – a whole system upgrade called Qualia.\n\nIf you're here reading, you felt the call towards Qualia. If you're in the contemplation phase or in the process of learning, this is an optimal time for your N=1.\n\nWhat is N=1?\n\nN-of-1 or single subject clinical trials consider an individual patient as the sole unit of observation in a study investigating the efficacy or side-effect profiles of different interventions. The ultimate goal of an n-of-1 trial is to determine the optimal or best intervention for an individual patient using objective data-driven criteria.\n\nYour N=1\n\nFrom baseline to Qualia for 4 weeks, here are the 5 steps to start your own personal N=1 experiment in emotional resilience and cognitive performance: \n\nInspired Action: Order your 30 day supply of Qualia - http://nuerohacker.com/ref/28/\n\nBaseline: Once your Qualia is received, take a baseline memory, reason, concentration and/or comprehensive cognitive test(s) on either Quantified Mind or Cambridge Brain Sciences and mark the date\n\nStage 1: Begin stage 1 of Qualia on an empty stomach each morning for 30 days. Download the Qualia Quick Start Guide for full directions on stage 2 and total program here: http://wellnessforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quickstart-Guide.pdf\n\nJournal: Each day for 30 days, journal for 5-7 minutes after your meditation session, or at minimum, during the same time each day.\nAfter 30 days: Congrats, you did it! How do you feel? What did you learn about yourself and Qualia? Now, reassess the same tests again for memory, reason, concentration and/or comprehensive cognitive performance (then email Josh and tell him how you feel!) \njosh (at)wellnessforce.com",

What can we gain from studying our subjective experience of reality? Daniel Schmachtenburger has spent his life blending different fields to bring together a new story of the evolution of our universe. Join us as we explore the concepts of emergence, synergy, and self-organization.  And how understanding these as individuals and within our scientific communities, assist us in understanding the nature, breadth, and urgency of our global challenges. \n\nAbout the Guest: \n\nDaniel has a trans-disciplinary science background within a whole systems, complexity, and integral framework. He loves solving seemingly intractable problems by reassessing the foundational data and axioms of a field and then restructuring it from the ground up. \n\nHe began seriously studying health and neurology when afflicted with neurological and autoimmune illnesses that had no known solutions in either allopathic or complementary medicine. The insights that led to his healing came from developing a new model for understanding physiology and pathology, which he then applied to helping many people address various forms of complex illness and optimize their capabilities beyond their previous healthy baselines. \n\nDaniel was the academic dean for a college of mind-body medicine and has consulted for many cutting edge integrative doctors and medical clinics to help find novel solutions for complex cases. He created and ran a cutting edge think tank developing complex systems solutions for environmental and social issues, and has directed a transdisciplinary group of scholars on a philosophy of mind project addressing core questions of mind/brain interface and developing an axiomatic reformulation for the epistemology of neuroscience. \n\nHe has a significant background with and love for nootropics, meditation, depth psychology,psychedelics,  and all effective tools for evolving states and stages of consciousness and evolving the human experience.",

In order to restore our meaning in life, we need to take care to heal the root of our addictions and patterns and understand the interconnectedness of life and earth. Deep down, we all want what is best for ourselves and each other, but often sacrifice exposing the truth out of fear of losing our belonging and sense of security. Listen in to find out what kind of conversation needs to happen to create a more beautiful world for everyone.\n\nFor full show notes visit: https://neurohacker.com/restoring-humanity-exploring-our-connections-to-earth-each-other",

    "description": "Marc, Barbara, and Daniel sit down together to reflect on Barbara’s session from the Center for Integral Wisdom course, Becoming a Future Human. Marc points out that we are locating ourselves in this unique moment in time, reminding us that we might not actually survive as a species if we do not become a Future Human. Facing the fact that each of us is going to die is what Marc calls the First Shock of Existence. Facing the potential extinction of our entire species and destruction of the biosphere is what Marc calls the Second Shock of Existence. The only response to this Second Shock is a transformation of identity in which we actually become the Future Human.\n\nBarbara introduces her famous term, Conscious Evolution, in this conversation. Even though evolution has been happening for billions of years, we are the first generation to be conscious of evolution and conscious that we are affecting evolution; not only that, we are evolution self-aware.\n\nDaniel notes that the universe story that Barbara shared is scientifically literate and also has purpose and meaning while giving us a place and role in the universe. As systems evolve to greater and greater complexity on the exterior, the capacity for greater interior subjective experience deepens as well. More and more complex biology leads to the development of the neocortex and with that the capacity for abstraction and to put oneself outside of the present moment and contemplate the past and the future. With these capabilities, we are able to take greater responsibility, not just for ourselves, but for our impact on the whole.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n-What the Goldilocks Principle is\n\n-That Future Humans are alive now and you are probably one of them; otherwise, you wouldn’t care about this course\n\n-The universe isn’t a fact, it’s a story and we’re the stars of that story\n\n-The definition of prima facie\n\n-Why it is critical that we start taking greater responsibility, not just for our own lives, but for the whole\n\nView the entirety of this course: https://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

    "description": "Barbara begins by saying that Daniel’s session felt like a self-portrait of a Future Human to her. Having considered Daniel an evolutionary son for a long time now, Barbara feels proud seeing his ability to respond to the complexity of the current global situation with such grace, charm, and even pleasure. Marc reminds us of the importance of embodying the teachings; this is the place in history where there can’t be a split. We must become the teachings, as each of these teachers illustrates so beautifully.\n\nMany subjects are covered in this conversation, from reconciling autonomy and communion, and certainty and uncertainty, to using technology to address the next level of connectivity between human imaginal cells around the world. Marc brings up the concept of “tantra,” or the principle of non-rejection, where nothing is left out and everything has a place at the table in a higher level of consciousness. They note that this recurring theme of embracing elements of humanity that have been rejected and integrating them has been even more prominent in the course than they had even realized before they sat down together.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    How human history can be traced through the lens of different approaches to reconciling the split between autonomy and communion\n    How Unique Self is the place where the split between autonomy and communion disappears\n    How technology can address the neural net membrane and connectivity of the human imaginal cells around the world\n    Why both Liberals and Fundamentalists don’t practice tantra very well\n    How certainty and uncertainty can be reconciled and how Barbara practices that in meditation\n    This course is a post-Liberal and post-Fundamentalist course, emergent by nature, which takes the best of both and integrates everything in a higher way\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

There, Daniel is focused on developing processes and technologies for advancing medicine and human optimization. He is particularly focused on personalized medicine, adequate approaches to complex illness, and deepening our knowledge of how the human regulatory systems function, how they break down, and how they can be supported to function with greater resilience.\n\nI’m so inspired to share this hour-plus podcast with you as resilience is a core principle of the PIVOT process. Daniel is a fascinating expert on this and so much more. So, fasten your seat belts because this hour-long plus podcast is filled with incredibly special and thought-provoking conversation about everything from sleep, to memory, to genetics, to performance and recovery, to the dynamics of longevity and even the definition of life!\n\nTo learn more about Daniel’s and the collective’s work, and the reference to a Harvard Business Review study visit adammarkel.com/podcasts.",

    "description": "Listen; The full Episode with show notes & references here,\nhttp://corebrainjournal.com/\n\nNeurohacker Insights For Brain Systems\r\nComplex and whole systems science, combined with exponentially increasing computational power, is about to pour light over our previously resigned expectations of just feeling \"OK.\"  The silver bullet mentality is a broken mentality in every area.\r\n- Daniel Schmachtenberger\r\nBeyond Reductionistic Thinking - Into Systems Complexity\r\nThis interview with Daniel Schmachtenberger, my friends, of more than 80 Episodes now, is directly targeted, in critical concordance, with our overall philosophy and mission objectives here at CBJ.  If you're new here, you'll love him and his Neurohacker insights.  If you're an old timer [!] with us since launching last April, you will love it. If you remain perplexed about the interface between neuroscience and street utility, be prepared for inclusive, actionable thinking. Daniel is amazing, with articulate insights on the evolution of mind science. \r\n\r\nDaniel Schmachtenberger is a consummate polymath with a background in systems science and human behavior and is the founder of the Emergence Project. He is the anchor of the scientific team at Neurohacker and provides sustained vision and informed for the larger Neurohacking movement.\r\n\r\nEd Note: This is a replay, published earlier and republished here because it was so well received previously. Daniel makes a difference - and he tells you how you can connect on a deeply nutrient level with these outstanding protocols for brain health and cognitive improvements.\r\nComplexity, Reality & Neurohacker Insights\r\nAfter accumulating comprehensive inventories on behavioral influence, coupled with an already widespread literacy of complex systems and whole systems science, he then founded The Emergence Project to begin working with a host of luminaries to tackle global-scale problems with global-scale solutions. Concurrently, he researched the epistemological frontier of neuroscience, delving deeply into integrative medicine as well as emergent neurotech tools and psychological techniques to optimize solutions on both sides of the mind/brain interface.\r\n\r\nMind science evolution provides a metaphor for the evolution of humankind.\r\nNeurohacker Ideas are Timely - Daniel's Overview:\r\n\"In many ways, our contemporary technical prowess works against us. Yes, we have access to a level of information that would have seemed like pure magic to folks even a few centuries ago. But this doesn’t come for free – our always-on, connected-info lifestyle immerses us in a barrage of demands on our attention and processing power. Even at their best, our poor hominid brains are overwhelmed by the pings and buzzes of social media.\r\n\r\nAnd we are not positioning ourselves to be at our best. Consider, for example, real nutrition. For hundreds of thousands of years, our tool using hunter-gatherer ancestors had access to food that provided a vast diversity of nutrients from topsoil that was robust and healthy and part of a whole, complex biologic system, without actually any toxicity in the environment. These days most of our food is produced, processed and transported in a complex soup of chemistry that we don’t come close to fully understanding.\r\nNeurohacker Insights Beyond Nutrition\r\nAnd even if we eat the healthiest food, which most of us don’t even come close to, even the very healthiest food grows in minerally-depleted soil that leaves our needs unmet.\r\n\r\nOr consider pollution and our toxic environment. We spend much of our time indoors, not getting enough vitamin D and breathing in a host of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from all of our modern building materials.",

    "description": "For the full show notes, visit: https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/neurohacker\n\nMy guest on today's podcast believes there's a big problem in the field of nootropics, smart drugs and cognitive enhancement: namely that the entire movement has followed some pretty extreme reductionist tendencies.\n\n When it comes to popping pills and using biohacks and self-quantification to make your body and brain smarter, research has indeed proliferated. There is a dizzying plethora of scientific findings focused on individual neurotransmitters, mechanisms, parts of the neurotransmission cycle, cell walls, receptor sites, brain/blood flow, and hundreds of other isolated variables.\n\n In other words, there are lots of parts and plenty of “findings” and “mechanisms.” But to date, there exists no prevailing meta-theory of the complex interactions that make up the whole of cognitive enhancement. Many various disconnected insights have so far fallen short of addressing the complex dynamics of all the interacting parts. For this reason most nootropic, smart drug and brain biohacking products are developed to narrowly optimize one aspect of cognitive capability, only to have unexpected drawbacks, deleterious side effects and impacts on other areas. By performing a principled meta-analysis and synthesis of existing research, we can better understand the complex dynamics and emergent homeostatic relationships within the brain and from these kinds of insights we can yield a truly advanced complex meta-theory of cognitive enhancement.\n\n Daniel Schmachtenberger, my guest on this podcast, wants to do just this. Daniel began seriously studying health and neurology when he became afflicted with neurological and autoimmune illnesses that had no known solutions in either allopathic or complementary medicine. The insights that lead to his healing came from developing a new model for understanding physiology and pathology, which he then applied to helping many people address various forms of complex illness and optimize their capabilities beyond their previous healthy baselines.\n\n Daniel was the academic dean for a college of mind-body medicine and has consulted for many cutting edge integrative doctors and medical clinics to help find novel solutions for complex cases. He created and ran a cutting edge think tank developing complex systems solutions for environmental and social issues, and has directed a transdisciplinary group of scholars on a philosophy of mind project addressing core questions of mind / brain interface and developed what he calls \"an axiomatic reformulation for the epistemology of neuroscience\". He has a significant background with and love for psychedelics, nootropics, meditation, depth psychology, and all effective tools for evolving states and stages of consciousness and evolving the human experience.\n\n Daniel focuses in bringing together the best scientific research on each individual mechanism and pathway supporting cognitive development, and integrating them into a whole systems view, a complex framework of integrative neuroscience and one of the most comprehensive nootropic stacks ever made called \"Qualia\".\n\n During our discussion, you'll discover:\n\n -What a \"dream nootropic\" would look like if it were to target every single component of cognitive enhancement...[16:55 & 68:45]\n\n -How&nbsp;nootropics can go beyond an acute effect and actually chronically change your brain structure or \"wiring\", including neuron and synapse development, increased mitochondrial ATP, healthier cell structures and increased neural complexity...[21:00 & 49:30]\n\n -How you can actually induce the creation of new brain stem cells to heal things like traumatic brain injury, excitotoxicity and oxidative damage to the brain...[24:54]\n\n -Two easy ways to test how your central nervous system and memory recall is responding to certain compounds you consume...[27:45]\n\n -My personal experience with the \"God pill\" that Daniel developed...[42:45]\n\n -What makes something a \"nootropic\" compound vs. just a nutrient or a vitamin or a smart drug...[47:00 & 59:35]\n\n -The little-known substance know as the \"love drug\" that can increase euphoria and empathy...[50:18]\n\n -A compound that can be bound to caffeine to cause caffeine to last longer without a crash...[52:20]\n\n -The ittle-known effects a nootropic can have that you&nbsp;may not know about, such as decreased tendency to procrastinate, increased stress resilience, lucid dreaming and beyond...[55:20 ]\n\n -How Vitamin D delivered in a form called \"Microencapsulated Cholecalciferol\" can act on specific brain targets...[61:25]\n\n -Which form of magnesium is best for neural targeting...[74:55]\n\n -Why it's absolutely crucial that you include something called \"choline donors\" when you consume a nootropic...[78:00]\n\n -The actual clinical research behind the Qualia formulation that Daniel helped to develop, and why it must be taken as a 1-2...",

    "description": "Neurohacker.com\nThrough his deep knowledge of neurochemistry and experience in the design of a nootropic product to enhance cognitive functions, Daniel Schmachtenberger explores with Ferananda Ibarra the question of can nootropics empower WE Spaces by enhancing individual flow states? How do they affect empathy and social intelligence and to what extent is the individual affected by the collective and conversely, how does the collective affect the individual? This question led Daniel and Ferananda into a conversation on how the optimization of individual capacity can influence the collective in powerful and emerging ways. Given how we are witnessing a rise of complexity and growth of exponential technologies, the fragility of nature is driving humanity to potentially catastrophic tipping points. What then are the viable alternatives and how can the practices of We-Spaces provide for better collective sensemaking and understanding? Daniel shares a taste of his work on Integral Civilization Design and offers visions of different scenarios and possibilities for humanity collectively in this time of transition.",

    "description": "In this conversation, Daniel talks about Barbara’s beautiful ability to reclaim motherhood on behalf of all humanity and the desire to give future generations more than we had. Barbara reminds us that we are at a birthing moment. When we are ready to give birth, it is messy and cannot be stopped, and her hope to ease the birthing process is to facilitate connection for social synergy on the planet at the present time.\n\nMarc adds a third element, saying not only do we have a need to provide for future generations as the mothers and fathers of the future, as well as a need for social synergy and connection right now, we also have all these different levels of consciousness on the planet all together currently. We need to create a story in which Christians, agnostics, and atheists, and everyone else feels welcome. As people grow up to new levels of consciousness, there are two things that can prompt a shift to the next level. First, a dissatisfaction with how things are currently, and second, a new story that is exciting and attractive.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    The importance of asking the right questions\n    That when we focus on our innate yearning to create, it is a powerful way to move beyond perceived differences\n    The importance of having a vision to move towards, both individually in personal therapy, and collectively as a species\n    The psychology of synergy is an under-acknowledged and great topic for researchers to explore\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

Charles Eisenstein joins our host, Daniel Schmachtenberger, to explore the many facets of humanity that will contribute to large-scale healing of our earth and civilization. We take a look at things we do every day that are contributing to the breakdown of our relationships with each other and with our planet. In order to restore our meaning in life, we need to take care to heal the root of our addictions and patterns and understand the interconnectedness of life and earth. Deep down, we all want what is best for ourselves and each other, but often sacrifice exposing the truth out of fear of losing our belonging and sense of security.

If they did not love each other, they could not do this. By loving each other, they create a synergy that moves the evolutionary story forward. If they egoically claimed this story, then they couldn’t move it forward. They honor each other’s uniqueness, and in witnessing each other shine with divine pride from sharing their teachings, they are radically loving each other. Synergy is really another word for outrageous love.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n-Why acknowledging that evolution has an interior is a major step towards addressing philosophical materialism\n\n-What synergy is and the central role it plays in evolution\n\n-Barbara’s Three E’s of Evolutionary Consciousness\n\n-A mistake people often make about the role of randomness in evolution\n\n-The distinction between randomness and disaster\n\n-How Unique Self-ends comparison and competition\n\n-How to reclaim the word obligation\n\nJoin the entire course: \nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

    "description": "Take a look at the group discussion in the third session of the Center for Integral Wisdom's course, Becoming a Future Human. In response to the Second Shock of Existence, Marc says we need a fundamental transformation of identity and a reworking of our essential understanding of how core structures work. Daniel agrees, saying we need to change the structures that condition and incentivize the problems that we are trying to solve; otherwise we will keep trying to solve problems that continue to be conditioned. This conversation centers around future structures and what those might look like, such as synergistic self-governance. It also addresses the importance of shifting our identity to technology as an extension of who we are.\n\nWhen Barbara ran for Vice President of the United States in 1984, she proposed a Peace Room as sophisticated and well-funded as the War Room that would map, track, and connect what’s working in the world. She has experimented with versions of synergistic democracy in her Synergistic Convergence events and brought her experience to this dialogue.\n\nLooking at the complexity of fundamentally redesigning our systems and structures, Barbara notes that sometimes all of this can feel too complex to do, but then she remembers the exquisite complexity of the human body. If a body, with its trillions of cells and all the networks and systems that allow it to function properly, can exist, why can’t human systems be fundamentally redesigned for what we are truly capable of?\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n-Why it is important to move beyond false dichotomies and understand the co-arising nature of reality\n\n-Why it is important to re-envision our relationship to technology\n\n-Why it is important to let go of our core structures of thought and to re-imagine ourselves\n\n-More about Barbara’s vision for a Peace Room and what future governance structures might look like\n\n-The importance of evo-mimicry\n\nView the entirety of this course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

    "description": "During this love-filled conversation in the Center for Integral Wisdom's course Becoming a Future Human, Barbara, Marc and Daniel spontaneously agree that they are part of an Evolutionary Family and delight in the joy of this! They continue to explore the themes of suprasex, the Co-creative Masculine, discovering vocation, and how to expand our love lists beyond romantic partners.\n\nDaniel remarks that one of the great teachings of suprasex is the question it begs: what am I committed to create in the world that is as significant as creating human life, that engages as much of my capacity, and that I am as committed to?\n\nIn this session you will:\n\n-Consider who your own evolutionary family is\n\n-Learn what it means to be telerotic\n\n-Why it is so attractive when we see people congruently living their teachings\n\n-Why it’s important not to become suprasexually promiscuous\n\nView the entirety of this course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

    "description": "This conversation re-emphasizes the importance of tying together our personal and collective evolution. What you do affects the entire world. Your personal life and all of humanity are inescapably linked. You need and are needed by the whole; you affect and are affected by the whole. Not only is this more clearly evident than ever before at this current time, it is also more true. With globalization and our interconnected planetary systems and technologies, as well as all of our global crises, such as climate change and ocean acidification, there is no “away” or someplace to which we can escape. That is a part of the uniqueness of the time we are alive in.\n\nIn this conversation, Marc and Barbara explain why they refer to sacred texts, bringing up the importance of transcending and including. Rather than dismissing the Great Traditions, the evolutionary impulse is to reclaim the beautiful parts, divesting them of the parts that are no longer relevant, and evolve them. Evolving the Great Traditions is the ultimate devotion. Every generation does this. Barbara adds that this is not just about going back because it’s important; there’s something there that takes us forward. There are also many people who cannot locate themselves in a Great Tradition. They are also welcome.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    What Marc means when he says that the process of evolution is to transcend all dualities/splits and to externalize interiors\n    How pathological evolution happens\n    What it means to wake up, show up, and grow up\n    What are the stages of growing up\n    What are the Three Divine Forces and how do they relate\n    What it means to be a religious dual-citizen\n    The importance of aggregating, integrating, and evolving\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

    "description": "In this group discussion, Daniel points out that much of the work that Marc does, and that is important for Future Humans to do, is to reclaim that which has been disowned, shamed, or distorted. Just as we won’t be able to make it through unless we reclaim our relationship with the ecosystem and biosphere, we won’t make it through without reclaiming sexuality, eros, relationship, and pleasure.\n\nMarc, Barbara and Daniel continue the conversation, looking at the different levels of pleasure, adding in new principles of pleasure, and seeing how that relates to their own lives, historical eras, and the pleasure of co-creating this course together.\n\nMarc reminds us that as long as we live in a society where there is a clash between our deepest experience of pleasure and society’s views on pleasure, we are never going to be able to actually transform consciousness. We can only transform consciousness at the root. Daniel emphasizes the importance of this, saying one of the characteristics of a dominator culture is that children are taught not to trust what feels good to them and thus they stop trusting themselves and look to authority for direction. These are some of the reasons why reclaiming the Source Code of pleasure is essential in becoming the Future Human.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    A new principle of pleasure: pleasure absolutism\n    Why it is important to explore all levels of pleasure and how level 6 is needed more than ever now\n    What level of pleasure Marxism absolutizes\n    How different epochs in history can be freeze-framed as absolutizing one level of pleasure\n    How you can do a pleasure check to see where you are on the levels of pleasure\n    Why it is important to address sexuality\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

    "description": "Marc begins this discussion by saying that laughter is a phenomenon that allows us to nullify false dichotomies and hold paradox. When we stop laughing, we get lost in one half of the paradox and getting lost in one half of the paradox is what Marc calls the source of evil. When we absolutize one side, we call that extremism. Holding paradox is the key to evolution, a central mechanism of evolution, and that is why this is a great topic to conclude this course.\n\nThis conversation continues with a discussion about the overview perspective, and the importance of learning to put all the many perspectives and snapshots of a house, for example, into an integrated perspective that cannot be found in any single snapshot or in a random scattering of different snapshots. How those pieces fit together is essential. The conversation also explores the classical philosophical debate surrounding volition and determinism.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    Why being able to hold paradox is critical to evolution and to becoming a Future Human\n    What the overview effect is\n    The definition of ecstasy\n    How sexuality holds paradox from a higher order of being\n    What integral methodological pluralism means\n    A story about King David that exemplifies this teaching\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",

    "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_uMgBoorlDQ/mqdefault.jpg",
    "description": "Listen to the full episode here::\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/22684128/\n\nThis week’s guest is Dr. Zak Stein, an author and educator whom I met as fellow students of the work of philosopher Ken Wilber over ten years ago. Zak took the road of serious high academic scholarship while I was learning the less laudable and messier way through immersion in the arts and entertainment world, but here we are converging to discuss one of the most important issues of our time: the need for a new human story that includes both modernity’s rigorous scientific inquiry and postmodernity’s revelation of how everything we know is framed by language, culture, and perspective. Without some clever, soulful balance of the two we’re stuck in a “post-truth” era where our need for answers to our fundamental questions leads us backwards into “isms” instead of forwards into something more good, true, and beautiful than what has come before.\r\n\r\n\r\nZak’s answer (like so many other guests on Future Fossils) is to get MORE rigorous about the scope and limits of the world disclosed by science, MORE honest with ourselves about the context-bound claims we can make on knowledge, and MORE open to how all “reality” starts in direct experience, as conscious subjects – where we meet to make new, open-ended, ever-more refined, evolving answers to the questions:\r\n\r\nWhat is human? What is love? What are we here to do?\r\n\r\n\r\nRead Zak’s new paper, “Love in a Time Between Worlds: On the Metamodern ‘Return’ to a Metaphysics of Eros”:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zakstein.org/love-in-a-time-between-worlds/ \r\n\r\n\r\n‘Where modern scientists often critique the claims of metaphysics as unverifiable and thus untrue, postmodernists critique both science and metaphysics for making truth claims in the first place. Either way, to call an idea or theory “metaphysical” has become another way of saying it is unacceptable. Often with comes with some implication that the theory is a kind of superstition, which means metaphysics is taken not as an attempt to engage the truth but rather as a kind of covert power play or psychological defense mechanism. I argue the opposite: metaphysics is what saves us from a descent into discourses that are merely about power and illusion. Believe it or not, there are metaphysical systems that survived postmodernism and popped-out of the far end of the 1990’s with “truth” and “reality” still intact. These include object oriented ontology and dialectical critical realism, among others.’\r\n\r\n\r\nZak is also the Co-Presdient and Academic Director at the Center for Integral Wisdom:\r\n\r\nhttps://centerforintegralwisdom.org/ \r\n\r\n\r\n…and on the scientific advisor board at Neurohacker Collective:\r\n\r\nhttps://neurohacker.com/ \r\n\r\n\r\n— In this episode we discuss:\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Mumford, Ken Wilber, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Jurgen Habermas, Seth Abramson, Timothy Morton, Rudolf Steiner, Alfred North Whitehead, Hanzi Freinacht, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Jordan Greenhall, and many other luminaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-wing and authoritarian political thought is resurgent today because of the absenceof reasonable discourse about metaphysical realities during a time when exactly these realties are being put in question due to the apocalypse of global capitalism and the accompanying planetary transition into the Anthropocene.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way we answer questions like, “What is the human?” will determine the next century because of the emerging power of new technologies that render the human mailable in unpresented ways, which has been made clear by writers like Yuval Harari.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The difference between metaphysics and science is not about what you can see and what you cannot see. It is about what you are paying attention to when you are seeing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“What we call postmodernism is just modernism with the volume turned WAY up.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference between modern, postmodern, and metamodern views on science and the realities disclosed by science.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to cut a definition of the human out of our education systems?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relevance of Rudolf Steiner’s metaphysics and pedagogy in 21st Century education – especially its attention to subjectivity and interiority.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow fundamentalism, nationalism, racism, and other regressive movements in society are symptoms of a postmodern assault on consensus reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the absence of metaphysics, there’s a vacuum of meaning…what can step into that is not always pretty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“After postmodernism, we can’t return to some pat, totalizing answer for everybody. After postmodernism, when we begin to build a new coherence, it’s always going to be a polycentric and dynamic and always renegotiated coherence. And that’s what science ought to be, which is to say, knowledge building, and not knowledge finding.

    "description": "In this episode, we're talking to Zak Stein, philosopher, futurist, and author of Education in a Time Between Worlds. We discuss how global systems are expanding beyond the capacities and institutions that the era of capitalist nation states used to manage them, and how as a result we are living in a time between worlds. We explore how this transition needs new ways of doing society, and new ways to prepare people for life in this new society. We discuss the idea that behind a philosophy of education lies a philosophy of self, and how under capitalism, the philosophy of self that has increasingly permeated society and schooling is of humans as economic actors, whose highest purpose is to produce economic value that can be commodified within the price system. As such, the very ego structures open to human subjects under capitalism - and that education instills in young people - reflect this economic outlook, what Zak calls \"reductive human capital theory\". We go on to ponder what ego structures might be possible under a future system where individual and collective identities are less entwined with economic value production. \n\nWe also discuss the fact that for many, work is an unfortunate necessity for survival, while for a select few, work is a deeply engaging process of discovering and giving one's innermost talents. We note how school often prepares children for this life of \"unfortunate necessity\", with education seen as a chore, rather than a space for experimentation and advancement of unique abilities and talents. We consider the issue of purpose, and how society often struggles to give children satisfactory answers as to why they should learn, which can destroy motivation, particularly for the most reflective and sensitive kids. Zak suggests that this inability to connect education to a valid purpose may explain the explosion of diagnoses of ADHD, as children struggle to focus on work that seems fundamentally meaningless to them. \n\nFinally, we consider issues with the current model of education. We note how standardised testing fails many, including Zak, whose dyslexia made him a terrible test taker in school. We consider that in our current education system, the most responsible, reflective people often don't rise, while the power hungry, schematic minds who are good at ticking boxes do. We connect to this the fact that the 2008 financial crisis was orchestrated by many of the \"best minds\" produced by the world's \"top universities\".\n\nIf this all sound bleak, dont worry. We also note how there is hope - in a time between worlds, as the flaws with the old way become increasingly impossible to ignore, opportunities are open for people to explore, participate and collaborate in creating the new. \n\nZak can be found here\n\nhttp://www.zakstein.org/",

    "description": "Get the audio version on iTunes here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/circling-and-authentic-relating-guide-podcast/id1339731324?mt=2\n\nIn episode 05 of the Circling Guide podcast, I join my friends and partners David Swedlow and Darrell Duane to talk about Zachary Stein on meta-modernist philosophy, healing the masculine/feminine split, free will, cults, Burning Man and more. In particular, we discuss the impact of a new philosophy called \"meta-modernism\" on the practice of Circling. Full video below or listen on iTunes from any Podcast app (I recommend Podcast Addict). Please leave your comments and feedback below!\n\nOn this podcast I/we argue that so-called \"meta-modernism\", which is among other things an \"include and transcend\" of both Modernism and Post-modernism (which are loosely correlated to right/left politics), is a very good context (a higher-level frame) for understanding the practice of Circling.  And vice-versa as well, that Circling can be a powerful tool, or application, into the meta-modernist world-view, which is even more attractive as it takes these ideas to ground-zero, into the streets as it were and into the heart-space, devoid of the over-intellectualization that kills many of these movements, or at minimum limits their reach.  We discuss all this within a \"topical circle\", speaking from our own experience.  David in particular shares a powerful experience he recently had at a workshop by Hazel-Grace Yates called \"Healing the Divide\" (previously the \"cock project\").\n\nThis podcast includes a 9-minute clip from Michael Garfield's Future Fossils Podcast, Episode 97 (see below).\n\n*  Zachary Stein excerpt from Michael Garfield Future Fossils podcast, episode 97.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/future-fossils/id1152767505?mt=2\n*  Zachary Stein website http://www.zakstein.org/\n*  Hazel-Grace Yates and \"Healing the Divide\" https://www.drhazelgraceyates.com/\n* Michael Garfield https://michaelgarfieldart.com/",

    "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/db-Xn2gzGxU/mqdefault.jpg",
    "description": "Daniel Schmachtenberger is best-known as a neurohacker, but some of his most interesting ideas are about civilization--how it thrives, how it fails, and how it eventually collapses. And right now, we are living through times that have many people wondering about the end of the world. On this episode of Conversations with Tom, host Tom Bilyeu and guest Daniel Schmachtenberger engage in a fascinating discussion about social media, neural warfare, game theory, power itself, and the ways that our society has over-optimized. In particular, they talk about why it’s so important to stop trying to be right, why we need to start thinking in more complex ways, and why the real battlefield is the human mind.\n\nSHOW NOTES:\n\nDaniel was home-schooled, allowed to study whatever he thought was most important [0:30]\nDaniel’s parents actually referred to his family as an “experiment” [3:40]\nBy the time a child goes to school, civilization has already been imprinted on them [6:04]\nDaniel advocates that optimization is actually a part of the problem [8:37]\nDaniel details exactly why trying to optimize leads to serious problems [13:14]\nDaniel talks about how to understand civilization’s history through game theory [18:40]\nSome kinds of value can be extracted and lead to power, and other kinds can’t [20:57]\nDaniel uses the example of COVID-19 to illustrate the problems with optimization [25:48]\nHow can we think in complex ways that respect the interconnected nature of existence [30:41]\nIt’s much easier to break things than it is to build complex systems [35:39]\nTom and Daniel discuss whether it’s possible to nudge people in the right direction [38:16]\nSocial media will lead us to war even though no one wants it [46:01]\nDaniel and Tom discuss the connections between high school bullying and terrorism [51:12]\nIf you aren’t considering counter-responses, you are just being emotionally hijacked [58:56]\nPeople’s minds are the battlefield [1:04:17]\nThere are no authorities that are trustworthy enough to just assume they are right [1:09:59]\nDo you want to be effective or do you want to be right? [1:15:15]\nDaniel explains how people become fundamentalist about things they are wrong about [1:19:45]\nDebates are often not about understanding. They are just dogfights. [1:28:48]\nLegitimate power is when I am trying to influence someone to be more self-directed [1:32:03]\nTom explains the relief of focusing on finding the right answers instead of being right [1:35:35]\nIf you want to be right, you are very easy to control. Fragile egos are vulnerable. [1:39:55]\nCapitalism, the Trump campaign and Christianity have all been antifragile so far [1:42:33]\n\nFOLLOW DANIEL:\n\nWEBSITE: https://neurohacker.com \nINSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/2UxGUo1 \nFACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/2UwYcBM \nTWITTER: https://bit.ly/37iOrvZ",

    "description": "Daniel Schmachtenberger, NeuroHacker Collective\n\nZoom Transcription: https://otter.ai/s/whiByhP5TZCxMI1wtOctgw\n\nIf a catastrophe is an event which causes the loss of most expected value, a eucatastrophe is an event which causes there to be much more expected value after the event than before. \nCurrently, there may be a few unique opportunities to steer the COVID-19 crisis away from catastrophe toward eucatastrophe. \n\nSome demand urgency given the speed with which the crisis is changing and the likely short time-window in which it will be possible to push for those ideas. The earlier we start exploring options, the better. \n\nForesight Hivemind is a three-weeks global online workshop to develop promising opportunities into action. \n\nThe goal is to grow a global community of contributors so that the ideas garner simultaneous support across the world. \n\nWe’ll have daily online salons in which focus groups screen one promising opportunity for change.\n\nSign up here: https://foresight.org/hive-mind \nAdd to your Google calendar: https://bit.ly/foresightcalendar \nWatch the videos: https://bit.ly/globalsalonplaylist",

    "description": "One Earth Live was an online transformational festival which included an international lineup of high-end musicians, artists, and speakers unifying to promote a positive outlook in a world currently facing so many challenges. One Earth Live took place online via streaming partner and digital venue PORTL on May 23rd and 24th, 2020. \n\nThe two-day transformational online festival is highlighted by musical headliners John Butler, Michael Franti, Nahko, Trevor Hall, FINK, Rising Appalachia, Mike Love and Krishna Das, as well as world-renowned public figures and speakers, Dr. Bruce Lipton, Jason Silva, Charles Eisenstein, Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, and many others. \n\nOne Earth Live was born as a collaborative charitable response to increasing global tensions over COVID-19; focusing on uplifting the world through positivity. Festival co-creator, Chris Deckker highlights the sentiment by noting much of the theme “will not focus on what is breaking down, but what positive things are breaking through for humanity at this time, and what solutions and pathways are available for us as a global community, enabling us to move into a positive future and not return to ‘business as usual.’\n\nOne Earth Live featured the universal language of music on its main stage, with brief intermissions of visionary leaders across a variety of sectors, wellness experts, yoga instructors, youth activists, poets, and First Nation Elders. With close to 20 countries represented, this global occurrence continues to give back through transparent donations managed by the charitable organization Proof of Impact, while also allowing donations to be made directly to the artists, who are currently unable to tour.\n\nThis two-day global conscious lifestyle event set the precedent for how artistic unity and live entertainment can thrive through an outbreak. Strategic partnerships and goal-oriented artistic bonds have come together in a matter of weeks to form a historic experience. \n\nDonations and merchandise supporting the projects charities continue to be available online at www.OneEarthLive.com",

Along the way, Rene Girard's mimetic theory is explored in relation to physics, media ecology, and the unraveling of political faith and cohesion in our time. Where are we heading after the lockdown? How do we bind ourselves together with stories and role models based in voluntary love, rather than coerced submission? What is the difference between the story of Jesus and myth?\nEmail hello@aneighborschoice.com to reach A Neighbor's Choice.

    "description": "10-27-2019\nDaniel Thorson\nLiberating Ways of Seeing\n\nIn this week's talk, Daniel Thorson explores a framework for understanding what we are doing when we meditate and how the practice works to relieve suffering. This framework, called ‘Ways of Seeing’, offers us a sensible conceptual framework to delineate the arc of practice and how techniques function to liberate freedom.\n\nWe use this framework to explore why the contemplative path may be uniquely valuable at this time of social, political, and planetary crisis. Through practice we can go beyond blind adherence to tradition, polarized perspectives, and fundamentalism—thus allowing us to become more skillful participants in our lives, relationships, and the world.\n\nDaniel leads a guided meditation of the most well known ‘Ways of Seeing’ within the Buddhist tradition: impermanence, suffering, and no-self. In this guided meditation we relate to these three characteristics not as fundamental truths about the universe, but as methods we can use to understand the nature of perception.\n\n\n------\n\nThe Monastic Academy is a training center dedicated to creating wise, powerful, and loving leaders who are an unstoppable force for social and environmental peace on Earth. \n\nIf you're interested in learning more, go to our website https://monasticacademy.com\n\nWe are accepting applications for 2-3 month-long apprenticeships. The training will provide you opportunities to dive deeply into mindfulness practice in community, working, and dedicated sitting periods. The apprenticeship is FREE with room and board provided. \n\nLearn more here: https://www.monasticacademy.com/apprentice",

    "description": "This conversation was recorded a couple of months ago, but its message feels very current. Our guest this time is Daniel Thorson, a resident at the Monastic Academy and host of the excellent Emerge podcast. In this, part one of our conversation, we discuss: the interconnectedness of systems change and personal growth, and how the minds we use to solve today’s problems are products of systems that are destroying themselves; the work of the Monastic Academy in creating awakened leaders; the importance of being able to hold multiple, sometimes contradictory perspectives within one’s worldview; Slavoj Zizek’s critique of Western Buddhism as the hegemonic ideology of late capitalism; how the pathologies of Western Buddhism show up in the contemporary spiritual scene; and heroism and the process of being in service to a grand narrative of how to improve the world.\n \nDaniel can be found here\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dthorson\n\nAnd his excellent Emerge podcast here\n\nhttp://www.whatisemerging.com/emergepodcast\n\nFind the Monastic Academy here\n\nhttps://www.monasticacademy.com/",
