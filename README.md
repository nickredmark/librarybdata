## Transcription help welcome!

Most transcripts are autogenerated by youtube and could be much better.

To find transcripts to work on navigate to your favorite piece in the [library.now.sh](https://libraryb.now.sh) and click on the "view raw transcript link on GitHub" link.

To suggest an improvement you'll need a GitHub account.

## TODO

- Podcast transcripts! Not done yet because it's a lot of manual work :)
