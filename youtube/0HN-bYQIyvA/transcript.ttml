<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">main theme so why don&#39;t we start there</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:24.899" style="s2">an open economy is all about sure thing</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.039" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">and what we have then what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">about is an open economy or an open</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">access economy and anyone who&#39;s familiar</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">with the scholarly world will be</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">familiar with the expression open access</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:48.050" style="s2">which basically means that that the all</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:51.929" style="s2">sort of a scientific and scholarly</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.050" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">research is publicized so it&#39;s put into</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.929" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">the public domain as we know that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">of scholarly research is privatized and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:02.670" style="s2">more or less kept behind lock and key so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:04.349" style="s2">and open access economy then is</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.670" end="00:02:06.599" style="s2">basically a way of extending that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.349" end="00:02:10.159" style="s2">philosophy to the economy in general</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.599" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">where we don&#39;t keep resources and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.159" end="00:02:17.909" style="s2">services under lock and key as we do now</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:19.560" style="s2">and short long story short basically we</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.909" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">had we have an economy where everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.560" end="00:02:26.550" style="s2">is free where and we volunteer to keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:30.209" style="s2">aside the business of society going and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.550" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">we use technology to to fill in the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.209" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">where we and the things that we maybe do</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:36.989" style="s2">not want to do so much so at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">in our current economy access to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.989" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">resources is granted through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:44.849" style="s2">exchange of money for those resources</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">right and so and resources or I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.849" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">value is placed on resources by how much</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">money they attract right yes of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:54.960" style="s2">yeah I mean as most people know who were</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2">who have maybe questions capitalism or</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.960" end="00:02:59.070" style="s2">the way that society works in general</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">these days is that we have created this</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.070" end="00:03:02.850" style="s2">kind of arbitrary value system on</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:04.830" style="s2">everything which has kind of made us a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.850" end="00:03:07.560" style="s2">bit crazy that we&#39;re assigning this</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.830" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">numerical value to all things and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.560" end="00:03:13.310" style="s2">beings and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of made us a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">little bit insane where we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.310" end="00:03:17.820" style="s2">prioritizing the numerical value of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:21.420" style="s2">things over the actual esoteric value or</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.820" end="00:03:24.450" style="s2">the physical value or immunity of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.420" end="00:03:27.090" style="s2">of those things so in a way the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.450" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">numerical what I called like a numerical</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.090" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">insanity has kind of overtaken normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:37.050" style="s2">rational common sense insofar as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">actually have a society now where even</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.050" end="00:03:42.060" style="s2">though it is technically feasible to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:44.010" style="s2">actually feeds and clothe and house</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.060" end="00:03:46.170" style="s2">everybody even though it&#39;s technically</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.010" end="00:03:48.750" style="s2">feasible to do that quite easily we</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.170" end="00:03:50.880" style="s2">still have a put everything behind a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.750" end="00:03:53.630" style="s2">value wall where basically you must</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.880" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">justify your existence in terms of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.630" end="00:04:01.080" style="s2">numerical value in terms of your of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">wages or your personal wealth and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.080" end="00:04:07.230" style="s2">you use this to access to various</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:08.910" style="s2">resources we need I think there&#39;s a key</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.230" end="00:04:11.370" style="s2">point that we need to home in on here</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.910" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">and that is that as you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.370" end="00:04:15.060" style="s2">pointed out you know technologically</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:17.070" style="s2">it&#39;s quite feasible to feed clothe house</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.060" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">provide clean water education internet</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.070" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">access blah blah blah for everybody on</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:24.990" style="s2">this planet right but by keeping these</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">things scarce or at least the appearance</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.990" end="00:04:29.100" style="s2">of scarcity in these things this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:31.470" style="s2">increases their profitability right</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.100" end="00:04:33.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a and that there I think alludes</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.470" end="00:04:36.120" style="s2">to the sickness to the insanity that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.240" end="00:04:38.700" style="s2">were talking about and and that concept</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.120" end="00:04:41.550" style="s2">of scarcity whether real or created or</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.700" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">imagined is is absolutely central to all</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:45.720" style="s2">of this right yes absolutely yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:48.360" style="s2">like to say this said that this</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.720" end="00:04:51.540" style="s2">numerical insanity has created this sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.360" end="00:04:54.180" style="s2">of like a numbers game where everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.540" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">is attributed a value and your time is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.180" end="00:05:00.510" style="s2">has a certain value your resources and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:03.070" style="s2">your skills have a certain value and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.510" end="00:05:07.490" style="s2">you must</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.070" end="00:05:10.730" style="s2">be you must generate wealth with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.490" end="00:05:12.350" style="s2">value that you have or not and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.730" end="00:05:14.510" style="s2">wealth that you create grants you access</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.350" end="00:05:17.480" style="s2">to the things that are required to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.510" end="00:05:19.220" style="s2">to try and solve problems in society for</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.480" end="00:05:21.140" style="s2">example homelessness yeah if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.220" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">solve the problem in society but there</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.140" end="00:05:25.430" style="s2">is no way to make a profit out of doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.900" style="s2">so then that swattin can never be solved</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.430" end="00:05:29.420" style="s2">under this paradigm right it&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.900" end="00:05:32.420" style="s2">impossible yeah absolutely and I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.420" end="00:05:34.760" style="s2">lot of the the governments and NGOs are</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.420" end="00:05:38.090" style="s2">starting looking out towards ways of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.760" end="00:05:40.760" style="s2">trying to create sustainable and ethical</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.090" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">methods of conducting society but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.760" end="00:05:45.110" style="s2">mean that this obviously it&#39;s it runs</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:48.500" style="s2">completely counter to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.110" end="00:05:50.690" style="s2">numerical and insanity that I referring</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.500" end="00:05:53.720" style="s2">to that basically everything must</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.690" end="00:05:56.030" style="s2">justify itself in an American Way so and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.720" end="00:05:58.070" style="s2">the ethics and sustainability must</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.030" end="00:06:01.630" style="s2">always by definition there must always</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.070" end="00:06:03.800" style="s2">take a second seat or third seats behind</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.630" end="00:06:08.169" style="s2">profit incentive and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.800" end="00:06:11.150" style="s2">is is that the because our because this</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.169" end="00:06:14.270" style="s2">numerical insanity is index-linked to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.150" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">our means of survival and that means we</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.270" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">must use these numbers to - great - and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:22.700" style="s2">for the means of survival because of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:24.470" style="s2">that then this it completely overtakes</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.700" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">our survival instinct which obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.470" end="00:06:30.020" style="s2">our survival instinct is transmuted into</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">instinct to make money yeah yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.020" end="00:06:34.850" style="s2">mean it&#39;s and it&#39;s it&#39;s perfectly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:37.300" style="s2">perfectly rational rational when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.850" end="00:06:40.070" style="s2">actually when you reason it out that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.300" end="00:06:42.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that we want enough money</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.070" end="00:06:44.270" style="s2">for to have the things that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.110" end="00:06:45.830" style="s2">live today but also we all we all fear</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.270" end="00:06:48.590" style="s2">for the future because we don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.830" end="00:06:50.510" style="s2">future so we want to really we really</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">want to amass as much personal wealth as</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.510" end="00:06:54.320" style="s2">possible that&#39;s what greed is Right fear</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:56.840" style="s2">of scarcity in the future that your</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.320" end="00:06:58.970" style="s2">greed is all about yeah exactly so it</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.840" end="00:07:00.620" style="s2">secures our future there so I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.970" end="00:07:02.450" style="s2">this idea people say well why are people</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.620" end="00:07:04.220" style="s2">so greedy aware people do that but</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.450" end="00:07:06.440" style="s2">actually there is actually perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.220" end="00:07:08.750" style="s2">rational explanation for people&#39;s greed</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.440" end="00:07:11.180" style="s2">and that is that people just want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.750" end="00:07:13.669" style="s2">have safety and security in the future</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.180" end="00:07:15.560" style="s2">and really you can&#39;t argue with that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.669" end="00:07:16.370" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a perfectly reasonable way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.560" end="00:07:18.889" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.370" end="00:07:20.810" style="s2">and what happens is and of course then</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.889" end="00:07:23.590" style="s2">with certain individuals and is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.810" end="00:07:26.330" style="s2">individuals really are largely minority</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.590" end="00:07:29.750" style="s2">they have this kind of misfiring of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.330" end="00:07:31.460" style="s2">kind of accumulation of resources and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.750" end="00:07:32.900" style="s2">the transit where they just want they</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.460" end="00:07:34.910" style="s2">want millions and billions and billions</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.900" end="00:07:37.310" style="s2">and billions and so it goes on so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.910" end="00:07:39.320" style="s2">this that it turns into another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.310" end="00:07:43.130" style="s2">kettle of fish where like a twisted and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.320" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">addictive sort of pursuit and but it by</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.130" end="00:07:47.620" style="s2">and large most people like you and me</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:50.180" style="s2">and who were kind of in or around</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.620" end="00:07:52.880" style="s2">middle-class area that really just wants</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.180" end="00:07:55.550" style="s2">enough money for the foreseeable future</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.880" end="00:07:57.500" style="s2">you know we want to want to see see</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.550" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">there our future is pretty much secure</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.500" end="00:08:03.260" style="s2">either in our job enough to not have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:05.389" style="s2">worry about it basically exactly and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.260" end="00:08:06.889" style="s2">I mean most people that most reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.389" end="00:08:08.630" style="s2">people I speak to they&#39;re just minutes</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.889" end="00:08:11.990" style="s2">they just want to have enough just not</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.630" end="00:08:14.060" style="s2">to have to stress but one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.990" end="00:08:15.889" style="s2">features of one of the things that word</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.060" end="00:08:20.539" style="s2">we talk about a lot in the open access</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.889" end="00:08:23.000" style="s2">economy is it&#39;s like if obviously people</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.539" end="00:08:25.130" style="s2">will will try and say well look what</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.000" end="00:08:27.530" style="s2">what about if I want a Ferrari what if I</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.130" end="00:08:30.530" style="s2">wanted a yacht for that big house on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.530" end="00:08:33.560" style="s2">hill and I think that these things are</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.530" end="00:08:35.479" style="s2">basically distractions because the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.560" end="00:08:39.950" style="s2">important thing that we have to consider</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.479" end="00:08:44.060" style="s2">and in any sort of change making sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.950" end="00:08:45.800" style="s2">approach is that we have to sort at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.060" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">basics of living and then that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.800" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">food or water your energy or your</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:53.510" style="s2">clothes your house and long-term</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:54.500" style="s2">sustainability yeah exactly yeah well if</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.510" end="00:08:57.170" style="s2">you think about if you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.500" end="00:08:59.270" style="s2">sustainability or non sustainability I</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:09:00.950" style="s2">mean all that is really like a toxic</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.270" end="00:09:03.080" style="s2">byproduct of the the capitalist system</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.950" end="00:09:05.180" style="s2">where obviously you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.080" end="00:09:07.400" style="s2">generating profits by correct by</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.180" end="00:09:08.680" style="s2">creating things that maybe break after a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.400" end="00:09:10.610" style="s2">few years I mean this is not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.680" end="00:09:12.410" style="s2">capitalism right I mean there&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.610" end="00:09:13.850" style="s2">know every every system that&#39;s been used</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.410" end="00:09:16.550" style="s2">for the last however many hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.850" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">years has essentially been the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.550" end="00:09:19.850" style="s2">thing yeah I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s rooted</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:22.070" style="s2">resources through the use of money I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.850" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">mean even the Soviet Union even now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.070" end="00:09:26.180" style="s2">China you know what I mean they still</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:28.580" style="s2">use money they still did cost you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.180" end="00:09:30.920" style="s2">cost analyses of projects and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.580" end="00:09:33.470" style="s2">you know what I mean it&#39;s not unique to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.920" end="00:09:36.170" style="s2">capitalism I think it&#39;s a far far deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.470" end="00:09:37.880" style="s2">issue than capitalism alone it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.170" end="00:09:39.589" style="s2">yes actually I suppose when I use the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.880" end="00:09:42.170" style="s2">word capitalism really I&#39;m referring to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.589" end="00:09:45.649" style="s2">all those monetary-ism really is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.170" end="00:09:47.269" style="s2">you mean yeah exactly yeah and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.649" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like to say all these countries</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.269" end="00:09:50.600" style="s2">played they just have competition by</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">another name or they may be slightly</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.600" end="00:09:54.170" style="s2">more socialist some countries are</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:56.450" style="s2">slightly more socialist and others but</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.170" end="00:09:57.769" style="s2">we find like all countries exactly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.450" end="00:09:58.310" style="s2">all shades of the same color yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.769" end="00:10:01.250" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.310" end="00:10:04.519" style="s2">alright I think I think I think we&#39;ve I</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.250" end="00:10:06.140" style="s2">think we&#39;ve covered the sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.519" end="00:10:09.529" style="s2">there the associate the sociological</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.140" end="00:10:12.649" style="s2">evils of money let&#39;s talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.529" end="00:10:15.829" style="s2">more nitty-gritty what do you see as</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.649" end="00:10:17.870" style="s2">some of the practical transitional steps</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.829" end="00:10:20.540" style="s2">that could be taken to get us from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.870" end="00:10:23.390" style="s2">mess that we&#39;re currently in to a more</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.540" end="00:10:25.430" style="s2">sustainable holistic humane type of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.390" end="00:10:28.040" style="s2">society yeah yeah of course it is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.430" end="00:10:30.980" style="s2">burning question on everyone&#39;s lips and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.040" end="00:10:32.450" style="s2">and I think before you can answer that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.980" end="00:10:35.390" style="s2">question I think we have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.450" end="00:10:37.930" style="s2">clear about what it is we want what are</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.390" end="00:10:39.829" style="s2">we actually trying to get towards and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.930" end="00:10:42.950" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.829" end="00:10:44.540" style="s2">different mixture of messages out there</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.950" end="00:10:46.250" style="s2">as well there&#39;s a few different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.540" end="00:10:49.700" style="s2">approaches to this kind of future</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.250" end="00:10:51.800" style="s2">moneyless world and by and large it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.700" end="00:10:53.450" style="s2">falls into two camps you have the one</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.800" end="00:10:55.730" style="s2">camp which basically okay let&#39;s let</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.450" end="00:10:56.990" style="s2">science and technology basically more or</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.730" end="00:10:59.870" style="s2">less run everything let&#39;s automate</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.990" end="00:11:01.940" style="s2">everything let&#39;s build big cities where</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.870" end="00:11:03.470" style="s2">everything is automatic and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.940" end="00:11:05.870" style="s2">everything is kind of very very</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.470" end="00:11:08.450" style="s2">futuristic and space-age no one needs to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.870" end="00:11:09.290" style="s2">work or release we minimize that as much</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.450" end="00:11:11.060" style="s2">as possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.290" end="00:11:12.649" style="s2">that&#39;s one school of thought the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.060" end="00:11:14.329" style="s2">school of thought which is the school of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.649" end="00:11:18.230" style="s2">thought that I would more subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.329" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">is the let&#39;s create a more compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.230" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">society let&#39;s create a society that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">more connected where were more and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:28.040" style="s2">investing in each other where we</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">actually we work more even because we</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.040" end="00:11:34.010" style="s2">want to do that because it it&#39;s and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:37.790" style="s2">serves us better to do that so it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.010" end="00:11:40.310" style="s2">way I don&#39;t like to use the words almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.790" end="00:11:41.630" style="s2">put it&#39;s kind of more along that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.310" end="00:11:44.360" style="s2">line of approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.630" end="00:11:48.140" style="s2">about a simplification and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.360" end="00:11:49.910" style="s2">localization no I&#39;m reluctant to use the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.140" end="00:11:53.420" style="s2">word armas but it&#39;s a good it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.910" end="00:11:55.730" style="s2">way of keying into what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.420" end="00:11:58.580" style="s2">about it&#39;s basically where we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.730" end="00:12:01.130" style="s2">end we value a community we value each</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.580" end="00:12:03.080" style="s2">other we are compassionate towards each</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.130" end="00:12:05.630" style="s2">other and nature and other animals and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.080" end="00:12:08.870" style="s2">that sort of stuff and by using that as</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.630" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">a platform or as our basic starting</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.870" end="00:12:13.340" style="s2">point for creating society then we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:16.520" style="s2">apply technology in whatever ways we</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.340" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">want with it by as much heard little as</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.520" end="00:12:23.000" style="s2">we want to actually solve a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:24.980" style="s2">practical problems so in its it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.000" end="00:12:27.380" style="s2">specific indifference I mean a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.980" end="00:12:28.970" style="s2">people I talked to who support maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.380" end="00:12:31.370" style="s2">The Venus Project or the zeitgeist</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.970" end="00:12:32.840" style="s2">movement are very much in the science</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.370" end="00:12:35.270" style="s2">and technology camp kind of saying let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.840" end="00:12:37.190" style="s2">build an environment where basically you</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.270" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">don&#39;t have to work where basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.190" end="00:12:41.750" style="s2">things are automated and we will get we</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:43.670" style="s2">get artificial intelligence and the box</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.750" end="00:12:49.010" style="s2">and we&#39;ll get this move we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.670" end="00:12:50.780" style="s2">like a cybernated world where as a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.010" end="00:12:52.490" style="s2">of other people then really just what to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.780" end="00:12:54.410" style="s2">talk about let&#39;s build something from</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.490" end="00:12:57.860" style="s2">the community level let&#39;s create better</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.410" end="00:13:00.500" style="s2">behaviors on an individual level these</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.860" end="00:13:02.690" style="s2">two approaches are not mutually</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.500" end="00:13:04.460" style="s2">exclusive right I mean they they they</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.690" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">they can borrow from each other I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.460" end="00:13:08.030" style="s2">you in fact I mean in a way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:10.460" style="s2">complementary because on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.030" end="00:13:12.140" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a philosophy and a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.460" end="00:13:14.600" style="s2">mindset and on the other hand you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.140" end="00:13:17.630" style="s2">talking about the tools with which to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.600" end="00:13:20.510" style="s2">you know make make a smooth efficient</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.630" end="00:13:22.400" style="s2">running infrastructure so you know these</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.510" end="00:13:23.780" style="s2">two things strike me as being actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.400" end="00:13:25.070" style="s2">very complementary to each other they</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.780" end="00:13:26.150" style="s2">don&#39;t need to be they don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.070" end="00:13:29.480" style="s2">set against each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.150" end="00:13:30.770" style="s2">yes no I&#39;m not set against each other at</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.480" end="00:13:33.020" style="s2">all in DST right they can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.770" end="00:13:35.390" style="s2">complementary but the point is that to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.020" end="00:13:38.450" style="s2">you asking that transition to create the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.390" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">right transition we need to know which</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.450" end="00:13:41.630" style="s2">shall we pray missile routes which are</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:43.460" style="s2">we putting first are we putting science</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.630" end="00:13:45.890" style="s2">and technology first or are we putting</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.460" end="00:13:48.470" style="s2">community and individual behavior first</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.890" end="00:13:50.540" style="s2">because these one of those is the key</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.470" end="00:13:52.820" style="s2">destination and you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.540" end="00:13:53.880" style="s2">use of Science and Technology but</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.820" end="00:13:55.620" style="s2">through the lens</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.880" end="00:13:57.150" style="s2">of a compassionate society and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.620" end="00:13:59.670" style="s2">lens of the compassionate society of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.150" end="00:14:00.780" style="s2">place within how do we go about doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.670" end="00:14:02.310" style="s2">that I mean one of the points I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.780" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">written down from having read your book</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.310" end="00:14:07.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the importance of education and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:11.100" style="s2">completely agree with that and so how do</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.320" end="00:14:13.140" style="s2">you see the education of young people</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.100" end="00:14:14.550" style="s2">and and ongoing education of older</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.140" end="00:14:17.250" style="s2">people as well but how do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.550" end="00:14:18.840" style="s2">changing under the current paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.250" end="00:14:22.020" style="s2">where everything is about test scores</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.840" end="00:14:25.740" style="s2">and league tables and you know sitting</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.020" end="00:14:27.510" style="s2">exams and common curriculums and funding</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.740" end="00:14:31.170" style="s2">issues and so on I suppose the short</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.510" end="00:14:33.540" style="s2">answer is over time as priorities change</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.170" end="00:14:35.790" style="s2">and as we start to look to other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.540" end="00:14:37.500" style="s2">actually interacting with with there</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.790" end="00:14:39.540" style="s2">with with each other and with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.500" end="00:14:41.940" style="s2">planners in this sort of approach that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.540" end="00:14:43.830" style="s2">am talking about which is moving more</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.940" end="00:14:46.350" style="s2">towards compassionate and connected</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.830" end="00:14:48.360" style="s2">society if we do that then education</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.350" end="00:14:51.030" style="s2">obviously will spring naturally from</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.360" end="00:14:52.710" style="s2">that once people start to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.030" end="00:14:54.300" style="s2">well actually certain behaviors are</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.710" end="00:14:56.820" style="s2">actually beneficial in certain or not</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.300" end="00:14:58.950" style="s2">not beneficial then people gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.820" end="00:15:02.700" style="s2">more towards that and the education bill</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.950" end="00:15:05.010" style="s2">will spring from that but and if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.700" end="00:15:06.330" style="s2">actually am on a side note maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.010" end="00:15:09.270" style="s2">talk about this later we are actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.330" end="00:15:10.650" style="s2">creating an education syllabus at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.270" end="00:15:12.930" style="s2">moment there&#39;s a team of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.650" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">actually creating this really textbooks</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.930" end="00:15:18.570" style="s2">for schools that are that are basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:21.240" style="s2">trying to instill promote values like</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.570" end="00:15:23.340" style="s2">compassion cooperation and social</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.240" end="00:15:24.600" style="s2">intelligence in young kids this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.340" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">something in our life I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.600" end="00:15:28.890" style="s2">actually working on right now and called</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">life games books but maybe we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.890" end="00:15:34.230" style="s2">don&#39;t now so apart from that there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:35.490" style="s2">other that what stage at what stage are</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.230" end="00:15:36.450" style="s2">you at the moment with the development</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.490" end="00:15:37.980" style="s2">of there I mean if you&#39;ve got anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.450" end="00:15:39.810" style="s2">because people to take a look at if they</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.980" end="00:15:42.360" style="s2">were interested well there&#39;s a website</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.810" end="00:15:44.220" style="s2">life games books calm the people to look</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.360" end="00:15:49.050" style="s2">at that the product actually won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.220" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">ready until probably April April or May</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.050" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">this year we&#39;re actually releasing it at</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:55.020" style="s2">first and first and then the text books</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:57.990" style="s2">would be coming out in September so and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.020" end="00:15:59.790" style="s2">that product is it&#39;s almost ready for</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.990" end="00:16:04.500" style="s2">Marcus we&#39;re actually working on they</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.790" end="00:16:06.410" style="s2">act now as as we speak and but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.500" end="00:16:07.579" style="s2">show you your PIN offender</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.410" end="00:16:09.769" style="s2">they&#39;re gone a little bit because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.579" end="00:16:11.690" style="s2">didn&#39;t ask me about transition and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.769" end="00:16:14.779" style="s2">want to just go back on that point a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.690" end="00:16:17.569" style="s2">little bit now in terms of transition to</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.779" end="00:16:20.089" style="s2">actually out of money society into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.569" end="00:16:22.759" style="s2">moneyless society I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.089" end="00:16:25.490" style="s2">thing you have to consider is how did</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.759" end="00:16:27.319" style="s2">the money society come about how did it</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.490" end="00:16:29.899" style="s2">actually begin and when you actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.319" end="00:16:31.430" style="s2">look when you have to scratch the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.899" end="00:16:32.839" style="s2">surface on that and investigate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.430" end="00:16:35.870" style="s2">actually very very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.839" end="00:16:38.120" style="s2">topic and the and it also shows you how</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.870" end="00:16:40.189" style="s2">to actually escape from the monetary</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.120" end="00:16:42.170" style="s2">society and how we recreate the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.189" end="00:16:45.050" style="s2">alternative - give me a couple minutes</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.170" end="00:16:47.389" style="s2">I&#39;ll explain that in it basically in</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.050" end="00:16:49.399" style="s2">medieval England which is a good example</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.389" end="00:16:51.379" style="s2">I use and it probably can be applied</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.399" end="00:16:53.269" style="s2">mostly across other cultures but in</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.379" end="00:16:56.360" style="s2">English English history is one that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.269" end="00:16:58.699" style="s2">would know most about but in medieval</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.360" end="00:17:01.730" style="s2">England then we had like this feudalism</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.699" end="00:17:03.529" style="s2">and arrangement where basically the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.730" end="00:17:10.100" style="s2">entire of the United Kingdom was</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.529" end="00:17:11.900" style="s2">basically split up into to the small</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.100" end="00:17:14.089" style="s2">municipalities or counties which were</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.900" end="00:17:16.850" style="s2">owned basically by the local Lord or</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.089" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">Baron or Duke or whatever so they was</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.850" end="00:17:21.409" style="s2">too late was a all the the entirety of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:24.470" style="s2">Great Britain was basically split up</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.409" end="00:17:26.839" style="s2">into these little little mayor sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.470" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">pockets that were owned by the nobility</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.839" end="00:17:33.919" style="s2">and if you leave tonight on one of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:36.260" style="s2">lands owned by the nobility you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.919" end="00:17:39.049" style="s2">obviously a subjects of the local lord</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.260" end="00:17:40.760" style="s2">and what actually happened was that all</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.049" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">your basically all your labor and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.760" end="00:17:45.590" style="s2">resources was completely or almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:49.039" style="s2">completely owned and controlled by his</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.590" end="00:17:51.620" style="s2">lordship or his parent ship and so what</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.039" end="00:17:54.169" style="s2">happened was that in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.620" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">Middle Ages that actually a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.169" end="00:17:58.280" style="s2">people who became very aggrieved by that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">they did agree by the excesses of their</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.280" end="00:18:03.350" style="s2">Lords or the parents and also with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:05.510" style="s2">fact that they pretty much had nothing</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.350" end="00:18:06.860" style="s2">much - nothing much to gain in life you</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.510" end="00:18:09.350" style="s2">know there were they&#39;re all in labor</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.860" end="00:18:11.240" style="s2">with pretty much owned and what actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.350" end="00:18:12.890" style="s2">happened was that these serfs who lived</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.240" end="00:18:16.490" style="s2">in all these areas they actually began</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.890" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">to convene and secretly in in forests</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.490" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">and in</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.230" end="00:18:22.030" style="s2">airplane lands and they began trading</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:24.970" style="s2">they began saying okay will rather than</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.030" end="00:18:28.780" style="s2">we just giving over all my labor and my</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.970" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">and my my tools whatever to my lord that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.780" end="00:18:32.710" style="s2">basically I will actually I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.419" style="s2">go and meet these people on the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.710" end="00:18:35.860" style="s2">somewhere and we&#39;re going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.419" end="00:18:37.900" style="s2">little party and we&#39;re going to like do</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.860" end="00:18:40.660" style="s2">a trading and then and basically from</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.900" end="00:18:42.669" style="s2">that friend the idea of markets of free</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.660" end="00:18:44.500" style="s2">markets this is where the term free</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.669" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">market comes from where basically these</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.500" end="00:18:48.549" style="s2">serfs forgetteth sort of a semi</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:51.010" style="s2">illegally they were meeting up with</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.549" end="00:18:53.650" style="s2">other people in similar positions and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.010" end="00:18:55.330" style="s2">they were they basically created these</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.650" end="00:18:57.940" style="s2">free markets and this is where free</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.330" end="00:18:59.530" style="s2">market technologies run it away right it</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.940" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">was the it was the birth of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.530" end="00:19:03.490" style="s2">that well actually hang on I can trade</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.570" end="00:19:05.530" style="s2">with anybody you know I can do anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.490" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">I can make anything I want like a trade</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.530" end="00:19:09.610" style="s2">would anyone want that this was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.240" end="00:19:12.040" style="s2">revolutionary at the time you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.610" end="00:19:14.919" style="s2">very revolutionary and so this basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.040" end="00:19:16.210" style="s2">is this is the seed of the capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.919" end="00:19:18.790" style="s2">that we see today this was the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.210" end="00:19:20.110" style="s2">of us and that&#39;s sort of that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.790" end="00:19:23.830" style="s2">obviously that free marketing</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.110" end="00:19:26.169" style="s2">proliferated widely and and reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.830" end="00:19:27.790" style="s2">quickly of course that&#39;s evolved then</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.169" end="00:19:29.799" style="s2">over and over and over and again now and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.790" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">of course we now we have billionaires</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.799" end="00:19:33.730" style="s2">and homeless people you know so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:36.040" style="s2">kind of fell we sort of there went from</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.730" end="00:19:39.400" style="s2">one sort of repressive scenario or kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.040" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">of evolved and then ended up oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.400" end="00:19:45.340" style="s2">scenario so my point is then that if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:48.250" style="s2">look at the way free-market capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.340" end="00:19:50.429" style="s2">began and how it evolves this is the key</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.250" end="00:19:52.330" style="s2">to understanding as to how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.429" end="00:19:54.460" style="s2">transition out of that and into</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.330" end="00:19:57.850" style="s2">something else and the short answer is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.460" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">that basically we we have to now start</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.850" end="00:20:04.840" style="s2">acting like lessor stood in in this free</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:06.010" style="s2">market but this time a really free</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.840" end="00:20:08.980" style="s2">market where it actually we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.010" end="00:20:11.290" style="s2">trading River actually and giving and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.980" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">taking goods and services with each</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.290" end="00:20:19.480" style="s2">other beyond the monetary or the trading</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:21.490" style="s2">system so basically this means it&#39;s us</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.480" end="00:20:23.530" style="s2">what the plain way in a minute is or</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.490" end="00:20:26.260" style="s2">it&#39;s been how this means that we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.530" end="00:20:28.840" style="s2">actually start and engaging with us in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.260" end="00:20:30.800" style="s2">free culture that we want to see in</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.840" end="00:20:32.900" style="s2">small ways now</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.800" end="00:20:34.550" style="s2">so to bottom up things a grass roots</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.900" end="00:20:36.770" style="s2">growing from the Lausanne thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.550" end="00:20:38.510" style="s2">that&#39;s it it has to be a bottom up it</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.770" end="00:20:42.740" style="s2">has to be a grassroots movement because</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.510" end="00:20:45.500" style="s2">no other no top-down social design has</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.740" end="00:20:48.760" style="s2">ever worked in the past do you see any</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.500" end="00:20:51.110" style="s2">value at all in you know political</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.760" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">demonstrations appealing for your MP</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.110" end="00:20:56.030" style="s2">well I think that everything doesn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">don&#39;t think any effort is ever wasted I</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.030" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">think that protests are good yet because</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">they&#39;re good first or like they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.220" style="s2">flashpoint for people they kind of they</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.440" style="s2">they make people think they they they</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.220" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">bring attention to issues I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.440" end="00:21:10.010" style="s2">important yeah but I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:11.780" style="s2">transition will come from that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.010" end="00:21:14.179" style="s2">I don&#39;t think transition ever really has</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.780" end="00:21:16.760" style="s2">come from transition comes from</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.179" end="00:21:18.380" style="s2">basically from normal people like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.760" end="00:21:20.870" style="s2">and me beginning to behave differently</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.380" end="00:21:24.380" style="s2">beginning to act differently changing</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.870" end="00:21:26.600" style="s2">our habits towards a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.380" end="00:21:28.370" style="s2">operating and that&#39;s what happened with</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.600" end="00:21:30.530" style="s2">the birth of capitalism and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.370" end="00:21:32.900" style="s2">only way I believe that it can happen to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.530" end="00:21:35.650" style="s2">transition out of capitalism is we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.900" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">to start acting and behaving in ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.650" end="00:21:41.179" style="s2">that are in that sort of system that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.830" style="s2">want to see in respect to education</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.179" end="00:21:45.710" style="s2">right because that&#39;s that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.830" end="00:21:47.300" style="s2">the way it spreads right is well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.710" end="00:21:49.910" style="s2">necessarily mean formal education in</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.300" end="00:21:52.850" style="s2">schools I mean learning about things you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.910" end="00:21:54.620" style="s2">know and there are loads of and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.850" end="00:21:56.390" style="s2">loads of online tools that there have</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.620" end="00:21:57.890" style="s2">actually helped us to do that like free</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.390" end="00:22:00.530" style="s2">world or is one that we do which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.890" end="00:22:03.320" style="s2">basically it&#39;s like a map based</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.530" end="00:22:04.970" style="s2">inventory of free goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.320" end="00:22:07.640" style="s2">that people are offering right now so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.970" end="00:22:09.470" style="s2">you can go on the map find out what</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.640" end="00:22:11.660" style="s2">things are available for free in your</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.470" end="00:22:13.940" style="s2">area somebody&#39;s giving away you know a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.660" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">guitar or they&#39;re giving away violin</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.940" end="00:22:20.780" style="s2">lessons or or language lessons I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:23.630" style="s2">this this is a small small like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.780" end="00:22:26.270" style="s2">microcosm if you like of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.630" end="00:22:27.710" style="s2">world that we&#39;re trying to aim at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.270" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">free world travel is going to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.710" end="00:22:30.920" style="s2">about that so I mean you bled into it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:33.230" style="s2">nicely so tell us a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.920" end="00:22:35.210" style="s2">that well the free world charter then</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.230" end="00:22:36.950" style="s2">was an asteroid like an aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.210" end="00:22:39.470" style="s2">kind of document that I wrote maybe bed</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.950" end="00:22:42.230" style="s2">nine years ago and it basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.470" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">describes where I what I consider to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.230" end="00:22:47.000" style="s2">like the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:49.010" style="s2">principles of a money free society which</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.000" end="00:22:51.980" style="s2">basically is about how we would position</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.010" end="00:22:55.040" style="s2">our priorities what what things should</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.980" end="00:22:57.730" style="s2">we be prioritizing and in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.040" end="00:23:00.590" style="s2">that work and in a way you can you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.730" end="00:23:03.800" style="s2">align it sorta to like religiosity maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.590" end="00:23:05.750" style="s2">the way that we we say when we know in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.800" end="00:23:08.330" style="s2">Christianity you might say the Lord is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.750" end="00:23:11.690" style="s2">the it&#39;s the most important thing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.330" end="00:23:13.400" style="s2">then you have like the priests and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.690" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">royalty and you know the way you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.400" end="00:23:17.120" style="s2">this kind of hierarchical system</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:18.800" style="s2">hierarchical system of priorities in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.120" end="00:23:20.150" style="s2">your mind of things that basically are</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.800" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">really important and things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.150" end="00:23:24.410" style="s2">so important what we did or what I did</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:26.030" style="s2">or the free word charter is I said well</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.410" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">okay the most important thing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.030" end="00:23:31.040" style="s2">actually nature and our shared fortunes</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.860" style="s2">on this planet of all species this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.040" end="00:23:35.690" style="s2">the most important thing of all because</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.860" end="00:23:37.790" style="s2">this is a physical reality and we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.690" end="00:23:40.160" style="s2">whatever we believe we cannot survive</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.790" end="00:23:42.560" style="s2">unless this thing is actually really and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.160" end="00:23:44.750" style="s2">well sustained and maintained and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.560" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">the other disk collectors ten principles</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.750" end="00:23:51.080" style="s2">from the Charter and one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:53.390" style="s2">about and valuing them the valuing all</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.080" end="00:23:54.740" style="s2">species you know the one is about saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.390" end="00:23:56.870" style="s2">that we&#39;re all equal</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.740" end="00:23:58.520" style="s2">shareholders in planet Earth basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.870" end="00:24:01.060" style="s2">you don&#39;t win regardless what anyone</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.520" end="00:24:05.540" style="s2">says that we are by birth we are equal</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.060" end="00:24:07.340" style="s2">shareholders and that and the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.540" end="00:24:09.740" style="s2">thing is that the best way to actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.340" end="00:24:12.040" style="s2">conduct society on earth is actually by</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.740" end="00:24:15.110" style="s2">not using a trading system but by using</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.040" end="00:24:16.940" style="s2">education and cooperation to actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.110" end="00:24:18.710" style="s2">and create a system where everyone gets</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.940" end="00:24:21.530" style="s2">looked after because at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.710" end="00:24:24.140" style="s2">day if we want to if we want to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.530" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">our chances of success at life or</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.140" end="00:24:28.790" style="s2">success of creating a good future world</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:32.180" style="s2">we have to we have to find the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.790" end="00:24:33.530" style="s2">sustainable and fairest ways to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.180" end="00:24:35.330" style="s2">things and the fairest and most</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.530" end="00:24:36.740" style="s2">sustainable way is to do away with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.330" end="00:24:40.040" style="s2">market system which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.740" end="00:24:41.420" style="s2">trashing the planet and basically look</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.040" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">after each other you know and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.420" end="00:24:45.860" style="s2">and this is this is how we all behave</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:48.380" style="s2">anyway in our in our own little worlds</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.860" end="00:24:50.690" style="s2">and ever in our families in our tribes</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.380" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">and I guess somehow when it gets scaled</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.690" end="00:24:54.090" style="s2">up it gets distorted into this yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:56.489" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.090" end="00:24:58.409" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the challenge really the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.489" end="00:25:00.059" style="s2">challenge yes I mean if we all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.409" end="00:25:01.769" style="s2">we all tend to look after each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.059" end="00:25:04.590" style="s2">we&#39;re nice to our family well more or</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.769" end="00:25:06.509" style="s2">less we&#39;re kind of we tend to look after</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.590" end="00:25:08.309" style="s2">our family we don&#39;t ask for payment we</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.509" end="00:25:10.289" style="s2">don&#39;t really trade generally with with</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.309" end="00:25:12.419" style="s2">our small circle of people so the big</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.289" end="00:25:15.389" style="s2">question is can we actually expand our</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.419" end="00:25:18.389" style="s2">family how to encompass everybody or at</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.389" end="00:25:20.399" style="s2">least the the larger community I believe</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.389" end="00:25:22.469" style="s2">it&#39;s possible yeah that&#39;s really for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.399" end="00:25:25.259" style="s2">that is it&#39;s a big question you know is</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.469" end="00:25:27.809" style="s2">yes and can we take that innate trust</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.259" end="00:25:29.820" style="s2">and responsibility towards each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.809" end="00:25:32.249" style="s2">that we do within our small circles and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.820" end="00:25:34.739" style="s2">can we expand that out so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.249" end="00:25:36.389" style="s2">interesting question I&#39;m sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.739" end="00:25:40.529" style="s2">aware of this research that says that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.389" end="00:25:42.359" style="s2">when societies get larger than about 150</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.529" end="00:25:44.519" style="s2">individuals it&#39;s no longer possible for</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.359" end="00:25:45.749" style="s2">everybody to know everybody you know and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.519" end="00:25:48.239" style="s2">know everybody&#39;s stories on an</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.749" end="00:25:51.210" style="s2">individual level and therefore they need</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.239" end="00:25:52.649" style="s2">to buy into other collective stories you</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.210" end="00:25:54.479" style="s2">talked about this quite a lot in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.649" end="00:25:57.359" style="s2">book about the impression ability and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.479" end="00:26:01.589" style="s2">the plasticity of the human mind and how</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.359" end="00:26:03.389" style="s2">easy how easily we are influenced and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.589" end="00:26:04.739" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a double-edged sword right you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.389" end="00:26:06.179" style="s2">point this out in the book on the one</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.739" end="00:26:07.830" style="s2">hand it means we&#39;re very easily</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.179" end="00:26:09.059" style="s2">manipulated but on the other hand it</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.830" end="00:26:12.450" style="s2">also means that we can change very</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.059" end="00:26:14.429" style="s2">easily and very quickly right and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.450" end="00:26:17.969" style="s2">yeah no I absolutely agree with all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.429" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">that and so just sorry sorry I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.969" end="00:26:22.139" style="s2">want to do too much talking this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:26.669" style="s2">really about you but you touched on</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.139" end="00:26:28.469" style="s2">something a moment ago about letting go</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.669" end="00:26:30.479" style="s2">you know expanding and our compassion</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.469" end="00:26:32.219" style="s2">beyond our immediate circle of family</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.479" end="00:26:35.190" style="s2">and friends to include the broader</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.219" end="00:26:36.599" style="s2">community that would mean going against</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.190" end="00:26:38.099" style="s2">and again this is this is down to our</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.599" end="00:26:39.839" style="s2">plasticity and impression ability</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.099" end="00:26:41.339" style="s2">there&#39;s been going against centuries of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.839" end="00:26:44.460" style="s2">divide and rule where we have been</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.339" end="00:26:48.719" style="s2">taught to mistrust and be suspicious of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.460" end="00:26:50.999" style="s2">the other right and so again how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.719" end="00:26:53.489" style="s2">go about overcoming I complete I listen</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.999" end="00:26:55.710" style="s2">I am I completely am on board with what</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.489" end="00:26:59.820" style="s2">you&#39;re saying what I&#39;m not quite getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.710" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">is practical sense I think this is very</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.820" end="00:27:04.019" style="s2">important to remember that our society</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:05.530" style="s2">our system that we use that maybe were</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.019" end="00:27:07.750" style="s2">not so happy with</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.530" end="00:27:09.610" style="s2">is a product of our behavior it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.750" end="00:27:11.530" style="s2">product of our actions it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.610" end="00:27:14.470" style="s2">something that anyone forced on us were</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.530" end="00:27:16.270" style="s2">not I don&#39;t I really don&#39;t subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.470" end="00:27:18.130" style="s2">this theory on this Elise who are kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.270" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">of like whipping us and they were kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.130" end="00:27:22.330" style="s2">of laughing at us or trying to turn us</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:23.860" style="s2">into slave batteries or</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.330" end="00:27:26.680" style="s2">something like this I mean I have no</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.860" end="00:27:29.950" style="s2">time for that because I mean society is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.680" end="00:27:32.590" style="s2">a product it&#39;s a system that evolves out</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.950" end="00:27:35.860" style="s2">of collective behavior there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.590" end="00:27:39.550" style="s2">other way to see it you know even if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.860" end="00:27:42.820" style="s2">try to go and control the society you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.550" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">know if if you&#39;re if you&#39;re gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.820" end="00:27:46.240" style="s2">revolution if people don&#39;t like the sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:48.040" style="s2">of stuff that you&#39;re saying or that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:49.330" style="s2">you&#39;re doing you know and you can whip</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.040" end="00:27:51.070" style="s2">them and whip and whip them but</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.330" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">eventually you&#39;ll be found out you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.070" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">if it&#39;s something that people it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:56.880" style="s2">resonate with the behavior that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:59.350" style="s2">want to have anyway this is why and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:00.970" style="s2">certain communist regimes have failed</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.350" end="00:28:02.980" style="s2">over the years because it just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.970" end="00:28:08.460" style="s2">resonate with the way people naturally</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.980" end="00:28:11.620" style="s2">want to act so and the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.460" end="00:28:14.110" style="s2">letting go yeah in terms of the our</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.620" end="00:28:16.930" style="s2">behaviors if we if we want to change our</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.110" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">society we have to change our individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.930" end="00:28:20.830" style="s2">and collective behavior it&#39;s as simple</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:22.690" style="s2">as that if we want a more compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.830" end="00:28:25.330" style="s2">society we have to be more compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.690" end="00:28:27.210" style="s2">know if we want more sustainable society</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.330" end="00:28:29.890" style="s2">we have to start recycling more or</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.210" end="00:28:31.900" style="s2">reducing the trash that we use I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.890" end="00:28:33.940" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s no-brainer that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.900" end="00:28:36.760" style="s2">stuff but in terms of actually moving</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.940" end="00:28:39.130" style="s2">beyond money and creating society that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.760" end="00:28:40.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t rely on money that&#39;s not again</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.130" end="00:28:42.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to come from outside no</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.930" end="00:28:44.860" style="s2">one is going to come up with this big</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.160" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">magic plan and say oh here&#39;s how we we</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.860" end="00:28:49.720" style="s2">get rid of money we just do this this</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:51.700" style="s2">big formula and we are we we build this</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.720" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">infrastructure that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.700" end="00:28:54.790" style="s2">happen it&#39;s not gonna happen that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:57.820" style="s2">either it has to happen with our</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.790" end="00:28:59.980" style="s2">individual collective behavior it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.820" end="00:29:01.960" style="s2">bit of a boring and tiresome answer but</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.980" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">this is really is honestly the truth the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.960" end="00:29:05.100" style="s2">only way to actually change society is</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:07.420" style="s2">to change</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.100" end="00:29:08.470" style="s2">I agree with you and that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.420" end="00:29:10.150" style="s2">lot more that sounds a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.470" end="00:29:11.800" style="s2">realistic than some of the stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.150" end="00:29:13.090" style="s2">hear from activists you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.800" end="00:29:15.850" style="s2">it sounds a lot more down-to-earth a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.090" end="00:29:18.040" style="s2">more realistic I want to talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.850" end="00:29:18.669" style="s2">I mentioned the free world of sight</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.040" end="00:29:20.379" style="s2">which is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.669" end="00:29:21.909" style="s2">thing that we did and like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.379" end="00:29:23.739" style="s2">offshoot of the free world charter when</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.909" end="00:29:26.019" style="s2">we wanted to put into our things into</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.739" end="00:29:28.179" style="s2">action where you can give and share</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.019" end="00:29:31.119" style="s2">goods and services freely with other</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.179" end="00:29:32.830" style="s2">people and that&#39;s just one site and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.119" end="00:29:35.080" style="s2">is like a very much a fledgling sites</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.830" end="00:29:37.269" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very much in its infancy we</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.080" end="00:29:38.590" style="s2">have like the two thousand members are</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.269" end="00:29:40.600" style="s2">all around the world or something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.590" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">that and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit of a hard</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.600" end="00:29:45.489" style="s2">slog to be honest with you it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:49.899" style="s2">not the most and active sites you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.489" end="00:29:52.629" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like pushing a</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.899" end="00:29:55.749" style="s2">rock up a hill sometimes what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.629" end="00:29:58.749" style="s2">doing here is really very very extremely</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.749" end="00:30:01.899" style="s2">counterculture and counterintuitive in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.749" end="00:30:04.239" style="s2">lot of ways some people but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.899" end="00:30:06.100" style="s2">the only size that&#39;s and there are other</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.239" end="00:30:09.690" style="s2">sites there&#39;s a whole plethora of sites</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.100" end="00:30:14.289" style="s2">now make pure B you have karma tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.690" end="00:30:18.009" style="s2">Cindy you have Street Bank you have kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.289" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">Easter and I can&#39;t remember the others</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.009" end="00:30:21.999" style="s2">now but there&#39;s at least ten other sites</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:23.970" style="s2">some of them really active something not</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.999" end="00:30:26.499" style="s2">so active which are basically people</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.970" end="00:30:29.350" style="s2">unconditionally giving goods and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.499" end="00:30:31.960" style="s2">services and that for me is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.350" end="00:30:34.330" style="s2">golden tickers that if we can make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.960" end="00:30:37.389" style="s2">work where people are starting to goods</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.330" end="00:30:40.210" style="s2">give and share goods and services with</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.389" end="00:30:43.029" style="s2">complete strangers for no reward for no</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.210" end="00:30:45.609" style="s2">payment but in the sort of in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.029" end="00:30:48.549" style="s2">expectation that they can also receive</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.609" end="00:30:49.690" style="s2">absolutely everything doesn&#39;t it instead</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.039" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">zero-sum game and it&#39;s a really but</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.210" end="00:31:13.659" style="s2">there&#39;s also a little small thing where</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:17.100" style="s2">basically that you did something good</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.659" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">for someone else and that&#39;s okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.100" end="00:31:21.929" style="s2">it&#39;s a little rush that we get from when</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:25.299" style="s2">we help other people but it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.929" end="00:31:27.220" style="s2">muted out because this that because this</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.299" end="00:31:28.239" style="s2">glamour phone number is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.220" end="00:31:31.450" style="s2">linked to our survival</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.450" end="00:31:36.920" style="s2">yeah absolutely we sort of we have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.670" end="00:31:39.110" style="s2">wrong really about giving and receiving</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.920" end="00:31:41.450" style="s2">we think that when we give something</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.110" end="00:31:44.150" style="s2">that we lose but we don&#39;t always lose we</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.450" end="00:31:46.820" style="s2">actually we gain a sort of a bit of an</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.820" end="00:31:51.950" style="s2">doing that and I see this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.280" end="00:31:53.810" style="s2">in the in my own work I mean I do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.950" end="00:31:55.130" style="s2">of stuff things for free I&#39;m sure you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.810" end="00:31:56.780" style="s2">too as well and it&#39;s kind of nice you</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.130" end="00:31:58.250" style="s2">know it&#39;s nice when you help somebody</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.780" end="00:31:59.690" style="s2">out if you know for a couple sit down</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.250" end="00:32:01.390" style="s2">with them and cover our if you help to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.690" end="00:32:04.700" style="s2">know whatever it is they&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.390" end="00:32:07.580" style="s2">you get a big kick out of doing them but</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.700" end="00:32:09.560" style="s2">when somebody pays you 100 quid or 200</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.580" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">quid to do that you don&#39;t you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.560" end="00:32:17.270" style="s2">that same rice or it masks that feeling</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:20.210" style="s2">so without without the money system we</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.270" end="00:32:23.240" style="s2">actually we can start to actually really</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.210" end="00:32:26.090" style="s2">experience that idea of the rush you get</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.240" end="00:32:27.950" style="s2">from giving and sharing with other</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.090" end="00:32:31.010" style="s2">people because it really is palpable</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.950" end="00:32:35.480" style="s2">it&#39;s real oh the foot yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.010" end="00:32:37.280" style="s2">and and and I mean it&#39;s if everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.480" end="00:32:39.380" style="s2">doing it it&#39;s not just about you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.280" end="00:32:41.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not just about the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.380" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">pleasure that you get from giving but</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.270" end="00:32:46.730" style="s2">it&#39;s also the the security that comes in</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:48.170" style="s2">the knowledge that you know that what</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.730" end="00:32:50.180" style="s2">what you need is out there for you</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.170" end="00:32:52.070" style="s2">because that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the nature</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.180" end="00:32:54.710" style="s2">of things and you know that that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.070" end="00:32:56.870" style="s2">greed is now transmuted into this</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.710" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">confidence that what I need will be</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.870" end="00:33:01.250" style="s2">there and you know that whole fear of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:03.710" style="s2">scarcity in the future thing is gone you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.250" end="00:33:05.390" style="s2">know well that&#39;s you hit the nail on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.710" end="00:33:08.030" style="s2">head there without the word confidence</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.390" end="00:33:10.430" style="s2">really is is the key to us because if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.030" end="00:33:13.610" style="s2">because the system that we&#39;ve created on</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.430" end="00:33:15.560" style="s2">free world err is not yet a confident</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.610" end="00:33:17.630" style="s2">system okay we have like literally it</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.560" end="00:33:19.730" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s too small at the moment but</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.630" end="00:33:22.130" style="s2">exactly we have a handful of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:24.470" style="s2">giving and sharing a very small low</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.130" end="00:33:26.120" style="s2">weight low valuations and that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.470" end="00:33:28.130" style="s2">enough but that is where we have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.120" end="00:33:31.220" style="s2">begin you know and it&#39;s low confidence</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.130" end="00:33:33.380" style="s2">it&#39;s low value but over time when</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.220" end="00:33:34.280" style="s2">involves just like the serfs did in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.380" end="00:33:36.980" style="s2">free market</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.280" end="00:33:39.110" style="s2">yesterday&#39;s years ago then that we build</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.980" end="00:33:41.330" style="s2">a confidence in that model we build</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.110" end="00:33:43.670" style="s2">caught we feel secure in the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.330" end="00:33:45.050" style="s2">when we give something that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.670" end="00:33:47.330" style="s2">big wide circle</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.050" end="00:33:48.620" style="s2">yeah come back to us later you know and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.330" end="00:33:50.330" style="s2">the first it would have the internet</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.620" end="00:33:51.410" style="s2">right I mean let&#39;s say that change that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.330" end="00:33:53.750" style="s2">changes everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.410" end="00:33:56.180" style="s2">yeah it really does this it really it</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.750" end="00:33:57.560" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been possible before now I missed</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.180" end="00:33:58.730" style="s2">on a large scale you know but the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.560" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">internet makes it possible yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.730" end="00:34:01.490" style="s2">absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:05.020" style="s2">we have people like offering programming</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.490" end="00:34:07.970" style="s2">services and like proofreading services</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.020" end="00:34:09.530" style="s2">loads of things check it out.3 were</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.970" end="00:34:10.909" style="s2">there and they some of them will say ok</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.530" end="00:34:13.580" style="s2">I&#39;ll do this I&#39;ll give you an hour my</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.909" end="00:34:15.470" style="s2">turn to air at my time or people even</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.580" end="00:34:17.659" style="s2">offering business advice actually which</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.470" end="00:34:20.270" style="s2">is kind of ironic but anyways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.659" end="00:34:22.220" style="s2">interesting and the point is that when</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.270" end="00:34:23.390" style="s2">we when enough people have confidence in</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.220" end="00:34:26.230" style="s2">that system they will have four more</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.390" end="00:34:28.280" style="s2">things they offer higher valuations and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.230" end="00:34:30.020" style="s2">eventually the confidence will grow to</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.280" end="00:34:32.300" style="s2">such a point where maybe maybe people</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.020" end="00:34:34.600" style="s2">can offer houses people cannot order a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.300" end="00:34:36.679" style="s2">car and run through stuff mister because</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.600" end="00:34:40.100" style="s2">things I wrote about recently actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.679" end="00:34:42.890" style="s2">was I mean if you owned a house would</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.100" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">you offer your house for free now on one</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.890" end="00:34:45.800" style="s2">of these websites well of course you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:47.780" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you know it&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.800" end="00:34:49.580" style="s2">suggest and it&#39;s like throwing money</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.780" end="00:34:52.040" style="s2">down the drain but if you turn that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.580" end="00:34:55.159" style="s2">around and say okay would you offer your</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.040" end="00:34:57.380" style="s2">house on this website if you knew that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.159" end="00:35:00.080" style="s2">actually there were hundreds or if not</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.380" end="00:35:01.810" style="s2">thousands of other similar hazards also</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.080" end="00:35:04.180" style="s2">being offered you know that website</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.810" end="00:35:06.530" style="s2">something you&#39;re not losing out so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.180" end="00:35:08.180" style="s2">easy to give your house away because you</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.530" end="00:35:09.350" style="s2">can just go and grab another one so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.180" end="00:35:11.660" style="s2">someone else is giving you no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.350" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the level of confidence</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.660" end="00:35:16.010" style="s2">here it&#39;s going to take a while to reach</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:17.450" style="s2">that yes that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.010" end="00:35:18.950" style="s2">you know that&#39;s possible and we start</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.450" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">with a little valuation we start with</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.950" end="00:35:23.290" style="s2"> USB sticks</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:26.420" style="s2">we start with pens you know with</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.290" end="00:35:29.510" style="s2">tribulations smalls services which would</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.420" end="00:35:31.310" style="s2">probably have now and over time this the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.510" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">confidence in that system will build and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.310" end="00:35:36.080" style="s2">eventually we can we can move towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:40.310" style="s2">you know whatever they&#39;re giving hold</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.080" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">silos of grain or houses or helicopters</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.310" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">or whatever who knows so it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:48.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not the most tantalizing of visions</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:50.540" style="s2">really it&#39;s not like it requires work</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.110" end="00:35:52.550" style="s2">you know it requires effort on people it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.540" end="00:35:54.080" style="s2">requires time yeah but it&#39;s in a bit a</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.550" end="00:35:56.060" style="s2">bit but it&#39;s rooted in individual</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.080" end="00:35:57.410" style="s2">responsibility isn&#39;t it yeah because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.060" end="00:35:58.280" style="s2">mean that there are other like groups</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.410" end="00:36:01.130" style="s2">who advocate</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.280" end="00:36:03.050" style="s2">moneyless sort of system and they maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.130" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">they would want to build cities like</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.050" end="00:36:08.870" style="s2">build a like a some kind of a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:10.490" style="s2">highly technological city and invite</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.870" end="00:36:12.410" style="s2">people to live there and try out that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.490" end="00:36:15.020" style="s2">under like to create like a miniature</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.410" end="00:36:17.570" style="s2">prototype culture and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.020" end="00:36:18.950" style="s2">some value in there and a lot would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.570" end="00:36:21.470" style="s2">learned even if it failed a lot would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.950" end="00:36:23.390" style="s2">learned in the process right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.470" end="00:36:26.780" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah well it the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.390" end="00:36:29.330" style="s2">problems is that if it failed it would</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.780" end="00:36:33.620" style="s2">probably be forever held as an example</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.330" end="00:36:35.210" style="s2">of proof that such as never work for me</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.620" end="00:36:38.180" style="s2">I think I think it would be useful</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.210" end="00:36:40.370" style="s2">experiments but I think that unless we</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.180" end="00:36:42.500" style="s2">invest we really tackle the behavior on</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.370" end="00:36:44.450" style="s2">a really fundamental individual level I</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.500" end="00:36:46.940" style="s2">don&#39;t think this kind of thing can work</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.450" end="00:36:50.900" style="s2">full-time you know because maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.940" end="00:36:52.190" style="s2">work in a small area like isolated from</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.900" end="00:36:55.070" style="s2">the rest of the world like a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.190" end="00:36:57.700" style="s2">island it could maybe work like that but</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.070" end="00:37:00.440" style="s2">if you want we don&#39;t want to have like</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.700" end="00:37:01.870" style="s2">the whole world with just little islands</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.440" end="00:37:03.980" style="s2">of communities we want to have a world</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.870" end="00:37:06.470" style="s2">connected world helping each other I</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.980" end="00:37:07.790" style="s2">love I love what Michael Challenger does</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.570" end="00:37:19.240" style="s2">to start looking - so behaving</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.010" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">differently the science and technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.240" end="00:37:23.170" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to think about science</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:26.150" style="s2">technology because it&#39;s already there</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.170" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">it&#39;s still cliche you know you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.150" end="00:37:29.690" style="s2">you can have technology to to feed</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.840" style="s2">everyone or you can have technology to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.690" end="00:37:35.540" style="s2">make bombs until you actually have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.840" end="00:37:36.920" style="s2">appropriate behavior then then let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.540" end="00:37:38.660" style="s2">the behavior right and then we can use</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.920" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">technology whatever way we want so</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.660" end="00:37:43.010" style="s2">technology isn&#39;t going away it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:44.900" style="s2">going back in the box and of course once</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.010" end="00:37:47.270" style="s2">we take away that the profit motive</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.900" end="00:37:50.870" style="s2">it&#39;ll be it&#39;ll be can be unleashed</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.270" end="00:37:53.330" style="s2">really to its potential so it&#39;s it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.870" end="00:37:56.420" style="s2">to play for but I think long story short</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.330" end="00:37:59.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s going to take time you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.420" end="00:38:03.560" style="s2">it&#39;s going to take a lot of work on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.020" end="00:38:05.390" style="s2">individual I see a lot of value in like</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.560" end="00:38:07.460" style="s2">awareness movements and people like</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.390" end="00:38:09.710" style="s2">Russell Brand to talk about spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.460" end="00:38:11.120" style="s2">awakenings and come to really really</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.710" end="00:38:12.860" style="s2">like ruffle brand he was</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.120" end="00:38:14.360" style="s2">not back in the day but I&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.860" end="00:38:15.890" style="s2">really really like one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.360" end="00:38:18.140" style="s2">interviewers on on the Internet as far</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.890" end="00:38:21.260" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned he&#39;s an absolute genius</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.140" end="00:38:23.810" style="s2">he really I mean I don&#39;t really I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.260" end="00:38:26.510" style="s2">really go in for this kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.810" end="00:38:29.260" style="s2">angle so much myself but I see value in</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.510" end="00:38:32.510" style="s2">as I see value in actually in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.260" end="00:38:35.210" style="s2">transcending the sort of lizard brain</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.510" end="00:38:37.010" style="s2">response that we take he&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.210" end="00:38:38.510" style="s2">open you know he doesn&#39;t reject anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.010" end="00:38:40.100" style="s2">that anyone says he questions them</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.510" end="00:38:42.110" style="s2">thoroughly but he doesn&#39;t reject and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.100" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">always builds a rapport with his</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.110" end="00:38:46.670" style="s2">interviewees I really enjoy I really</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">enjoy listening to him yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.670" end="00:38:50.330" style="s2">he&#39;s a good guy he really is a good guy</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:52.850" style="s2">yeah we need a lot more of him really do</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.330" end="00:38:54.050" style="s2">one thing I&#39;d like to touch on with you</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.850" end="00:38:56.210" style="s2">before I think I think we&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.050" end="00:38:57.530" style="s2">just about no I don&#39;t want to bore</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.210" end="00:38:58.850" style="s2">people for too long so I think he</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.530" end="00:39:00.620" style="s2">probably just about done on time but one</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.850" end="00:39:01.790" style="s2">more thing I&#39;d like to touch on with you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.620" end="00:39:03.860" style="s2">which is again something Charles</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.790" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">Eisenstein talks a great deal about is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.860" end="00:39:08.420" style="s2">is the power of story this is something</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:11.900" style="s2">that I&#39;ve become very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.420" end="00:39:15.170" style="s2">recently is is the ability of story</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.900" end="00:39:17.240" style="s2">narrative mythology archetype that kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.170" end="00:39:19.910" style="s2">of thing to really shape the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.240" end="00:39:24.050" style="s2">interact with the world the way we fit</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.910" end="00:39:26.120" style="s2">with it if you know what I mean and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.050" end="00:39:27.980" style="s2">something that you did in your book not</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.120" end="00:39:29.120" style="s2">in FME Neph day is a novel anyway and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.980" end="00:39:30.770" style="s2">you&#39;ve done the whole you know the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.120" end="00:39:32.270" style="s2">thing is couched in terms of story but</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.770" end="00:39:35.420" style="s2">even in into the OE</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.270" end="00:39:37.790" style="s2">or your nonfiction book you had a series</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.420" end="00:39:40.220" style="s2">of very short stories in there relating</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.790" end="00:39:41.870" style="s2">people&#39;s experiences of the transitions</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.220" end="00:39:43.430" style="s2">for the new economy and I have to say I</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.870" end="00:39:45.470" style="s2">found that one of the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.430" end="00:39:47.900" style="s2">parts of the book you know because you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.470" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">and this this is the thing which story</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.900" end="00:39:50.330" style="s2">I&#39;d like to hear what you think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.490" style="s2">this this is the thing which is or here</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.330" end="00:39:56.120" style="s2">it&#39;s so much more powerful than a set of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.490" end="00:39:58.520" style="s2">instructions because as the reader you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.120" end="00:40:00.470" style="s2">put yourself into the shoes of one or</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.520" end="00:40:02.870" style="s2">more characters in that story and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.470" end="00:40:04.970" style="s2">live out the thing through you know you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.870" end="00:40:06.980" style="s2">live it out in in in a real way in an</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.970" end="00:40:10.370" style="s2">emotional way you engage with it with</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.980" end="00:40:13.370" style="s2">far more of yourself and so just to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.370" end="00:40:16.280" style="s2">close out on hmm how do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.370" end="00:40:19.580" style="s2">could employ their power as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.280" end="00:40:21.830" style="s2">process of engendering the compassion</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.580" end="00:40:22.840" style="s2">and the collaboration the cooperation in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.830" end="00:40:24.770" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.840" end="00:40:25.940" style="s2">yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.770" end="00:40:28.700" style="s2">one of the other projects that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.940" end="00:40:30.260" style="s2">working on by the way I didn&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.700" end="00:40:33.140" style="s2">that we have we created this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.260" end="00:40:35.690" style="s2">organisation called free world one which</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.140" end="00:40:38.150" style="s2">is basically and ironically it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.690" end="00:40:40.970" style="s2">for-profit company which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.150" end="00:40:42.470" style="s2">for launching different projects that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.970" end="00:40:44.540" style="s2">want to launch and one of the projects</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.470" end="00:40:47.210" style="s2">that we&#39;re hoping to do is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.540" end="00:40:50.869" style="s2">movie first of the F Day book because</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.210" end="00:40:53.720" style="s2">your rights at the little them so user</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.869" end="00:40:56.270" style="s2">stories in the interim economy a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.720" end="00:40:58.460" style="s2">people have really liked those and FJ is</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.270" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">really almost like a full-length novel</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.460" end="00:41:04.780" style="s2">version of that and not so much as more</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:06.890" style="s2">it&#39;s more about transition and their</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.780" end="00:41:09.980" style="s2">resistance and transition and that sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.890" end="00:41:10.940" style="s2">of stuff so and we&#39;re hoping to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.980" end="00:41:12.680" style="s2">that into a movie</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.940" end="00:41:15.790" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve actually had some interest</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.680" end="00:41:19.010" style="s2">from a producer in the US and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.790" end="00:41:21.230" style="s2">director in the US as well who basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.010" end="00:41:23.300" style="s2">are interested in seeing your scripts of</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.230" end="00:41:25.190" style="s2">that of that books they read the book</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.300" end="00:41:27.020" style="s2">and they love the book so yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.190" end="00:41:28.700" style="s2">that&#39;s one really good vehicle we could</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.020" end="00:41:31.609" style="s2">use is to actually try and create like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.700" end="00:41:33.859" style="s2">mainstream blockbuster movie I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.609" end="00:41:36.050" style="s2">it were possible and that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.859" end="00:41:37.970" style="s2">fantastic achievement and a way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.050" end="00:41:40.550" style="s2">actually putting the ideas into people</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.970" end="00:41:44.330" style="s2">that you know kind of really make them</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.550" end="00:41:46.369" style="s2">think hey what the hell you know and one</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.330" end="00:41:49.280" style="s2">of the things that a lot of the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.369" end="00:41:52.940" style="s2">I get from that F Day book is that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.280" end="00:41:55.730" style="s2">makes it so seem very very real and very</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.940" end="00:41:58.840" style="s2">easy and very plausible and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.730" end="00:42:01.220" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really valuable I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.840" end="00:42:04.190" style="s2">acid of the story is the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.220" end="00:42:08.900" style="s2">will seem so plausible and if we could</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.190" end="00:42:11.930" style="s2">create a movie like that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.900" end="00:42:15.830" style="s2">making a big impact would be fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.930" end="00:42:17.869" style="s2">but we the best way to do that is really</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.830" end="00:42:19.970" style="s2">through the profit system ironically</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.869" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">enough now I don&#39;t get it too much</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.970" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">because then because I know I&#39;m somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.900" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">who kind of advocates like a moneyless</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.520" end="00:42:29.480" style="s2">Society I&#39;m very passionate about asked</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:30.830" style="s2">so you mean a lot of people say well why</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.480" end="00:42:32.900" style="s2">the hell are you setting up a company</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.830" end="00:42:35.300" style="s2">and the shorter answer is is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.900" end="00:42:37.329" style="s2">because they really feel the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.300" end="00:42:39.640" style="s2">do things right here right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.329" end="00:42:41.709" style="s2">yeah we basically we were putting a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.640" end="00:42:43.390" style="s2">called getting investors in to do this</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.709" end="00:42:45.099" style="s2">thing like we are educational project</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.390" end="00:42:48.219" style="s2">the life games books this has been</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.099" end="00:42:49.749" style="s2">financed by our investors and the FDA</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.219" end="00:42:51.640" style="s2">movie scripts are being financed by our</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.749" end="00:42:53.410" style="s2">investors the free world their website</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.640" end="00:42:55.690" style="s2">that I was mentioned earlier this is is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.410" end="00:42:59.950" style="s2">being backed by the investors as well so</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.690" end="00:43:01.479" style="s2">we&#39;ve built up and and a pool of a pool</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.950" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">of money basically two people who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.479" end="00:43:07.150" style="s2">backing these projects and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:08.440" style="s2">delicious irony of it is that all these</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.150" end="00:43:11.049" style="s2">people are shareholders in this company</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.440" end="00:43:12.940" style="s2">and if we start actually making money</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.049" end="00:43:15.039" style="s2">from this company we can actually put</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.940" end="00:43:16.450" style="s2">money back to shareholders I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.039" end="00:43:20.140" style="s2">that sounds completely counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.450" end="00:43:24.759" style="s2">but actually my feeling we are where we</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.140" end="00:43:28.380" style="s2">are right you can only operate without</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.759" end="00:43:30.579" style="s2">that if we don&#39;t do this if we rely on</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.380" end="00:43:34.690" style="s2">volunteering people doing stuff in their</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.579" end="00:43:37.479" style="s2">spare time it&#39;s it&#39;s a mess it</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.690" end="00:43:40.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t society and our system is not we</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.479" end="00:43:42.130" style="s2">are not organized enough to behave that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.390" end="00:43:43.719" style="s2">way feels responsible and accountable</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.130" end="00:43:47.199" style="s2">unless there&#39;s a deadline and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.719" end="00:43:49.809" style="s2">getting paid for it yeah and of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.199" end="00:43:52.690" style="s2">people have not just it&#39;s not just not</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.809" end="00:43:54.640" style="s2">that people won&#39;t volunteer or that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.690" end="00:43:57.609" style="s2">are not passionate enough it&#39;s that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.640" end="00:43:59.799" style="s2">also have jobs that they that they have</p>
