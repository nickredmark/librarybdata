<p begin="00:00:16.460" end="00:00:21.890" style="s2">about Tantra whatever the hell that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.630" end="00:00:23.390" style="s2">why don&#39;t you define counter first oh</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.890" end="00:00:25.640" style="s2">and then you do the questions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.390" end="00:00:27.019" style="s2">exactly exactly what those needs</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.640" end="00:00:30.140" style="s2">understood this beautiful concept</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.019" end="00:00:32.600" style="s2">exactly so there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.140" end="00:00:35.390" style="s2">etymology that has to do with weaving</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.600" end="00:00:37.940" style="s2">sewing together that&#39;s part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.390" end="00:00:40.610" style="s2">animala G and also stretching I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.940" end="00:00:42.800" style="s2">when I was looking into it</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.610" end="00:00:45.680" style="s2">it means generally a technique or</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.800" end="00:00:48.350" style="s2">practice but and it&#39;s normally</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.680" end="00:00:50.570" style="s2">associated with with sex in the West but</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.350" end="00:00:52.820" style="s2">that&#39;s actually something more like neo</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.570" end="00:00:54.710" style="s2">Tantra because yeah it could be all</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.820" end="00:00:58.430" style="s2">kinds of practices right it has much</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.710" end="00:01:01.550" style="s2">it&#39;s not specifically related to fucking</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.430" end="00:01:04.040" style="s2">let&#39;s say more about our Western</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.550" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">obsession with sexuality the dust about</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.040" end="00:01:09.260" style="s2">original Tantra doesn&#39;t it exactly so so</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:12.140" style="s2">the Western the Western obsession is</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.260" end="00:01:14.210" style="s2">with sort of opening this serpent power</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.140" end="00:01:16.520" style="s2">Kundalini Shakti or whatever the hell</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.210" end="00:01:19.250" style="s2">you know there&#39;s it has it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.520" end="00:01:21.710" style="s2">elastic term and it&#39;s such an abused</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.250" end="00:01:23.870" style="s2">term and it&#39;s such a it seems to be it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.710" end="00:01:26.990" style="s2">seems to me to have taken on almost a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.870" end="00:01:29.120" style="s2">demonic quality in the West we in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.990" end="00:01:31.970" style="s2">West are so obsessed with instant</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.120" end="00:01:33.290" style="s2">gratification yeah that we thought of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.970" end="00:01:35.090" style="s2">tons of the way we think of everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.290" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">else in the West which is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.090" end="00:01:39.049" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna colonize am I gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:41.960" style="s2">appropriate and then we&#39;re gonna extract</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.049" end="00:01:43.490" style="s2">instant value or whatever we find yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.960" end="00:01:46.340" style="s2">called an exploitation we&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.490" end="00:01:48.470" style="s2">exploitative culture where is so faster</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.340" end="00:01:51.290" style="s2">do you think exploitation so we run into</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.470" end="00:01:53.330" style="s2">something like tundra and long huge rich</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.290" end="00:01:56.030" style="s2">traditional thinking from the east and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.330" end="00:01:58.040" style="s2">practice and and then we think the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.030" end="00:02:02.360" style="s2">Tantra is just gonna be another short</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.040" end="00:02:05.390" style="s2">route to our desires so yeah first a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.360" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">fast route to enlightenment which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.390" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">really what you and I are people and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">and leads people to as you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:14.370" style="s2">exploitation in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.320" style="s2">sense of wine you exploit that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.370" end="00:02:18.450" style="s2">body&#39;s natural power and the mate maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.320" end="00:02:20.070" style="s2">in the way you white mine for uranium or</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.450" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">something you know is that exactly</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.070" end="00:02:25.170" style="s2">again power to get you know mm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.950" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">and that is why in our first book the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.170" end="00:02:29.160" style="s2">netic rats which is the first book in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:31.410" style="s2">the futur the trilogy can we wrote what</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.160" end="00:02:33.240" style="s2">80 80 years ago we do not have a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.410" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">important concept it&#39;s gonna catch up</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.240" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">with us eventually in the digital age</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">and we call this concept employ tation</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">mmm-hmm which is the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:44.370" style="s2">exploitation fun enough there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:46.440" style="s2">even a word for this what we mean with</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.370" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">implication is that we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.440" end="00:02:51.330" style="s2">learn that the real value in something</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.140" end="00:02:53.330" style="s2">is actually investing in it and keeping</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.330" end="00:02:56.250" style="s2">it as it is for as long as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.330" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">which i think is fundamental to Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:03:00.060" style="s2">so that means in our age you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:02.459" style="s2">current obsession that we don&#39;t grow up</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.060" end="00:03:05.190" style="s2">any longer our culture is infantilized</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.459" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">and the whole journey from childhood to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.190" end="00:03:08.150" style="s2">adulthood it&#39;s gonna be hard to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">relearned it&#39;s gonna be the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.150" end="00:03:11.160" style="s2">important exercise we do over the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">100 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.160" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a adult defy society again well you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:18.269" style="s2">and I love Jordan Peterson I always</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">point out Jordan is greater and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.269" end="00:03:22.290" style="s2">serdica is not doing in our work and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">probably you&#39;re doing your work 200 is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.290" end="00:03:27.180" style="s2">that we try to teach people the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">of adult education that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.180" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">become adults again and no longer state</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:33.810" style="s2">children and this ironically means</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">countries the exact opposite of the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.810" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">it&#39;s been presented in the West this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:41.070" style="s2">not a short route to pleasure or you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:42.600" style="s2">know how you get access to something you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.070" end="00:03:44.070" style="s2">want so bad to be you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.600" end="00:03:46.200" style="s2">learn it you don&#39;t want to go through</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.070" end="00:03:47.850" style="s2">any trouble you want it now now now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.200" end="00:03:51.000" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve done a lot of Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.850" end="00:03:53.640" style="s2">practice I lived in a monastery for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.000" end="00:03:56.130" style="s2">year I started on I started off doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.640" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">Zen and then I then I got interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.130" end="00:04:02.340" style="s2">in broad ryona there was a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:04.410" style="s2">intense study intense meditation a dense</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.340" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">practices before you could even kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.410" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">approach Tantra right and I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:13.049" style="s2">sure right now that I&#39;ve approached</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">Tantra so so I the only way I can really</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.049" end="00:04:17.910" style="s2">you know talk about it is is let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.560" style="s2">with a bit of humility what I think I</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.910" end="00:04:21.539" style="s2">think this is the thing when we think</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.560" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">about ourselves as children adults it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.539" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">the same thing that&#39;s exactly when you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">say you never reached it or you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">sure you really well you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:30.569" style="s2">but you didn&#39;t stay there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:31.650" style="s2">exactly the point would understand what</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.569" end="00:04:34.110" style="s2">it means to be an adult</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.650" end="00:04:35.370" style="s2">we are always children in a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.110" end="00:04:37.830" style="s2">Christianity&#39;s right we&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.370" end="00:04:39.599" style="s2">expulsion of God right so we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.830" end="00:04:41.250" style="s2">the children of our ancestors they know</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.599" end="00:04:43.889" style="s2">better than we do that&#39;s what religion</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.250" end="00:04:45.960" style="s2">is but you have obviously reads Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.889" end="00:04:48.300" style="s2">precisely because you have this humility</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.960" end="00:04:50.009" style="s2">about it but you go back to Toronto you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.300" end="00:04:52.979" style="s2">can stay in Toronto and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.009" end="00:04:55.050" style="s2">return to be non Tundra it&#39;s not a steak</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.979" end="00:04:57.330" style="s2">you can stay in that&#39;s that&#39;s a complete</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.050" end="00:05:00.180" style="s2">misunderstanding of Tantra we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.330" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">go into tundra I talk about it like when</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.180" end="00:05:04.530" style="s2">I want to go into libidinal stayed I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:06.509" style="s2">probably get out of sexuality I push</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.530" end="00:05:08.190" style="s2">that energy into my head and then I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.509" end="00:05:10.500" style="s2">for example think and write and be</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.190" end="00:05:11.820" style="s2">creative for a few weeks or so and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:13.530" style="s2">I can go back into the others to stay</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.820" end="00:05:15.389" style="s2">and I think that is fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.530" end="00:05:17.070" style="s2">understanding Tantra so I I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.389" end="00:05:18.630" style="s2">you that you&#39;re not in the state of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.070" end="00:05:22.139" style="s2">tundra but you obviously under you you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.630" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">are tantric obviously our country well</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.139" end="00:05:27.449" style="s2">my my orientation towards the world is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:29.849" style="s2">is probably headed in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.449" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">that&#39;s how I would look at it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.849" end="00:05:35.159" style="s2">what being tantric means okay otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.729" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">you&#39;d have to die to be permanently 200</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.159" end="00:05:39.810" style="s2">oh you&#39;re alive this is what you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:41.729" style="s2">right so the humility goes with being</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.810" end="00:05:43.620" style="s2">tantric the humility be growing out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.729" end="00:05:44.909" style="s2">this also understand you allow yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.620" end="00:05:46.710" style="s2">to be a little child knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.909" end="00:05:50.009" style="s2">because the child inside of you will</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.710" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">always papa that you take on the role or</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.760" end="00:06:51.450" style="s2">it starts with agriculture I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.250" end="00:06:53.850" style="s2">will be the first thing you teach</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.450" end="00:06:55.130" style="s2">somebody when you finally have access to</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.130" end="00:06:58.920" style="s2">because you can store knowledge of</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.780" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">language and Mesopotamia was that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.820" end="00:07:11.760" style="s2">started to making Diaries or collections</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:13.110" style="s2">of grain so that we can learn that</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.760" end="00:07:16.140" style="s2">instead of eating the screen right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.110" end="00:07:18.750" style="s2">starve a bit plant the grain in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.140" end="00:07:20.940" style="s2">earth and within six months you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.750" end="00:07:22.620" style="s2">harvest there&#39;s gonna be way bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.940" end="00:07:25.020" style="s2">anything you could have picked up by</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.620" end="00:07:27.000" style="s2">walking around as a nomad for years and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.020" end="00:07:29.070" style="s2">suddenly instead of spending you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.000" end="00:07:30.600" style="s2">three hours in the morning to get a few</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.070" end="00:07:32.250" style="s2">grains you just have the grain right in</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.600" end="00:07:34.200" style="s2">front of you you can have a larger</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.250" end="00:07:36.660" style="s2">population or we can therefore create a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.200" end="00:07:38.910" style="s2">civilization so this insight is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.660" end="00:07:41.310" style="s2">basically you teach the kid that okay if</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.910" end="00:07:43.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t eat this now he&#39;s invested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.310" end="00:07:46.100" style="s2">the future you&#39;ll get ten times more</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.610" end="00:07:50.790" style="s2">that is essentially what Tantra is</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.100" end="00:07:55.050" style="s2">Tantra analogy to farming that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.790" end="00:07:57.300" style="s2">so so by employing the value now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.050" end="00:07:58.980" style="s2">all about the time axis it&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.300" end="00:08:01.530" style="s2">important thing in religion to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.980" end="00:08:03.270" style="s2">understand the value of time um if</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.530" end="00:08:04.590" style="s2">you&#39;re best now you&#39;re gonna get 10</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.270" end="00:08:07.140" style="s2">times more in the future</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.590" end="00:08:09.390" style="s2">meaning that contraception says that if</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.140" end="00:08:11.100" style="s2">you don&#39;t come now if you don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.390" end="00:08:13.110" style="s2">organ or something little death now if</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.100" end="00:08:17.220" style="s2">you keep that in you learn from</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.110" end="00:08:19.950" style="s2">sexuality that oh my mind will go WOW</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.220" end="00:08:22.530" style="s2">and I will be much more productive and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.950" end="00:08:24.270" style="s2">much more creative in my life and we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.530" end="00:08:26.550" style="s2">apply this to everything we learn this</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.270" end="00:08:28.620" style="s2">we just push the sexuality into our</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.550" end="00:08:31.200" style="s2">heads instead and we get libidinal</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.620" end="00:08:35.769" style="s2">energy which motivates us to do amazing</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.200" end="00:08:38.589" style="s2">things this is our Titanic</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.769" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">into the history of civilization it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.589" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">just it&#39;s it&#39;s the Indian whatever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:47.529" style="s2">it&#39;s a term used in the East for</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:49.300" style="s2">practices to teach people to be this of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.529" end="00:08:51.759" style="s2">course you teach the children to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.300" end="00:08:53.589" style="s2">adults but you then teach the adults</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.759" end="00:08:56.110" style="s2">among those adults who want to teach</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.589" end="00:08:58.660" style="s2">them how to be spiritual this exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.110" end="00:09:01.499" style="s2">the exercise of priests and monks nuns</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.660" end="00:09:05.739" style="s2">who then practice Tantra to perfection</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.499" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">mm-hmm go back to your story okay what</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.739" end="00:09:12.279" style="s2">do you exam for example uh yeah a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:14.889" style="s2">meditation in a rinse eye tradition I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.279" end="00:09:16.600" style="s2">mean a lot is very relative because some</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.889" end="00:09:20.049" style="s2">people spend you know a third of their</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.600" end="00:09:22.569" style="s2">life sitting in zazen but but uh you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.049" end="00:09:24.639" style="s2">know III spent my 20s doing Zen retreats</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.569" end="00:09:27.819" style="s2">and but I also I was also very</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.639" end="00:09:30.369" style="s2">interested in in the the writings of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.819" end="00:09:34.329" style="s2">chögyam Troopa and I and I read sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.369" end="00:09:36.610" style="s2">all of his stuff and loving got me very</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.329" end="00:09:39.309" style="s2">interested in I guess the the magical</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.610" end="00:09:42.490" style="s2">aspect of spiritual I would call it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.309" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">magic not in this sense of the search</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.490" end="00:09:51.009" style="s2">for exalted experiences but but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:54.999" style="s2">exultation of ordinary life so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.009" end="00:09:56.799" style="s2">yeah it is it is libido libido you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.999" end="00:09:59.980" style="s2">more little into your life into your</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.799" end="00:10:01.869" style="s2">current life you can only you can only</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.980" end="00:10:03.189" style="s2">understand certain things once you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.869" end="00:10:05.949" style="s2">and other things before that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.189" end="00:10:08.709" style="s2">exactly how education works is right you</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.949" end="00:10:10.629" style="s2">you you apply the education to where</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.709" end="00:10:13.749" style="s2">you&#39;re at right now and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.629" end="00:10:16.299" style="s2">learn an ass you learn you&#39;re ready to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.749" end="00:10:18.279" style="s2">take on more knowledge and if you jump</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.299" end="00:10:19.629" style="s2">the queue too quickly you will not</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.279" end="00:10:21.970" style="s2">understand a thing you completely</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.629" end="00:10:25.029" style="s2">misunderstand it and actually education</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.970" end="00:10:27.759" style="s2">become destructive mm-hmm I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.029" end="00:10:30.459" style="s2">the if you look at life that way it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.759" end="00:10:32.470" style="s2">you go from child to dog and you go from</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.459" end="00:10:35.379" style="s2">a dolls into the divine and actually the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.470" end="00:10:37.959" style="s2">divine is when you die right so so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.379" end="00:10:39.309" style="s2">this journey means that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.959" end="00:10:41.259" style="s2">knowledge along the way you will learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.309" end="00:10:42.819" style="s2">that you will not get it and of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.259" end="00:10:45.189" style="s2">this is what you discover when you turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.819" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2">50 or so you discovered that oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.189" end="00:10:49.690" style="s2">read this when I was 30 I didn&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:51.340" style="s2">now I finally can understand it so</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.690" end="00:10:53.830" style="s2">so this is essential I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.340" end="00:10:56.220" style="s2">technologies that you can only apply the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.830" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">knowledge to the level where you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.220" end="00:10:59.830" style="s2">otherwise you don&#39;t get it you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:01.780" style="s2">it and actually the misunderstandings</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.830" end="00:11:04.420" style="s2">can be very destructive incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.780" end="00:11:06.580" style="s2">destructive so you know ultimately I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.420" end="00:11:09.190" style="s2">would say that the biggest mistakes of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.580" end="00:11:12.070" style="s2">human history her always who allowed a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.190" end="00:11:13.480" style="s2">little boys and girls to play gods so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.070" end="00:11:16.030" style="s2">could say that tundra has great</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.480" end="00:11:17.320" style="s2">potential for what&#39;s called in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.030" end="00:11:19.210" style="s2">Buddhist tradition Rudra</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.320" end="00:11:22.950" style="s2">which means embodying the ego completely</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.210" end="00:11:25.810" style="s2">no becoming fully evil in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.950" end="00:11:27.790" style="s2">have you go beyond good and even I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.810" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">say you would understand how things</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.790" end="00:11:31.090" style="s2">actually work</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">this is exactly why I&#39;m so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.090" end="00:11:36.250" style="s2">dongjun and then because Dobson is</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:39.100" style="s2">saying we actually Buddhism to these</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.250" end="00:11:41.290" style="s2">these these sort of titles these sort of</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.180" end="00:11:50.410" style="s2">decided to you know punch them in and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.490" end="00:11:52.180" style="s2">call it Hinduism and Buddhism and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.410" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">allow the Chinese that Taoist and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.180" end="00:11:55.270" style="s2">Confucianism and suddenly they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:57.490" style="s2">these four titles and it could throw</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.270" end="00:12:00.520" style="s2">them on things when a seed option is dog</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.490" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">sure then is then Shawn in China Shawn</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.520" end="00:12:04.420" style="s2">you don&#39;t actually Buddhism to any of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:07.240" style="s2">them because they&#39;re actually mixes and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.420" end="00:12:09.490" style="s2">what I mean interests induction is</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.240" end="00:12:12.490" style="s2">because it is the mixture of the person</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.910" end="00:12:26.200" style="s2">mix the Buddhist tradition was very very</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.630" end="00:12:43.450" style="s2">India and Iran it&#39;s really hard to unify</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.260" end="00:12:46.060" style="s2">in Iran geographically because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.450" end="00:12:47.650" style="s2">got a huge mountain range in between</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.060" end="00:12:51.220" style="s2">called the Hindu Kush which makes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.650" end="00:12:53.050" style="s2">ops very small by a comparison and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.220" end="00:12:54.490" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why that rarely happened</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.050" end="00:12:57.340" style="s2">but it did have for couple hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.490" end="00:12:59.950" style="s2">and briefly saw Aston ISM and Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.340" end="00:13:02.410" style="s2">were both state religions of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.389" end="00:13:08.549" style="s2">in peace there&#39;s not a single recorded</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.209" end="00:13:09.779" style="s2">conflict between the two probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.549" end="00:13:12.149" style="s2">because they match each other perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.779" end="00:13:13.559" style="s2">so you would go into a motive well we</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.149" end="00:13:14.999" style="s2">can practice or a students in here we</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.559" end="00:13:16.259" style="s2">could practice Buddhism here because</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.259" end="00:13:20.129" style="s2">practical they&#39;re actually together</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.850" end="00:13:21.149" style="s2">tribal they&#39;re actually makes sense for</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.149" end="00:13:24.569" style="s2">and I&#39;ve never seen a conflict between</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.569" end="00:13:29.069" style="s2">Afghanistan but the Taliban&#39;s tried</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.480" end="00:13:31.529" style="s2">really hard to tear down the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.069" end="00:13:33.389" style="s2">statues mm-hmm that is simply because</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.529" end="00:13:36.089" style="s2">the original religion of Afghanistan</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.389" end="00:13:37.529" style="s2">long before Islam arrived was to mix in</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.529" end="00:13:41.809" style="s2">because Afghanistan obviously is the</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.809" end="00:13:45.239" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.649" end="00:13:47.069" style="s2">interesting about all things them</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.239" end="00:13:50.339" style="s2">repeated when you get to China because</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.069" end="00:13:52.049" style="s2">Taoism is the unification of the phallic</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.129" end="00:14:06.689" style="s2">the full picture but then also in China</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.709" end="00:14:09.540" style="s2">they developed the Shan practices they</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.689" end="00:14:11.669" style="s2">did not start in India then did not</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.540" end="00:14:13.290" style="s2">originate in Indian and went from India</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.669" end="00:14:15.149" style="s2">to China to Japan because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.290" end="00:14:18.689" style="s2">direct connection between India and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.149" end="00:14:21.209" style="s2">China besides a few really brave Tibetan</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.069" end="00:14:31.860" style="s2">again learn from Aristotle to always</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.499" end="00:14:34.610" style="s2">check both sides of the coin before you</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.860" end="00:14:37.019" style="s2">buy into any story the Buddha Dharma</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.209" end="00:14:42.419" style="s2">the paintings that was done about at</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.679" end="00:14:44.369" style="s2">harm I know engine looks like that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.419" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">got these boskie big I&#39;m always right</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.369" end="00:14:48.929" style="s2">bearded well he looks like an Iranian he</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:51.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like an India doesn&#39;t okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.929" end="00:14:53.429" style="s2">oh did I harm you if you go to India</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.119" end="00:14:56.759" style="s2">which you should you discovered it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.429" end="00:14:58.529" style="s2">a single day supported harm anyway you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.759" end="00:15:00.689" style="s2">know there wasn&#39;t a boy at Harmon</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.529" end="00:15:02.339" style="s2">endeavor so he obviously wasn&#39;t not only</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.689" end="00:15:05.579" style="s2">not Indian he was certainly not india</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.339" end="00:15:07.379" style="s2">prince so then you go to central asia</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.579" end="00:15:10.769" style="s2">and you discover the board enormous</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.470" end="00:15:46.490" style="s2">probably applied Buddhism to it or was</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.870" end="00:15:48.590" style="s2">applied later because to add some</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.490" end="00:15:50.270" style="s2">credibility to it the way you hide</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.590" end="00:15:52.580" style="s2">something the way you tell the story</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.270" end="00:15:54.110" style="s2">well this hasn&#39;t like a golden origin</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.580" end="00:15:56.510" style="s2">from somewhere and because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.110" end="00:15:59.060" style="s2">golden origin somewhere then because</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.510" end="00:16:01.700" style="s2">we&#39;re valuable I mean Moses never lived</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.060" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">in Egypt and the Hebrews never left</p>

<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:10.990" style="s2">nation of Israel more credible of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.600" end="00:16:13.670" style="s2">their origin was in Egypt because Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.990" end="00:16:15.980" style="s2">of the world so that&#39;s why you created</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.670" end="00:16:18.200" style="s2">that mythology then if you go to Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.980" end="00:16:21.050" style="s2">and check historical records you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.200" end="00:16:21.830" style="s2">see single trace of Moses anywhere in</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.150" end="00:16:31.130" style="s2">so boded Hamas is origin in sogdia and</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.830" end="00:16:58.670" style="s2">you walk into one of these beautiful zen</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.840" end="00:17:00.940" style="s2">rock gardens by the way I&#39;m terrible</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.670" end="00:17:03.830" style="s2">it&#39;s awesome - I do walking meditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.940" end="00:17:05.510" style="s2">Zen is that actually most meditations on</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.830" end="00:17:07.340" style="s2">walking not sitting and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.510" end="00:17:09.050" style="s2">Westerners shouldn&#39;t walk around and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.340" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">said so I do walking meditation when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.050" end="00:17:13.370" style="s2">practice that but when you look into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.360" end="00:17:15.770" style="s2">sand rock gardens of Japan you discover</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.370" end="00:17:17.750" style="s2">that almost identical to the sorest and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.770" end="00:17:22.460" style="s2">fire temples if you&#39;re finding Iran in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.750" end="00:17:24.860" style="s2">super job minimalism you got the rock</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.460" end="00:17:26.810" style="s2">garden you got a symmetric rock put</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.860" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">inside the garden and you focus on the s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.810" end="00:17:31.250" style="s2">symmetries because the spiritual isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:33.590" style="s2">symmetric saying with it with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.250" end="00:17:35.540" style="s2">Reston&#39;s in iran you put fire at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.590" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">center the fire is always alive because</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.540" end="00:17:39.920" style="s2">of live it adds an isometric element to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">the rest of the symmetry of the room</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.920" end="00:17:44.570" style="s2">everything is white you&#39;ve got the all</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:46.310" style="s2">touch bottom which is a sacred fire at</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.570" end="00:17:47.990" style="s2">the center of the room and you can sit</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.310" end="00:17:49.910" style="s2">there and meditate and meditate to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.990" end="00:17:52.670" style="s2">meditate for hours it&#39;s an environment</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.670" end="00:17:56.810" style="s2">so asterism and zen are essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.460" end="00:17:58.130" style="s2">same thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.810" end="00:18:00.130" style="s2">well interesting the Vajra honor</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.130" end="00:18:07.130" style="s2">tradition is much more let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.130" end="00:18:08.660" style="s2">colorful or explosively Baroque well</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.130" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">that comes from Hinduism as well so</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.660" end="00:18:11.660" style="s2">there you go right yeah that probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:14.600" style="s2">comes from Hinduism yeah yeah it comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.660" end="00:18:16.310" style="s2">from a distant ISM is metrical as is</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.279" end="00:20:20.929" style="s2">of warfare among the people who traded</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.619" end="00:20:22.580" style="s2">along the Silk Road and with the Silk</p>

<p begin="00:20:22.580" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">because of two external threats that</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.659" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">one country to the next that&#39;s a threat</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.609" end="00:20:45.139" style="s2">of intense international traveling today</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:47.989" style="s2">and also the Mongol invasions like an</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.989" end="00:20:53.029" style="s2">the system the Mongol invasion were</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.840" end="00:20:54.769" style="s2">nomads there were no minutes and how the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.029" end="00:20:57.080" style="s2">hell could they understand the culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.769" end="00:20:58.700" style="s2">of chained permanent settlements that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.080" end="00:20:59.389" style="s2">traded with each other it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.700" end="00:21:00.679" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.389" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">and because they were sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.679" end="00:21:04.970" style="s2">horseback they could just slaughter</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:07.820" style="s2">people without understanding what it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.970" end="00:21:09.769" style="s2">until finally the Chinese tamed the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.820" end="00:21:12.440" style="s2">Mongols turned him into their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.769" end="00:21:14.269" style="s2">Emperor&#39;s gave them China basically to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.440" end="00:21:17.869" style="s2">domesticate them so they could include</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.269" end="00:21:19.190" style="s2">them in civilization hmm the Mongol</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.899" end="00:21:36.889" style="s2">had over million citizens I mean along</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.299" end="00:21:38.840" style="s2">the Silk Road was so prospered that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.889" end="00:21:40.279" style="s2">six out of the seven biggest cities in</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.840" end="00:21:41.720" style="s2">the world in the thirteenth century were</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.279" end="00:21:44.029" style="s2">along the Silk Road including the two</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.720" end="00:21:47.239" style="s2">biggest which were the end of the Silk</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.029" end="00:21:48.830" style="s2">Road Xian and Cairo see onyx are not</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.239" end="00:21:49.249" style="s2">currently with a two biggest cities in</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.350" end="00:21:55.970" style="s2">set of the Middle East way bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.230" end="00:21:58.009" style="s2">anything you found in Europe right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.970" end="00:22:00.259" style="s2">these these were the ends of the Silk</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.009" end="00:22:03.049" style="s2">Road no longer Silk Road for example is</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.259" end="00:22:06.889" style="s2">say like Merv in current Turkmenistan</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.049" end="00:22:10.269" style="s2">that probably had a population about 1.2</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.889" end="00:22:13.220" style="s2">million people this is in the mid 1200</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.269" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">isn&#39;t it well Honda&#39;s what Europe was in</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.220" end="00:22:17.359" style="s2">the dark ages or whatever Merve had 1.2</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:19.359" style="s2">million people and we surrounded me</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.359" end="00:22:22.429" style="s2">three or four days the Mongols slaughter</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.359" end="00:22:25.970" style="s2">everybody in the city in less than a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.429" end="00:22:27.139" style="s2">days right mm-hmm that is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.970" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">we need to learn from history is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.139" end="00:22:32.330" style="s2">when did when the boys to play gods the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:34.399" style="s2">Mongols not knowing there were boys who</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.330" end="00:22:37.669" style="s2">played gods they were so high on their</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.399" end="00:22:39.559" style="s2">power on the on the weaponry on sitting</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.669" end="00:22:40.940" style="s2">on these horse backs being able to score</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.559" end="00:22:43.940" style="s2">two that gave me people so quickly</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.940" end="00:22:46.609" style="s2">basically interpreting the citizens of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.940" end="00:22:47.629" style="s2">Mervis idiots from mostly women and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.609" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">children to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.629" end="00:22:50.929" style="s2">they just started them they just started</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:52.999" style="s2">they found a racing to do not just did</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.929" end="00:22:56.809" style="s2">not and this is what we have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.999" end="00:22:58.580" style="s2">from history so back to todrick yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.809" end="00:23:01.190" style="s2">have something can I just say something</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.580" end="00:23:03.409" style="s2">something you you wrote you said Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.190" end="00:23:07.399" style="s2">as the ultimate exercise in moving from</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.409" end="00:23:11.240" style="s2">child to adults yes that&#39;s the way she</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.399" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">which is the exact opposite of taking a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.240" end="00:23:15.289" style="s2">course and how to improve your sex life</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.460" end="00:23:18.649" style="s2">to get more out of life</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.289" end="00:23:20.990" style="s2">this is not about you exploiting your</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.649" end="00:23:23.359" style="s2">resources it&#39;s not about you exploiting</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.990" end="00:23:25.730" style="s2">other people this is a very very</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.359" end="00:23:28.909" style="s2">childish understanding of what sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.730" end="00:23:31.999" style="s2">should be so adult sexuality is very</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.909" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">much about serving the other yea and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.999" end="00:23:36.230" style="s2">serving the other by not coming for</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:38.149" style="s2">example it&#39;s just it&#39;s just the not</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.230" end="00:23:40.340" style="s2">coming part it&#39;s actually a minor but</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.149" end="00:23:42.379" style="s2">it&#39;s despair to remind us that if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.340" end="00:23:44.779" style="s2">don&#39;t behave like children but actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.379" end="00:23:47.539" style="s2">behave as adults the rewards we get are</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.779" end="00:23:51.139" style="s2">so rich and so beautiful that is really</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.539" end="00:23:54.859" style="s2">worth learning that exercise mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.139" end="00:23:58.070" style="s2">so why you say it&#39;s minor it is minor</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.859" end="00:23:59.749" style="s2">but it&#39;s very off we have to talk to us</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.070" end="00:24:01.490" style="s2">our people and describe these things you</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.749" end="00:24:03.950" style="s2">just have to go to their everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.490" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">you have to connect somewhere and since</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.950" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">they understand that coming too quickly</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:10.730" style="s2">for example or you know especially for</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:12.380" style="s2">men men discover that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.730" end="00:24:14.870" style="s2">their sex life is gonna be about three</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.380" end="00:24:17.150" style="s2">minutes episodes yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.870" end="00:24:18.650" style="s2">gratification women at least understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.150" end="00:24:21.110" style="s2">cuz it takes them a while to get started</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.650" end="00:24:24.200" style="s2">and once they get started they want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.110" end="00:24:26.390" style="s2">stay on for quite a while so the guys</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.200" end="00:24:28.010" style="s2">discover that women leave me they get</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.500" end="00:32:40.580" style="s2">they don&#39;t take care of themselves they</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.570" end="00:32:42.530" style="s2">eat the wrong things and they just try</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.580" end="00:32:45.290" style="s2">to forget there&#39;s anything beneath here</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.530" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">beneath the mat right so you see that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.290" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">you see that in their behavior and just</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:51.770" style="s2">okay we&#39;re gonna put you through some</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:53.630" style="s2">easy exercise you&#39;re gonna learn to care</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.630" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">right things or actually gonna teach</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.730" end="00:33:00.050" style="s2">your actions be more sexual than you</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:01.940" style="s2">been so he can take on the entire body</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.050" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">because as a human being your body your</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.940" end="00:33:06.680" style="s2">mind and and of course to live a full</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:08.900" style="s2">life you&#39;re gonna have a full-on body in</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.680" end="00:33:15.800" style="s2">a full-on mind and that is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.900" end="00:33:20.600" style="s2">you learn in Tantra at least in real</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.800" end="00:33:22.280" style="s2">Tantra so I mean perhaps it might be</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.600" end="00:33:24.110" style="s2">useful to talk about what is not real</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.280" end="00:33:26.300" style="s2">Tantra because this seems to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.110" end="00:33:28.760" style="s2">the Osho had this thing called neo</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.300" end="00:33:30.770" style="s2">Tantra and you thought that Western</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.760" end="00:33:34.370" style="s2">people were very very repressed right</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.770" end="00:33:36.800" style="s2">and we just perhaps true and that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.370" end="00:33:40.160" style="s2">needed all of these sexual and somatic</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.800" end="00:33:41.990" style="s2">techniques and and he called that neo</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.160" end="00:33:48.620" style="s2">Tantra because he said it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.990" end="00:33:50.630" style="s2">real Tantra so well it&#39;s I I like also</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.620" end="00:33:52.820" style="s2">he&#39;s very useful we can&#39;t stop just</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.630" end="00:33:54.340" style="s2">reading or throw and then discover the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.820" end="00:33:56.870" style="s2">whole thing because he as many</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.340" end="00:33:59.270" style="s2">philosophers do there</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.870" end="00:34:01.630" style="s2">commentary on the time within which they</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.270" end="00:34:04.550" style="s2">live and this of course for the West</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.630" end="00:34:06.980" style="s2">experimental wildly in the 1960s with</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.550" end="00:34:08.990" style="s2">sexual liberation and Oscar came onto</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.980" end="00:34:11.000" style="s2">the scene he was a very clever guy in</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.990" end="00:34:12.889" style="s2">ending guy who figured out where</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.000" end="00:34:16.490" style="s2">American Europe were heading and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.889" end="00:34:18.169" style="s2">could just tap into that but obviously</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.490" end="00:34:21.550" style="s2">the problem with the entire Austral</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.169" end="00:34:24.710" style="s2">called was that it was a very infantile</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.550" end="00:34:26.899" style="s2">very name that&#39;s exactly right for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.710" end="00:34:32.270" style="s2">part I was with the problem that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.899" end="00:34:33.860" style="s2">what was the problem is it just promised</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.270" end="00:34:37.310" style="s2">all the kids you can get everything you</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.860" end="00:34:40.940" style="s2">want essentially also became the great</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.310" end="00:34:42.950" style="s2">tit again what it didn&#39;t realize or at</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.940" end="00:34:45.169" style="s2">least what it did is that he basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.950" end="00:34:48.290" style="s2">promised you could get all this sexual</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.169" end="00:34:51.080" style="s2">fulfillment and the spiritual awakened</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.290" end="00:34:53.240" style="s2">like if you were you know the adult of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.080" end="00:34:56.120" style="s2">all the adults and he promised it for</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.240" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">instant gratification yeah which is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.120" end="00:34:59.360" style="s2">the way it works</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:02.780" style="s2">that&#39;s exacta boss who did not take on</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.360" end="00:35:04.820" style="s2">in India even when also moved and left</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.780" end="00:35:07.460" style="s2">America and he moved eventually to to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.820" end="00:35:09.800" style="s2">India and set up shop there and pruning</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.460" end="00:35:11.720" style="s2">they still go through there that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.800" end="00:35:13.960" style="s2">Westerners all go there and they buy</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.720" end="00:35:16.280" style="s2">into a very touristy version of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.960" end="00:35:18.260" style="s2">spiritual India which really the Indians</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.280" end="00:35:20.570" style="s2">don&#39;t care too much about daddy so</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.260" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">should speak volumes about ways look at</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.570" end="00:35:24.860" style="s2">it now I&#39;ve got lots of friends who</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:26.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know so enormously I&#39;m hi raffia</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.860" end="00:35:28.520" style="s2">Morgan in the UK is one of my dearest</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.600" end="00:35:30.290" style="s2">friends he&#39;s he&#39;s a great spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.520" end="00:35:31.850" style="s2">teacher but he&#39;s also criminal also</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.290" end="00:35:34.130" style="s2">obviously on the other side and learn</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.850" end="00:35:37.820" style="s2">more and and understands there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.130" end="00:35:40.460" style="s2">it but our show was so popular with</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.820" end="00:35:42.290" style="s2">young Westerners especially in America</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.460" end="00:35:45.130" style="s2">because essentially promised them</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.290" end="00:35:48.650" style="s2">spiritual enlightenment and sexual</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.130" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">satisfaction yeah instantly yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.650" end="00:35:53.750" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s where that community</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:56.960" style="s2">became so dark I guess right yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.750" end="00:35:59.540" style="s2">and also was in the 8th he pulled in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.960" end="00:36:02.360" style="s2">Psychopaths and the sociopaths in jizan</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.540" end="00:36:05.270" style="s2">cult and that&#39;s exactly why I fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.360" end="00:36:07.100" style="s2">I mean if you check the story of also</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.270" end="00:36:09.080" style="s2">for example in Oregon where they set up</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.100" end="00:36:10.510" style="s2">their community they did not at all</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.080" end="00:36:12.820" style="s2">communicate with us around</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.510" end="00:36:15.340" style="s2">world and become friends with the local</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.820" end="00:36:17.230" style="s2">community there were enemies it was more</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.340" end="00:36:20.440" style="s2">of a civil war in Oregon while they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.230" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">still yeah that speaks volumes to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.440" end="00:36:25.500" style="s2">about the infertility of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">organization so an infant I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.500" end="00:36:30.460" style="s2">organizations like say the German Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:32.050" style="s2">Party yeah you&#39;re gonna have the boys</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.460" end="00:36:32.620" style="s2">and girls to think that God&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.050" end="00:36:34.930" style="s2">the show</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.620" end="00:36:36.430" style="s2">oh yeah that&#39;s exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.930" end="00:36:37.720" style="s2">gosh oh thank God they didn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.430" end="00:36:41.370" style="s2">atomic bomb because they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.720" end="00:36:43.890" style="s2">Brona of America time when that happened</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.370" end="00:36:46.390" style="s2">watch out for the sects and cults</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.890" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">because the sects and cults Louis</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.390" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">promise you you can get spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">enlightened and because you get</p>

<p begin="00:36:53.590" end="00:36:58.360" style="s2">instantly when in reality spirit</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.720" end="00:37:00.460" style="s2">enlightenment is removing yourself from</p>
