<p begin="00:00:38.710" end="00:00:43.000" style="s2">opportunity to go away and work on an</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.970" end="00:00:53.980" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s so many similarities</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.200" end="00:00:55.750" style="s2">between Douglas and Jamie&#39;s work and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.980" end="00:00:58.270" style="s2">say that they&#39;re two of the the most</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.170" end="00:01:27.729" style="s2">nine films I think with Jamie now</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.939" end="00:01:30.249" style="s2">ranging from the pitfalls of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.729" end="00:01:33.759" style="s2">culture to sort of big transformative</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.759" end="00:01:37.779" style="s2">really appreciate how he brings together</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.319" end="00:01:40.179" style="s2">this sort of really intellectual depth</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.779" end="00:01:43.929" style="s2">with an embodied transformational part</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.179" end="00:01:47.619" style="s2">with a real sense of integrity and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.929" end="00:01:51.130" style="s2">Jamie the topic here is building team</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.619" end="00:01:53.289" style="s2">human and it&#39;s one thing to build team</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.130" end="00:01:54.969" style="s2">human when we&#39;ve got a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.289" end="00:01:57.700" style="s2">working for us it&#39;s quite another thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.969" end="00:02:00.459" style="s2">now to be looking to build team human or</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.700" end="00:02:02.469" style="s2">as you&#39;ve talked about homegrown humans</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.459" end="00:02:03.999" style="s2">when it seems that everything is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.469" end="00:02:06.310" style="s2">falling apart at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.999" end="00:02:11.470" style="s2">you like to frame how you how you see</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.310" end="00:02:12.939" style="s2">this hello everybody yeah I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.470" end="00:02:14.530" style="s2">and I think what I&#39;d love to do is</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.939" end="00:02:17.260" style="s2">anticipate in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.530" end="00:02:19.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll all get to have together after</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.260" end="00:02:20.680" style="s2">Doug has also jumped in as we get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.000" end="00:02:22.990" style="s2">kind of frame this I think the highest</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.680" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">level question that we&#39;ve kicked around</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.990" end="00:02:29.410" style="s2">together is like how do we get to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:31.690" style="s2">place of heightened coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.410" end="00:02:34.300" style="s2">coordination how do how are we at our</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.690" end="00:02:37.330" style="s2">best when everything around us appears</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.300" end="00:02:39.070" style="s2">to be at its worst so that&#39;s the inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.330" end="00:02:40.590" style="s2">for our for our time together this</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.070" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">afternoon or evening or wherever we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.590" end="00:02:47.020" style="s2">but to kick it off I wanted to actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:48.580" style="s2">read an excerpt from the introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.020" end="00:02:50.290" style="s2">the sequel this tingling fire which I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.580" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">writing right now is called recapture</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.290" end="00:02:56.530" style="s2">the rapture and the reason is because</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:58.630" style="s2">Doug has already had a direct influence</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.530" end="00:03:01.420" style="s2">on this I remember I&#39;ve been following</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.630" end="00:03:03.310" style="s2">Doug&#39;s work for probably 15 years or</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.420" end="00:03:05.470" style="s2">more and if anybody&#39;s not already</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.310" end="00:03:09.400" style="s2">familiar with his stuff I would put him</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.470" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">on the short list of considered thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.400" end="00:03:13.930" style="s2">that are both participants in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:15.430" style="s2">emerging edge of culture and also have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.930" end="00:03:17.590" style="s2">rigorous scholarly and academic</p>

<p begin="00:03:17.590" end="00:03:23.410" style="s2">and framing of things is exquisite and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.950" end="00:03:25.480" style="s2">always the bonus following Doug and also</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.480" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">on or was about to but either way like I</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.810" end="00:10:48.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve been using for that which is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:49.940" style="s2">rapture ideologies again whether its</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.740" end="00:11:18.110" style="s2">never mind the collateral damage now the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:19.640" style="s2">problem with rapture ideologies is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.110" end="00:11:22.040" style="s2">as you can imagine is they&#39;re all one</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.040" end="00:11:27.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the morally virtuous or the saved</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.090" end="00:11:41.090" style="s2">the question here is how as the world is</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.290" end="00:11:57.830" style="s2">narrative around the rapture and how do</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.380" end="00:12:00.110" style="s2">we insist on all of us or none of us</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.830" end="00:12:01.880" style="s2">solutions because no matter how tempting</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.110" end="00:12:03.800" style="s2">a rapture ideology may be and it could</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.310" end="00:12:44.570" style="s2">rapture but the next is the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.490" end="00:12:48.680" style="s2">right and I think I already heard this</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.250" end="00:12:57.890" style="s2">revealing or the unveiling so while we</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.850" end="00:12:59.900" style="s2">want to reclaim the rapture and say not</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.890" end="00:13:02.270" style="s2">so far as one percenters okay those are</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.470" end="00:15:18.170" style="s2">the whole notion of progress I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.530" end="00:15:19.590" style="s2">some ways it might be it might be Jewish</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.620" end="00:15:32.430" style="s2">tradition was to really take a circular</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.240" end="00:15:35.220" style="s2">civilization and make it linear you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.430" end="00:15:37.800" style="s2">with the invention of text we had the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.220" end="00:15:40.620" style="s2">ability to write history and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.800" end="00:15:43.710" style="s2">to write contracts into the future and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.620" end="00:15:45.510" style="s2">it was a beautiful thing and we decided</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.710" end="00:15:46.950" style="s2">once we could write things down the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.510" end="00:15:49.560" style="s2">first thing we did was we wrote down the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.950" end="00:15:52.680" style="s2">law we wrote down ethics we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.560" end="00:15:54.870" style="s2">would use writing to make this year</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.680" end="00:15:58.110" style="s2">better than last year and next year</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.870" end="00:16:00.300" style="s2">better than this year and we move from a</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.950" end="00:16:20.550" style="s2">all-powerful and the reason why the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.300" end="00:16:22.050" style="s2">world isn&#39;t perfect yet is because</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.550" end="00:16:24.960" style="s2">there&#39;s this thing called linear time</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.050" end="00:16:27.240" style="s2">and once the story unfolds we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.960" end="00:16:29.510" style="s2">that we&#39;ll get to that perfect moment so</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.240" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">let&#39;s all keep working eyes on the prize</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.450" end="00:22:55.140" style="s2">yeah so for me to to unpack that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.960" end="00:22:56.610" style="s2">question and by the way I share it I</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.140" end="00:22:58.650" style="s2">mean this morning I woke up with a heavy</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.610" end="00:23:00.030" style="s2">heart and I&#39;m like man what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.650" end="00:23:02.850" style="s2">fucking point you know they want on</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.030" end="00:23:06.030" style="s2">earth can we possibly say that can begin</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.850" end="00:23:08.910" style="s2">to wrap our heads around any of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.030" end="00:23:11.820" style="s2">stark raving dumpster fire of other</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.820" end="00:23:18.570" style="s2">clearly insufficient so just to to fully</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.170" end="00:23:21.480" style="s2">emphasize that whole I mean it&#39;s a total</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.570" end="00:23:24.120" style="s2">hackneyed cliche of the think globally</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.480" end="00:23:26.460" style="s2">act locally but the flip side of it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.120" end="00:23:31.710" style="s2">is it&#39;s actually highly pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.460" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">because if we lose basic communal basic</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.710" end="00:23:37.410" style="s2">food security physical security you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:38.940" style="s2">connectivity with our neighbors all</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.410" end="00:23:40.800" style="s2">these kinds of things we just go down</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.940" end="00:23:44.520" style="s2">through Maslow&#39;s you know floorboards</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.800" end="00:23:46.230" style="s2">and the most aspirational goals for</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.520" end="00:23:48.780" style="s2">collective coherence or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.230" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">want to call it simply it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.780" end="00:23:55.850" style="s2">elective option we don&#39;t get to play and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:59.250" style="s2">so the idea of sort of dusting off</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.850" end="00:24:01.640" style="s2">communal community and communal support</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.250" end="00:24:04.350" style="s2">and resiliency and self responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.640" end="00:24:06.330" style="s2">does feel an essential part because like</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.350" end="00:24:07.830" style="s2">we can&#39;t control it all we can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.330" end="00:24:09.300" style="s2">sure of governance and politics and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.830" end="00:24:10.710" style="s2">macroeconomics and multinational</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.300" end="00:24:11.280" style="s2">corporations to content all that on it</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.710" end="00:24:13.560" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.280" end="00:24:16.440" style="s2">but unless we look after ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.560" end="00:24:18.780" style="s2">get sorted there first at the personal</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.440" end="00:24:20.220" style="s2">at the familial and at the community</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.780" end="00:24:22.500" style="s2">level then we don&#39;t stand a chance of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.220" end="00:24:24.750" style="s2">playing any of the other games so I did</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.500" end="00:24:26.160" style="s2">see somebody in there saying as Doug you</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.750" end="00:24:28.850" style="s2">were commenting of like oh this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.160" end="00:24:31.140" style="s2">like jordan Peterson&#39;s clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.850" end="00:24:33.480" style="s2">but just with it you know a more liberal</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.140" end="00:24:36.150" style="s2">bent and and I would actually say sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.480" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">of kind of but it&#39;s not about personal</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.150" end="00:24:39.630" style="s2">morality in this case it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:42.450" style="s2">connectivity viability and antifragility</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.630" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">and those things I was just saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.450" end="00:24:47.250" style="s2">absolutely let&#39;s get on that because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:49.020" style="s2">are atomized fractured rash like hiker</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.250" end="00:24:51.030" style="s2">individualist consumers zoo monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.020" end="00:24:53.310" style="s2">right now and we want to break out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.030" end="00:24:57.140" style="s2">that and get back to like homegrown</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.310" end="00:25:00.510" style="s2">human team human requires responsible</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.140" end="00:25:02.430" style="s2">self-reliant folks to make it up right I</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.510" end="00:25:05.160" style="s2">mean if things can grow by distributing</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.430" end="00:25:06.930" style="s2">outward and laterally rather than coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.160" end="00:25:08.700" style="s2">up with a great new top-down solution</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.930" end="00:25:10.110" style="s2">you know where what the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.700" end="00:25:12.450" style="s2">always gets me most nervous when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.110" end="00:25:14.310" style="s2">with a group of great activists is when</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.450" end="00:25:17.070" style="s2">they&#39;re saying okay how do we get people</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.310" end="00:25:19.110" style="s2">to anything it&#39;s like once you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.070" end="00:25:20.580" style="s2">to get people to do something then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.110" end="00:25:24.210" style="s2">back you know figuring out how to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.580" end="00:25:26.910" style="s2">propaganda or or social control of one</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.210" end="00:25:29.160" style="s2">sort or another and second how dare I be</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.910" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">the one who wants to get someone else to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.160" end="00:25:33.660" style="s2">do something else it&#39;s what I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:35.940" style="s2">at now is whether or not sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.660" end="00:25:38.940" style="s2">rapture that you&#39;re describing or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.940" end="00:25:42.120" style="s2">the the you know the apocalypse without</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.940" end="00:25:46.290" style="s2">the Armageddon whether that can be a a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.120" end="00:25:49.320" style="s2">gentle unfolding of what is here rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.290" end="00:25:52.490" style="s2">than reaching towards you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.320" end="00:25:54.600" style="s2">reach or strive towards apocalypse we</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.490" end="00:25:56.490" style="s2">you know when you think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.600" end="00:25:58.860" style="s2">the Buddha or anybody who reaches a some</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.490" end="00:26:01.380" style="s2">kind of awakening it&#39;s like oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.860" end="00:26:05.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not ah you know it&#39;s really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.380" end="00:26:07.980" style="s2">not the this this very Western quest for</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.250" end="00:26:10.980" style="s2">if we could only get there and the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.980" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">thing I&#39;m wondering is as our job</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.980" end="00:26:19.860" style="s2">changed from I mean this is a very silly</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:21.720" style="s2">way of thinking about it but we go just</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.860" end="00:26:24.090" style="s2">to go maybe but as our job changed from</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.720" end="00:26:25.320" style="s2">like saving the world to doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.090" end="00:26:27.570" style="s2">palliative care</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.320" end="00:26:30.930" style="s2">and what would the difference look like</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.570" end="00:26:34.200" style="s2">you know pal you know it for to help</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.930" end="00:26:37.170" style="s2">everybody contend with the probable end</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.200" end="00:26:39.720" style="s2">of our civilization is we go through a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.170" end="00:26:42.330" style="s2">mourning period and kind of and a slow</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.720" end="00:26:43.620" style="s2">how can we be kind kindest about it how</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.330" end="00:26:45.510" style="s2">can we have the least amount of pain</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.620" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">going into the destruction of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.510" end="00:26:49.590" style="s2">civilization and hopefully its</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:52.620" style="s2">replacement with something else or are</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.590" end="00:26:54.210" style="s2">we trying to keep this thing is it about</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.620" end="00:26:55.560" style="s2">keeping this thing going and then what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.210" end="00:26:58.350" style="s2">the difference between what those even</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.560" end="00:27:00.810" style="s2">what those even look like you know so</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.350" end="00:27:02.820" style="s2">it&#39;s am almost wondering like is giving</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.810" end="00:27:06.270" style="s2">up really such a problem if giving up</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.820" end="00:27:09.450" style="s2">just means okay you know we&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.270" end="00:27:10.710" style="s2">die but let&#39;s be as nice to each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.450" end="00:27:13.920" style="s2">let&#39;s make it as painless as possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.710" end="00:27:16.200" style="s2">let&#39;s you know help people experience as</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.920" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">much meaning and connection and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.200" end="00:27:22.770" style="s2">and then maybe we&#39;ll surprise ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.730" end="00:27:23.850" style="s2">and not Act not die after all yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.770" end="00:27:26.400" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of you know you&#39;re nudging</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.850" end="00:27:29.100" style="s2">into like gem Bendele territory and</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.400" end="00:27:31.140" style="s2">right at everything from deep adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.100" end="00:27:35.610" style="s2">to dark mountain to all this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.980" end="00:36:12.810" style="s2">like Francis Bacon that it was so much</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.810" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">was so separate from women and people of</p>

<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:25.619" style="s2">know that that it was incapable you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.490" end="00:36:27.569" style="s2">that it just moved you to the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.619" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">stuff you&#39;re talking about it moved to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.569" end="00:36:34.349" style="s2">Hegel and and Marx and Heidegger and all</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:36.780" style="s2">that stuff it was so it was so it became</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.349" end="00:36:39.810" style="s2">so idealized and disconnected from just</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.780" end="00:36:41.970" style="s2">what what real experience is you know it</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.810" end="00:36:43.380" style="s2">feels I mean not to say that the people</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.760" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">that makes people happy as opposed to</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.630" end="00:37:13.710" style="s2">were criticizing before reminded me of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.700" end="00:37:15.990" style="s2">when I used to speak with Terence</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.710" end="00:37:17.550" style="s2">Mckenna and I would get really mad at</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.990" end="00:37:19.859" style="s2">him because I would say look you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.550" end="00:37:22.349" style="s2">acting like only people who have had the</p>

<p begin="00:37:26.460" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">and have that so you know how to and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.260" end="00:37:31.230" style="s2">like no it&#39;s not going to work George</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.230" end="00:37:35.490" style="s2">like all-or-none they were one one</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.540" end="00:37:37.170" style="s2">organism and he&#39;s like I&#39;m sorry Douglas</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.490" end="00:37:41.580" style="s2">but it&#39;s just not gonna work that way</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.170" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">you know you know and and so we our side</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.580" end="00:37:45.540" style="s2">such as such as we are that the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:47.670" style="s2">brilliant well-meaning counterculture</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.540" end="00:37:50.150" style="s2">can become just as guilty like you say</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.150" end="00:37:56.070" style="s2">thinking I guess where I&#39;m stuck is uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.880" end="00:38:01.910" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s a fine place to be but</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.070" end="00:38:05.190" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like any how do how do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.910" end="00:38:07.320" style="s2">how do you sit with this you know how</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.190" end="00:38:10.310" style="s2">it&#39;s really it doesn&#39;t the hard moment</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.310" end="00:38:16.740" style="s2">should we be in the streets should we be</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.170" end="00:38:34.260" style="s2">is actually this this all builds</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.490" end="00:38:36.630" style="s2">beautifully right because that notion if</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.260" end="00:38:38.070" style="s2">we&#39;re and again this is a hypothesis</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.859" end="00:38:55.260" style="s2">structurally part of the problem so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.710" end="00:38:57.900" style="s2">actually want to commit to some version</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.260" end="00:39:00.570" style="s2">of agonistic liberalism and the the</p>

<p begin="00:42:31.890" end="00:42:37.049" style="s2">work to be done that these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.410" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">abstracted solutions are I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.049" end="00:42:40.289" style="s2">why it&#39;s tricky for us as two</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.289" end="00:42:44.940" style="s2">with published books and all to say oh</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.940" end="00:42:47.640" style="s2">crowds with your solution I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.950" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">a part of why I&#39;ve been feeling</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.640" end="00:42:51.720" style="s2">hypocritical lately as whatever this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:53.970" style="s2">public intellectual it&#39;s part of why I</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.720" end="00:42:56.490" style="s2">want to just like be a teacher and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.970" end="00:42:59.130" style="s2">and help people locally it&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.490" end="00:43:00.839" style="s2">I&#39;m done but it&#39;s like it&#39;s there there</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.130" end="00:43:02.819" style="s2">there&#39;s enough other ideas and other</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.839" end="00:43:06.299" style="s2">people so I just want to stay somehow</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.819" end="00:43:09.539" style="s2">stay in service rather than in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.299" end="00:43:13.230" style="s2">whatever the the opposite is yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.539" end="00:43:18.359" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna throw in the first answer</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.230" end="00:43:20.339" style="s2">from the the unmanned or and but if you</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.069" end="00:43:25.650" style="s2">Douglas I think everyone would</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.299" end="00:43:28.890" style="s2">appreciate that that went down really</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.099" end="00:43:48.450" style="s2">responded to the question that was posed</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.690" end="00:43:51.150" style="s2">by bringing up death and our</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.450" end="00:43:53.910" style="s2">relationship with death and really our</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.150" end="00:43:56.519" style="s2">relationship with mortality what are</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.910" end="00:43:59.239" style="s2">resource constraints if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.519" end="00:44:02.299" style="s2">playing the immortality game anymore I</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.239" end="00:44:10.529" style="s2">mean if we don&#39;t want to live forever</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.299" end="00:44:11.980" style="s2">yeah I think the question is how how how</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.529" end="00:44:16.300" style="s2">much are those</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.980" end="00:44:18.970" style="s2">game theoretic competitive aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.300" end="00:44:21.130" style="s2">society that we&#39;re seeing part of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.970" end="00:44:26.380" style="s2">conscious and unconscious drive for</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.130" end="00:44:29.350" style="s2">immortality and yeah does how important</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.380" end="00:44:33.840" style="s2">is a relationship with death and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.350" end="00:44:38.470" style="s2">mortality to be able to widen and not be</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.840" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">seeking that endgame yeah I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.470" end="00:44:43.390" style="s2">absolutely non-negotiable essential so</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:47.070" style="s2">like I don&#39;t think we actually get to</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.180" end="00:46:56.360" style="s2">orientation to how we live yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.790" end="00:46:58.310" style="s2">got I got to deal with death a lot just</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.360" end="00:46:59.930" style="s2">from people I know you know dying and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.310" end="00:47:02.300" style="s2">being with them and thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.930" end="00:47:05.180" style="s2">and then um you know Timothy Leary tried</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.300" end="00:47:07.160" style="s2">to do a kind of a design for dying</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.180" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">around around his death and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.160" end="00:47:12.080" style="s2">interestingly he kind of abandoned that</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:13.670" style="s2">trip as he got close to the end and it</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.080" end="00:47:15.170" style="s2">got really serious he was like oh fuck</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.670" end="00:47:16.730" style="s2">this I just gonna I got a really deal</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.170" end="00:47:19.130" style="s2">with dying here it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.730" end="00:47:20.840" style="s2">interesting to see you know the show is</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.130" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">over I can&#39;t do death as a show I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.840" end="00:47:24.530" style="s2">actually I&#39;m not gonna freeze my brain</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">and I&#39;m not doing this I&#39;m gonna deal</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.530" end="00:47:29.480" style="s2">with dying and I feel okay about dying</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:30.770" style="s2">but then I mean what I&#39;ve been concerned</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.480" end="00:47:33.590" style="s2">about is the the death of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.770" end="00:47:36.950" style="s2">civilization or the death of our species</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.590" end="00:47:38.390" style="s2">or the death of life itself and trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.950" end="00:47:41.600" style="s2">to apply the same understandings of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.390" end="00:47:44.150" style="s2">Resurrection to to that or return or the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.600" end="00:47:47.390" style="s2">the eternal return to civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.150" end="00:47:49.250" style="s2">then I interviewed James Lovelock a few</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.390" end="00:47:53.090" style="s2">months ago who&#39;s a hundred years old the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.250" end="00:47:55.580" style="s2">Gaia hypothesis guy and he said well</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.090" end="00:47:56.990" style="s2">because the Sun is so much hotter now</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.580" end="00:48:01.370" style="s2">than it was when life started on earth</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.990" end="00:48:03.410" style="s2">back when if we reach the tipping point</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.370" end="00:48:05.900" style="s2">and it got too hot for life on Earth and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.410" end="00:48:08.930" style="s2">life on Earth died we no longer have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.900" end="00:48:11.540" style="s2">conditions for life to start again that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.930" end="00:48:13.130" style="s2">that that he believes that the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.540" end="00:48:15.620" style="s2">maintenance of the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.130" end="00:48:18.830" style="s2">temperature for biology as we know it to</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.620" end="00:48:22.100" style="s2">exist on this planet is is very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.830" end="00:48:24.230" style="s2">delicate system and it&#39;s it&#39;s in it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.100" end="00:48:27.770" style="s2">danger so then I started to think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.230" end="00:48:30.440" style="s2">well what if everything dies right what</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.770" end="00:48:31.670" style="s2">if life on Earth dies and what if it</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.440" end="00:48:33.950" style="s2">turns out that this was the only life in</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.670" end="00:48:35.090" style="s2">the universe and it turns out that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.950" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">only life in the universe was the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.090" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">universe&#39;s only bit of self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:46.049" style="s2">so what if it&#39;s really dying and do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:48.359" style="s2">how do we how do we you know how does</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.049" end="00:48:50.460" style="s2">one come to terms with that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.359" end="00:48:52.770" style="s2">just so for me it&#39;s again it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.460" end="00:48:55.319" style="s2">hopelessly linear it&#39;s so different from</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.770" end="00:48:58.650" style="s2">the sustainable circular reincarnation</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.319" end="00:49:01.319" style="s2">you know imitation of the Gods sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.650" end="00:49:03.059" style="s2">myth of eternal return that that that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.319" end="00:49:06.270" style="s2">indigenous people hadn&#39;t that I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.059" end="00:49:08.420" style="s2">to to to you know kind of adopt adopt</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.270" end="00:49:12.059" style="s2">myself as a little Western linear person</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.420" end="00:49:14.130" style="s2">but I&#39;m trying I feel like even if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.059" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">even if we are gonna go on and it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.130" end="00:49:19.140" style="s2">gonna be okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:21.450" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to even as a society as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.140" end="00:49:23.819" style="s2">civilization we&#39;ve got to contend we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.450" end="00:49:27.869" style="s2">got to accept that possibility as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.819" end="00:49:30.630" style="s2">except that the that you know yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.869" end="00:49:33.030" style="s2">playing the infinite game but infinity</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.630" end="00:49:35.430" style="s2">might not be mine you know we might not</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.030" end="00:49:37.410" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you play it and keep it going</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.430" end="00:49:39.720" style="s2">as long as we can keep that you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.410" end="00:49:44.130" style="s2">that hacky sack up in the air as long as</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.720" end="00:49:46.740" style="s2">we can as a as a species but also accept</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.130" end="00:49:49.890" style="s2">that if if we are temporary what what is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.740" end="00:49:52.770" style="s2">what is that then you know and and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.890" end="00:49:56.760" style="s2">and you know what does that mean for art</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.770" end="00:49:57.420" style="s2">for our you know I&#39;ve been reading 11 us</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.760" end="00:50:01.589" style="s2">lately</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.420" end="00:50:03.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a really interesting guy and he</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.589" end="00:50:06.660" style="s2">basically says that all we&#39;ve really got</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.390" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">is our comportment it&#39;s how you can port</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.660" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">yourself is really all that you can all</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:14.010" style="s2">that you can know how do you engage with</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:16.200" style="s2">the other and how do you expand you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.010" end="00:50:17.790" style="s2">Timothy Leary was the one who had the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.200" end="00:50:19.589" style="s2">quote find the others but he meant find</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.790" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">the other cool psychedelic people and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.589" end="00:50:22.680" style="s2">then when I&#39;ve retrieved find the others</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:24.450" style="s2">I mean find the others fine</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.680" end="00:50:26.069" style="s2">you know the manga hat-wearing scary</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.450" end="00:50:28.260" style="s2">people that you don&#39;t really think you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.069" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">like and find the human in them and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.260" end="00:50:31.380" style="s2">I just met an indigenous man who is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:33.990" style="s2">now the others are the other species</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.380" end="00:50:35.849" style="s2">it&#39;s not the other you&#39;ve got way more</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.990" end="00:50:37.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve got everything in common with</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.849" end="00:50:37.950" style="s2">that Trump supporter you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.170" end="00:50:39.869" style="s2">different from him</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.950" end="00:50:42.329" style="s2">it&#39;s like start recognizing the others</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.869" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">that you&#39;re trampling on so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.329" end="00:50:49.380" style="s2">playing with that too but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:52.320" style="s2">expanding our notions of self and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.380" end="00:50:56.580" style="s2">supposed other play into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.320" end="00:50:57.180" style="s2">real misperceptions and fear and fear of</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.580" end="00:51:00.270" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.180" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">which I but I totally agree it&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.270" end="00:51:04.860" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s essential I mean Becker</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:07.350" style="s2">was writing about it and and really he</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.860" end="00:51:09.270" style="s2">nailed it right and now so much of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.350" end="00:51:10.500" style="s2">everything we do all those billionaires</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.270" end="00:51:12.660" style="s2">we were talking about they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.500" end="00:51:16.770" style="s2">scared to die they&#39;re really just scared</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.660" end="00:51:18.660" style="s2">to die and they do so much you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.770" end="00:51:20.430" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely right and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.660" end="00:51:22.560" style="s2">not because the fact is all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.430" end="00:51:23.970" style="s2">gamification you know as we they showed</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.560" end="00:51:25.650" style="s2">when they tried to recreate the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.970" end="00:51:28.020" style="s2">prisoner&#39;s dilemma experiments they</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.650" end="00:51:30.600" style="s2">never work they never work people never</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.020" end="00:51:33.930" style="s2">behave that way they never do</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.600" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">the thing that who was it what was his</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.930" end="00:51:38.910" style="s2">name the game theorist they</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:40.710" style="s2">schizophrenic who uh yeah John Nash you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.910" end="00:51:42.690" style="s2">came up with him and later he said look</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.710" end="00:51:44.820" style="s2">I was a paranoid schizophrenic coming up</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.690" end="00:51:47.940" style="s2">with these ideas this is not this is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.820" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">the normal human response but yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.940" end="00:51:51.330" style="s2">when you are afraid I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:53.190" style="s2">certainly in the big picture more afraid</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.330" end="00:51:54.870" style="s2">of death shirt we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.190" end="00:51:56.490" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna gather we&#39;re not gonna trust</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.870" end="00:51:59.370" style="s2">that the mana is coming from heaven the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.490" end="00:52:02.730" style="s2">next day and you know what you get you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.370" end="00:52:04.440" style="s2">get worms yeah I love the the prisoner&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.730" end="00:52:06.300" style="s2">dilemma I think the only people that did</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.440" end="00:52:09.030" style="s2">the prisoner&#39;s dilemma in that way were</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.300" end="00:52:09.930" style="s2">economists because they&#39;ve been taught</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.030" end="00:52:15.300" style="s2">that that&#39;s what they were supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.930" end="00:52:18.650" style="s2">have done so we&#39;ve next up is Gordon</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.300" end="00:52:22.890" style="s2">Young you had an answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.650" end="00:52:25.380" style="s2">yes yeah so the problem posed by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.890" end="00:52:28.610" style="s2">question is how do we deal with limited</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.380" end="00:52:33.480" style="s2">resources or resource constraints and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.610" end="00:52:36.360" style="s2">the the issue with that or one way</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.480" end="00:52:40.260" style="s2">around it is recognition that the best</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.360" end="00:52:42.560" style="s2">things in life aren&#39;t things that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.260" end="00:52:46.140" style="s2">once we get past a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.560" end="00:52:50.520" style="s2">resource that the things that we value</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.140" end="00:52:52.140" style="s2">we&#39;re valuing them for the ability to to</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.520" end="00:52:53.820" style="s2">make our lives better but but not</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.140" end="00:52:57.480" style="s2">necessarily by making our lives better</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.820" end="00:53:03.210" style="s2">in a material sense and so in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.480" end="00:53:05.190" style="s2">it was a an easy answer you know a banal</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.210" end="00:53:06.119" style="s2">answer to the question but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.190" end="00:53:12.349" style="s2">part that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.119" end="00:53:15.150" style="s2">that merits a lot of contemplation is</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.349" end="00:53:18.809" style="s2">how do you how do you awaken that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.150" end="00:53:20.849" style="s2">recognition for people especially in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.809" end="00:53:22.200" style="s2">this culture that we&#39;re you know in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.849" end="00:53:23.549" style="s2">Western culture but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.200" end="00:53:26.369" style="s2">our Western industrial information</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.549" end="00:53:29.930" style="s2">culture I think it&#39;s I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.369" end="00:53:34.829" style="s2">lot of sort of genetic evolutionary bias</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.930" end="00:53:36.539" style="s2">towards individual trying to trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.829" end="00:53:39.450" style="s2">get more right how much money is enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.539" end="00:53:41.609" style="s2">well just a little bit more with John D</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.450" end="00:53:43.829" style="s2">Rockefellers answer right sure how much</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.609" end="00:53:46.200" style="s2">you know how do you know you&#39;re wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.829" end="00:53:50.599" style="s2">enough well when I when I can afford</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.200" end="00:53:52.769" style="s2">better toys than my brother-in-law right</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.599" end="00:53:54.869" style="s2">well there&#39;s there&#39;s some pretty innate</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.769" end="00:53:58.950" style="s2">forces that drive us towards this</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.869" end="00:54:00.569" style="s2">material porosity so the the question I</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.950" end="00:54:04.440" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.569" end="00:54:07.079" style="s2">is how do we how do we awaken that</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.440" end="00:54:10.710" style="s2">recognition individually for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.079" end="00:54:12.569" style="s2">and for the people around us and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.710" end="00:54:15.329" style="s2">culture in the you know seven and a half</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.569" end="00:54:18.989" style="s2">billion of us that are on this planet I</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.329" end="00:54:21.450" style="s2">think you know the the event is coming</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.989" end="00:54:23.759" style="s2">unless we do awaken this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.450" end="00:54:25.980" style="s2">recognition and so I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.759" end="00:54:28.440" style="s2">that where&#39;s the growing edge how to how</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.980" end="00:54:30.539" style="s2">to propagate that understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.440" end="00:54:32.730" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s more to life than just</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.539" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">the material I don&#39;t have any answers</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.730" end="00:54:38.700" style="s2">for it that&#39;s but that&#39;s that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:41.069" style="s2">here is to talk about it with other</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.700" end="00:54:44.039" style="s2">people so hope that sparked some other</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.069" end="00:54:45.559" style="s2">interesting conversation yeah and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.039" end="00:54:47.759" style="s2">you know that is that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.559" end="00:54:49.470" style="s2">those are those are the shallow waters</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.759" end="00:54:50.970" style="s2">we&#39;re all run aground in in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.470" end="00:54:52.829" style="s2">personal growth and transformation space</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.970" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">right because people are like oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.829" end="00:54:55.950" style="s2">I&#39;m grinding and I&#39;m chasing material</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:57.720" style="s2">stuff and then either sand deck or</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.950" end="00:54:59.039" style="s2">totally or or whatever I drop a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.720" end="00:55:00.660" style="s2">surrogate of any minute I&#39;m like eh</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.039" end="00:55:02.130" style="s2">we&#39;re all on it screwy and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.660" end="00:55:04.410" style="s2">hold this as long as I possibly can into</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.130" end="00:55:07.549" style="s2">wham wham wham and now I&#39;m pulled down</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.410" end="00:55:10.950" style="s2">again into my material seeking striving</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.549" end="00:55:12.210" style="s2">animal self and my sense is if we want</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.950" end="00:55:15.150" style="s2">something to work we have to fully</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.210" end="00:55:17.910" style="s2">acknowledge the better angels of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.150" end="00:55:18.780" style="s2">nature but also the baser animal and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.910" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">actually have to meet</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.780" end="00:55:22.440" style="s2">both good you can&#39;t just go fucking</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:25.530" style="s2">cross-eyed and pretend you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.440" end="00:55:27.630" style="s2">hypothermic don&#39;t make good poets right</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.530" end="00:55:29.100" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s just basic hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.630" end="00:55:32.040" style="s2">evolutionary biology and code and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.100" end="00:55:35.100" style="s2">competition etc and so my sense would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.040" end="00:55:36.750" style="s2">is that the like because the question</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.100" end="00:55:38.910" style="s2">that we posed which is how do we play</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.750" end="00:55:42.090" style="s2">well together when the stakes are high</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.910" end="00:55:44.040" style="s2">and there&#39;s a ton of in like attempts or</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.090" end="00:55:46.290" style="s2">efforts for us to gel together and do</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.040" end="00:55:48.390" style="s2">this hard thing and we fragment and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.290" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">fragment it feels to me at the top and</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.390" end="00:55:51.870" style="s2">we fragment at the bottom so we fragment</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">with the large number of people that try</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.870" end="00:55:57.810" style="s2">to come together on behalf of the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:56:00.930" style="s2">cons and there needs to be some basic</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.810" end="00:56:02.190" style="s2">version of hey I mean ubi is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.930" end="00:56:04.710" style="s2">contemporary expression of it but</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.190" end="00:56:09.150" style="s2">basically we find a way to meet</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.710" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">everybody&#39;s basic needs so that striving</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.150" end="00:56:13.890" style="s2">for competition and advancement and one</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:17.220" style="s2">up one down relationships is at least</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.890" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">hypothetically off the table now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.220" end="00:56:21.210" style="s2">the multipolar trap in game theory which</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">is if someone&#39;s gonna rush to break the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.210" end="00:56:25.830" style="s2">pact then it might as well be me right</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:27.750" style="s2">and then you get shitty sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.830" end="00:56:29.280" style="s2">behavior again simply without even</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.750" end="00:56:31.560" style="s2">having to have a sociopath in the mix</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.280" end="00:56:33.690" style="s2">it&#39;s just I suspect someone else might</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.560" end="00:56:36.780" style="s2">be therefore I will act to protect my</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.690" end="00:56:39.750" style="s2">own interests so I remember in grad</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.780" end="00:56:41.910" style="s2">school reading a case study of the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.750" end="00:56:42.450" style="s2">century range Wars in northern New</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.910" end="00:56:44.220" style="s2">Mexico</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.450" end="00:56:45.510" style="s2">and it was this fascinating story if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.220" end="00:56:46.680" style="s2">guys don&#39;t miss one the Cowboys are like</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.510" end="00:56:49.170" style="s2">fencing everything and it was basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.680" end="00:56:52.710" style="s2">a pitched battle between the Hispanic</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.170" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">sheep herding communities and the Anglo</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.710" end="00:56:57.120" style="s2">cattle companies right and and it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:56:58.530" style="s2">you know the cattle companies were going</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.120" end="00:56:59.970" style="s2">around and killing all that killing all</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.530" end="00:57:02.550" style="s2">the Hispanic folks and fencing</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.970" end="00:57:04.380" style="s2">everything for their cattle super bloody</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.550" end="00:57:06.750" style="s2">crazy conflict but what was fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.380" end="00:57:07.950" style="s2">is that in the Hispanic mountain</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.750" end="00:57:10.380" style="s2">communities where there was limited</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.950" end="00:57:12.690" style="s2">resources this was high alpine not super</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.380" end="00:57:15.030" style="s2">lush kinda sketchy was that within those</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.690" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">villages there was explicit social</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.030" end="00:57:20.250" style="s2">shaming against individually taking more</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:23.970" style="s2">than your fair share so there was net</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.250" end="00:57:27.480" style="s2">like if one goat herder started</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.970" end="00:57:31.050" style="s2">basically trashing the Commons in order</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.480" end="00:57:32.500" style="s2">to asymmetrically gather capital right</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.050" end="00:57:34.150" style="s2">in the form of a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.500" end="00:57:36.280" style="s2">walk or whatever they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.150" end="00:57:37.600" style="s2">socially shunned and shamed that would</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.280" end="00:57:38.290" style="s2">be the kind of thing their mother would</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.600" end="00:57:39.610" style="s2">take him aside</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.290" end="00:57:40.810" style="s2">don&#39;t be an asset what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.610" end="00:57:42.310" style="s2">right or their friends would maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.810" end="00:57:45.370" style="s2">distance them or tease them or something</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.310" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">along those lines and so some version of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.370" end="00:57:48.490" style="s2">a ubi and this could be in an</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:49.900" style="s2">intentional community this could be in</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.490" end="00:57:52.050" style="s2">an urban environment all the way to a</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.900" end="00:57:55.780" style="s2">nation-state but some form of that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.050" end="00:57:57.550" style="s2">then some form of healthy pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.780" end="00:57:58.990" style="s2">shaming which is different than guilt</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.550" end="00:58:00.850" style="s2">and I know there&#39;s different and</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.990" end="00:58:02.650" style="s2">conflicting definitions of this term but</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.850" end="00:58:04.990" style="s2">the idea of like guilt is unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.650" end="00:58:07.300" style="s2">that&#39;s me I&#39;m not worthy but shame is I</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.990" end="00:58:09.580" style="s2">have transgressed the highest norms of</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.300" end="00:58:12.400" style="s2">my society of my in-group and I am</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.580" end="00:58:14.890" style="s2">responsible for atoning for them and if</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.400" end="00:58:16.420" style="s2">we have that at the base layer is there</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.890" end="00:58:19.210" style="s2">a chance for us to an you know to</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.420" end="00:58:22.120" style="s2">basically renormalize the Commons and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.210" end="00:58:23.950" style="s2">pro-social behavior so I&#39;ll leave it at</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.120" end="00:58:26.140" style="s2">that there&#39;s also a top-down element</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.950" end="00:58:29.500" style="s2">which is how do you take the the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.140" end="00:58:30.790" style="s2">awake charismatic transmission folks and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.500" end="00:58:32.140" style="s2">how do you get them to play well to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.790" end="00:58:33.880" style="s2">there which is another nut to crack but</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.140" end="00:58:36.790" style="s2">we can come back to it if it pops up</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.880" end="00:58:38.830" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s hard I mean and and as you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.790" end="00:58:40.690" style="s2">know you know until now the most of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.830" end="00:58:44.380" style="s2">most of the social shaming is being done</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.690" end="00:58:46.480" style="s2">by the the wicked on the good you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.380" end="00:58:48.910" style="s2">to make us you know shameful about about</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:52.510" style="s2">you know sex or gender or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.910" end="00:58:55.660" style="s2">know that we carry around shame and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.510" end="00:58:57.880" style="s2">truly shameless people the people who do</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.660" end="00:59:02.050" style="s2">the shameful stuff are shameless right</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.880" end="00:59:04.450" style="s2">now it&#39;s not even it&#39;s not even it they</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.050" end="00:59:08.140" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to they don&#39;t seem to care</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.450" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">but but I agree you know the the you</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.140" end="00:59:11.530" style="s2">know my work has always been about</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:13.450" style="s2">trying to reveal the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.530" end="00:59:15.700" style="s2">operating systems that people accept is</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.450" end="00:59:18.970" style="s2">given conditions of nature but are</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.700" end="00:59:20.770" style="s2">actually inventions so central currency</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.970" end="00:59:21.970" style="s2">everybody thinks okay money so how are</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.770" end="00:59:24.580" style="s2">we gonna get more money to more people</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.970" end="00:59:26.680" style="s2">and this and it&#39;s like you know and some</p>

<p begin="01:05:51.530" end="01:05:56.240" style="s2">and we were connected to source right</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.660" end="01:05:59.990" style="s2">and we could all manifest from there yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.240" end="01:06:02.200" style="s2">but then the next the next crux is who</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.990" end="01:06:05.180" style="s2">the fuck grabs the One Ring of Power</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.200" end="01:06:07.100" style="s2">because like it&#39;s magic and it&#39;s potent</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.180" end="01:06:08.630" style="s2">and then the so let&#39;s just say let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.100" end="01:06:10.430" style="s2">just telescope ahead okay yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.630" end="01:06:11.690" style="s2">possible it&#39;s reproducible its scalable</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.430" end="01:06:14.180" style="s2">and a ship pilot people are doing it all</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.690" end="01:06:15.170" style="s2">at once right now and how do we learn to</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.180" end="01:06:17.090" style="s2">play together</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.170" end="01:06:20.210" style="s2">well once people are actually tapping in</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.090" end="01:06:22.550" style="s2">to the mainframe and because because you</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.210" end="01:06:24.070" style="s2">know Lord Acton 101 absolute power</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.550" end="01:06:26.200" style="s2">corrupts right so</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.070" end="01:06:28.810" style="s2">the notion so when I posited that</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.200" end="01:06:31.720" style="s2">bottoms up like UB is health and social</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.810" end="01:06:34.750" style="s2">shame as a way for us to manage the</p>

<p begin="01:06:34.750" end="01:06:38.740" style="s2">and the positioning in the jockeying and</p>

<p begin="01:06:41.890" end="01:06:44.920" style="s2">the particularly in the Pacific</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.780" end="01:06:47.170" style="s2">Northwest tribes the notion of the</p>

<p begin="01:06:47.170" end="01:06:51.160" style="s2">wealth I actually accrue status not by</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.060" end="01:06:53.560" style="s2">holding it and hoarding it like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.160" end="01:06:55.630" style="s2">dragon Smaug right but actually by</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.560" end="01:06:58.420" style="s2">gifting it and putting the velocity of</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.630" end="01:06:59.560" style="s2">wealth back into my society so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.420" end="01:07:01.510" style="s2">almost sort of like an indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.560" end="01:07:04.660" style="s2">version of metcalf law like I actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.510" end="01:07:06.700" style="s2">gained power within the network right by</p>

<p begin="01:07:06.700" end="01:07:11.200" style="s2">resources versus hoarding so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.830" end="01:07:13.810" style="s2">super neat but the toss down one is is</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.200" end="01:07:15.730" style="s2">as or more problematic which is you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.810" end="01:07:17.230" style="s2">a conversation I think we&#39;ve all been</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.730" end="01:07:19.810" style="s2">having in this you know on rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.230" end="01:07:22.030" style="s2">and elsewhere you know which is why is</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.810" end="01:07:25.690" style="s2">it that people that are sourcing from</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.030" end="01:07:26.470" style="s2">that place tend as a rule not to play</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.690" end="01:07:29.290" style="s2">well with others</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.470" end="01:07:31.300" style="s2">yeah and how the hell do we actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.290" end="01:07:33.430" style="s2">bomb this together and one of it it</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.300" end="01:07:35.830" style="s2">feels like because because up until now</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.430" end="01:07:36.970" style="s2">the waking up process or the actual</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.830" end="01:07:40.030" style="s2">izing process has been largely</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.970" end="01:07:42.100" style="s2">individual and catch-as-catch-can so</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.030" end="01:07:43.750" style="s2">we&#39;re all like apex predators like</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.100" end="01:07:45.580" style="s2">Panthers and we all need 400 square</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.750" end="01:07:47.950" style="s2">miles of territory you try and put you</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.580" end="01:07:50.590" style="s2">know you put a dozen Panthers in a pen</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.950" end="01:07:52.690" style="s2">together and it&#39;s a shit show you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.590" end="01:07:55.090" style="s2">versus if you guys saw that documentary</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.690" end="01:07:57.100" style="s2">blackfish right about about Orca pods</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.090" end="01:07:59.200" style="s2">like they&#39;ve bigger bigger brains than</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.100" end="01:08:02.350" style="s2">we do and then the all the extra folds</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.200" end="01:08:04.420" style="s2">are for social coherence so they</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.350" end="01:08:06.640" style="s2">literally have anatomically they are</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.420" end="01:08:08.110" style="s2">hard-wired to their apex predators to</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.640" end="01:08:10.300" style="s2">the Wolves of the sea they&#39;re badasses</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.110" end="01:08:13.630" style="s2">but some they have figured out how to</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.300" end="01:08:16.299" style="s2">play this game and so for me that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.630" end="01:08:18.430" style="s2">true missing link and I mean lots of</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.299" end="01:08:20.319" style="s2">efforts in the last five years of coming</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.430" end="01:08:22.150" style="s2">together with smart brilliant intention</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.319" end="01:08:23.620" style="s2">you know like Dhamma holders or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.150" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">they&#39;ve all got their super power and</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.620" end="01:08:26.080" style="s2">the super heroes cannot get it fucking</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:30.310" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.080" end="01:08:35.799" style="s2">and so one proposed solution would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.310" end="01:08:37.929" style="s2">the idea of like can we can we see each</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.799" end="01:08:39.880" style="s2">other&#39;s light from each other&#39;s light</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.929" end="01:08:41.500" style="s2">right without getting pushed away from</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.880" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">each other by seeing each other&#39;s shadow</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.500" end="01:08:46.150" style="s2">or fail ability or humanity and so if</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:48.690" style="s2">you find as a thought experiment like</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.150" end="01:08:50.890" style="s2">who&#39;s your 12 like find your dozen and</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.690" end="01:08:52.150" style="s2">think about the people that are closest</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.890" end="01:08:54.100" style="s2">in your life and think about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.150" end="01:08:55.750" style="s2">beautiful perfect part of them that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.100" end="01:08:57.609" style="s2">their expression it could be they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.750" end="01:08:59.409" style="s2">always the humorous one they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.609" end="01:09:00.880" style="s2">the adventuresome one there o is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.409" end="01:09:02.620" style="s2">emotionally intelligent one this is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.880" end="01:09:04.900" style="s2">creative harebrained idea when like I</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.620" end="01:09:06.460" style="s2">love you fully and wholly for that in</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.900" end="01:09:09.400" style="s2">that expression when you&#39;re on that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.460" end="01:09:11.920" style="s2">are perfect right and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.400" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">because we can love each other out but</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:15.250" style="s2">then there&#39;s also the element of well</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:16.509" style="s2">hey rather than some of us getting kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.250" end="01:09:17.589" style="s2">of sort of most of the way there and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.509" end="01:09:19.330" style="s2">whether it&#39;s pressure from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.589" end="01:09:20.529" style="s2">marketplace or Instagram or whatever we</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.330" end="01:09:22.449" style="s2">stop fronting that we&#39;re all the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.529" end="01:09:24.850" style="s2">there we actually say what if we</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.449" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">assemble from this dozen that is our</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.850" end="01:09:30.400" style="s2">chorus right as bonding it would call it</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:31.870" style="s2">right our crew that we say we take your</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.400" end="01:09:33.130" style="s2">slice of the divine we take your slice</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.870" end="01:09:34.810" style="s2">of the divine this is your slice your</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.130" end="01:09:38.710" style="s2">slice and we assemble Voltron we</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.810" end="01:09:40.420" style="s2">assemble perfected human that is the sum</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.710" end="01:09:42.009" style="s2">total and mediated by all of our</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.420" end="01:09:44.380" style="s2">relationships which is we express the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.009" end="01:09:47.259" style="s2">agape like I fuckin love you because I</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.380" end="01:09:50.049" style="s2">see the perfected in you but none of us</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.259" end="01:09:52.620" style="s2">grab the ring that&#39;s a non-starter but</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.049" end="01:09:54.699" style="s2">between us we can hold the metabolise</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.620" end="01:09:57.850" style="s2">perfected human and we can we can</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.699" end="01:10:01.810" style="s2">transfer all worship right sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.850" end="01:10:05.170" style="s2">dedication loyalty to that hologram that</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.810" end="01:10:08.590" style="s2">is the one right how they metabolized by</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.170" end="01:10:11.290" style="s2">the twelve and can we use that as a way</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.590" end="01:10:13.060" style="s2">to precipitate what Tila de Chardin</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.290" end="01:10:15.760" style="s2">called the you know the omega point like</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.060" end="01:10:18.100" style="s2">the body of Christ to Sheridan said is</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.760" end="01:10:25.090" style="s2">the second coming at the end of time</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.100" end="01:10:30.100" style="s2">that is all of us as a Macon&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.090" end="01:10:31.360" style="s2">don&#39;t go to Omega but it&#39;s nice I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.100" end="01:10:33.790" style="s2">guess I don&#39;t believe the ring actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.360" end="01:10:36.159" style="s2">has power was super Woody Allen of you</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.790" end="01:10:37.719" style="s2">right there but okay good I try it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.159" end="01:10:40.600" style="s2">better than Terrence in some ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.719" end="01:10:42.580" style="s2">closer to my origins but the the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.600" end="01:10:44.830" style="s2">ring I look at the ring in a social</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.580" end="01:10:48.040" style="s2">construction you know again from Torah</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.830" end="01:10:49.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like Samuel goes to God and says</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.040" end="01:10:51.320" style="s2">everybody wants a king they want a king</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.750" end="01:10:52.850" style="s2">everyone else has a king now the Jew</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.320" end="01:10:54.890" style="s2">is really they want a king what do I do</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.850" end="01:10:56.840" style="s2">and God hate that guys like they&#39;d know</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.890" end="01:10:58.190" style="s2">no we don&#39;t do Kings it&#39;s not what we do</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.840" end="01:10:59.930" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s about power and all you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.190" end="01:11:00.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t do that Sam it&#39;s like looked at</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.930" end="01:11:02.150" style="s2">really and they&#39;re not gonna do not</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.920" end="01:11:04.550" style="s2">gonna behave they really really want a</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.150" end="01:11:07.580" style="s2">king and God says all right pick the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.550" end="01:11:09.710" style="s2">tallest guy pick the tallest guy as if</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.580" end="01:11:11.810" style="s2">it&#39;s just like it doesn&#39;t just pick some</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.710" end="01:11:13.430" style="s2">dude you know at that point it was all</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.810" end="01:11:15.980" style="s2">dude you should have picked a woman but</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.430" end="01:11:17.300" style="s2">but pick the tallest one put the crown</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.980" end="01:11:20.150" style="s2">on so they know it&#39;s the King the whole</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.300" end="01:11:22.190" style="s2">idea is the crown to me the crown is</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.150" end="01:11:24.860" style="s2">about the opposite of power but the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.190" end="01:11:27.080" style="s2">crown is saying the only reason why this</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.860" end="01:11:29.300" style="s2">person gets to be Kings is they wearing</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.080" end="01:11:30.830" style="s2">the crown it&#39;s a total social</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.300" end="01:11:33.650" style="s2">construction we&#39;re gonna pretend like</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.830" end="01:11:35.660" style="s2">this guy is something when he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.650" end="01:11:38.420" style="s2">not in order to just administrate what</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.660" end="01:11:40.400" style="s2">we&#39;re doing and and we&#39;ve you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.420" end="01:11:43.520" style="s2">fallen into the trap of feeling like our</p>
