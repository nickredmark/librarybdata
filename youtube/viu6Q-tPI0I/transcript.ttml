<p begin="00:00:30.830" end="00:00:38.000" style="s2">slightly controversial and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.890" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">talk about somebody who is very divisive</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.000" end="00:00:48.879" style="s2">it seems in the popular discourse these</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.559" end="00:00:51.580" style="s2">days and I&#39;m going to make my claim that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:55.339" style="s2">there is a somewhat of a witch hunt</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.580" end="00:00:59.030" style="s2">going on right now which is truly</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.339" end="00:01:00.890" style="s2">deplorable this summer I got acquainted</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.030" end="00:01:09.159" style="s2">with the thinker by the name of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.890" end="00:01:14.030" style="s2">Peterson so I want to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.159" end="00:01:18.140" style="s2">Peterson cult and yes he&#39;s a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.030" end="00:01:21.400" style="s2">cult figure but he&#39;s also a serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.140" end="00:01:21.400" style="s2">thinker which is something that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.730" end="00:01:30.040" style="s2">when they become media stars or get</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.850" end="00:01:37.400" style="s2">instrumentalized by various shady groups</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.040" end="00:01:42.520" style="s2">forget he&#39;s Canadian and he&#39;s from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.400" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">northern Alberta he&#39;s sort of a</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:51.860" style="s2">Harvard psychologist and he wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.840" end="00:01:54.350" style="s2">called maps and minion in 1999 and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.860" end="00:01:57.440" style="s2">recently he&#39;s been accused of thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.350" end="00:01:59.300" style="s2">crime the people who are accusing in</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.440" end="00:02:01.820" style="s2">them I would say that none of them have</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.300" end="00:02:04.820" style="s2">actually read his books they&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.820" end="00:02:08.810" style="s2">short videos ten minutes long five</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.820" end="00:02:11.330" style="s2">minutes long they&#39;ve seen various</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.810" end="00:02:14.930" style="s2">attacks on him various memes you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.330" end="00:02:19.390" style="s2">and most of his critics</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.930" end="00:02:24.280" style="s2">I think misunderstand him</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.390" end="00:02:30.190" style="s2">some kind of way so I would like to set</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.280" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2">the record straight so his book maps and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.190" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">meanings is a very rich complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:38.110" style="s2">important book I would say it&#39;s a book</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:40.209" style="s2">that&#39;s written in blood so to speak it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.110" end="00:02:43.540" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s what Nietzsche and Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.209" end="00:02:46.300" style="s2">swards it&#39;s it has the real power it has</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.540" end="00:02:51.430" style="s2">real power in it and it has the power of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.300" end="00:02:55.110" style="s2">an individual grappling in a deep and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:55.110" style="s2">sincere way with with the truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.330" end="00:03:00.150" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy reading and actually its</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.790" end="00:03:04.660" style="s2">complexity kind of surprised me because</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">Peterson is such a fluid talker but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.660" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">book isn&#39;t fluid at all there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:13.660" style="s2">be a very big gap between his let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:18.940" style="s2">a serious work as a writer and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.660" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">psychologist and his public persona as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.940" end="00:03:27.850" style="s2">kind of free speech advocate and for</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:36.130" style="s2">some weird reason he&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.850" end="00:03:38.110" style="s2">the right anyway it&#39;s very strange to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.130" end="00:03:41.350" style="s2">that someone with his obvious gravitas</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.110" end="00:03:45.160" style="s2">as a thinker would become such a star</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.350" end="00:03:48.459" style="s2">first of all and also that also be not</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.160" end="00:03:51.959" style="s2">discussed in the mainstream media except</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.459" end="00:03:55.600" style="s2">through rather insulting caricatures</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.959" end="00:03:59.340" style="s2">usually he&#39;s called a neo-nazi which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.600" end="00:04:02.709" style="s2">the best kind of unimaginative</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.340" end="00:04:04.180" style="s2">ideological insult that anybody seems to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.709" end="00:04:05.620" style="s2">be able to come up with you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.180" end="00:04:09.130" style="s2">the way it is these days and these</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.620" end="00:04:14.230" style="s2">strange times if you can&#39;t fit somebody</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.130" end="00:04:16.709" style="s2">into your nice ideological box or if</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.230" end="00:04:22.300" style="s2">somebody is too forthright</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.709" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">straightforward not obscure and jargon</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.300" end="00:04:27.720" style="s2">rid and enough you kind of ignore them</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">or you demonize them or you call them</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.720" end="00:04:34.189" style="s2">inflammatory names like nah</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:38.419" style="s2">see or other such that&#39;s nonsense and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.189" end="00:04:40.550" style="s2">peterson is not a nazi or a neo-nazi and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.419" end="00:04:47.439" style="s2">he&#39;s not even really right-wing in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.550" end="00:04:49.539" style="s2">view he seems to me to be a very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.439" end="00:04:54.949" style="s2">compassionate and intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.539" end="00:04:57.050" style="s2">tender-hearted person he&#39;s closer to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.949" end="00:05:00.590" style="s2">sort of george orwell he&#39;s a critic</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.050" end="00:05:03.289" style="s2">critique of ideology and totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.590" end="00:05:08.229" style="s2">and political correctness and all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.289" end="00:05:15.770" style="s2">that twenty years ago he would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.229" end="00:05:20.449" style="s2">something left of center although he is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.770" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">a economic liberal which of course is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.449" end="00:05:29.210" style="s2">great sin for for the left and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:31.819" style="s2">gonna comment on that because I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.210" end="00:05:34.370" style="s2">economist but I know there are some</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.819" end="00:05:36.770" style="s2">reasons for his mischaracterizations and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.370" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">that he&#39;s got himself into it somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.770" end="00:05:40.430" style="s2">and regardless of what but we&#39;re I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:43.879" style="s2">to say that regardless of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.430" end="00:05:50.199" style="s2">political label you put on him I believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.879" end="00:05:55.330" style="s2">he&#39;s somebody on fire with a real</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.199" end="00:05:58.879" style="s2">message or something you know genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.330" end="00:06:01.099" style="s2">mmm spiritual and in the old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.879" end="00:06:07.240" style="s2">sense of the word he&#39;s on fire with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.099" end="00:06:10.940" style="s2">holy spirit since I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.240" end="00:06:14.839" style="s2">religion and metaphysics of all kinds I</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.940" end="00:06:17.479" style="s2">have no problem with with that though of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.839" end="00:06:20.990" style="s2">course it&#39;s it&#39;s taboo to to speak in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.479" end="00:06:22.940" style="s2">this way and of course actually speaking</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.990" end="00:06:28.580" style="s2">in this way as I&#39;m speaking opens me up</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.940" end="00:06:34.089" style="s2">to as I realized today opens me up to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.580" end="00:06:39.349" style="s2">great deal of potential abuse a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.089" end="00:06:42.529" style="s2">potential sarcasm potential you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.349" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">shallow attacks right the kind same kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.529" end="00:06:46.580" style="s2">of attacks that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:52.220" style="s2">that Peterson is subject to daily I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.580" end="00:06:54.380" style="s2">no wonder the guy is ill maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.220" end="00:06:57.290" style="s2">feel the trepidation I have and actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.380" end="00:07:02.660" style="s2">even talking about him which is strange</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.290" end="00:07:08.660" style="s2">because he&#39;s quite a moderate individual</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.660" end="00:07:17.620" style="s2">you know he&#39;s quite old-fashioned he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.660" end="00:07:23.210" style="s2">quite fatherly there&#39;s nothing cruel or</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.620" end="00:07:27.770" style="s2">unkind or you know nasty about any of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.210" end="00:07:29.330" style="s2">his discourse so the fact that he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.770" end="00:07:32.419" style="s2">called the not-see is just just</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.330" end="00:07:37.580" style="s2">appalling and shows us the level at</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.419" end="00:07:40.850" style="s2">which you know the discourse has sunk in</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.580" end="00:07:45.560" style="s2">our society in our social network world</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.850" end="00:07:50.510" style="s2">and I&#39;m not a Peter Sohn Ian Cinco fan</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.560" end="00:07:54.919" style="s2">t&#39;k I&#39;m not a Cinco fent not in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.510" end="00:07:58.580" style="s2">least I&#39;m actually critical of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.919" end="00:08:00.590" style="s2">several of his assumptions and confused</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.580" end="00:08:02.990" style="s2">about some of his orientations and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.590" end="00:08:07.580" style="s2">will separate the wheat from the chaff</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.990" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">in this discussion I will try to say you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.580" end="00:08:13.789" style="s2">know what I rejected what I accept in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:17.510" style="s2">his thought that shafts or the chaff of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.789" end="00:08:20.950" style="s2">the wheat I&#39;ll talk about first and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.510" end="00:08:23.390" style="s2">I&#39;ll say why I appreciate the man okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.950" end="00:08:26.110" style="s2">so I&#39;m happy that Peterson is speaking</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.390" end="00:08:29.240" style="s2">on both sides of the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.110" end="00:08:31.970" style="s2">but I&#39;m puzzled why he glosses over any</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.240" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">critique of sort of Ayn Rand</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.970" end="00:08:37.969" style="s2">individualism</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:40.010" style="s2">I am follow his critique of Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.969" end="00:08:42.050" style="s2">utopianism and post-modernism I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.010" end="00:08:45.550" style="s2">it&#39;s fair enough I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.050" end="00:08:48.020" style="s2">profound but I think it&#39;s fair enough I</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.550" end="00:08:49.579" style="s2">wonder why he doesn&#39;t critique the free</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.020" end="00:08:52.009" style="s2">market or</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.579" end="00:08:54.350" style="s2">the kind of liberal ideological</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.009" end="00:08:58.759" style="s2">possession to use another one of his</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.350" end="00:09:04.009" style="s2">phrases I mean of course free-market</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.759" end="00:09:06.920" style="s2">capitalism is also destructive Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.009" end="00:09:09.410" style="s2">Marxist collectivism is equally</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.920" end="00:09:12.910" style="s2">destructive and perhaps they are two</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.410" end="00:09:15.319" style="s2">sides of the same coin in my view so</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.910" end="00:09:17.529" style="s2">obviously we&#39;re destroying the earth the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.319" end="00:09:20.899" style="s2">air the water like greedy predators and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.529" end="00:09:26.209" style="s2">this can&#39;t be remedied by 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.899" end="00:09:29.720" style="s2">liberalism in my view so I I wonder why</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.209" end="00:09:33.459" style="s2">mm-hmm we can&#39;t be critical of extreme</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.720" end="00:09:37.009" style="s2">liberalism or radical selfishness as</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.459" end="00:09:40.430" style="s2">well as being critical of communism or</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.430" end="00:09:45.019" style="s2">the individual doesn&#39;t matter at all why</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.620" end="00:09:48.620" style="s2">can&#39;t we be rid of be critical of both</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.019" end="00:09:50.899" style="s2">these wrong views okay so I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.620" end="00:09:52.639" style="s2">his discourse is a bit dated that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.899" end="00:09:57.050" style="s2">belongs a bit to the 1980s when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.639" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">to politics I don&#39;t think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.050" end="00:10:03.589" style="s2">choose between one wrong view and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:04.579" style="s2">another between the good Empire and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.589" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">evil one</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.579" end="00:10:09.620" style="s2">I think he seems to think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:12.529" style="s2">choose science but I want to say perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.620" end="00:10:14.779" style="s2">there&#39;s another way and I have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.529" end="00:10:18.439" style="s2">wondering if Peterson&#39;s psychological</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.779" end="00:10:21.139" style="s2">ideas are slightly reductive I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.439" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">sure that he&#39;s solid from a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.139" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">point of view and nobody&#39;s accusing him</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:29.509" style="s2">of not being a rigorous of scientist in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:33.319" style="s2">fact he quite obviously is a rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.509" end="00:10:36.379" style="s2">scientist but I wonder if the system of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.319" end="00:10:38.389" style="s2">categorization he speaks above the five</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.379" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">year the four big five personality</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.389" end="00:10:45.199" style="s2">traits IQ tests etc have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:49.550" style="s2">totalitarian potential somewhat like</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.199" end="00:10:51.850" style="s2">5-year plans could such tests be used by</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.550" end="00:10:54.470" style="s2">companies to create a nightmarish</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.850" end="00:10:57.199" style="s2">meritocracy where everyone was evaluated</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.470" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">by their DNA or their genes or their IQ</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.199" end="00:11:01.490" style="s2">or whatever you know could a class of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:02.110" style="s2">untouchables arise from people being</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.490" end="00:11:05.649" style="s2">left out</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.110" end="00:11:08.110" style="s2">the mix I think there is some virtue to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.649" end="00:11:10.680" style="s2">the left which he does actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.110" end="00:11:13.810" style="s2">acknowledge even as a vociferous</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.680" end="00:11:19.450" style="s2">critique of Marxist materialism</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.810" end="00:11:22.390" style="s2">dialectics which I am also the virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.450" end="00:11:23.950" style="s2">the left is to expand the net of care</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.390" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">and compassion to the widest group of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.950" end="00:11:32.620" style="s2">people possible and that is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:35.260" style="s2">and finally while I find no evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.620" end="00:11:37.329" style="s2">bigotry in Peterson&#39;s thinking I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.260" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">why is being propped up by people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.329" end="00:11:45.459" style="s2">are so irrationally opposed to gay</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:47.980" style="s2">marriage there so ardently I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.459" end="00:11:49.899" style="s2">it I don&#39;t get the outright movement I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.980" end="00:11:51.730" style="s2">don&#39;t think he&#39;s a part of it I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.899" end="00:11:55.350" style="s2">he&#39;s actually critiqued it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.730" end="00:12:00.220" style="s2">he has a lot of fans who are all</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.350" end="00:12:02.410" style="s2">apparently all right I think maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.220" end="00:12:05.769" style="s2">are a few things about postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.410" end="00:12:12.190" style="s2">society that are not just satanic right</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.769" end="00:12:14.260" style="s2">and evil I think that it&#39;s great that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.190" end="00:12:16.570" style="s2">we&#39;ve been able to extend our protection</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.260" end="00:12:18.850" style="s2">to vulnerable people and look outside of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.570" end="00:12:20.620" style="s2">our own tribe and I think perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.850" end="00:12:23.019" style="s2">Peterson might be a bit provincial in</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.620" end="00:12:25.089" style="s2">his Christianity which is not so rare</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.019" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">for a Christian certainly or are a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.089" end="00:12:31.269" style="s2">Buddhist or a Muslim either of course so</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">while Peterson never criticizes gay</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.269" end="00:12:38.050" style="s2">marriage I wonder why he doesn&#39;t lend</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:42.610" style="s2">more support to it is he worried about</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.050" end="00:12:45.399" style="s2">defending his his more traditional fans</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.610" end="00:12:50.740" style="s2">is he in bed with some of the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.399" end="00:12:54.570" style="s2">people despite a kind of good will and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.740" end="00:12:54.570" style="s2">desire to dialogue with everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.630" end="00:12:59.500" style="s2">lastly one of his best articulations</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.970" end="00:13:01.839" style="s2">things that I like that he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.500" end="00:13:05.829" style="s2">is sacred speech and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.839" end="00:13:08.940" style="s2">what inspired me to to start talking to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.829" end="00:13:11.560" style="s2">start doing these kind of podcast things</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.940" end="00:13:13.050" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the subject of his arch</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.560" end="00:13:15.870" style="s2">enemy</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.050" end="00:13:17.910" style="s2">the dreaded postmodernist michel</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.870" end="00:13:22.920" style="s2">foucault in his last book the courage of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.910" end="00:13:25.170" style="s2">truth who had many faults but came to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.920" end="00:13:30.029" style="s2">some of the same conclusions as speeders</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.170" end="00:13:33.480" style="s2">and weirdly enough the sacredness of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.029" end="00:13:35.670" style="s2">individual who speaks the truth my only</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.480" end="00:13:38.370" style="s2">question here is is sacred speech unique</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.670" end="00:13:41.330" style="s2">to Christianity has in sacred speech and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">the value of the individual soul and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.330" end="00:13:46.080" style="s2">sacred speech existed before</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.980" end="00:13:50.580" style="s2">Christianity and cultures like India and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.080" end="00:13:53.370" style="s2">others and well I am sympathetic and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.580" end="00:13:56.279" style="s2">agree with the idea that we need to as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.370" end="00:13:58.890" style="s2">culture rediscover the Father in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.279" end="00:14:01.470" style="s2">belly of the whale our metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.890" end="00:14:06.600" style="s2">roots we also need to study world</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.470" end="00:14:10.290" style="s2">religion not just Christian religion so</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.600" end="00:14:15.630" style="s2">those are my Peter Sounion my misgivings</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.290" end="00:14:18.930" style="s2">and at the same time I loved a man in</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.630" end="00:14:22.050" style="s2">many ways okay what do I love about him</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.930" end="00:14:25.110" style="s2">well firstly the deep practicality and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.050" end="00:14:27.240" style="s2">usefulness of his thoughts that&#39;s to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.110" end="00:14:30.839" style="s2">as a kind of genius right I believe he</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.240" end="00:14:33.720" style="s2">has a sort of genius for simplicity for</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.839" end="00:14:37.230" style="s2">clarity his ideas rise above abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.720" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">and and move into the real world you</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.230" end="00:14:42.540" style="s2">know when he says clean up your room pay</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:46.140" style="s2">attention don&#39;t say things that make you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.540" end="00:14:49.860" style="s2">weak these are not as simple ideas as</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.140" end="00:14:53.060" style="s2">they appear they&#39;re deeply thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.860" end="00:14:56.339" style="s2">spiritual Maxim&#39;s are words to live by</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.060" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">the primary spiritual practice is just</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.339" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">that it&#39;s cleaning up our intimate space</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:03.420" style="s2">in our mind as well and that is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:05.160" style="s2">simple real meditation is about paying</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.420" end="00:15:08.310" style="s2">attention is about orienting ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.160" end="00:15:12.300" style="s2">properly and yes of course we need the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.310" end="00:15:14.279" style="s2">courage to say what is true so I read</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.300" end="00:15:16.709" style="s2">Peterson and I go yeah that&#39;s right yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.279" end="00:15:22.550" style="s2">I think that&#39;s true and and yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.709" end="00:15:22.550" style="s2">what I need to do you know it&#39;s action</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.649" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">so another thing I think he&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.350" end="00:15:38.380" style="s2">about is the importance of Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:38.380" style="s2">which people in the let&#39;s say Academy</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.860" end="00:15:45.610" style="s2">haven&#39;t quite grappled with there to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.940" end="00:15:54.649" style="s2">merely intellectual and young is a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.720" end="00:15:58.730" style="s2">difficult and visceral thinker young is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.649" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">not going away because I think that much</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.730" end="00:16:02.810" style="s2">of what Jung&#39;s gift as much of his</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:05.390" style="s2">genius hasn&#39;t yet been discovered and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.810" end="00:16:08.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like that with all very great</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.390" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">thinkers they have a sort of endless</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.180" end="00:16:15.529" style="s2">bounty they&#39;re revealing things to us</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:17.720" style="s2">through time and Peterson has brought</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.529" end="00:16:20.540" style="s2">Carl Jung back to life with a vengeance</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.720" end="00:16:23.690" style="s2">and he&#39;s made this most complex thinker</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.540" end="00:16:26.630" style="s2">accessible and he&#39;s he&#39;s bringing out</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.690" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">the darker side of Jung Jung&#39;s concepts</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.630" end="00:16:30.890" style="s2">of the shadow or the collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:34.070" style="s2">unconsciousness or synchronicity are</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.890" end="00:16:37.610" style="s2">sort of bottomless in their depth and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.070" end="00:16:39.709" style="s2">interest I was pretty blown away when I</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.610" end="00:16:41.810" style="s2">read Peterson&#39;s reading list because</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.709" end="00:16:44.899" style="s2">these were the same writers I read in my</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.810" end="00:16:47.959" style="s2">youth Nietzsche dusty esky Northrop Frye</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.899" end="00:16:50.140" style="s2">Robert even Robert prison you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.959" end="00:16:53.329" style="s2">right to say we should read writers who</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.140" end="00:16:57.250" style="s2">wound us in some way who traumatized us</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.329" end="00:17:00.529" style="s2">who we can never become recover from who</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.250" end="00:17:03.459" style="s2">reorient our entire existence I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.529" end="00:17:05.900" style="s2">for many people Peterson is just that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.459" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">perhaps were both Canadians so we like</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.900" end="00:17:15.079" style="s2">these bleak massive landscapes so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">Russian novels are set we like Russian</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.079" end="00:17:20.770" style="s2">and northern European writers there are</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.460" end="00:17:44.390" style="s2">been surpassed in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.059" end="00:17:47.480" style="s2">so is nietzsche you know both writers</p>

<p begin="00:17:47.480" end="00:17:55.700" style="s2">I believe that Peterson&#39;s writing has</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">so he&#39;s missing some people from his</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.650" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">reading list like real Kay and Blake and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:13.340" style="s2">maybe reneging on and George Gurdjieff</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:15.380" style="s2">and Buddhist like chögyam trungpa but</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:33.710" style="s2">he&#39;s anti-feminist I think he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.750" end="00:18:36.950" style="s2">critique of a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.710" end="00:18:39.640" style="s2">pathological feminism I I&#39;m sure he</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.950" end="00:18:43.850" style="s2">supports the civil rights and gains of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.640" end="00:18:46.190" style="s2">women and I think he simply opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.850" end="00:18:49.880" style="s2">the cliched hatred and repression of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.190" end="00:18:54.140" style="s2">them the horrible man you know I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.880" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">that he&#39;s he represents the resurgence</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.140" end="00:19:01.670" style="s2">of the kind of male principle which has</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:19:03.320" style="s2">been so maligned lately yes I know this</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.670" end="00:19:06.830" style="s2">view will make everybody hysterical</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.320" end="00:19:10.300" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.830" end="00:19:14.420" style="s2">taboo thing in the world right here here</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.300" end="00:19:21.050" style="s2">to critique any cut form of feminism</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.420" end="00:19:28.309" style="s2">right but you know not all feminism is</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.050" end="00:19:32.030" style="s2">pure so the good the strong the rational</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.309" end="00:19:34.280" style="s2">the noble man yeah is you know not in</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.030" end="00:19:37.220" style="s2">fashion these days you know he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.280" end="00:19:39.400" style="s2">a dinosaur he&#39;s a thing of the past he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.220" end="00:19:42.770" style="s2">a subject for scorn</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.400" end="00:19:45.290" style="s2">so we can just look at the election of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.770" end="00:19:51.530" style="s2">this pussy grabbing president Donald</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.290" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">Trump and see how repressing the good</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:20:03.920" style="s2">man you know leads to it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.540" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">demonic caricature so I think Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.920" end="00:20:10.070" style="s2">only against this kind of self-defeating</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:14.540" style="s2">man-hating feminism today&#39;s men you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.070" end="00:20:16.940" style="s2">have a lot of problems you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.540" end="00:20:19.460" style="s2">addicted to porn and video games they</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.940" end="00:20:22.160" style="s2">they&#39;re losing out to women in education</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.460" end="00:20:24.500" style="s2">and work they&#39;re filling up the prisons</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.160" end="00:20:27.350" style="s2">and the lunatic asylums there they clean</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.500" end="00:20:29.330" style="s2">our garbage and our sewage systems they</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.350" end="00:20:34.700" style="s2">run the corporate world and who the hell</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.330" end="00:20:37.600" style="s2">would want to do that young men are</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.700" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">hungry for Peterson&#39;s message of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.600" end="00:20:44.570" style="s2">responsibility they find a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:46.310" style="s2">resonance there you know we need men to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.570" end="00:20:49.310" style="s2">manifest the good the true the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.310" end="00:20:51.790" style="s2">we need to celebrate men and not just</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.310" end="00:20:55.250" style="s2">women we need to celebrate women as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.790" end="00:20:58.130" style="s2">huh complaining about the patriarchy all</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.250" end="00:21:05.420" style="s2">day long it&#39;s it&#39;s tiresome it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.130" end="00:21:08.060" style="s2">has no force behind it yeah I just think</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.420" end="00:21:10.820" style="s2">Peterson wants to present a balanced</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.060" end="00:21:13.580" style="s2">picture of the sexes that&#39;s all and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.820" end="00:21:16.850" style="s2">suspect that Peterson&#39;s enemies are full</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.580" end="00:21:23.140" style="s2">of daddy issues and they have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.850" end="00:21:23.140" style="s2">with capable assertive strong men</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.260" end="00:21:28.150" style="s2">okay and asked to the charge that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.540" end="00:21:31.210" style="s2">the enemy of vulnerable groups give me a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.150" end="00:21:34.990" style="s2">scrap of evidence of a single hateful</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.210" end="00:21:39.130" style="s2">word he&#39;s spoken against any transgender</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.990" end="00:21:42.370" style="s2">person or any black person or any woman</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.130" end="00:21:47.530" style="s2">I haven&#39;t found a single one so calling</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.370" end="00:21:53.850" style="s2">him a Nazi is his grotesque I I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.530" end="00:22:03.010" style="s2">believe that he speaks to people with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.850" end="00:22:07.330" style="s2">kind of respect and he speaks to them as</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.010" end="00:22:11.350" style="s2">individuals you know not as groups so</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.330" end="00:22:13.660" style="s2">the issue is compelled speech okay hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.350" end="00:22:16.210" style="s2">the government should not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.660" end="00:22:22.210" style="s2">tell us what language to use it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.210" end="00:22:25.809" style="s2">civil rights issue obviously why can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.210" end="00:22:27.700" style="s2">people understand that I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.809" end="00:22:32.110" style="s2">think that Peterson has a racist bone in</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.700" end="00:22:35.260" style="s2">his body I think he actually is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.110" end="00:22:39.030" style="s2">advocate for immigrants and people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.260" end="00:22:43.000" style="s2">need a lift up that&#39;s the sense I get</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.030" end="00:22:45.100" style="s2">and he&#39;s actually helped a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.000" end="00:22:49.809" style="s2">in his self authoring program greatly I</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.100" end="00:22:51.790" style="s2">believe he always addresses people as</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.809" end="00:22:54.520" style="s2">individuals and that&#39;s the way we should</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.790" end="00:22:57.929" style="s2">address each other soul to soul person</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.520" end="00:23:01.179" style="s2">to person you know enough of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.929" end="00:23:03.669" style="s2">labeling you know these political labels</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.179" end="00:23:07.570" style="s2">you know yeah are we sick of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.669" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">already I mean to me he attacks</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.570" end="00:23:15.580" style="s2">ideologies right not people and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:18.190" style="s2">he taxed them sometimes fiercely but</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.580" end="00:23:21.179" style="s2">I&#39;ve never seen him behave in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.190" end="00:23:25.020" style="s2">isn&#39;t with a bit of grace and dignity</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.179" end="00:23:28.090" style="s2">even in the most grotesque circus</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.020" end="00:23:31.000" style="s2">situations even when people are like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.090" end="00:23:33.070" style="s2">know after his scalp which they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.000" end="00:23:37.129" style="s2">be at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.070" end="00:23:39.979" style="s2">so he&#39;s right to say that the remedy for</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.129" end="00:23:42.580" style="s2">ideological possession ideological</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.979" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">position is mythology poetics</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.580" end="00:23:47.359" style="s2">metaphysics studying religion find the</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.359" end="00:23:57.589" style="s2">whale and just to conclude I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.519" end="00:23:59.869" style="s2">sure that Peterson&#39;s intention was not</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.589" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">to create a youtube cult but he does</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.869" end="00:24:05.989" style="s2">have great ambition and one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:08.659" style="s2">to rescue the humanities from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.989" end="00:24:13.389" style="s2">zombie-like administrators you know in</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.659" end="00:24:15.859" style="s2">our universities to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.389" end="00:24:18.440" style="s2">rediscover the underlying metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.859" end="00:24:20.539" style="s2">their culture to point out the vast</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.539" end="00:24:29.629" style="s2">and the potential abyssal darkness as</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:31.579" style="s2">well he never glosses over the dark side</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.629" end="00:24:33.019" style="s2">of a person but tells us to look into</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.579" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">the abyss to look at our own monsters</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.019" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">that our own shadows</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.610" end="00:24:45.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of danger of course of</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.920" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">blind adoration of this sort of paternal</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.410" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">figure of unthinkingly parroting his</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:56.390" style="s2">ideas of political instrumentalization</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:58.520" style="s2">by right-wingers but I believe as</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.390" end="00:25:00.230" style="s2">thoughts are based on the values of deep</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.230" end="00:25:07.820" style="s2">humanism and that goes beyond left-right</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.820" end="00:25:13.250" style="s2">dangerous and yes we should question</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.260" end="00:25:16.610" style="s2">their motives but read the book before</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.250" end="00:25:18.820" style="s2">you talk to me before you write</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.610" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">grotesque things on my Facebook page</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.820" end="00:25:32.050" style="s2">before you attack me in a sarcastic</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:34.760" style="s2">facile childish manner read the book and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.050" end="00:25:43.700" style="s2">watches his lectures biblical lectures</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.760" end="00:25:47.450" style="s2">and his hundreds of hours of teaching on</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.700" end="00:25:50.020" style="s2">the dangers of ideology and his maps of</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.830" end="00:26:02.590" style="s2">so he&#39;s not perfect he&#39;s wrong about a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.020" end="00:26:05.740" style="s2">lot of things but in the balance I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.590" end="00:26:09.820" style="s2">he&#39;s got a somewhat of a saintly quality</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.740" end="00:26:12.220" style="s2">and what happens to saintly people</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.820" end="00:26:18.490" style="s2">they&#39;re called out as being the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.220" end="00:26:20.170" style="s2">corrupters of youth people are putting</p>
