<p begin="00:05:18.280" end="00:05:22.389" style="s2">many of his podcast this past summer</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.930" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">while on long training runs they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.389" end="00:05:28.300" style="s2">do much for pace but they keep you going</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:31.030" style="s2">for a long time dr. Peterson made</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.300" end="00:05:32.700" style="s2">something of a public splash in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.030" end="00:05:36.010" style="s2">when he made a couple of YouTube videos</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.700" end="00:05:38.139" style="s2">criticizing Canada&#39;s bill c16 which adds</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.169" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">has recently been passed in California</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.599" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">which of course raises the issue of</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.330" end="00:07:43.640" style="s2">guess this is part of my attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.660" end="00:07:45.500" style="s2">wrestle with some of the actual problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.640" end="00:07:49.070" style="s2">that the post modernists opposed because</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.500" end="00:07:50.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean as people or as thinkers I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.070" end="00:07:53.330" style="s2">mean conceptually because you always</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.930" end="00:07:55.820" style="s2">have to give the devil his due so to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.330" end="00:07:58.430" style="s2">speak and there are elements of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.820" end="00:07:59.780" style="s2">postmodern thought like the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.430" end="00:08:01.940" style="s2">there&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.780" end="00:08:04.760" style="s2">interpretations for any finite set of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.940" end="00:08:05.660" style="s2">facts that actually happened to be true</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.760" end="00:08:08.630" style="s2">and there aren&#39;t they&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.660" end="00:08:10.460" style="s2">problematic and it&#39;s it&#39;s for good</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.630" end="00:08:12.350" style="s2">reasons as well as bad reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">post-modernism has become such a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.350" end="00:08:18.050" style="s2">dominant strain of thought and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:19.670" style="s2">necessary to take it seriously and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.050" end="00:08:21.590" style="s2">been trying to one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.670" end="00:08:24.040" style="s2">been trying to figure out is is there a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.590" end="00:08:26.270" style="s2">reasonable way of distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.040" end="00:08:27.830" style="s2">philosophy from an ideologies and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.270" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">Pope the post modernist answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.830" end="00:08:32.930" style="s2">is basically know that it&#39;s ideology all</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:36.140" style="s2">the way down like the turtles all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.930" end="00:08:39.110" style="s2">way down you never escaped from the from</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.140" end="00:08:41.570" style="s2">the grip of your of your viewpoint in</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.110" end="00:08:43.610" style="s2">some sense and and there&#39;s some truth in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.570" end="00:08:46.790" style="s2">that but there&#39;s not enough truth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.610" end="00:08:48.620" style="s2">the thing and one of the hallmarks I</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.790" end="00:08:50.420" style="s2">would say of both post-postmodern an</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.620" end="00:08:53.840" style="s2">ideological thinking is the proclivity</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:35.910" style="s2">and I do think that&#39;s not only the</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.590" end="00:11:05.310" style="s2">be impaired certainly with enough effort</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.860" end="00:11:07.110" style="s2">and you&#39;re born in a certain culture</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:14.310" style="s2">degree of attractiveness and those are</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.840" end="00:11:16.830" style="s2">things that are all handed to you in</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.310" end="00:11:18.660" style="s2">some sense they they make up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.830" end="00:11:22.050" style="s2">in some sense they make up the axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.660" end="00:11:23.790" style="s2">structure of your being and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.050" end="00:11:26.190" style="s2">more advantageous and others are</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.790" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">disadvantageous and you&#39;re stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.190" end="00:11:31.350" style="s2">them and that really is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:33.510" style="s2">partly because life in and of itself is</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.350" end="00:11:36.860" style="s2">a problem and a problem of suffering but</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.510" end="00:11:39.180" style="s2">also because it seems quite evident that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.860" end="00:11:41.940" style="s2">well or at least that you could make a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.180" end="00:11:44.040" style="s2">strong case that the the talents and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.940" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">catastrophes of life are by no means</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.040" end="00:11:48.900" style="s2">equally distributed and so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:51.030" style="s2">there seems to be an intrinsic we might</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.900" end="00:11:52.710" style="s2">regard it from the perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.030" end="00:11:54.900" style="s2">standards of human justice and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.710" end="00:11:57.450" style="s2">human mercy as well as something</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.900" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">intrinsically unfair unjust about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.450" end="00:12:02.100" style="s2">structure of existence itself now I like</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:06.390" style="s2">the exact existentialist take on that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.100" end="00:12:08.430" style="s2">because what the existentialists do is</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.390" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">attribute that inequality and injustice</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.430" end="00:12:13.350" style="s2">and say unfairness to the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:15.300" style="s2">being itself and pose that as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.350" end="00:12:17.910" style="s2">central problem of life and I find that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.300" end="00:12:19.500" style="s2">very realistic I like this painting by</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.910" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">Van Gogh I think it does a very good job</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.500" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">of expressing that you know he&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:28.050" style="s2">man and he&#39;s obviously sorrowful and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:30.770" style="s2">you know he&#39;s not rich as you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.050" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">by his shoes and like it&#39;s rough and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.770" end="00:12:40.740" style="s2">he&#39;s a nexus of oppression and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.370" end="00:12:42.210" style="s2">Oh a nexus of oppression in that he may</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.740" end="00:12:44.580" style="s2">have served as an oppressor but also</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.210" end="00:12:46.260" style="s2">someone who&#39;s suffering and oppressed as</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.580" end="00:12:48.450" style="s2">a consequence of the conditions of his</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.260" end="00:12:51.210" style="s2">life and so then the question might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.450" end="00:12:52.980" style="s2">well why is life like that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.210" end="00:12:54.630" style="s2">where and what might be done about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.980" end="00:12:57.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s where the differences really</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.630" end="00:12:59.280" style="s2">start to arise so we can start from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.660" end="00:13:02.280" style="s2">perspective of the fact that life</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.280" end="00:13:08.760" style="s2">presents a universal problem to those of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.280" end="00:13:11.190" style="s2">us who are alive and conscious now there</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.760" end="00:13:12.990" style="s2">are various what would you call the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.190" end="00:13:15.060" style="s2">Metta theories that account for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.990" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">existence of this suffering my</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.060" end="00:13:20.100" style="s2">interpretation of the story of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">essentially which in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.100" end="00:13:25.170" style="s2">describes the introduction of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:27.000" style="s2">into the world is that what what seems</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.170" end="00:13:29.940" style="s2">to happen in the story of Genesis is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.000" end="00:13:31.110" style="s2">that human beings originally emerge is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.940" end="00:13:33.750" style="s2">mythological rep</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.110" end="00:13:35.130" style="s2">so it&#39;s a deep fictional representation</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.750" end="00:13:37.589" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.130" end="00:13:39.779" style="s2">keeping in mind as you might that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.589" end="00:13:41.700" style="s2">fiction can be more true than truth</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.779" end="00:13:44.910" style="s2">which is partly why we&#39;re so attracted</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.700" end="00:13:46.500" style="s2">to it because fiction distills truth and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.910" end="00:13:49.200" style="s2">presents it in a much more concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.500" end="00:13:51.899" style="s2">form than than a mere description of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.200" end="00:13:54.570" style="s2">everyday reality and in the Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.899" end="00:13:56.970" style="s2">story there&#39;s a there seems to be an</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.570" end="00:13:58.709" style="s2">association between the development of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.970" end="00:14:00.360" style="s2">vision and self-consciousness and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.709" end="00:14:01.890" style="s2">awareness of death and the awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.360" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">good and evil those things happen pretty</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.890" end="00:14:08.579" style="s2">much at exactly the same time and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:10.290" style="s2">consequence of that awareness of or that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.579" end="00:14:12.060" style="s2">self-consciousness is a dawning</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.290" end="00:14:14.100" style="s2">awareness of vulnerability you remember</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.060" end="00:14:15.690" style="s2">in the story of Genesis when Adam and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.100" end="00:14:18.300" style="s2">Eve opened their eyes or have their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.690" end="00:14:20.670" style="s2">opened as a consequence of falling prey</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.300" end="00:14:22.200" style="s2">to temptation the scales fall from their</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.670" end="00:14:24.209" style="s2">eyes and they realize that they&#39;re naked</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.200" end="00:14:26.519" style="s2">and then they immediately cover</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.209" end="00:14:28.529" style="s2">themselves up and of course the question</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.519" end="00:14:30.779" style="s2">is what does it mean to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.529" end="00:14:33.240" style="s2">you&#39;re naked and there&#39;s a variety of</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.240" end="00:14:38.010" style="s2">that well if you&#39;re naked a common</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.329" end="00:14:39.990" style="s2">nightmare is to be naked in front of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.010" end="00:14:41.550" style="s2">crowd and the reason that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.990" end="00:14:44.220" style="s2">nightmare is because well people don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.220" end="00:14:48.540" style="s2">exposed to the judgmental eye of the</p>

<p begin="00:15:02.699" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a foundational story it&#39;s obviously</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.360" end="00:15:27.899" style="s2">future because even if you solve the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.399" end="00:15:29.910" style="s2">problems that are right in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.899" end="00:15:32.459" style="s2">this moment that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.910" end="00:15:33.959" style="s2">you&#39;ve solved the plethora of problems</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.459" end="00:15:35.610" style="s2">that are likely to pop up for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.959" end="00:15:37.980" style="s2">tomorrow and next week and next month</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.610" end="00:15:40.550" style="s2">and next year and and that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.980" end="00:15:43.770" style="s2">are beyond your ability to finally solve</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.550" end="00:15:44.579" style="s2">so but there&#39;s a different viewpoint I</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.770" end="00:15:47.220" style="s2">think that comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.579" end="00:15:48.769" style="s2">of the Marxist perspective and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.220" end="00:15:51.199" style="s2">to talk to you about Marxism and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.769" end="00:15:55.110" style="s2">post-modernism both of which I regard as</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.199" end="00:15:56.999" style="s2">variant strands of the same ideology and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.110" end="00:16:00.119" style="s2">as I said I&#39;ll define why I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.999" end="00:16:02.129" style="s2">they&#39;re ideological and the the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.119" end="00:16:04.649" style="s2">thing that strikes me so clearly about</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.129" end="00:16:07.350" style="s2">the Marxist perspective is that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.649" end="00:16:08.970" style="s2">finger is always pointed at inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.350" end="00:16:11.339" style="s2">social order as the root cause of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.970" end="00:16:14.519" style="s2">suffering and that just seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.339" end="00:16:16.589" style="s2">be I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s so naive that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.519" end="00:16:18.600" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult to understand why people</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.589" end="00:16:19.860" style="s2">can possibly fall for it maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.600" end="00:16:21.259" style="s2">partly because there&#39;s some hope</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.860" end="00:16:24.059" style="s2">embedded in it right</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.259" end="00:16:25.410" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea that well suffering</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.059" end="00:16:27.899" style="s2">might be transcended if we could just</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.410" end="00:16:29.939" style="s2">organize our societies properly but it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.899" end="00:16:31.619" style="s2">seems to be number one that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.939" end="00:16:33.779" style="s2">highly unlikely and number two as</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.619" end="00:16:35.610" style="s2">Dostoevsky pointed out even if we did</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.779" end="00:16:37.230" style="s2">organize our societies so that no one</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.610" end="00:16:39.329" style="s2">had anything to worry about from a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.230" end="00:16:41.639" style="s2">material perspective so everyone let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.329" end="00:16:43.259" style="s2">say had enough bread and shelter that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.639" end="00:16:45.689" style="s2">were the kind of insane creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.259" end="00:16:48.839" style="s2">would blow that apart and fragment that</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.689" end="00:16:50.189" style="s2">sort of static utopian perfection just</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:52.649" style="s2">so something strange and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.189" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">might happen and I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.649" end="00:16:57.749" style="s2">that&#39;s a really devastating critique and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:17:00.689" style="s2">you know no Dostoevsky formulated that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.749" end="00:17:02.579" style="s2">back in the late 1800s he had thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.689" end="00:17:05.189" style="s2">through the consequences of communist</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.579" end="00:17:07.380" style="s2">utopia before it even manifested itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.189" end="00:17:09.480" style="s2">as a political force and I think put his</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.380" end="00:17:12.689" style="s2">finger on exactly at least one of its</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.480" end="00:17:14.399" style="s2">primary weaknesses so you know if we</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.689" end="00:17:16.260" style="s2">were delivered from suffering it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.399" end="00:17:17.939" style="s2">necessarily clear that we would be happy</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.260" end="00:17:19.769" style="s2">about that because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.939" end="00:17:22.829" style="s2">that does characterize human beings is</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.769" end="00:17:24.630" style="s2">this intense desire for experience that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.829" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">transcends the normative you know and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.630" end="00:17:28.049" style="s2">people will go out and look for</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:29.880" style="s2">difficult things to do just for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.049" end="00:17:32.250" style="s2">of doing difficult things they climb</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.880" end="00:17:33.750" style="s2">mountains and they engage in extreme</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.250" end="00:17:36.360" style="s2">sports and they put their lives in</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.750" end="00:17:38.130" style="s2">danger and there&#39;s no technical reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.360" end="00:17:39.870" style="s2">for that and it doesn&#39;t seem like a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.130" end="00:17:41.820" style="s2">intelligent thing to do from the pure</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.870" end="00:17:44.700" style="s2">perspective of self-preservation but</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.820" end="00:17:47.669" style="s2">we&#39;re certainly capable of it and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.700" end="00:17:49.889" style="s2">problem the Marxists seem to lay the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.669" end="00:17:52.500" style="s2">reason for suffering at the foot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.889" end="00:17:55.049" style="s2">inadequate social structure and but they</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.500" end="00:17:57.029" style="s2">go farther than that they also describe</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.049" end="00:17:58.020" style="s2">the social structure as it exists and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.029" end="00:18:00.090" style="s2">this is where the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.020" end="00:18:02.150" style="s2">the patriarchy is derived as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.090" end="00:18:06.300" style="s2">concerned as something that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.150" end="00:18:08.280" style="s2">necessarily an upper class or an</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.300" end="00:18:10.980" style="s2">oppressive class against the oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.280" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">class and what the people who fit in</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.980" end="00:18:15.570" style="s2">those different categories can vary with</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:17.160" style="s2">classic Marxism it was the rich against</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.570" end="00:18:18.920" style="s2">the poor or the poor against the rich</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.160" end="00:18:22.440" style="s2">right the burrs was C against the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.920" end="00:18:24.510" style="s2">proletariat and that&#39;s been transformed</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.440" end="00:18:28.050" style="s2">I would say by the post modernists using</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.510" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">a fairly self-evident sleight of hand</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.050" end="00:18:34.920" style="s2">into identity politics where the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:38.250" style="s2">oppressed oppressor narrative just takes</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.920" end="00:18:40.410" style="s2">different forms according to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.250" end="00:18:43.890" style="s2">identity that happens to be plugged into</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.410" end="00:18:45.720" style="s2">the same mediational structure and what</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.890" end="00:18:47.130" style="s2">seems to happen as a consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.720" end="00:18:49.620" style="s2">and I mean there&#39;s pretty good data</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.130" end="00:18:53.910" style="s2">about this with regards to the genesis</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.620" end="00:18:55.050" style="s2">of intense intergroup conflict one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.910" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">the things that predicts intense</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.050" end="00:18:59.040" style="s2">intergroup conflict like the conflict in</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:02.220" style="s2">Rwanda and certainly also happened in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.040" end="00:19:05.429" style="s2">Nazi Germany is that genocide all</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.220" end="00:19:07.650" style="s2">activities are often marketed as</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.429" end="00:19:09.150" style="s2">pre-emptive strikes against an oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.650" end="00:19:12.809" style="s2">class right and so that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.150" end="00:19:15.450" style="s2">the Jews in Germany and in in Rwanda the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.809" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">same narrative emerged it&#39;s very common</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.450" end="00:19:20.850" style="s2">to to dichotomize this society as</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">oppressor and oppressed and then for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.850" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">oppressed to rise up and take out the so</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:28.830" style="s2">called oppressors even before anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:30.840" style="s2">of any of any particular violence occurs</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.830" end="00:19:33.000" style="s2">because of this enhanced sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.840" end="00:19:36.330" style="s2">victimization and the moral high ground</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.000" end="00:19:37.890" style="s2">that it seems to provide the logic being</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.330" end="00:19:41.190" style="s2">something like if we&#39;re being oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.890" end="00:19:43.020" style="s2">and we have every right to to defend</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.190" end="00:19:45.660" style="s2">ourselves so to speak even against</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.020" end="00:19:48.120" style="s2">threats that are only in some way</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.660" end="00:19:50.130" style="s2">imaginary now I don&#39;t want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.120" end="00:19:51.960" style="s2">cut-and-dried about that because you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.130" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">know it certainly is the case that there</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.960" end="00:19:55.950" style="s2">isn&#39;t a political or economic system in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:59.220" style="s2">the entire world that lacks corruption</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.950" end="00:20:03.210" style="s2">and so the idea that this the social</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.220" end="00:20:05.309" style="s2">structure is in part corrupt enough so</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.210" end="00:20:07.230" style="s2">that everyone who is embodied in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.309" end="00:20:09.720" style="s2">social structure doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.460" end="00:20:15.659" style="s2">certainly true because human beings are</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.429" end="00:20:21.779" style="s2">of reasons our own blindness the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.190" end="00:20:23.580" style="s2">that we inherit structures that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.779" end="00:20:25.880" style="s2">really understand that are all demented</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.580" end="00:20:28.340" style="s2">and bent in one way or another and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.880" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">there&#39;s always an element of truth to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.340" end="00:20:32.730" style="s2">critical claims that if we just got our</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:34.200" style="s2">act together better from a social</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.730" end="00:20:36.659" style="s2">perspective that everything would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.200" end="00:20:39.450" style="s2">more fair and just but to say that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.659" end="00:20:41.460" style="s2">not to simultaneously justify the claim</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.450" end="00:20:43.470" style="s2">that all the reasons that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.460" end="00:20:45.510" style="s2">are suffering and that life is unfair</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.470" end="00:20:47.059" style="s2">and unjust is because the social</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.510" end="00:20:49.559" style="s2">structure is corrupt and oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.059" end="00:20:50.940" style="s2">right you got to think in multivariate</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.559" end="00:20:53.490" style="s2">terms if you have any degree of</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.100" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2">differentiate I mean that&#39;s partly what</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.570" end="00:21:04.649" style="s2">social scientists is do is to take a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.340" end="00:21:07.080" style="s2">look at a complex outcome suffering</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.649" end="00:21:08.580" style="s2">certainly being one of those and to look</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.639" end="00:22:25.560" style="s2">because resentment is a very toxic and</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.330" end="00:22:39.330" style="s2">really quite a spectacle to see people</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.550" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">at places like Yale come out and agitate</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.330" end="00:22:43.500" style="s2">as a consequence of the realization of</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.870" end="00:23:25.980" style="s2">privilege comparisons and that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.790" end="00:23:28.830" style="s2">immediately self-evident and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.980" end="00:23:30.630" style="s2">the fact that as Americans let&#39;s say us</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.830" end="00:23:32.490" style="s2">North Americans since I&#39;m a Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.630" end="00:23:33.870" style="s2">that we&#39;re staggeringly privileged</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.490" end="00:23:36.300" style="s2">compared to the rest of the world is</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.870" end="00:23:38.100" style="s2">certainly a consequence of the of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.300" end="00:23:40.950" style="s2">you might describe is the arbitrariness</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.100" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">of our political borders and so but to</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.950" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">forget that when you&#39;re claiming a</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:46.340" style="s2">particular brand of oppression for</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:49.340" style="s2">yourself seems to me to be very</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.340" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">ungrateful at the least and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.340" end="00:23:53.430" style="s2">motivated let&#39;s say politically because</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:55.740" style="s2">I think it justifies your expression of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.430" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">hatred for those that tiny fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.740" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">people who are still better off than you</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:02.280" style="s2">and also a degree of historical</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:03.990" style="s2">ignorance that&#39;s absolutely staggering</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.280" end="00:24:06.540" style="s2">in its magnitude and a complete</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.990" end="00:24:08.780" style="s2">indictment of our education system which</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.540" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">should be indicted in every possible way</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.780" end="00:24:20.090" style="s2">so now the Marxists might claim to their</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.840" end="00:24:22.410" style="s2">benefit let&#39;s say with this worldview of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.090" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">class struggle as being the primary</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.410" end="00:24:28.350" style="s2">driver of human history and the well-off</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:30.090" style="s2">socioeconomically because that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.350" end="00:24:31.680" style="s2">much the only way they defined well-off</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.090" end="00:24:34.130" style="s2">which is also something I take great</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.680" end="00:24:36.840" style="s2">objection to because there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.130" end="00:24:39.000" style="s2">hierarchies in the world and there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.840" end="00:24:39.330" style="s2">many important hierarchies and not all</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.000" end="00:24:41.730" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.330" end="00:24:43.130" style="s2">can be reduced to socioeconomic status</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.730" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">by any stretch of the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.130" end="00:24:47.550" style="s2">imagine if you were 80 years old and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:49.530" style="s2">had 20 million dollars you know you</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.550" end="00:24:51.150" style="s2">might be perfectly happy to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.530" end="00:24:53.310" style="s2">all that money if you could be 18 again</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.150" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s and you know one of the best</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">actually age because you know young</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.750" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">people haven&#39;t actually had much time to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.520" end="00:25:03.030" style="s2">make money whereas old people have had</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:04.500" style="s2">quite a bit of time but the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.030" end="00:25:07.500" style="s2">being old and rich is that you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.500" end="00:25:10.020" style="s2">old and that actually turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.500" end="00:25:11.910" style="s2">quite a serious problem because no</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.020" end="00:25:14.700" style="s2">matter how rich you are you eventually</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.910" end="00:25:19.080" style="s2">die and so the money is the money has</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.700" end="00:25:20.820" style="s2">very delimited if delimited effect with</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.080" end="00:25:23.040" style="s2">regards to addressing the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.820" end="00:25:24.990" style="s2">problems of the suffering of life and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.040" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">know perfectly well from the empirical</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.990" end="00:25:29.280" style="s2">perspective that once you have enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:31.590" style="s2">money so that the bill collectors aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.280" end="00:25:33.510" style="s2">chasing you around essentially something</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.590" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">like the beginnings of a middle-class</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.510" end="00:25:37.590" style="s2">existence or maybe the upper end of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:39.570" style="s2">working class then additional money has</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.590" end="00:25:41.610" style="s2">absolutely no bearing whatsoever on your</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.570" end="00:25:43.080" style="s2">psychological well-being and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.610" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">actually an indication of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.080" end="00:25:48.330" style="s2">limitations of material comfort let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:50.310" style="s2">say as a medication for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.330" end="00:25:52.530" style="s2">suffering that&#39;s attendant on life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.310" end="00:25:54.470" style="s2">another thing that&#39;s very weak about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.530" end="00:25:57.720" style="s2">Marxists and I think very interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.470" end="00:25:59.340" style="s2">contradictory because they&#39;re very anti</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.720" end="00:26:00.840" style="s2">capital in their structure but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.340" end="00:26:02.820" style="s2">so damn materialistic that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.840" end="00:26:04.650" style="s2">absolutely mind-boggling because the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.820" end="00:26:05.910" style="s2">Marxists are actually more convinced</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.650" end="00:26:07.830" style="s2">that money is useful than most</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.910" end="00:26:10.680" style="s2">capitalists as far as I can tell because</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.830" end="00:26:12.840" style="s2">they believe that that money is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.680" end="00:26:14.670" style="s2">the solution to all life&#39;s problems the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.840" end="00:26:16.740" style="s2">problem is is that just the right people</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.670" end="00:26:18.780" style="s2">don&#39;t have the money and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.740" end="00:26:21.630" style="s2">a staggeringly naive perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.780" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">there&#39;s many there&#39;s many problems in</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.630" end="00:26:24.840" style="s2">life that money just cannot solve and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:26.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a fair number of them in that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.840" end="00:26:29.610" style="s2">actually makes worse</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.070" end="00:26:32.160" style="s2">so anyways having said all that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.610" end="00:26:34.140" style="s2">could also still make the case I used to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.160" end="00:26:37.110" style="s2">work for a socialist party in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.140" end="00:26:39.330" style="s2">when I was a kid about six about time I</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.110" end="00:26:42.630" style="s2">was 14 till the time I was about 17</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.330" end="00:26:44.670" style="s2">before I figured out what was wrong not</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.630" end="00:26:47.490" style="s2">so much with socialism per se but with</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.670" end="00:26:49.950" style="s2">ideology per se and I actually admired</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.490" end="00:26:52.800" style="s2">that the socialist leaders that I had</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.950" end="00:26:56.550" style="s2">the fortune to be introduced to because</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.800" end="00:26:58.200" style="s2">at that point they were very much voice</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.550" end="00:26:59.940" style="s2">for the working class a lot of union</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.200" end="00:27:01.920" style="s2">leaders and people like that you know so</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.940" end="00:27:03.870" style="s2">they&#39;re classic democratic socialists on</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.920" end="00:27:05.670" style="s2">the labor end of the distribution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.870" end="00:27:06.960" style="s2">absolutely necessary for labor and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.670" end="00:27:09.300" style="s2">working class to have a political voice</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:11.340" style="s2">something the Democrats might keep in</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.300" end="00:27:14.100" style="s2">mind so and maybe they wouldn&#39;t lose</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.340" end="00:27:15.660" style="s2">their elections quite so frequently no I</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.100" end="00:27:17.280" style="s2">really think it&#39;s appalling you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.660" end="00:27:19.830" style="s2">because it&#39;s necessary for the working</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.280" end="00:27:21.540" style="s2">class to have a political voice so and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.830" end="00:27:24.210" style="s2">to have that transformed into identity</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.540" end="00:27:27.750" style="s2">politics is a real catastrophe anyways I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.210" end="00:27:29.850" style="s2">think that the people that I met many of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.750" end="00:27:31.620" style="s2">them were genuinely concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.850" end="00:27:33.210" style="s2">problems of the working-class and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.620" end="00:27:35.400" style="s2">know more power to them and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.210" end="00:27:37.500" style="s2">there are people on the Left who who</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.270" end="00:36:15.730" style="s2">derived from the state I would say if</p>

<p begin="00:36:24.490" end="00:36:28.180" style="s2">also good and evil and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.740" end="00:36:30.550" style="s2">paradoxical and we don&#39;t like</p>

<p begin="00:36:30.550" end="00:36:35.290" style="s2">how it is what what Foucault and Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:37.120" style="s2">and the post modernists did was that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.290" end="00:36:38.890" style="s2">they kind of added a collective element</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.120" end="00:36:40.540" style="s2">to that so they&#39;re Hobbesian world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.890" end="00:36:43.120" style="s2">a world of individuals struggling</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.120" end="00:36:48.670" style="s2">of warlike nature it&#39;s it&#39;s groups of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.970" end="00:36:50.740" style="s2">individuals bound by whatever their</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.670" end="00:36:52.900" style="s2">identity happens to be struggling</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.740" end="00:36:55.810" style="s2">against each each other for power</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.900" end="00:36:58.180" style="s2">because in the postmodern neo-marxist</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.810" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">universe there&#39;s nothing but power and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.180" end="00:37:03.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a variety of reasons for that</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:05.620" style="s2">partly it&#39;s because the post modernists</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.610" end="00:37:08.590" style="s2">don&#39;t admit that there are any standards</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.620" end="00:37:10.210" style="s2">outside of arbitrary opinion essentially</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.590" end="00:37:12.100" style="s2">they don&#39;t really believe in the real</p>

<p begin="00:37:12.100" end="00:37:16.540" style="s2">critiques of science for example which</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.110" end="00:37:19.270" style="s2">is increasingly characterized as nothing</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.540" end="00:37:21.850" style="s2">but part of the Eurocentric patriarchy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.270" end="00:37:23.800" style="s2">what would you call desire to impose</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.850" end="00:37:25.600" style="s2">their power structure on the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.800" end="00:37:28.210" style="s2">world despite the fact that it also</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.600" end="00:37:32.680" style="s2">makes planes fly and computers operate</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.210" end="00:37:34.920" style="s2">and well you know yeah exactly so and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.680" end="00:37:37.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a rare bloody</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.920" end="00:37:40.510" style="s2">social justice warrior that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.510" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">a an iPhone or a Android that wouldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.160" end="00:37:46.990" style="s2">actually correct because the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.710" end="00:37:48.580" style="s2">quantum mechanics is correct is one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.990" end="00:37:50.950" style="s2">the reasons why these unbelievably</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.950" end="00:37:55.960" style="s2">actually functions so they and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.110" end="00:37:58.180" style="s2">whine about the patriarchal patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.960" end="00:38:00.760" style="s2">underpinnings of Eurocentric science and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.180" end="00:38:04.180" style="s2">use the gadgets all the time to Agra</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.760" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">to complain about it so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.180" end="00:38:08.590" style="s2">pretty appalling so anyways anyways the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">worldview of the of the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.590" end="00:38:14.020" style="s2">neo-marxists is that everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:15.520" style="s2">basically not an individual because</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.020" end="00:38:17.620" style="s2">that&#39;s really a fiction and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.520" end="00:38:19.900" style="s2">Eurocentric patriarchal fiction at that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.620" end="00:38:21.910" style="s2">but a member of whatever their identity</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.900" end="00:38:23.980" style="s2">group happens to be and there&#39;s no real</p>

<p begin="00:38:26.770" end="00:38:32.740" style="s2">cultural appropriation and so it&#39;s a war</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.790" end="00:38:34.300" style="s2">of all groups against all groups and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.740" end="00:38:36.820" style="s2">it&#39;s all it&#39;s nothing but a struggle for</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.300" end="00:38:39.490" style="s2">power and there&#39;s no higher order ethic</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.820" end="00:38:42.370" style="s2">to be referred to because for the post</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.490" end="00:38:44.170" style="s2">modernists there is no such thing as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.370" end="00:38:46.150" style="s2">higher order ethic there&#39;s no such thing</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.310" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work out in practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.870" end="00:38:53.830" style="s2">because without an ethic or a</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.360" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">get into that a little bit so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.030" end="00:51:31.950" style="s2">about diversity okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:34.030" style="s2">well first of all we have to define it</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.950" end="00:51:35.860" style="s2">you know when Jonathan Hyde has been</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.030" end="00:51:37.990" style="s2">trying to define it as diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.860" end="00:51:40.210" style="s2">opinion I think it might be useful to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.990" end="00:51:41.230" style="s2">define it as diversity of personality</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.210" end="00:51:43.180" style="s2">because there&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.230" end="00:51:45.100" style="s2">variability and personality within</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.180" end="00:51:46.930" style="s2">groups of people regardless of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.100" end="00:51:48.670" style="s2">group&#39;s than there is between groups of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.930" end="00:51:51.190" style="s2">people so that should be said again</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.670" end="00:51:53.230" style="s2">there&#39;s more variability within groups</p>

<p begin="00:52:30.840" end="00:52:35.590" style="s2">intersectionality has emerged you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.830" end="00:52:37.330" style="s2">because people figured out well you know</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.550" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">but you&#39;re even having a harder time if</p>

<p begin="00:59:23.160" end="00:59:27.000" style="s2">in such a location will be neutral or</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.170" end="00:59:28.740" style="s2">pleasant to me unless they know that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:59:36.420" end="00:59:40.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like well the first thing is as lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.369" end="00:59:42.210" style="s2">of those so-called privileges are just</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.920" end="00:59:44.039" style="s2">the consequence of living in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.210" end="00:59:45.869" style="s2">reasonably civilized society and apply</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.039" end="00:59:47.880" style="s2">to pretty much everyone and the second</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.869" end="00:59:50.130" style="s2">thing is is that there&#39;s no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.880" end="00:59:52.380" style="s2">associate this with race that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.130" end="00:59:54.150" style="s2">one of these absolutely pathological</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.380" end="00:59:56.430" style="s2">slights of hand how about we call it</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.150" end="00:59:59.009" style="s2">majority privilege you think that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.430" end="01:00:00.720" style="s2">the case for for the majority members of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.009" end="01:00:02.039" style="s2">every society that&#39;s ever functioned</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.720" end="01:00:03.630" style="s2">that&#39;s actually being functional</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.039" end="01:00:05.250" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a majority advantage</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.630" end="01:00:07.470" style="s2">if there wasn&#39;t a bloody majority</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.250" end="01:00:09.539" style="s2">advantage people wouldn&#39;t make societies</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.470" end="01:00:11.779" style="s2">the whole point of making a society is</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.539" end="01:00:13.730" style="s2">so that the people within this society</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.779" end="01:00:16.280" style="s2">have the advantage</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.730" end="01:00:17.750" style="s2">so now you might say well when people</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.280" end="01:00:19.460" style="s2">are being integrated into this society</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.750" end="01:00:21.620" style="s2">they should be given those advantages</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.210" end="01:00:28.310" style="s2">rapidly as possible and obviously that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.550" end="01:00:30.610" style="s2">the case but to attribute this level of</p>

<p begin="01:00:30.610" end="01:00:35.180" style="s2">construct like white privileges well</p>

<p begin="01:01:43.970" end="01:01:47.270" style="s2">it all to the cities and then the rule</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.830" end="01:01:49.130" style="s2">was that if you were a starving</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.270" end="01:01:50.930" style="s2">Ukrainian woman who had children and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.130" end="01:01:54.140" style="s2">went out in the field and you picked up</p>

<p begin="01:05:44.990" end="01:05:49.580" style="s2">you a different way of conceptualizing</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.280" end="01:05:51.350" style="s2">it this is based on some of the work</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.580" end="01:05:54.370" style="s2">that I&#39;ve done on archetypes and I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.350" end="01:05:56.750" style="s2">of I think of archetypes as imagistic</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.370" end="01:05:59.120" style="s2">representations of the axioms of thought</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.750" end="01:06:01.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a reasonable way of or maybe of</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.120" end="01:06:03.620" style="s2">the axioms of being itself there are</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.100" end="01:06:05.500" style="s2">categories of being pain is a category</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.620" end="01:06:07.940" style="s2">of being for example suffering</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.500" end="01:06:09.440" style="s2">limitation finitude those are all</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.940" end="01:06:11.210" style="s2">categories of being and they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.440" end="01:06:14.510" style="s2">realistic they&#39;re the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.210" end="01:06:16.430" style="s2">elements of existence essentially it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.510" end="01:06:18.200" style="s2">different different in some sense than a</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.430" end="01:06:20.210" style="s2">materialist viewpoint you know because</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.200" end="01:06:22.040" style="s2">the materialists make the claim and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.210" end="01:06:24.530" style="s2">perfectly reasonable in some sense that</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.040" end="01:06:27.470" style="s2">the fundamental realities are material</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.530" end="01:06:29.690" style="s2">but they&#39;re only the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.470" end="01:06:31.580" style="s2">realities in some sense if you define</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.690" end="01:06:33.890" style="s2">them that way not that that isn&#39;t useful</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.580" end="01:06:34.520" style="s2">and not that you can&#39;t derive objective</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.890" end="01:06:36.470" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.520" end="01:06:39.170" style="s2">that&#39;s pragmatically useful from that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.470" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">but the fundamental realities of life</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.170" end="01:06:42.860" style="s2">have a lot more to do with motivation</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:45.440" style="s2">and emotion especially with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.860" end="01:06:47.360" style="s2">suffering and so that is the unsolved</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.440" end="01:06:48.500" style="s2">problem of human existence and we talked</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.360" end="01:06:51.140" style="s2">about the different ways of</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.500" end="01:06:53.150" style="s2">conceptualizing that and I want to walk</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.140" end="01:06:54.290" style="s2">you quickly through some of my thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.150" end="01:06:57.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.290" end="01:07:00.470" style="s2">the root the true roots of suffering and</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.160" end="01:07:03.020" style="s2">human vulnerability and I think of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.470" end="01:07:05.780" style="s2">as an antidote to ideological possession</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.020" end="01:07:07.670" style="s2">I think that this is the fundamental map</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.780" end="01:07:09.050" style="s2">of religious belief and I&#39;ll walk you</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.670" end="01:07:12.470" style="s2">through it very quickly and that what</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.050" end="01:07:14.810" style="s2">happens what happens in the case of an</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.470" end="01:07:17.930" style="s2">ideology as an ideology takes a fragment</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.810" end="01:07:20.510" style="s2">of a religious belief system and expands</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.930" end="01:07:22.369" style="s2">it up into a totality and has its mode</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.510" end="01:07:25.070" style="s2">of power because it draws on these</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.369" end="01:07:27.980" style="s2">underlying religious / archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.070" end="01:07:29.540" style="s2">narratives for its power so for example</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.980" end="01:07:32.119" style="s2">you know that the idea of the future</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.540" end="01:07:33.710" style="s2">socialist utopia is very very similar to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.119" end="01:07:35.380" style="s2">the idea of the kingdom of heaven on</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.710" end="01:07:38.390" style="s2">earth it was always you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.380" end="01:07:42.350" style="s2">cardinal element of may of of the three</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.390" end="01:07:45.530" style="s2">Western major religions so here&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.350" end="01:07:47.420" style="s2">of conceptualizing existence and each of</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.530" end="01:07:49.550" style="s2">these levels of conceptualization have</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.420" end="01:07:52.690" style="s2">their own symbolic representations and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.550" end="01:07:55.640" style="s2">you can see these what portrayed</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.690" end="01:07:57.710" style="s2">consistently throughout the narratives</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.640" end="01:07:59.090" style="s2">that we use to guide our existence even</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.710" end="01:08:01.970" style="s2">the ones that we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.090" end="01:08:04.910" style="s2">explicitly they come up in in in movies</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.970" end="01:08:06.470" style="s2">and in and in books and in myths and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.910" end="01:08:08.690" style="s2">the stories we tell each other in our</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.470" end="01:08:10.100" style="s2">dreams in our imagination constantly so</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.690" end="01:08:13.010" style="s2">they&#39;re really the categories of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.100" end="01:08:14.690" style="s2">imagination and so the first category</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.010" end="01:08:16.310" style="s2">and the one that&#39;s most difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.690" end="01:08:20.089" style="s2">understand I called the dragon of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.310" end="01:08:22.850" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of the outermost circle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.089" end="01:08:25.489" style="s2">a good illustration of it there the</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.850" end="01:08:28.489" style="s2">dragon is a very large very common</p>

<p begin="01:08:28.489" end="01:08:33.850" style="s2">biologist who I recently read called it</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.770" end="01:08:36.739" style="s2">a snake cat bird which I really liked</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.850" end="01:08:39.350" style="s2">and he thought about it as an amalgam of</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.739" end="01:08:41.720" style="s2">the of the idea of predator you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.350" end="01:08:43.790" style="s2">because our tree-dwelling ancestors and</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.720" end="01:08:46.310" style="s2">after that were basically preyed on burb</p>

<p begin="01:08:46.310" end="01:08:51.470" style="s2">by snakes and so well and god only knows</p>

<p begin="01:08:53.960" end="01:08:59.239" style="s2">tree snake bird is a is a very good</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.410" end="01:09:00.589" style="s2">representation of the category of</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.150" end="01:09:21.859" style="s2">beyond our comprehension that can do us</p>

<p begin="01:11:28.040" end="01:11:33.080" style="s2">capacity and so it works on a practical</p>

<p begin="01:11:33.080" end="01:11:39.200" style="s2">also on a on a on an abstract level and</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.860" end="01:11:41.660" style="s2">so you can also think about it as a</p>

<p begin="01:12:19.010" end="01:12:22.460" style="s2">was the fundamental problem with both of</p>

<p begin="01:12:30.740" end="01:12:34.250" style="s2">think about the Marxist and</p>

<p begin="01:12:45.350" end="01:12:49.820" style="s2">would also say that the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.500" end="01:12:51.710" style="s2">existence is a battle between good and</p>

<p begin="01:12:51.710" end="01:12:56.600" style="s2">a consequence of the symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.050" end="01:12:58.670" style="s2">realization of Western civilization that</p>

<p begin="01:13:03.110" end="01:13:07.610" style="s2">to the individual and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.850" end="01:13:09.650" style="s2">primarily an ethical issue at the</p>

<p begin="01:13:11.690" end="01:13:15.440" style="s2">that you project it onto other people</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.610" end="01:13:17.210" style="s2">you take no responsibility for it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.440" end="01:13:19.160" style="s2">you end up thinking that you&#39;re the good</p>

<p begin="01:21:34.780" end="01:21:38.920" style="s2">that of that other symbolic image did</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.760" end="01:21:41.710" style="s2">which is that the proper society</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.920" end="01:21:43.750" style="s2">supports the suffering individual in his</p>

<p begin="01:21:52.449" end="01:21:56.139" style="s2">really like that picture so Hercules</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.920" end="01:21:57.820" style="s2">goes out into the darkness and he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.139" end="01:21:59.770" style="s2">this container and maybe you could think</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.820" end="01:22:01.750" style="s2">of that container as a cultural artifact</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.770" end="01:22:03.820" style="s2">you know because the culture protects</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.750" end="01:22:05.110" style="s2">you from chaos and then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.820" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">what are you supposed to do with that</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.110" end="01:22:09.340" style="s2">protection and the answer is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.880" end="01:22:11.230" style="s2">supposed to wear the garb of the lion</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.340" end="01:22:13.000" style="s2">right that&#39;s the king of the beasts so</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.230" end="01:22:14.139" style="s2">that&#39;s supposed to be you and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.000" end="01:22:15.820" style="s2">supposed to go out there into the</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.139" end="01:22:17.500" style="s2">darkness with your bloody eyes open so</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.820" end="01:22:19.480" style="s2">you can discover what&#39;s in the darkness</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.500" end="01:22:21.159" style="s2">and share it with everyone else and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.480" end="01:22:22.989" style="s2">got a club there in his hands and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.159" end="01:22:25.150" style="s2">club is covered with eyes those are eyes</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.989" end="01:22:26.980" style="s2">NOT barbs and what that means is that</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.150" end="01:22:29.409" style="s2">you should bloody well pay attention and</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.980" end="01:22:30.969" style="s2">that well the other element of that</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.409" end="01:22:32.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not expressed in that image is</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.969" end="01:22:35.199" style="s2">that you should also speak carefully pay</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.920" end="01:22:36.820" style="s2">attention and speak carefully and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.199" end="01:22:38.139" style="s2">you&#39;re the proper son of the proper</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.820" end="01:22:40.719" style="s2">father and you can keep things</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.139" end="01:22:44.469" style="s2">functioning and that makes you into this</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.719" end="01:22:46.060" style="s2">right so the city is always threatened</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.469" end="01:22:47.679" style="s2">it&#39;s always corrupt and threatened and</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.060" end="01:22:50.170" style="s2">there&#39;s always something outside that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.679" end="01:22:51.940" style="s2">going to take it down always and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.170" end="01:22:53.860" style="s2">what&#39;s represented by the dragon that</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.940" end="01:22:55.570" style="s2">little twist in its tail is something</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.860" end="01:22:57.370" style="s2">that represents infinity and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.570" end="01:22:59.830" style="s2">courageous individual goes out of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.370" end="01:23:02.620" style="s2">damaged city to confront the dragon of</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.830" end="01:23:04.900" style="s2">chaos and to gain something valuable as</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.620" end="01:23:07.960" style="s2">a consequence and that&#39;s what human</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.900" end="01:23:10.270" style="s2">beings are supposed to do that&#39;s our</p>

<p begin="01:23:12.070" end="01:23:16.030" style="s2">that terrible dragon is just the</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.020" end="01:23:17.949" style="s2">catastrophe and suffering of life and</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.030" end="01:23:19.840" style="s2">our continual attempts to transcend it</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.949" end="01:23:22.420" style="s2">but a tremendous amount of it is also</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.840" end="01:23:24.820" style="s2">the malevolence and the evil that exists</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.420" end="01:23:26.860" style="s2">in our own hearts and in society and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.820" end="01:23:29.590" style="s2">perhaps to some degree even in the world</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.860" end="01:23:31.360" style="s2">itself you&#39;re supposed to wake up and</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.590" end="01:23:33.850" style="s2">strengthen yourself and stand up</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.360" end="01:23:35.620" style="s2">properly and fortify yourself so that</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.850" end="01:23:37.239" style="s2">you&#39;re a light that can shine in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.620" end="01:23:39.800" style="s2">darkness and that&#39;s something that can</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.239" end="01:23:42.080" style="s2">withstand malevolence and tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.800" end="01:23:44.480" style="s2">and what did what&#39;s your alternative</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.080" end="01:23:46.130" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna let life crush you and make</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.480" end="01:23:48.470" style="s2">you weak and make you resentful and</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.130" end="01:23:50.420" style="s2">bitter and then murderous you&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.470" end="01:23:52.670" style="s2">out your rage on everyone you can and</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.420" end="01:23:54.800" style="s2">it&#39;ll only be limited by your capacity</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.670" end="01:23:58.070" style="s2">to obtain power that&#39;s not a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.800" end="01:24:00.350" style="s2">and so it&#39;s this way or it&#39;s this way or</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.070" end="01:24:01.880" style="s2">a way that leads directly to hell and</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.350" end="01:24:03.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve certainly seen that plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.880" end="01:24:05.240" style="s2">times in the last hundred years and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.530" end="01:24:08.210" style="s2">you&#39;d think we might have learned our</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.240" end="01:24:10.520" style="s2">lesson but it takes a lot for people to</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.210" end="01:24:16.550" style="s2">learn and we&#39;re in danger of repeating</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.520" end="01:24:19.070" style="s2">exactly the same mistakes again so you</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.550" end="01:24:20.840" style="s2">know it&#39;s one thing to complain about</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.070" end="01:24:22.580" style="s2">the political polarization and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.840" end="01:24:24.800" style="s2">another thing to point fingers at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.580" end="01:24:28.250" style="s2">post modernists and the neo-marxist even</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.800" end="01:24:30.830" style="s2">though they they roundly deserve it in</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.250" end="01:24:31.880" style="s2">my estimation it&#39;s another thing to try</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.830" end="01:24:33.410" style="s2">to figure out what the proper</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.880" end="01:24:35.630" style="s2">alternative is and the proper</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.410" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">alternative is not in my estimation to</p>

<p begin="01:24:37.840" end="01:24:42.050" style="s2">it&#39;s not good and it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.400" end="01:24:43.700" style="s2">radical right is the solution to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.050" end="01:24:46.220" style="s2">radical left it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.700" end="01:24:47.690" style="s2">catastrophe and the only solution that</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.220" end="01:24:49.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to figure out and this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.690" end="01:24:51.740" style="s2">as a consequence of much reading and</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.610" end="01:24:53.900" style="s2">much thinking is that it&#39;s up to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.740" end="01:24:55.190" style="s2">individuals in our society sort</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.900" end="01:24:57.680" style="s2">themselves out and to strengthen</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.190" end="01:25:00.350" style="s2">themselves and to become wise and alert</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.680" end="01:25:02.960" style="s2">and to shoulder the responsibility of</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.350" end="01:25:04.730" style="s2">being and the demand the ethical demand</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.960" end="01:25:06.920" style="s2">to push back malevolence in their own</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.730" end="01:25:08.780" style="s2">hearts and in their society and I also</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.920" end="01:25:10.370" style="s2">believe that you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.780" end="01:25:12.080" style="s2">difficult for people to respect</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.370" end="01:25:14.540" style="s2">themselves because they&#39;re weak and</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.080" end="01:25:16.340" style="s2">vulnerable and pathetic and malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.540" end="01:25:17.840" style="s2">and so it&#39;s know when they&#39;re not what</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.340" end="01:25:19.430" style="s2">they could be and they know it and so</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.840" end="01:25:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s no wonder that people don&#39;t respect</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.430" end="01:25:22.850" style="s2">themselves and some of that&#39;s nature and</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.440" end="01:25:25.010" style="s2">some of that&#39;s culture and some of its</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.850" end="01:25:26.360" style="s2">individual weakness but one of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.010" end="01:25:27.980" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve learned and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.360" end="01:25:30.080" style="s2">the only optimistic thought I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.980" end="01:25:32.990" style="s2">come across is that if you have enough</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.080" end="01:25:34.730" style="s2">courage to forthrightly accept the fact</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.990" end="01:25:36.470" style="s2">that you&#39;re vulnerable and malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.730" end="01:25:38.540" style="s2">and you&#39;re willing to do something about</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.470" end="01:25:40.160" style="s2">it to overcome it you can develop enough</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.540" end="01:25:42.290" style="s2">respect for yourself so that the</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.160" end="01:25:44.990" style="s2">terrible weight of being will not make</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.290" end="01:25:46.430" style="s2">you malevolent and corrupt and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.990" end="01:25:48.140" style="s2">think that you have anything better to</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.430" end="01:25:50.540" style="s2">aim for unless you want blood in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.140" end="01:25:52.160" style="s2">streets and a pathetic life and so you</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.540" end="01:25:53.179" style="s2">might as well straighten up and get your</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.160" end="01:25:55.070" style="s2">act together and</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.179" end="01:25:56.750" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ve got some chance of getting</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.070" end="01:25:58.699" style="s2">through this intermediary period of</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.750" end="01:26:00.020" style="s2">chaos that we all face and make</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.699" end="01:26:03.170" style="s2">something better out of it instead of</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.020" end="01:26:04.370" style="s2">something worse so that&#39;s what I have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.170" end="01:26:06.080" style="s2">say about that</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.370" end="01:26:09.869" style="s2">so thank you</p>

<p begin="01:26:47.749" end="01:26:54.820" style="s2">so I should just unplug it or shut off</p>

<p begin="01:26:56.760" end="01:27:00.500" style="s2">oh yes yes right</p>

<p begin="01:27:56.920" end="01:28:02.930" style="s2">yeah you might say that reluctant would</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.780" end="01:28:05.810" style="s2">be one way of putting it yeah so the</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.930" end="01:28:07.490" style="s2">question is I had thought about making a</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.810" end="01:28:09.170" style="s2">website well the website was actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.490" end="01:28:10.940" style="s2">made because you know if I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.170" end="01:28:12.380" style="s2">decide whether to do something usually</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.940" end="01:28:13.490" style="s2">what I do because it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.380" end="01:28:15.920" style="s2">figure out if you should do something</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.490" end="01:28:17.060" style="s2">just hypothetically right so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.920" end="01:28:18.980" style="s2">ways to figure out if you should do</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.060" end="01:28:21.110" style="s2">something is to do it almost completely</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.980" end="01:28:22.640" style="s2">and then it&#39;s there and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.110" end="01:28:24.710" style="s2">actually thinking about something real</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.640" end="01:28:27.970" style="s2">and I talked to a bunch of people about</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.710" end="01:28:30.800" style="s2">it after it was built and thought that I</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.970" end="01:28:32.210" style="s2">wasn&#39;t sure it would cause more that</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.800" end="01:28:36.140" style="s2">would do more good than harm</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.210" end="01:28:37.760" style="s2">so I put it on hiatus now you know one</p>

<p begin="01:28:37.760" end="01:28:41.750" style="s2">was that the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.170" end="01:28:44.120" style="s2">Faculty Association accused me of making</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.750" end="01:28:45.530" style="s2">this website you know on the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.120" end="01:28:47.060" style="s2">things I had said about three or four</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.530" end="01:28:48.890" style="s2">months ago without talking to me about</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.060" end="01:28:51.230" style="s2">it because why would they talk to one of</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.890" end="01:28:54.830" style="s2">their faculty members being the Faculty</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.230" end="01:28:58.580" style="s2">Association and you know so I would I</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.830" end="01:29:00.980" style="s2">would I was wavering back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.580" end="01:29:03.350" style="s2">about whether to not to do this and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.980" end="01:29:05.180" style="s2">they came out and attacked me and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.350" end="01:29:06.650" style="s2">problem with that is that now if I say</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.180" end="01:29:09.440" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to do it it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.650" end="01:29:11.780" style="s2">they won and that&#39;s and first of all I</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.440" end="01:29:13.220" style="s2">don&#39;t see this as a win-loss situation I</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.780" end="01:29:14.290" style="s2">don&#39;t like it to be construed that way</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.220" end="01:29:16.239" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.290" end="01:29:18.070" style="s2">the truth of the matter is is that when</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.239" end="01:29:19.810" style="s2">the Faculty Association came out and</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.070" end="01:29:21.970" style="s2">said that you know it would be wrong for</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.810" end="01:29:23.680" style="s2">me to do it my first response was see</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.970" end="01:29:25.840" style="s2">how well you bastards I&#39;ll be doing it</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.680" end="01:29:26.830" style="s2">now you can be sure of that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.840" end="01:29:28.720" style="s2">not a good</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.830" end="01:29:30.670" style="s2">that&#39;s not how to think right that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.720" end="01:29:32.530" style="s2">to react and so you don&#39;t do that you</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.670" end="01:29:35.680" style="s2">have your little emotional meltdown and</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.530" end="01:29:37.810" style="s2">then you you think for like a month and</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.680" end="01:29:39.430" style="s2">you get people to talk to and you try to</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.810" end="01:29:43.150" style="s2">come at it from a level-headed</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.430" end="01:29:45.730" style="s2">perspective so I I don&#39;t know I probably</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.150" end="01:29:48.130" style="s2">have most luck with YouTube videos and I</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.730" end="01:29:49.810" style="s2">have a book coming out I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.130" end="01:29:55.450" style="s2">bring a flyer for all of you but you</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.810" end="01:29:57.250" style="s2">know I forgot so like I always do so and</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.450" end="01:29:59.860" style="s2">hopefully that&#39;ll be helpful because</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.250" end="01:30:01.810" style="s2">it&#39;s about individual responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.860" end="01:30:06.580" style="s2">fundamentally and and truth in</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.810" end="01:30:08.620" style="s2">particular which i think is what would</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.580" end="01:30:11.440" style="s2">you say well if you want to adapt to</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.620" end="01:30:14.380" style="s2">reality which is kind of what you have</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.440" end="01:30:17.140" style="s2">to do then falsifying it is probably not</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.380" end="01:30:18.370" style="s2">the most effective strategy as far as I</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.140" end="01:30:21.190" style="s2">can tell and it&#39;s certainly the case</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.370" end="01:30:22.870" style="s2">that if you allow yourself to speak bent</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.190" end="01:30:26.860" style="s2">words that you&#39;ll end up with a bent</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.870" end="01:30:28.360" style="s2">character and then God help you so you</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.860" end="01:30:30.030" style="s2">know I talked tonight about what I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.360" end="01:30:33.610" style="s2">are the words that are most dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.030" end="01:30:36.370" style="s2">diversity equity inclusivity white</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.610" end="01:30:38.350" style="s2">privilege so maybe you know the people</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.370" end="01:30:40.930" style="s2">who are watching the videos can think</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.350" end="01:30:42.670" style="s2">about how they might want to orient</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.930" end="01:30:45.100" style="s2">themselves in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.670" end="01:30:46.630" style="s2">mid-level bureaucrats in particular who</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.100" end="01:30:48.340" style="s2">are pushing this sort of thing forward</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.630" end="01:30:53.020" style="s2">with as much force as they can possibly</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.340" end="01:30:56.850" style="s2">manage so we&#39;ll see that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.020" end="01:30:56.850" style="s2">plan at the moment yep</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.910" end="01:31:04.320" style="s2">ha you never know hello</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.679" end="01:31:31.320" style="s2">students like they have today I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.939" end="01:31:34.650" style="s2">talking about people like we could loop</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.320" end="01:31:38.760" style="s2">on the board though they are some of</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.650" end="01:31:44.130" style="s2">them steeped in Marxism they in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.760" end="01:31:46.139" style="s2">sense that though there are power</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.130" end="01:31:48.570" style="s2">hierarchies and structures though</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.139" end="01:31:50.309" style="s2">admittedly not all powerful that do we</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.570" end="01:31:52.949" style="s2">define human interactions that do</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.309" end="01:31:55.170" style="s2">dominate people and that do in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.949" end="01:31:57.539" style="s2">or at least in their words alienate</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.170" end="01:31:58.979" style="s2">people from themselves probably the most</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.539" end="01:32:03.599" style="s2">prominent papers the medium is the</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.979" end="01:32:06.570" style="s2">message production of new technologies</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.599" end="01:32:08.579" style="s2">the technology itself and the content it</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.570" end="01:32:11.010" style="s2">reduces we can think of newspaper</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.579" end="01:32:13.199" style="s2">articles in a newspaper the distribution</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.010" end="01:32:17.429" style="s2">of newspapers is itself content as well</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.199" end="01:32:19.110" style="s2">and how that defines well the first</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.429" end="01:32:21.510" style="s2">thing is is that it&#39;s not particularly</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.110" end="01:32:23.519" style="s2">useful necessarily to conceptualize them</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.510" end="01:32:25.499" style="s2">as power structures because there are</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.519" end="01:32:27.030" style="s2">structures with multiple purposes and</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.499" end="01:32:29.159" style="s2">there are multiple structures and so</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.030" end="01:32:32.909" style="s2">collapsing it to power is a very bad</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.159" end="01:32:34.499" style="s2">idea the second is that we&#39;re in a human</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.909" end="01:32:37.289" style="s2">beings are in a constant state of</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.499" end="01:32:39.329" style="s2">alienation from the world and from what</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.289" end="01:32:41.130" style="s2">they produce it&#39;s that&#39;s what human if</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.329" end="01:32:42.959" style="s2">you had to define human beings that</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.130" end="01:32:44.369" style="s2">would be the definition those creatures</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.959" end="01:32:47.130" style="s2">that are in a constant state of</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.369" end="01:32:49.949" style="s2">alienation from themselves culture and</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.130" end="01:32:51.420" style="s2">the world now why that is exactly I</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.949" end="01:32:52.650" style="s2">don&#39;t know I think it has something to</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.420" end="01:32:54.659" style="s2">do with the fact that we&#39;re self</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.650" end="01:32:57.840" style="s2">conscious but it&#39;s an existential</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.659" end="01:32:59.639" style="s2">reality rather than an indication of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.840" end="01:33:02.219" style="s2">pathology of a given cultural</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.639" end="01:33:03.869" style="s2">construction you know that that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.219" end="01:33:05.849" style="s2">the reasons I really like well Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.869" end="01:33:07.320" style="s2">in part but the existentialist in</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.849" end="01:33:09.749" style="s2">general they just throw that out in</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.320" end="01:33:12.119" style="s2">front of you and say look yes of course</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.749" end="01:33:13.979" style="s2">you have those problems like that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.119" end="01:33:16.650" style="s2">always been that way the ancient</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.979" end="01:33:19.019" style="s2">Egyptians had a God that represented the</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.650" end="01:33:20.489" style="s2">corrupting they&#39;re corrupt the</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.019" end="01:33:22.380" style="s2">corruption of the state and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.489" end="01:33:25.050" style="s2">corrupting influence that produced that</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.380" end="01:33:27.570" style="s2">corruption that was set and set is the</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.050" end="01:33:29.639" style="s2">is set the word set eventually becomes</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.570" end="01:33:32.340" style="s2">the word Satan I mean we&#39;ve known this</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.639" end="01:33:34.199" style="s2">the Mesopotamians knew this they had a</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.340" end="01:33:36.329" style="s2">god Kingu who was the king of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.199" end="01:33:38.820" style="s2">monsters out of whose blood human beings</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.329" end="01:33:40.800" style="s2">were made it&#39;s like the idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.820" end="01:33:41.949" style="s2">a lien ated from what we create it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.800" end="01:33:44.499" style="s2">like yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.949" end="01:33:46.479" style="s2">absolutely that&#39;s true so get up and do</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.499" end="01:33:48.699" style="s2">something about it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.479" end="01:33:51.070" style="s2">not like you&#39;re unique in your</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.699" end="01:33:53.079" style="s2">subjugation to the pathology of culture</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.070" end="01:33:55.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s also not the case that culture</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.079" end="01:33:57.579" style="s2">is only pathological that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.090" end="01:34:00.550" style="s2">thing that&#39;s so that&#39;s so disturbing I</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.579" end="01:34:03.489" style="s2">mean you have glasses on that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.550" end="01:34:05.889" style="s2">thing you don&#39;t bump into walls you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.489" end="01:34:08.079" style="s2">and so and that&#39;s a cultural artifact</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.889" end="01:34:10.150" style="s2">you know and I&#39;d be dead six times over</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.079" end="01:34:13.599" style="s2">if it wasn&#39;t for various medical</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.150" end="01:34:15.130" style="s2">interventions and so you know leavening</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.599" end="01:34:17.170" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re oppressed with a</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.130" end="01:34:18.909" style="s2">little bit of gratitude is a really</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.170" end="01:34:21.130" style="s2">wonderful thing and one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.909" end="01:34:24.429" style="s2">that just staggers me about the the</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.130" end="01:34:26.380" style="s2">radical fringe that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.429" end="01:34:28.030" style="s2">characterized by these ideas that we</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.380" end="01:34:29.949" style="s2">discussed tonight they have absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.030" end="01:34:32.289" style="s2">no gratitude for anything and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.949" end="01:34:34.510" style="s2">really something remarkable you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.289" end="01:34:36.340" style="s2">what Ignatius a human being is</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.510" end="01:34:38.889" style="s2">intolerable unless he has two things</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.340" end="01:34:41.110" style="s2">cleanliness and gratitude well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.889" end="01:34:44.409" style="s2">they manage the first count although not</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.110" end="01:34:46.440" style="s2">always but they certainly sorry about</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.409" end="01:34:46.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.889" end="01:34:54.360" style="s2">but they certainly don&#39;t manage this</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.090" end="01:34:54.360" style="s2">second so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.750" end="01:35:05.730" style="s2">published this morning a letter to the</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.700" end="01:35:08.760" style="s2">editor by a student government the</p>

<p begin="01:43:57.450" end="01:44:00.840" style="s2">like it&#39;s smarter than it sounds which</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.370" end="01:44:02.850" style="s2">is the case with most of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.840" end="01:44:05.850" style="s2">you wrote because it actually does turn</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.850" end="01:44:07.710" style="s2">out that our category systems are not so</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.850" end="01:44:10.410" style="s2">much about subdividing the material</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.710" end="01:44:13.320" style="s2">world into its appropriate entities but</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.410" end="01:44:15.180" style="s2">about carving up our experience in two</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.320" end="01:44:17.070" style="s2">categories of tools and obstacles so</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.180" end="01:44:19.830" style="s2">that we can attain certain valued goals</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.070" end="01:44:21.810" style="s2">and so we&#39;re always directing our action</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.830" end="01:44:23.310" style="s2">towards the attainment of a goal and so</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.810" end="01:44:25.530" style="s2">that means we&#39;re immersed in the value</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.310" end="01:44:27.060" style="s2">structure and so Jung&#39;s point was</p>

<p begin="01:44:27.060" end="01:44:32.100" style="s2">value structure serves the function of</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.940" end="01:44:33.630" style="s2">God now you might have a fragmented</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.100" end="01:44:35.070" style="s2">value structure which means in some</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.630" end="01:44:37.140" style="s2">sense that you&#39;re psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.070" end="01:44:39.000" style="s2">polytheistic and the problem with that</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.140" end="01:44:40.680" style="s2">is that then you&#39;re a house divided</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.000" end="01:44:42.050" style="s2">amongst itself you&#39;re pulling in</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.680" end="01:44:44.370" style="s2">multiple directions simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.050" end="01:44:46.530" style="s2">impulsive people are like that right and</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.370" end="01:44:48.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand themselves because</p>

<p begin="01:44:48.000" end="01:44:51.770" style="s2">they go right and you know they they</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.590" end="01:44:54.330" style="s2">have no control over themselves at all</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.770" end="01:44:57.230" style="s2">now you said well there&#39;s no objective</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.330" end="01:45:00.630" style="s2">God and that seems to be a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.230" end="01:45:02.250" style="s2">hypothesis the question then I suppose</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.630" end="01:45:04.350" style="s2">becomes to what degree our subjective</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.250" end="01:45:05.280" style="s2">experience is real and that&#39;s a matter</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.350" end="01:45:08.850" style="s2">of definition</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.280" end="01:45:11.010" style="s2">I think the religious impulse is an</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.850" end="01:45:13.080" style="s2">inevitable consequence of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.010" end="01:45:15.480" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary for people to live inside</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.080" end="01:45:19.620" style="s2">hierarchies of value and that we feel a</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.480" end="01:45:21.870" style="s2">sense of awe the sense of all we feel</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.620" end="01:45:24.540" style="s2">with regards to the highest values is no</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.870" end="01:45:27.600" style="s2">not distinguishable from the existence</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.540" end="01:45:30.210" style="s2">of the value itself now and there&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.600" end="01:45:32.070" style="s2">advantages to the idea of a detached God</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.210" end="01:45:34.260" style="s2">in some sense and one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.070" end="01:45:37.830" style="s2">learned about archaic concepts of</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.260" end="01:45:41.280" style="s2">sovereignty is that detaching the idea</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.830" end="01:45:44.220" style="s2">of ethical of ethics itself and ethical</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.280" end="01:45:45.780" style="s2">power from the holder of power is an</p>

<p begin="01:45:52.320" end="01:45:59.250" style="s2">if the idea of power and sovereignty is</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.960" end="01:46:01.020" style="s2">detached from the individual and set up</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.250" end="01:46:04.350" style="s2">as a higher virtue that even the</p>

<p begin="01:46:09.120" end="01:46:13.200" style="s2">absolute and you can think about that</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.250" end="01:46:15.390" style="s2">just as a development of humans capacity</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.200" end="01:46:17.250" style="s2">to abstract right we can abstract the</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.390" end="01:46:19.860" style="s2">idea of sovereignty we can abstract the</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.250" end="01:46:22.440" style="s2">idea of ethics in virtue we can we can</p>

<p begin="01:46:22.440" end="01:46:26.160" style="s2">embody it as a personality it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.720" end="01:46:28.380" style="s2">quite useful because it&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.160" end="01:46:31.860" style="s2">have to act out now you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.380" end="01:46:34.380" style="s2">what relationship does that have to you</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.860" end="01:46:36.360" style="s2">know to the existence of something</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.380" end="01:46:38.160" style="s2">transcendent in the religious sense</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.360" end="01:46:40.290" style="s2">outside of that abstract</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.160" end="01:46:43.410" style="s2">conceptualization and the answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.290" end="01:46:45.930" style="s2">is we don&#39;t know if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.410" end="01:46:48.180" style="s2">familiarize yourself with the writings</p>

<p begin="01:47:00.480" end="01:47:05.460" style="s2">proof depends on how you define proof so</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.450" end="01:47:08.220" style="s2">I&#39;m not making a case for it one way or</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.460" end="01:47:09.810" style="s2">another but I mean Jung himself I mean</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.220" end="01:47:11.610" style="s2">when he talked about god when he was</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.810" end="01:47:14.010" style="s2">being careful he didn&#39;t talk about god</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.610" end="01:47:18.360" style="s2">he talked about the god image in man and</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.010" end="01:47:20.160" style="s2">he was careful never to formally state</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.360" end="01:47:22.500" style="s2">that the fact that there&#39;s an image of</p>

<p begin="01:47:22.500" end="01:47:28.470" style="s2">archetype that that provided concrete</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.350" end="01:47:30.780" style="s2">proof that such an ideal existed you</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.470" end="01:47:32.250" style="s2">know in some transcendent manner but the</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.780" end="01:47:34.710" style="s2">world is a weird place and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.250" end="01:47:36.930" style="s2">something I would rule out so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.710" end="01:47:39.450" style="s2">like we understand the world very well</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.930" end="01:47:43.170" style="s2">and the materialists you know they try</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.450" end="01:47:44.670" style="s2">to they try to encapsulate the entire</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.170" end="01:47:46.980" style="s2">world within the materialist philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.670" end="01:47:51.690" style="s2">and like more power to them it&#39;s been an</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.980" end="01:47:53.160" style="s2">unbelievably successful tool but we</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.690" end="01:47:53.670" style="s2">haven&#39;t cracked consciousness in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.160" end="01:47:55.230" style="s2">lead</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.670" end="01:47:57.570" style="s2">and there is something about</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.230" end="01:47:59.460" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s world creating and</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.570" end="01:48:01.139" style="s2">there&#39;s something transcendent about</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.460" end="01:48:03.989" style="s2">consciousness and it also seems capable</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.139" end="01:48:05.699" style="s2">of a kind of infinite expansion and it</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.989" end="01:48:12.590" style="s2">isn&#39;t obvious why any of that is the</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.699" end="01:48:17.570" style="s2">case not obvious at all so yep</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.590" end="01:48:17.570" style="s2">hello okay</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.179" end="01:48:32.409" style="s2">before they were writing this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.320" end="01:48:41.850" style="s2">criticizing Marxism itself and</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.210" end="01:48:56.130" style="s2">those ideas to get right</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.260" end="01:49:10.040" style="s2">post-modernism is serving objective</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.310" end="01:49:13.040" style="s2">realities so I mean what do you make</p>

<p begin="01:49:20.960" end="01:49:25.290" style="s2">well okay so two things I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.580" end="01:49:27.630" style="s2">been a number of attempts to revise</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.290" end="01:49:29.610" style="s2">Marxist theory right and so you pointed</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.630" end="01:49:31.770" style="s2">to one that&#39;s the cultural theorists and</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.610" end="01:49:34.710" style="s2">that was after World War two when it</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.770" end="01:49:37.530" style="s2">became painfully obvious at least to the</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.710" end="01:49:39.180" style="s2">first round of people who were oriented</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.530" end="01:49:40.200" style="s2">towards the radical left but opened</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.180" end="01:49:42.300" style="s2">their eyes that there was something</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.200" end="01:49:46.490" style="s2">rotten in the state of the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.300" end="01:49:49.350" style="s2">and so they did they did their best to</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.490" end="01:49:51.330" style="s2">revamp the central doctrines of Marxism</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.350" end="01:49:53.310" style="s2">using Freudian theory and so forth and</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.330" end="01:49:55.680" style="s2">as you said they were very influential</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.310" end="01:49:57.360" style="s2">among the student radicals of the 60s</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.680" end="01:49:59.550" style="s2">and it was them that gave birth to the</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.360" end="01:50:02.400" style="s2">modern crop of say postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.550" end="01:50:04.290" style="s2">neo-marxists i think that you know i</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.400" end="01:50:06.420" style="s2">couldn&#39;t cover all of that obviously in</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.290" end="01:50:08.450" style="s2">one lecture but your your point is</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.420" end="01:50:10.530" style="s2">well-taken</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.450" end="01:50:13.890" style="s2">now you yet you ended that with a</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.530" end="01:50:17.720" style="s2">different question so but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.890" end="01:50:17.720" style="s2">remember exactly what that question was</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.140" end="01:50:28.730" style="s2">oh yes well look I mean look the</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.210" end="01:50:30.170" style="s2">ultimate minority is the individual and</p>

<p begin="01:50:32.780" end="01:50:38.720" style="s2">of the mob so that&#39;s true is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.140" end="01:50:41.210" style="s2">very frequently the case that truth is</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.720" end="01:50:44.750" style="s2">held by something outside the general</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.210" end="01:50:46.610" style="s2">consensus now falsehood is - right so I</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.750" end="01:50:48.830" style="s2">mean if you if you have a structure</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.610" end="01:50:50.150" style="s2">that&#39;s reasonably functional you like a</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.830" end="01:50:52.100" style="s2">little walled city and you have a</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.150" end="01:50:54.830" style="s2">hundred people outside yelling about how</p>

<p begin="01:50:54.830" end="01:50:59.780" style="s2">it worse and one of them has something</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.440" end="01:51:02.030" style="s2">useful to say and so you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.780" end="01:51:04.880" style="s2">dispense with the minority so to speak</p>

<p begin="01:51:06.340" end="01:51:11.990" style="s2">because the one person in the minority</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.900" end="01:51:14.570" style="s2">who isn&#39;t wrong is absolutely vital and</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.990" end="01:51:16.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the tension that&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.570" end="01:51:18.920" style="s2">tension between the group that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.370" end="01:51:21.260" style="s2">the mythological hero really has two</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.920" end="01:51:23.000" style="s2">roles one is to go out and conquer the</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.260" end="01:51:24.950" style="s2">dragon of darkness and to gather</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.000" end="01:51:26.750" style="s2">information and to disseminate it but</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.950" end="01:51:29.090" style="s2">the second role which is equally</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.750" end="01:51:30.860" style="s2">important is to stand up against the</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.090" end="01:51:32.840" style="s2">corrupt culture which is what Horace</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.860" end="01:51:35.840" style="s2">does for example in the ancient Egyptian</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.840" end="01:51:38.000" style="s2">stories demolish what&#39;s what&#39;s corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.840" end="01:51:41.450" style="s2">and then rebuild something in it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.000" end="01:51:43.310" style="s2">it&#39;s in it&#39;s in the aftermath you do</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.450" end="01:51:45.200" style="s2">that psychologically - you know because</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.310" end="01:51:48.080" style="s2">you have an interpretive structure</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.200" end="01:51:49.580" style="s2">through which you view the world and now</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.080" end="01:51:52.760" style="s2">and then you run into something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.580" end="01:51:55.880" style="s2">like a minority a fact that doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.760" end="01:51:57.920" style="s2">and but it&#39;s but it&#39;s actually a fact it</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.880" end="01:52:01.370" style="s2">indicates that part of you needs to die</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.920" end="01:52:03.560" style="s2">and come encounter chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.370" end="01:52:05.450" style="s2">reconstitute yourself and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.560" end="01:52:06.980" style="s2">there is this dynamism between the group</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.450" end="01:52:11.210" style="s2">and the individual and also why the</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.980" end="01:52:14.060" style="s2">individual is held in the West to be a</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.210" end="01:52:16.610" style="s2">power let&#39;s say that&#39;s super ordinate to</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.060" end="01:52:18.290" style="s2">the state the state has to recognize the</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.610" end="01:52:20.300" style="s2">validity of the individual because the</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.290" end="01:52:23.090" style="s2">individual does in the final analysis</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.300" end="01:52:25.100" style="s2">hold the redemptive truth but to put</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.090" end="01:52:27.380" style="s2">that in minority groups that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.100" end="01:52:30.170" style="s2">different issue that&#39;s a sleight of hand</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.380" end="01:52:32.760" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned so</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.170" end="01:52:34.970" style="s2">all right all right well thank you very</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.760" end="01:52:34.970" style="s2">much</p>
