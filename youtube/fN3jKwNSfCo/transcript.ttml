<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:06.140" style="s2">all right so here I would like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.530" end="00:00:08.400" style="s2">about is uh unintended consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.140" end="00:00:11.730" style="s2">policies in the way that we actually set</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.400" end="00:00:14.389" style="s2">up our social systems and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.730" end="00:00:17.699" style="s2">I want to focus on the the notion of how</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.389" end="00:00:19.560" style="s2">our homes shifted from being homes</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.699" end="00:00:22.439" style="s2">shelter places where we live and raise</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.560" end="00:00:26.130" style="s2">our families to assets and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.439" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">they&#39;re on their way back and for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:29.250" style="s2">purposes of this particular video I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">simply going to assume that everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.250" end="00:00:33.899" style="s2">I&#39;m going to report on is an unintended</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">consequence to the degree to which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.899" end="00:00:38.219" style="s2">an intended consequence of somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">actions it may very well be but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">care all right so I&#39;m going to fast</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:46.410" style="s2">forward through the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">Federal Reserve but the key insight here</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.410" end="00:00:50.129" style="s2">is that the Federal Reserve the way or</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:52.469" style="s2">at least one of the principal ways that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.129" end="00:00:57.180" style="s2">it tries to manage or modulate the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.469" end="00:00:59.820" style="s2">economy is through interest rates and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.180" end="00:01:01.109" style="s2">the way that it modulates the economy</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.820" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">through interest rates is that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.109" end="00:01:04.979" style="s2">changes the rate at which banks can</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.409" end="00:01:08.070" style="s2">borrow money</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.979" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">I&#39;m simplified but I&#39;d have to get this</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:12.420" style="s2">in place to kind of get to the next</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">piece which makes it possible to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.420" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">more money coming to the economy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">when banks can bring more money into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">economy there&#39;s more economic activity</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">that could happen that they can fuel but</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing banks don&#39;t have direct</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">access to the real economy right banks</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">don&#39;t buy widgets and they don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">cars thanks loan money to people who do</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">that kind of stuff so when the Federal</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">Reserve is trying to increase activity</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">in the economy by lowering interest</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:41.400" style="s2">rates what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">pushing on banks to be able to produce</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.400" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">more debt in the economy to get more to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">make more loans alright fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">let&#39;s just I don&#39;t I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:51.000" style="s2">critique that just yet we&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:53.930" style="s2">to talk about the unintended</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:01:57.930" style="s2">consequences of that particular approach</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.930" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">so when you look at the debt market the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.930" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">bond market in the economy the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">piece by far is US Treasuries but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">gonna rule that out because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">productive well I mean in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:12.209" style="s2">maybe it finances government activity</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">but I mean you can or that entirely you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.209" end="00:02:16.269" style="s2">know the two big chunks are</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:18.129" style="s2">our corporate and mortgage in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.269" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">mortgages is the bigger of those two so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.129" end="00:02:23.200" style="s2">home loans alright so when the when the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:24.639" style="s2">Fed is trying to get money into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.200" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">economy and it&#39;s telling banks ok money</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.639" end="00:02:29.049" style="s2">is cheaper for you to make available</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:31.750" style="s2">loan money out into the market you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.049" end="00:02:33.700" style="s2">mark it up a bit and let it back out one</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.750" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">of the biggest funnels that they can put</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.700" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">that money into is in home loans so they</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:41.169" style="s2">do right because there&#39;s only so many</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.489" style="s2">bankers and they can only cut so many</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.169" end="00:02:44.109" style="s2">deals and they can&#39;t you know they just</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.489" end="00:02:45.579" style="s2">have to be able to figure out what are</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.109" end="00:02:47.049" style="s2">the biggest chunks of the economy that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.579" end="00:02:48.219" style="s2">they could actually modify and interact</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.049" end="00:02:49.989" style="s2">with by the way in the corporate side</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.219" end="00:02:53.530" style="s2">this will typically show up and things</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.989" end="00:02:55.810" style="s2">like large structured finance for MBA</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.530" end="00:02:57.069" style="s2">for buyouts and acquisitions which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.810" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">one of the reasons why another</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.069" end="00:03:01.419" style="s2">unintended consequences consolidation</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:03.639" style="s2">it&#39;s just easier to write a billion</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.419" end="00:03:04.900" style="s2">dollar check to get a big company to buy</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.639" end="00:03:07.689" style="s2">another big company that is to try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.900" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">write like a billion one dollar checks</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.689" end="00:03:11.019" style="s2">to a whole bunch of guys who are trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:13.150" style="s2">to start up their own pizzas dance okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.019" end="00:03:17.049" style="s2">so mortgages so now you have this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.150" end="00:03:21.400" style="s2">notion and a need to move money into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.049" end="00:03:23.409" style="s2">economy by promoting mortgages which of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.400" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">course is about basically getting one</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.409" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">agent a person a home buyer to be able</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:29.470" style="s2">to be financed to be able to buy a home</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:31.569" style="s2">which of course then puts money in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.470" end="00:03:33.549" style="s2">hands of the home seller but then in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.569" end="00:03:34.870" style="s2">principle at least rejects it back to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.549" end="00:03:37.540" style="s2">the economy in some fashion although of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.870" end="00:03:38.439" style="s2">course many of them buy new houses which</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.540" end="00:03:40.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.439" end="00:03:42.459" style="s2">impact on the real economy but a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.930" end="00:03:44.590" style="s2">characteristic of this is that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.459" end="00:03:46.540" style="s2">increases the price of homes you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.590" end="00:03:48.729" style="s2">this process where the need to inject</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.540" end="00:03:50.979" style="s2">money into the Riesz economy has as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.729" end="00:03:53.379" style="s2">consequence that it causes there to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.979" end="00:03:55.750" style="s2">more money chasing after what is more</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.379" end="00:03:57.629" style="s2">less relatively inflexible supply of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.750" end="00:03:59.500" style="s2">homes I&#39;m not always obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.629" end="00:04:01.719" style="s2">construction can happen it does happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.500" end="00:04:05.650" style="s2">for sure but it tends to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.719" end="00:04:08.409" style="s2">price of homes okay so here&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.650" end="00:04:10.629" style="s2">piece when you&#39;ve got a long enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.409" end="00:04:13.269" style="s2">period of time where that policy has</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.629" end="00:04:16.329" style="s2">been in place that the price of homes</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.269" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">has a very standard characteristic of up</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.329" end="00:04:19.810" style="s2">and to the right which is just say it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">becomes part of the zeitgeist part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.810" end="00:04:27.070" style="s2">the the unassuming assumptions that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:29.410" style="s2">mortgage prices</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.070" end="00:04:31.540" style="s2">relatively stable and slightly accretive</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.410" end="00:04:34.090" style="s2">because we&#39;ve actually been creating an</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.540" end="00:04:36.280" style="s2">artificial vector of driving pressure</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.090" end="00:04:39.580" style="s2">because that&#39;s a vector that we have for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.280" end="00:04:41.740" style="s2">putting money into the economy then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.580" end="00:04:44.380" style="s2">get a secondary consequence which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.740" end="00:04:46.750" style="s2">that mortgages in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.380" end="00:04:49.510" style="s2">mortgage-backed securities begin to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:51.100" style="s2">taken as relatively risk-free you begin</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.510" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">to assume that this condition that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.100" end="00:04:53.590" style="s2">you&#39;ve been seeing for a long period of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:55.210" style="s2">time is a natural condition of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.590" end="00:04:57.190" style="s2">universe and think it&#39;s a solid</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.210" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">foundation when in fact to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.190" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s an artifact of an unintended</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:05.470" style="s2">consequence of one of our mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:06.580" style="s2">managing the economy of the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.470" end="00:05:08.470" style="s2">design that wreck the Fed had been</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.580" end="00:05:09.970" style="s2">designed a different way if the Fed then</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.470" end="00:05:12.010" style="s2">had the ability to say for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.970" end="00:05:13.870" style="s2">deliver a ubi directly to people as</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.010" end="00:05:15.580" style="s2">opposed to trying to moderate things</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.870" end="00:05:17.230" style="s2">through banks then we have a different</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.580" end="00:05:20.680" style="s2">set of unintended consequences but not</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.230" end="00:05:22.390" style="s2">that one it&#39;s a little bit more esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.680" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look at two forks on this</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.390" end="00:05:28.540" style="s2">road as mortgages in particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:31.990" style="s2">mortgage-backed securities become seen</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.540" end="00:05:34.090" style="s2">as relatively risk-free they also then</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.990" end="00:05:35.380" style="s2">become really high-quality collateral so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.090" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">if I&#39;m trying to engage in large</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.380" end="00:05:39.130" style="s2">transactions one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:41.410" style="s2">might do is I might hold mortgage-backed</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.130" end="00:05:42.910" style="s2">securities and then I will use them as</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.410" end="00:05:44.890" style="s2">collateral so I get debt leverage right</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.910" end="00:05:47.140" style="s2">if I&#39;ve got a million dollars of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.890" end="00:05:48.580" style="s2">mortgage securities and I go to the bank</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.140" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">and say had like a loan backed by this</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.580" end="00:05:52.360" style="s2">as collateral they might say great I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:54.340" style="s2">give you 3 million for that that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.360" end="00:05:56.710" style="s2">collateral so now I&#39;ve got 3 million to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.340" end="00:05:58.060" style="s2">work with and of course in particular if</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.710" end="00:06:01.960" style="s2">I use that 3 million to go out and buy</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.060" end="00:06:03.760" style="s2">more property then that actually becomes</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.960" end="00:06:05.740" style="s2">an asset that I could bring pump back in</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.760" end="00:06:08.710" style="s2">as collateral so I get a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.740" end="00:06:11.370" style="s2">where the ability to take this asset as</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.710" end="00:06:13.450" style="s2">a super high quality low risk asset</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.370" end="00:06:15.670" style="s2">creates a capacity to actually generate</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.450" end="00:06:17.320" style="s2">more leverage which actually by the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.670" end="00:06:18.730" style="s2">injects more risk into the system but</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.320" end="00:06:20.530" style="s2">it&#39;s risky you don&#39;t see because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.730" end="00:06:22.090" style="s2">tapped to that asset and this is of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.530" end="00:06:24.780" style="s2">course the story of the movie the big</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.090" end="00:06:27.370" style="s2">short we saw that happen in 2006 where</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.780" end="00:06:28.660" style="s2">mortgage prices kept going up because</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.370" end="00:06:30.970" style="s2">more money was pumped into the system</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.660" end="00:06:32.650" style="s2">originally it was the Fed and lending</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.970" end="00:06:34.510" style="s2">rates but then it actually was the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.650" end="00:06:38.230" style="s2">that because mortgages were seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.510" end="00:06:39.400" style="s2">solid collateral debt was leveraged was</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.230" end="00:06:40.700" style="s2">generated but that leverage was then</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.400" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">pumped back into the system</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.700" end="00:06:43.760" style="s2">of course if I have three million</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:45.170" style="s2">dollars and used that 30min dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.760" end="00:06:47.930" style="s2">go out and buy more property then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.170" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">price of property goes up which to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.930" end="00:06:51.290" style="s2">extent means the value of my collateral</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:52.700" style="s2">just went up certainly I can mark it</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.290" end="00:06:53.870" style="s2">that way I used to have a million</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.700" end="00:06:55.760" style="s2">dollars with a property but now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.870" end="00:06:57.260" style="s2">worth fifteen one point five million</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.760" end="00:06:58.700" style="s2">because the price of properties going up</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.260" end="00:07:00.920" style="s2">guys come on my collateral is worth more</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.700" end="00:07:02.300" style="s2">so now I can borrow more so I can vest</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.920" end="00:07:03.530" style="s2">more so now I can borrow more when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.300" end="00:07:05.540" style="s2">get a feedback loop where this happens</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.530" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">and this in fact actually did happen so</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.540" end="00:07:10.970" style="s2">that&#39;s one secondary consequence so</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:12.110" style="s2">let&#39;s now go to a tertiary consequence</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.970" end="00:07:14.120" style="s2">and I&#39;ll actually slide sideways after</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.110" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">this to a kind of a fun ancillary</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.120" end="00:07:19.370" style="s2">tertiary consequence now in this context</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:21.920" style="s2">we&#39;re having this feedback loop where</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.370" end="00:07:23.600" style="s2">prices are going up in lending rates and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.920" end="00:07:25.250" style="s2">leverage is being used then you get a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.600" end="00:07:28.100" style="s2">competitive landscape because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.250" end="00:07:29.270" style="s2">bankers are competing to write loans</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.100" end="00:07:30.950" style="s2">like that&#39;s what they do that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.270" end="00:07:33.080" style="s2">that&#39;s their their product right just</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.950" end="00:07:35.750" style="s2">like cell phone manufacturers compete to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.080" end="00:07:38.060" style="s2">cell phones banks compete to sell loans</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.750" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">and where there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.060" end="00:07:42.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a limited supply like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:45.470" style="s2">lot of money that wants to get into</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.920" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">selling to writing loans that would</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.470" end="00:07:48.710" style="s2">happen since they have to make better</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:50.510" style="s2">terms and that a better term might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.710" end="00:07:52.430" style="s2">for example giving more leverage to less</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.510" end="00:07:53.690" style="s2">collateral so instead of getting three</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.430" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">million dollars per billion dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.690" end="00:08:00.260" style="s2">collateral maybe I get four or five or</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:08:01.940" style="s2">ten right and at the peak of the 2006</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.260" end="00:08:03.230" style="s2">financial bubble leverage was starting</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.940" end="00:08:05.390" style="s2">to go through the roof right because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.230" end="00:08:08.690" style="s2">more promiscuous bankers that ones who</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.390" end="00:08:11.810" style="s2">are willing to write the fastest hottest</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.690" end="00:08:12.890" style="s2">cheapest loans got more business and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.810" end="00:08:14.300" style="s2">they made more money because of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.890" end="00:08:16.220" style="s2">they don&#39;t make their money on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.300" end="00:08:17.480" style="s2">particularly mortgage brokers to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.220" end="00:08:18.770" style="s2">their money on the return of the loans</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.480" end="00:08:20.060" style="s2">they make their money on the cutting of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.770" end="00:08:21.200" style="s2">the loan the selling of the look but</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.060" end="00:08:23.770" style="s2">they just flip it and sell to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.200" end="00:08:25.880" style="s2">else who packages it into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.770" end="00:08:28.010" style="s2">mortgage-backed security or to some</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.880" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">other kind of object so you create an</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.010" end="00:08:32.900" style="s2">economic system where there&#39;s a moral</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:34.760" style="s2">hazard I believe is the term let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.900" end="00:08:36.050" style="s2">call it promiscuity become selected for</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.760" end="00:08:38.840" style="s2">now of course that doesn&#39;t creates an</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.050" end="00:08:40.970" style="s2">accelerated price of the asset cuz</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.840" end="00:08:43.099" style="s2">there&#39;s just more money chasing what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.970" end="00:08:44.660" style="s2">now a very hard strapped supply you</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.099" end="00:08:45.860" style="s2">could try to you know cranes everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.660" end="00:08:47.060" style="s2">trying to build buildings but they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.860" end="00:08:50.150" style="s2">keep up with the velocity of money cuz</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.060" end="00:08:51.560" style="s2">finance moves fast okay so so then we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.150" end="00:08:53.270" style="s2">is you get this rapidly accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.560" end="00:08:54.440" style="s2">thing until something breaks at the top</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.270" end="00:08:56.120" style="s2">some small per</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.440" end="00:08:57.590" style="s2">Meishan becomes more fragile more</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.590" end="00:09:02.150" style="s2">because it&#39;s way out of her skis in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.270" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">terms of leverage and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.150" end="00:09:06.710" style="s2">somewhere some small shift in price goes</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:08.750" style="s2">down somebody is you know misses a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.710" end="00:09:10.310" style="s2">payment there&#39;s bankruptcy the you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.750" end="00:09:12.200" style="s2">but in the case of 2006 the lending</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.310" end="00:09:13.640" style="s2">terms just got so crazy that just</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.200" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">couldn&#39;t make any sense and something</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.640" end="00:09:18.260" style="s2">you know small contraction the economy</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:20.150" style="s2">cascades down and hits this thing but</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.260" end="00:09:22.280" style="s2">then you have the type of fragile the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.150" end="00:09:23.690" style="s2">most promiscuous lenders are also the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.280" end="00:09:25.100" style="s2">most vulnerable leverage their way out</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.690" end="00:09:26.840" style="s2">over their skis and then borrowers are</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.100" end="00:09:28.430" style="s2">the most way over their skis so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.840" end="00:09:30.260" style="s2">gonna tend to one leverage and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.430" end="00:09:32.500" style="s2">the value of my asset base just went</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.260" end="00:09:34.370" style="s2">down market the value of security of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.500" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">mortgage-backed securities to went down</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.370" end="00:09:37.490" style="s2">a little tiny bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">well my collateral just got worth less</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.490" end="00:09:42.110" style="s2">so now I&#39;m under collateralized so now I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.370" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">have to sell some of my real asset</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.110" end="00:09:46.340" style="s2">getting enough collateral will shoot</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:47.990" style="s2">with that price prices down at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.340" end="00:09:48.350" style="s2">margin just maybe like a tenth of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.990" end="00:09:49.580" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.350" end="00:09:51.290" style="s2">but now when this thing is to have a</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.290" end="00:09:54.200" style="s2">tenth of a point makes a difference that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.520" end="00:09:55.970" style="s2">cascades down alright so that same</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.200" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">steepness of a cent becomes a steep as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.970" end="00:10:00.380" style="s2">descent so a tertiary unintended</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:01.700" style="s2">consequence you actually create vastly</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.380" end="00:10:03.350" style="s2">more volatile markets that have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.700" end="00:10:05.780" style="s2">characteristic of prices going way up</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.350" end="00:10:09.020" style="s2">and then having huge crashes when they</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.780" end="00:10:11.540" style="s2">fall let me slide sideways a bit because</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.020" end="00:10:13.820" style="s2">it&#39;s also very important because in this</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.740" end="00:10:20.330" style="s2">sitting on becomes financialized it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.770" end="00:10:21.560" style="s2">becomes an object of securities and</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.610" end="00:10:30.140" style="s2">home it shifts from a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.830" end="00:10:31.310" style="s2">satisfies human needs a place that rain</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.130" end="00:10:39.380" style="s2">financial object and that means people</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.790" end="00:10:41.060" style="s2">begin to think of it as a financial</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.380" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">object it&#39;s called wealth effects right</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.060" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">if I can get people&#39;s homes to be more</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:46.010" style="s2">valuable they feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:47.570" style="s2">wealthier which means by the way they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.010" end="00:10:49.460" style="s2">be willing to spend more money if I feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.570" end="00:10:50.870" style="s2">rich I&#39;m less worried about what how</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.460" end="00:10:54.020" style="s2">much cash I have in the bank because</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.870" end="00:10:55.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a $500,000 home I&#39;m rich so</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.020" end="00:10:56.990" style="s2">fine I&#39;ll spend more money so we saw</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.820" end="00:10:59.180" style="s2">that we saw this notion of the wealth</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.990" end="00:11:01.400" style="s2">effects and was interesting is that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.180" end="00:11:02.690" style="s2">not only we first noticed it then we</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.400" end="00:11:03.500" style="s2">took advantage of it then we got</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.690" end="00:11:04.760" style="s2">addicted to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.500" end="00:11:06.290" style="s2">we actually had to get people feeling</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.760" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">more and more wealthy to keep that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.290" end="00:11:09.149" style="s2">wealth effect</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.470" style="s2">to keep the flow of money going and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.149" end="00:11:12.149" style="s2">then you get another negative feedback</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.149" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">go down not only do you start getting</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:19.889" style="s2">but also the wealth effect you become so</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.060" end="00:11:21.510" style="s2">addicted to starts to evaporate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.889" end="00:11:23.399" style="s2">velocity of money collapses people like</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.510" end="00:11:25.350" style="s2">oh I&#39;m not rich anymore oh and I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.459" end="00:11:33.269" style="s2">another one</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.970" end="00:11:36.630" style="s2">this other one&#39;s kind of funky so let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.310" end="00:11:45.449" style="s2">a new testing infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.990" end="00:11:47.639" style="s2">actually much more accurately evaluates</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.449" end="00:11:49.260" style="s2">the quality of education in an</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.639" end="00:11:51.870" style="s2">environment how well people have learned</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.730" end="00:12:08.699" style="s2">students would be smarter more capable</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.290" end="00:12:10.519" style="s2">or more effective contributors to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.699" end="00:12:12.779" style="s2">society your tests will be more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.519" end="00:12:14.370" style="s2">now like that sounds awesome so then</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.779" end="00:12:15.810" style="s2">start talking about in the community and</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.750" end="00:12:27.959" style="s2">they&#39;re useless our testing</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.130" end="00:12:31.019" style="s2">infrastructure is a lot better they go</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.959" end="00:12:33.540" style="s2">yeah but here&#39;s the thing real estate</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.019" end="00:12:35.430" style="s2">prices have a significant direct</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.540" end="00:12:36.630" style="s2">connection to test scores if I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.430" end="00:12:39.029" style="s2">two neighborhoods that are roughly</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.630" end="00:12:40.860" style="s2">equivalent in everything except for they</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.029" end="00:12:42.630" style="s2">they broadcast their local schools</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.860" end="00:12:45.000" style="s2">broadcast different qualities of test</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.630" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">scores then the one that has higher test</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.000" end="00:12:49.410" style="s2">scores has higher prices more wealth the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:50.790" style="s2">prices the houses are worth more it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.410" end="00:12:53.250" style="s2">better neighborhood because of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.790" end="00:12:55.079" style="s2">metric and guess what you find really</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.250" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">quick nobody&#39;s interested in buying your</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.079" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">new technology so a technology in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:01.380" style="s2">educational domain that should actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:03.480" style="s2">by hypothesis at least radically upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.380" end="00:13:06.060" style="s2">the quality of education can&#39;t gets</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.480" end="00:13:08.370" style="s2">accepted because we&#39;ve been trained our</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.060" end="00:13:09.810" style="s2">testing methodology to our home value</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.370" end="00:13:12.149" style="s2">methodology and our whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.810" end="00:13:13.260" style="s2">economy is now built on home values so</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.149" end="00:13:14.730" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean just like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.260" end="00:13:16.500" style="s2">homeowners will get pissed if the home</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.730" end="00:13:19.430" style="s2">prices go down the entire economy</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.500" end="00:13:21.350" style="s2">collapses because we&#39;re so premise don</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.430" end="00:13:24.140" style="s2">home prices being stable they always</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.350" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">going up you know if we have a small</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.140" end="00:13:27.890" style="s2">shift in the price of homes the lending</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:29.540" style="s2">market collapses because they become</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.890" end="00:13:31.280" style="s2">hyper fragile the wealth effect Goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.540" end="00:13:34.340" style="s2">Down and so the economy begins to shrink</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.280" end="00:13:36.200" style="s2">and that collapses so this crazy Kuantan</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.340" end="00:13:37.970" style="s2">area effect you might call it of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.200" end="00:13:39.620" style="s2">fact that we designed our system so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.970" end="00:13:42.050" style="s2">Federal Reserve tries to modify the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.620" end="00:13:45.530" style="s2">economy by reducing interest rates which</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.050" end="00:13:47.720" style="s2">increases the or induces banks to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.530" end="00:13:49.370" style="s2">more able and willing to loan money at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.720" end="00:13:51.260" style="s2">cheaper price which causes more pressure</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.370" end="00:13:53.390" style="s2">to push money in we only have a small</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.260" end="00:13:55.190" style="s2">number of large valves corporate</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.390" end="00:13:57.530" style="s2">securities and mortgage securities to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.190" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">drop money into which increases the</p>
