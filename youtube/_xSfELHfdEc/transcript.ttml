<p begin="00:00:30.090" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2">could go and explore outside of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.650" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">then spend 10 to 15 minutes talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.260" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">about a potential future an omni win</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.270" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">our juices flowing of like this is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.070" end="00:00:51.690" style="s2">could happen if humanity work together</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.899" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">and and then spending half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.690" end="00:00:56.789" style="s2">discussing something that we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">actually do right now if we had 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.789" end="00:01:02.190" style="s2">people at $100,000 something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require coercion or force or</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.190" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">government involvement just those 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:09.390" style="s2">people creating a solution for</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">themselves and yeah so that&#39;s what and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.390" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">then the other thing I wanted to say is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">that let&#39;s have fun because we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">to come up with a solution to education</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:22.830" style="s2">an hour that&#39;s a little ridiculous let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">just know that and that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.830" end="00:01:26.070" style="s2">short time period for each of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.390" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">topics not everyone&#39;s gonna get to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.070" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">what they want it&#39;s more about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">conversation itself emerging allowing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">to to happen what is what is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">happen during this hour that would never</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">happen as individuals coming up with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">solution and so if anyone would like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:48.390" style="s2">start sharing for 30 seconds a minute</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">two minutes what they think education</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.390" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">currently is I don&#39;t mind going I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">brought a fair bit to this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">anyway I mean doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not happy</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">to let things emerge right but I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">already brought a fair bit to this I</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:00.649" style="s2">assume</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">to me it seems pretty straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.649" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">that the education system the model for</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">the education system we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">is simply out-of-date right I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:11.009" style="s2">may have been a good thing 150 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">when you were training factory workers</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.009" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">but you know given the rapidly changing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">circle</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:18.330" style="s2">senses an environment in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:20.280" style="s2">expect to be living for the future you</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.330" end="00:02:22.730" style="s2">know training content and then the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.280" end="00:02:26.489" style="s2">ability to regurgitate content is simply</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.730" end="00:02:28.290" style="s2">not fit for purpose and so it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.489" end="00:02:30.659" style="s2">me that&#39;s pretty much what education is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:32.129" style="s2">anything exploratory the arts at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.659" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">emphasized because you can&#39;t easily</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.129" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">assess and measure outcomes in these</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">types of things the willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:40.650" style="s2">experiment is all but vanished from</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">schools there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.650" end="00:02:44.730" style="s2">atmosphere of fear particularly fear of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:46.950" style="s2">failure but fear in general you know of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.730" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">what you know what if I do something</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">wrong what if I get something wrong what</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:53.480" style="s2">if I make a mistake you know this kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">of thing pervades the entire fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.480" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">education I mean that&#39;s my experience I</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:03:00.659" style="s2">was a teacher so I have some I have some</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:02.549" style="s2">personal hands-on feet on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.659" end="00:03:04.470" style="s2">kind of experience in this and so it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.549" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">seems to me that essentially the entire</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.470" end="00:03:12.390" style="s2">thing needs to be thrown out and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:14.310" style="s2">something entirely new built I I say</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.390" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">from the bottom up I mean Jubilee and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.310" end="00:03:17.639" style="s2">actually had discussion along these</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">lines not very long ago and I know I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.639" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">know I&#39;m taking up a lot of time so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:24.900" style="s2">just say this very quickly and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:26.130" style="s2">done that you know the the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.900" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">this conversation is to come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.130" end="00:03:31.139" style="s2">idea something which could be you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">work towards right now I I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.139" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">strongly have the feeling that to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:36.660" style="s2">clear idea of where you want to go is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">actually a mistake at this stage and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.660" end="00:03:41.269" style="s2">that really the the more appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:43.290" style="s2">question to ask is what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.269" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">circumstances what sort of starting</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:49.739" style="s2">conditions are necessary for a fit for</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:51.329" style="s2">purpose flourishing education system to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.739" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">emerge from in the same way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.329" end="00:03:54.750" style="s2">having this conversation right we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">starting with a particular goal in mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.750" end="00:03:59.069" style="s2">you know in the same way we have you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">know we have a set of aspirations maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.069" end="00:04:02.699" style="s2">but not like a particular picture</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:04.079" style="s2">framework of exactly how the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.699" end="00:04:07.489" style="s2">going to look and so I will stop there</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.079" end="00:04:07.489" style="s2">sorry if I run over</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:12.820" style="s2">anyone else want to add to our current</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.850" end="00:04:15.160" style="s2">education sure just one note it might</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.820" end="00:04:17.920" style="s2">actually make sense to swap the last two</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.160" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">spots on the agenda so it goes we cover</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.920" end="00:04:22.420" style="s2">what we&#39;re ordering now sort of what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:24.970" style="s2">could do like our next steps and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.420" end="00:04:26.650" style="s2">the last that is as we sort of built up</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.970" end="00:04:29.340" style="s2">towards it from the what can we do now</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.650" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s that final like</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.340" end="00:04:34.540" style="s2">what does it look like if it&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:35.890" style="s2">quote unquote yeah I&#39;m doing it this way</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.540" end="00:04:37.510" style="s2">first visit agrees in but if it turns</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.890" end="00:04:39.670" style="s2">out it doesn&#39;t work this way then we</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.510" end="00:04:41.950" style="s2">could absolutely like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.670" end="00:04:44.200" style="s2">chronological order right of where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.950" end="00:04:46.480" style="s2">are to the step to be it&#39;s like getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.200" end="00:04:48.280" style="s2">our juices flowing so that we can think</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.480" end="00:04:52.150" style="s2">of the current solution what is a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.280" end="00:04:56.110" style="s2">thing right oh I can see II either</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.150" end="00:04:58.450" style="s2">working just be floating different from</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.110" end="00:05:01.090" style="s2">actual input on education I</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.450" end="00:05:03.460" style="s2">I mean agree it&#39;s sort of a mostly</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.090" end="00:05:05.290" style="s2">broken topic Jubilee I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.460" end="00:05:07.660" style="s2">you found like going to our high school</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.290" end="00:05:09.670" style="s2">was like but I actually credit that with</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.660" end="00:05:12.910" style="s2">doing a lot of good things but it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.670" end="00:05:15.010" style="s2">also really weird high school where they</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.910" end="00:05:17.530" style="s2">like to be teachers went by first names</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.010" end="00:05:18.669" style="s2">which is uncommon and also seems like it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.530" end="00:05:21.780" style="s2">should be normal</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.669" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a small thing but I think it helped</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.780" end="00:05:27.250" style="s2">and then also students that like</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">actually showed an aptitude in something</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.250" end="00:05:33.430" style="s2">like for me it was computers for another</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:36.730" style="s2">guy his dad owned like a little drywall</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.430" end="00:05:38.620" style="s2">company and so he kind of got to skip a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.730" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">lot of his classes and just go and shop</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.620" end="00:05:42.840" style="s2">class and just sort of own that space</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">and the people who were into computers</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.840" end="00:05:47.200" style="s2">we kind of got to ignore a lot other I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:48.790" style="s2">got excused from classes to go and help</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.200" end="00:05:51.370" style="s2">teachers with computers I gotta execute</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.790" end="00:05:54.820" style="s2">some tests to go and like fix problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.370" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">and so it seemed like if it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.820" end="00:05:59.200" style="s2">you knew where you were going they</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:05:59.950" style="s2">de-emphasize everything else and off to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.200" end="00:06:01.419" style="s2">the races</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.950" end="00:06:04.030" style="s2">and I spent my last two years in high</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.419" end="00:06:11.020" style="s2">school mostly just doing you work for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.030" end="00:06:16.780" style="s2">school which I found quite useful and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.020" end="00:06:20.110" style="s2">that&#39;s all yeah I I just want to add to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.780" end="00:06:22.270" style="s2">that I still from Eric saying that</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.110" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">kind of stressful days I still when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.270" end="00:06:25.540" style="s2">have stress dreams they are about</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">finding my classes in high school I</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.540" end="00:06:30.670" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s part of just being</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.430" end="00:06:34.540" style="s2">an overly sensitive teenager or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.670" end="00:06:36.010" style="s2">just that scary of a time but definitely</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.540" end="00:06:39.370" style="s2">seems to be more stressful than it</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.010" end="00:06:41.170" style="s2">should be and and yeah you know several</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.370" end="00:06:43.510" style="s2">hundred years ago it was possible that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.170" end="00:06:45.790" style="s2">human could through a lifetime learn a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.510" end="00:06:49.690" style="s2">majority of human knowledge at that time</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.790" end="00:06:52.660" style="s2">but now we have more content appearing</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.690" end="00:06:57.730" style="s2">in a day than a human could learn in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.660" end="00:07:01.150" style="s2">lifetime so yeah the you know memorizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.730" end="00:07:01.960" style="s2">and regurgitating faxes that&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.150" end="00:07:05.950" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.960" end="00:07:08.050" style="s2">I think our education systems throughout</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.950" end="00:07:10.210" style="s2">history have done a great thing as far</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.050" end="00:07:13.030" style="s2">as bringing the human race to where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.210" end="00:07:21.790" style="s2">at and now it&#39;s time for the next level</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.030" end="00:07:24.820" style="s2">I think the state of education right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.790" end="00:07:30.070" style="s2">the difficulty with it is that we still</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.820" end="00:07:33.880" style="s2">live in this stage where we like what</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.070" end="00:07:36.310" style="s2">Eric said where we&#39;re treating students</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.880" end="00:07:39.550" style="s2">like they&#39;re still about to work in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.310" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">factory the issue is we are under</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.550" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">estimating the amount of complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">has always been part of how much ways to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:55.300" style="s2">there can be to learn and how many</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:59.590" style="s2">things there are to learn and so now</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.300" end="00:08:03.640" style="s2">that we have access to communicating on</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.590" end="00:08:04.750" style="s2">way higher bandwidth we start realizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.640" end="00:08:08.260" style="s2">oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.750" end="00:08:11.580" style="s2">not only is education ambiguous but we</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.260" end="00:08:13.960" style="s2">need to find a way to keep education</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.580" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">ambiguous so we don&#39;t leave anything out</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.960" end="00:08:19.300" style="s2">but at the same time we need to create a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:25.330" style="s2">strategy to go from the factory worker</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.300" end="00:08:27.640" style="s2">mentality to a more stable coherent like</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.330" end="00:08:29.410" style="s2">second wave of Education and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.640" end="00:08:31.449" style="s2">that&#39;s where we need to start and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.410" end="00:08:33.409" style="s2">haven&#39;t even gotten there yet</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.449" end="00:08:39.139" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.409" end="00:08:40.849" style="s2">I think you guys laid out a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.139" end="00:08:42.620" style="s2">is wrong with the education system so</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.849" end="00:08:46.009" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna touch on things that I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.620" end="00:08:47.810" style="s2">are working in this space I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.009" end="00:08:50.540" style="s2">before we went live to Nick that like</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.810" end="00:08:53.029" style="s2">the Khan Academy and MOOCs online I</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.540" end="00:08:57.100" style="s2">don&#39;t remember what MOOC stands for no</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.029" end="00:08:57.100" style="s2">you don&#39;t will no massive online</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.970" end="00:09:06.019" style="s2">classroom massively open online</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.069" end="00:09:08.569" style="s2">classroom look and having technology</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.019" end="00:09:10.670" style="s2">available having basically every piece</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.569" end="00:09:12.439" style="s2">of human knowledge available on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.670" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">internet right now the issues to me is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.439" end="00:09:16.120" style="s2">that it&#39;s not organized and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:18.980" style="s2">access it in that way and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.120" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">learn the complexity that ins that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.980" end="00:09:21.980" style="s2">there and access it in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:24.980" style="s2">don&#39;t need to memorize it and can just</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.980" end="00:09:26.870" style="s2">just access it I also in this space my</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.980" end="00:09:28.879" style="s2">kids school last year just closed and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.870" end="00:09:30.379" style="s2">now she&#39;s in a regular public school but</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.879" end="00:09:32.870" style="s2">she was in a democratic school and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.379" end="00:09:34.339" style="s2">seeing the difference between calling</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.870" end="00:09:35.660" style="s2">your teacher by the first name having</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.339" end="00:09:37.790" style="s2">your teacher as a friend that you feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.660" end="00:09:39.589" style="s2">absolutely comfortable inviting over for</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.790" end="00:09:42.649" style="s2">dinner and comes to your house to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.589" end="00:09:44.870" style="s2">interview you when needed and does these</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.649" end="00:09:47.689" style="s2">things that are just not done in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.870" end="00:09:49.130" style="s2">regular public school system and now the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.689" end="00:09:50.300" style="s2">difference it is like my kid didn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.130" end="00:09:51.529" style="s2">to know how to read when she was in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.300" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">it would have emerged and it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.529" end="00:09:54.649" style="s2">time and now it&#39;s like she does need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:56.930" style="s2">know how to read because it&#39;s gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.649" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">her back from learning everything that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.930" end="00:10:00.290" style="s2">is based on knowing how to read in class</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:01.910" style="s2">and knowing you know your numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.290" end="00:10:04.759" style="s2">you have to move this entire cohort</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.910" end="00:10:07.149" style="s2">together through the system so that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.759" end="00:10:12.139" style="s2">teacher has an easier job teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.149" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">there was much more like the students</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.139" end="00:10:16.579" style="s2">fed there&#39;s a plane and the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:20.209" style="s2">emotional intelligence and interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.579" end="00:10:22.600" style="s2">intelligence they got was way ahead like</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.209" end="00:10:25.189" style="s2">everyone I know who went to that school</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.600" end="00:10:26.930" style="s2">knows how to talk to an adult knows how</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.189" end="00:10:29.480" style="s2">to have their ideas heard knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.930" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">even in kindergarten like at least by</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.480" end="00:10:33.199" style="s2">the end of kindergarten knows that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:35.509" style="s2">can that they have a voice and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.199" end="00:10:37.250" style="s2">that is HUGE and so does anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.509" end="00:10:39.170" style="s2">know of any solutions that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.250" end="00:10:41.389" style="s2">in this space they get all touched on</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.170" end="00:10:43.759" style="s2">our high school which was a regular</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.389" end="00:10:45.709" style="s2">public high school in Alberta in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.759" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">nineties and still was pretty awesome</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.709" end="00:10:49.170" style="s2">for what it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:50.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a documentary made a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.170" end="00:10:52.680" style="s2">years ago no more than a couple years</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.490" end="00:10:55.250" style="s2">ago now anyway called Waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.680" end="00:10:59.940" style="s2">Superman have any of you seen this film</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.250" end="00:11:02.210" style="s2">no Bentley&#39;s nodding and that highlights</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.940" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">a I mean a it highlighted some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.210" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">systemic blocks that there are to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">actually you know a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:09.450" style="s2">Commissioners whatever came along</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:10.920" style="s2">actually tried to make changes actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.450" end="00:11:13.110" style="s2">tried to make things better bring in new</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.920" end="00:11:14.550" style="s2">models and the resistance they met from</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.110" end="00:11:16.740" style="s2">the profession from the teaching unions</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.550" end="00:11:17.880" style="s2">as well as from the administration you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.740" end="00:11:20.060" style="s2">know from the Department of Education</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.880" end="00:11:23.370" style="s2">and so I was was insurmountable you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.060" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s that but the but</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.370" end="00:11:29.220" style="s2">it also focused on a guy who started</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:31.110" style="s2">schools I think I&#39;m pretty sure they</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.220" end="00:11:32.930" style="s2">were called Kipp schools Kay IP and</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.110" end="00:11:36.600" style="s2">again I&#39;m not sure what that stands for</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.930" end="00:11:39.570" style="s2">but these are schools particularly</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.600" end="00:11:41.400" style="s2">designed for deprived areas inner-city</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.570" end="00:11:42.420" style="s2">kids because what sorry again I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.400" end="00:11:45.980" style="s2">to go on for a minute here I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.420" end="00:11:49.020" style="s2">apologize but studies and education</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.980" end="00:11:51.660" style="s2">forever basically have always always</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.020" end="00:11:53.490" style="s2">shown their children particularly black</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.660" end="00:11:56.280" style="s2">children but children in general from</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.490" end="00:11:59.580" style="s2">deprived areas never ever ever catch up</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.280" end="00:12:01.320" style="s2">with their with their compadres in</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.580" end="00:12:03.570" style="s2">higher demographics right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.320" end="00:12:05.250" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re the outcomes the results</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.570" end="00:12:07.830" style="s2">that they achieved never ever ever catch</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.250" end="00:12:09.060" style="s2">up and it was thought that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.830" end="00:12:10.740" style="s2">either the conditions in which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.060" end="00:12:12.780" style="s2">growing up or there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.740" end="00:12:14.340" style="s2">the genes or whatever that is just not</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.780" end="00:12:16.200" style="s2">possible these kids schools absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.340" end="00:12:19.590" style="s2">turned that on their head by using this</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.200" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">model of you know fantastic teachers</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.590" end="00:12:23.330" style="s2">really highly motivated doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:26.370" style="s2">they love doing it that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.330" end="00:12:28.590" style="s2">kids who are involved in the planning of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.370" end="00:12:29.910" style="s2">the curriculum and the organization at</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.590" end="00:12:31.530" style="s2">the school and the disciplining of other</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.910" end="00:12:33.480" style="s2">children it&#39;s really funny he made a</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.530" end="00:12:36.330" style="s2">comment that you know after a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.480" end="00:12:37.770" style="s2">years of the children deciding on what</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.330" end="00:12:38.970" style="s2">the rules were they came up with exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.770" end="00:12:40.590" style="s2">the same rules that we had in the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.970" end="00:12:43.260" style="s2">place right the point is they are they</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.590" end="00:12:45.540" style="s2">own them they enforce them right they</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.260" end="00:12:48.360" style="s2">are meaningful to if they understand the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.540" end="00:12:51.690" style="s2">point of them right and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.360" end="00:12:54.180" style="s2">that&#39;s the models do exist at the Khan</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.690" end="00:12:55.500" style="s2">Academy that that jubilee mentioned as</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.180" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">well you know models do exist they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.500" end="00:13:00.390" style="s2">out there but there are massive barriers</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:00.840" style="s2">to their implementation because of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.390" end="00:13:03.690" style="s2">bureau</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.840" end="00:13:05.610" style="s2">basic structures that exist that must be</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.690" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">able to compare one school with another</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.610" end="00:13:09.180" style="s2">one student with another give this but</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:10.650" style="s2">you know 15% of them get a is 20% of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.180" end="00:13:14.780" style="s2">them get B&#39;s every single year you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.650" end="00:13:18.510" style="s2">what I mean this this whole apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.780" end="00:13:20.070" style="s2">seems to me to be a huge barrier however</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.510" end="00:13:22.040" style="s2">good your idea is you know however</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.070" end="00:13:24.840" style="s2">perfect an educational system you design</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.040" end="00:13:26.340" style="s2">actually getting it implemented is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.840" end="00:13:28.230" style="s2">whole different kettle of fish right</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.340" end="00:13:34.260" style="s2">sorry again I talk too long I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.230" end="00:13:36.290" style="s2">yeah and if I can just add one point you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.260" end="00:13:39.300" style="s2">know we&#39;ll talk about the things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.290" end="00:13:42.780" style="s2">kind of went wrong but there are there</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.300" end="00:13:44.790" style="s2">are some like we might say rote learning</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.780" end="00:13:47.250" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that we&#39;d see in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.790" end="00:13:48.990" style="s2">future but there are some types of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.250" end="00:13:51.350" style="s2">knowledge that rote learning is</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.990" end="00:13:57.810" style="s2">important and can provide a lot of value</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.350" end="00:13:59.850" style="s2">so I&#39;m all for not yeah right because</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.810" end="00:14:01.410" style="s2">once you learn that you can you can do</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.850" end="00:14:04.110" style="s2">the other math so much quicker in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.410" end="00:14:05.340" style="s2">head it makes it easier so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.110" end="00:14:07.890" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be times for all these</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.340" end="00:14:09.690" style="s2">different modalities of learning and but</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.890" end="00:14:12.150" style="s2">yeah nothing should really be sacred in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.690" end="00:14:14.130" style="s2">our current plan we should be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.150" end="00:14:18.240" style="s2">look at every piece and break it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.130" end="00:14:20.280" style="s2">experiment where at the end of this this</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.240" end="00:14:21.960" style="s2">section I also wanted to mention one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.280" end="00:14:24.780" style="s2">the things our current education system</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.960" end="00:14:28.650" style="s2">does for kids in particular is child</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.780" end="00:14:30.390" style="s2">care that that is a big piece of that if</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.650" end="00:14:32.070" style="s2">people are working and even if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.390" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">not if they&#39;re just like have purpose a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.070" end="00:14:37.500" style="s2">place for kids to go and be kids</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:40.340" style="s2">together is a one of the pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.500" end="00:14:42.870" style="s2">education gives you that I think yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.340" end="00:14:45.720" style="s2">socialization and the break for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.870" end="00:14:50.040" style="s2">parents okay and then yes for both for</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.720" end="00:14:53.130" style="s2">both parties right yeah and so now we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.040" end="00:14:54.810" style="s2">can go into the the amazing future that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.130" end="00:14:57.270" style="s2">however far the future you need that to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.810" end="00:14:59.310" style="s2">be for it to be possible Star Trek what</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.270" end="00:15:01.830" style="s2">does education look like when we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.310" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">all the resources all the power people</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.830" end="00:15:06.000" style="s2">came together and made an answer Bob</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:08.130" style="s2">Laura&#39;s on the UN solution would anyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.000" end="00:15:11.310" style="s2">like to start because I got ideas sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.130" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">is one of the really key parts that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.310" end="00:15:14.840" style="s2">anything to do with like educating a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:16.940" style="s2">populace has to take</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.840" end="00:15:18.380" style="s2">to account is what people are interested</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.940" end="00:15:20.360" style="s2">in like I&#39;ve been interested in</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.380" end="00:15:22.220" style="s2">technology and computers since I was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.360" end="00:15:24.350" style="s2">kid and I worked with people who were</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.220" end="00:15:26.780" style="s2">not that way whose parents put them in</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.350" end="00:15:28.370" style="s2">technology they hated it and candidly</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.780" end="00:15:29.540" style="s2">they weren&#39;t very good at it because it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.370" end="00:15:31.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t speak to them they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.540" end="00:15:33.620" style="s2">practice in their spare time they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.070" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">you know go go to hackathons it was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.620" end="00:15:37.640" style="s2">very telling thing and in tech that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:39.080" style="s2">that&#39;s rampant there&#39;s people who love</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.640" end="00:15:40.970" style="s2">it and who do it on the weekends and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.080" end="00:15:42.530" style="s2">evenings and it&#39;s their life there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.970" end="00:15:44.780" style="s2">people who you can tell it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.530" end="00:15:47.450" style="s2">paycheck and they&#39;ll easily leave it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.780" end="00:15:49.340" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but the question is if they</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.450" end="00:15:50.360" style="s2">weren&#39;t forced into tech what would they</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.340" end="00:15:54.020" style="s2">have done and what they have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.360" end="00:15:56.390" style="s2">world-class at it and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.020" end="00:15:58.520" style="s2">huge part is having that be whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.390" end="00:16:00.890" style="s2">schooling ends up being you learn your</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.520" end="00:16:02.600" style="s2">basics like you know you probably should</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.890" end="00:16:05.030" style="s2">be able to read and write and and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.600" end="00:16:06.590" style="s2">like that at some point in time but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.030" end="00:16:08.750" style="s2">somewhere in there there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.590" end="00:16:11.000" style="s2">divergence where you spend time figuring</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.750" end="00:16:13.190" style="s2">out what it is you really like to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.000" end="00:16:15.050" style="s2">ideally hopefully maybe some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.190" end="00:16:17.210" style="s2">what do you already show some aptitude</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.050" end="00:16:19.940" style="s2">for and then let that guide more</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.210" end="00:16:22.100" style="s2">specific learning to do with what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.940" end="00:16:24.380" style="s2">might actually end up doing this is also</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.100" end="00:16:25.370" style="s2">part of sorry to jump in I plan not to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.380" end="00:16:26.600" style="s2">say anything in this because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.370" end="00:16:28.640" style="s2">already sought so much but this is part</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.600" end="00:16:30.200" style="s2">of a wider thing right is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.640" end="00:16:31.580" style="s2">if you want to do dance or you want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.200" end="00:16:33.110" style="s2">do music or something like that if this</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.580" end="00:16:34.580" style="s2">is your passion to actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.110" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">earn a living from there at the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.580" end="00:16:37.940" style="s2">end is extremely difficult and so what</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.410" end="00:16:39.980" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about absolutely I agree</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.940" end="00:16:41.810" style="s2">with all of it but it can&#39;t be done in</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.980" end="00:16:43.730" style="s2">isolation of a change in the society</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.810" end="00:16:45.380" style="s2">broadly as well where these things are</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.730" end="00:16:47.240" style="s2">actually valued and rewarded and you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.380" end="00:16:49.190" style="s2">you know you can you can live from doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.240" end="00:16:51.320" style="s2">them kind of thing or live independently</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.190" end="00:16:53.720" style="s2">of having to do anything right and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.320" end="00:16:55.490" style="s2">might be down the line with like how</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.720" end="00:16:57.530" style="s2">those courses end up so if you say oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.490" end="00:17:00.020" style="s2">well I have an aptitude for dance or vo</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.530" end="00:17:01.940" style="s2">or music or art part of the learning</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.020" end="00:17:04.490" style="s2">might be okay just so you know at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.940" end="00:17:05.870" style="s2">for right now those industries you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.490" end="00:17:07.130" style="s2">you&#39;re rolling the dice as to whether or</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.870" end="00:17:09.080" style="s2">not you&#39;re gonna be able to live</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.130" end="00:17:10.610" style="s2">comfortably here&#39;s some strategies</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.080" end="00:17:12.410" style="s2">here&#39;s some things Oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.610" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">maybe also find an alternate interest</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.410" end="00:17:18.950" style="s2">because I have interests or examples</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:21.200" style="s2">yeah yeah most I don&#39;t know of anyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.950" end="00:17:22.610" style="s2">that has a single passion so maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.200" end="00:17:24.740" style="s2">need change the words to say finding</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.610" end="00:17:26.990" style="s2">your passions true I always speak about</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.740" end="00:17:30.500" style="s2">a plural so yeah and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.990" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">yeah helping helping them and also</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.500" end="00:17:36.500" style="s2">often passions are very are not like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">may not be danced it may be physical</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.500" end="00:17:41.750" style="s2">movement and then maybe woodworking is</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">similar to dance if it unless you like</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.750" end="00:17:45.529" style="s2">the being in front of other people and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:47.720" style="s2">then maybe if it&#39;s the self-expression</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.529" end="00:17:51.020" style="s2">then it&#39;s that it&#39;s going into making</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.720" end="00:17:53.750" style="s2">movies or something yeah but yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.020" end="00:17:56.390" style="s2">guidance to make sure that if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.750" end="00:17:57.830" style="s2">still in a game a world that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.390" end="00:18:00.440" style="s2">something that they could make a living</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.830" end="00:18:05.630" style="s2">off of this interesting and while I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.440" end="00:18:07.970" style="s2">the floor the future unless I forgot</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.630" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">what I was gonna say oh is that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.970" end="00:18:12.919" style="s2">concept that learning is a lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:16.549" style="s2">pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.919" end="00:18:19.190" style="s2">so you made spend a higher priority of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.549" end="00:18:22.909" style="s2">your time during the formative years of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.190" end="00:18:24.529" style="s2">being a young person but maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.909" end="00:18:26.779" style="s2">processes that we build would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.529" end="00:18:29.990" style="s2">something that continued it&#39;d be nice if</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.779" end="00:18:31.429" style="s2">I had a way to track my learning these</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.990" end="00:18:33.380" style="s2">are the skills I&#39;ve learned and here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.429" end="00:18:34.909" style="s2">chart of that kind of like they do in</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.380" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">video games where you have skills and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.909" end="00:18:38.059" style="s2">they build on each other I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:40.100" style="s2">wanted that and there are some tools</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.059" end="00:18:46.100" style="s2">that then you can use that throughout</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.100" end="00:18:48.559" style="s2">your whole life I think speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.100" end="00:18:51.380" style="s2">the future since you mentioned Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.559" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">and stuff like that this sort of enters</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.380" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">in that vein I really think they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:19:01.090" style="s2">in the future there should be a digital</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:04.850" style="s2">complex where we encourage diversity and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.090" end="00:19:06.500" style="s2">being able to have modules being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.850" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">like if you want to dance but you also</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.500" end="00:19:10.850" style="s2">want to do carpeting for example you</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:13.460" style="s2">could just mix that into a degree and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.850" end="00:19:16.279" style="s2">literally in the digital complex there</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.460" end="00:19:19.730" style="s2">will be this almost infinite or</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.279" end="00:19:21.649" style="s2">innumerable library of videos that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.730" end="00:19:25.870" style="s2">can have access to that will be saved</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.649" end="00:19:30.909" style="s2">with that will be saved on a server and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.870" end="00:19:33.409" style="s2">the issue to me would be the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.909" end="00:19:35.990" style="s2">making sure that everyone has an</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.409" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">individualized experience so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.990" end="00:19:40.790" style="s2">future of Education would be a mixture</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:45.380" style="s2">of finding a way to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.790" end="00:19:48.200" style="s2">um merge private tooter ship with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.380" end="00:19:51.380" style="s2">digital complex of getting access to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.200" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">lectures that you want at a certain time</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.380" end="00:19:55.640" style="s2">and then of course you have to add like</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:58.700" style="s2">what you guys were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.640" end="00:20:00.680" style="s2">final little sweet spot which is you got</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.700" end="00:20:02.060" style="s2">to make sure that you get employment</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.680" end="00:20:04.910" style="s2">from that and you got to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.060" end="00:20:07.550" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s accredited in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.910" end="00:20:10.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily authoritarian but</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.550" end="00:20:15.680" style="s2">you can actually look upon this library</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.160" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">and if you and people actually a firm</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.680" end="00:20:20.780" style="s2">what you&#39;ve done and it can actually get</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:23.420" style="s2">a good analysis I think in the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.780" end="00:20:25.430" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have education that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.420" end="00:20:27.830" style="s2">tailored to your interests for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.430" end="00:20:29.870" style="s2">also to your learning style and helping</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.830" end="00:20:32.510" style="s2">you figure out what those things are so</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.870" end="00:20:34.040" style="s2">like Bentley said we&#39;re having a way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.510" end="00:20:35.540" style="s2">be able to track your interest having a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.040" end="00:20:37.640" style="s2">way to be able to track your skills and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.540" end="00:20:40.250" style="s2">as they increase having a way to gamify</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.640" end="00:20:43.880" style="s2">that if you want to and making it so</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.250" end="00:20:46.490" style="s2">that it is it is very individually based</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.880" end="00:20:49.370" style="s2">but at the same time as I&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.490" end="00:20:53.090" style="s2">learn math people who is brains work</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.370" end="00:20:54.860" style="s2">like mine would be able to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.090" end="00:20:57.410" style="s2">what I&#39;ve learned right so so it could</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.860" end="00:20:59.240" style="s2">actually help you figure out what math</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.410" end="00:21:00.620" style="s2">course would be the best for you if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.240" end="00:21:02.330" style="s2">want to learn math so like following</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.620" end="00:21:03.980" style="s2">your interests but also helping you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.330" end="00:21:06.590" style="s2">figure out what your learning style is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.980" end="00:21:08.060" style="s2">and having it be lifelong where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.590" end="00:21:10.130" style="s2">about necessarily going and getting a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.060" end="00:21:11.930" style="s2">four-year degree but hey I want to take</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.130" end="00:21:14.060" style="s2">this math course or it can offer if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.930" end="00:21:15.530" style="s2">want to do this if you&#39;re gonna probably</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.060" end="00:21:17.750" style="s2">need this stuff you don&#39;t to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.530" end="00:21:19.340" style="s2">understand that and even if it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.750" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try to make it as easy as</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.340" end="00:21:23.720" style="s2">possible within your learning style and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:25.340" style="s2">including virtual reality so that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.720" end="00:21:29.720" style="s2">could have personal one-on-one tutors</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.340" end="00:21:31.490" style="s2">without it necessarily being a one like</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.720" end="00:21:33.050" style="s2">Nick doesn&#39;t need to teach Jubilee and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.490" end="00:21:35.240" style="s2">take his time to teach me it could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.050" end="00:21:37.460" style="s2">like a virtual Nick teaching me right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.240" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re an expert and never told me</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.460" end="00:21:41.990" style="s2">teaching you and so also I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">that we need to teach kids for</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.990" end="00:21:45.890" style="s2">employments in the future because I</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:47.570" style="s2">think that employment with you be I and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.890" end="00:21:49.340" style="s2">with other resources it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.570" end="00:21:51.230" style="s2">making a living it&#39;s about making a</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.340" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">purpose and so for some people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.230" end="00:21:54.230" style="s2">going to be very tailored it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:56.150" style="s2">be you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.230" end="00:21:58.160" style="s2">and everything&#39;s tack or you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.150" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">medicine and being a surgeon and</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.160" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">everything is that but for other people</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:04.010" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be so flowy I mean I watch</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">how my kid learns and it&#39;s like ballet</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.010" end="00:22:10.280" style="s2">one week and minecraft the next and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:12.710" style="s2">being able to say yes follow your follow</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.280" end="00:22:15.049" style="s2">your passion follow it you want to learn</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.710" end="00:22:16.910" style="s2">and then teaming up with other people</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.049" end="00:22:18.410" style="s2">that both have the skill sets you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.910" end="00:22:20.510" style="s2">have to be able to work on a team and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.410" end="00:22:22.160" style="s2">work towards a project from the age of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.510" end="00:22:23.870" style="s2">five and six like why not work on</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.160" end="00:22:26.390" style="s2">projects why not have things that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.870" end="00:22:28.820" style="s2">actually tangible like what happened</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.390" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">with the last last week some digital</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.820" end="00:22:35.450" style="s2">native having the students add to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:37.970" style="s2">learning curriculum right and having it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.450" end="00:22:39.740" style="s2">be like it&#39;s okay if there&#39;s millions of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.970" end="00:22:41.270" style="s2">videos on world war ii which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.740" end="00:22:43.100" style="s2">the best for your brain which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.270" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">the best for you to understand which</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.100" end="00:22:49.490" style="s2">ones do we agree are the truth and all</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:52.850" style="s2">the reason making sense making reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.490" end="00:22:54.740" style="s2">making technology that helps you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.850" end="00:22:57.350" style="s2">access to data that is usable and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.740" end="00:22:58.190" style="s2">understandable at your fingertips so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.350" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">that you don&#39;t need to memorize</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.190" end="00:23:03.220" style="s2">everything and having it be and it will</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:06.919" style="s2">be a little more silent because I just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.220" end="00:23:08.270" style="s2">future oh just to add to that real quick</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.919" end="00:23:09.710" style="s2">you can even think make things more</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.270" end="00:23:11.900" style="s2">complicated as we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.710" end="00:23:14.390" style="s2">future and I really don&#39;t think this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.900" end="00:23:18.440" style="s2">too far-fetched but let&#39;s say I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.390" end="00:23:20.780" style="s2">teacher I teach metaphysics and I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.440" end="00:23:22.179" style="s2">someplace to go I can&#39;t necessarily be</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.780" end="00:23:26.630" style="s2">there live or I can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.179" end="00:23:29.030" style="s2">produce lectures within a specific kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.630" end="00:23:31.130" style="s2">of way that can like let&#39;s say if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.030" end="00:23:33.580" style="s2">more of a visual learner perhaps I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.130" end="00:23:38.630" style="s2">do I can&#39;t perform in that manner</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.580" end="00:23:41.990" style="s2">literally and this is maybe mm 150 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.630" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">in the future when we have a GI you will</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.990" end="00:23:47.480" style="s2">be able to take the using neural</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">networks all the capacity of my sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.480" end="00:23:52.700" style="s2">data and then make it into like what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:55.280" style="s2">said like a virtual kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.700" end="00:23:56.750" style="s2">then the virtual me will teach me and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.280" end="00:23:59.900" style="s2">it&#39;ll be a neural network it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.750" end="00:24:03.169" style="s2">hologram that can literally mimic me so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.900" end="00:24:04.490" style="s2">perfectly that even it will teach me</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.169" end="00:24:06.860" style="s2">some new things about learning</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.490" end="00:24:08.150" style="s2">metaphysics so there will not be this</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.860" end="00:24:10.280" style="s2">limitation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.150" end="00:24:12.350" style="s2">out all we can only learn what the human</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.280" end="00:24:16.430" style="s2">mind is capable of but there literally</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.350" end="00:24:17.540" style="s2">be these huge undescribable branches</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.430" end="00:24:19.310" style="s2">going on in all these different</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.540" end="00:24:21.260" style="s2">directions and it would that would take</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.310" end="00:24:24.490" style="s2">us forever to be able to like talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.260" end="00:24:24.490" style="s2">keenly today</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.950" end="00:24:29.660" style="s2">I would like to said in the future we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.320" end="00:24:32.090" style="s2">got past the notion of institutional</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.660" end="00:24:33.970" style="s2">accreditation right I mean have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.090" end="00:24:38.050" style="s2">how this would work it&#39;s just a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.970" end="00:24:40.310" style="s2">picture in my head of this giant like</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.050" end="00:24:42.440" style="s2">interface of everything with everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.310" end="00:24:44.180" style="s2">kind of thing and so you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.440" end="00:24:46.280" style="s2">what you blue is talking about I want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.180" end="00:24:47.780" style="s2">learn about this who is there out there</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.280" end="00:24:49.160" style="s2">nearby me you know I want to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.780" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">to play the guitar right who is there</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.160" end="00:24:52.580" style="s2">nearby me who knows how to play the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">guitar and you know because we are no</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.580" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">longer having to go out and spend 50</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.760" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">to keep our heads above water people</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.470" end="00:25:00.620" style="s2">have time and there is nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:02.270" style="s2">pleasurable if you&#39;re an expert at</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.070" end="00:25:07.430" style="s2">professional about it to teach somebody</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.140" end="00:25:08.570" style="s2">else about it is one of the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.430" end="00:25:10.490" style="s2">joys that there is you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.570" end="00:25:12.530" style="s2">so everybody becomes potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.490" end="00:25:14.630" style="s2">teacher of things that they know about</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.530" end="00:25:15.800" style="s2">and everybody is a learner of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.630" end="00:25:18.560" style="s2">they want to know about you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.800" end="00:25:20.780" style="s2">mean in it and that that is the end that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.560" end="00:25:22.520" style="s2">starts you know what I mean it starts</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.780" end="00:25:24.340" style="s2">that day Dalton finishes that there you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.520" end="00:25:31.550" style="s2">go in the ground</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.340" end="00:25:33.620" style="s2">yes and so yeah so I think adding on to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.550" end="00:25:35.660" style="s2">all the virtual stuff that Nick was</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.620" end="00:25:38.330" style="s2">talking to the digital stuff but also</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.660" end="00:25:41.000" style="s2">the ability to both find peers that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.330" end="00:25:43.220" style="s2">at the same learning stage you in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.000" end="00:25:45.080" style="s2">physical space which I&#39;m a big person</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.220" end="00:25:47.990" style="s2">for digital stuff but there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.080" end="00:25:51.410" style="s2">a place for real people being in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.990" end="00:25:53.720" style="s2">physical proximity or video or you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.410" end="00:25:55.850" style="s2">just all the different ways that we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.720" end="00:25:57.500" style="s2">link together because sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.850" end="00:26:00.260" style="s2">other person you want to learn with is</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.500" end="00:26:01.940" style="s2">on the other side of the planet but if</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.260" end="00:26:03.170" style="s2">there is someone in your in your town or</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.940" end="00:26:05.510" style="s2">within driving distance or</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.170" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">transportation distance then it would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.510" end="00:26:10.040" style="s2">nice to have that as a possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:12.980" style="s2">then as peers and then also as teachers</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.040" end="00:26:15.410" style="s2">and as tutors I kind of have the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.980" end="00:26:17.300" style="s2">that in the future and I really think</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.410" end="00:26:19.430" style="s2">the biggest thing that teachers bring to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.300" end="00:26:24.500" style="s2">the situation is really more tutoring</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.430" end="00:26:27.680" style="s2">than teaching just because you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.500" end="00:26:31.030" style="s2">there&#39;s many many modalities for</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.680" end="00:26:33.710" style="s2">learning something written video audio</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.030" end="00:26:35.540" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.710" end="00:26:36.710" style="s2">modality toy you learn best from a human</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.540" end="00:26:38.539" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.710" end="00:26:40.789" style="s2">being interactive like being able to ask</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.539" end="00:26:43.130" style="s2">questions there&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.789" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard that but I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.130" end="00:26:47.779" style="s2">but that still I think would fall under</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:49.309" style="s2">tutoring I&#39;d you know that right now it</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.779" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">seems like we have thousands of teachers</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.309" end="00:26:53.870" style="s2">creating their own curriculum or when</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:26:55.880" style="s2">really they should be collected app ting</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.870" end="00:26:58.929" style="s2">a curriculum to individual children and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.880" end="00:27:01.370" style="s2">I know a lot of them do that as well but</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.929" end="00:27:02.899" style="s2">and I could definitely be wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.370" end="00:27:06.140" style="s2">this but it just seemed like there was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.899" end="00:27:07.549" style="s2">lot of spinning of wheels of teachers</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.140" end="00:27:10.610" style="s2">kind of spending time creating</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.549" end="00:27:12.470" style="s2">curriculum as opposed to adapting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.610" end="00:27:15.260" style="s2">each individual child and of course not</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.470" end="00:27:18.440" style="s2">being given the time to do that but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.260" end="00:27:21.140" style="s2">if the if the individuals can adapt the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.440" end="00:27:23.720" style="s2">curriculum or pull it out then that</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.140" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">might be even better but there will</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.720" end="00:27:28.490" style="s2">still be a place for for specific</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:30.529" style="s2">teachers to help adapt curriculum to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.490" end="00:27:34.340" style="s2">different people and teach them how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.529" end="00:27:36.740" style="s2">adapt it and then yeah and then not not</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.340" end="00:27:39.500" style="s2">like a central accreditation I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.740" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t see there being degrees because</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.500" end="00:27:43.220" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of weird that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:45.740" style="s2">reason to have a degree is because it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.220" end="00:27:48.169" style="s2">was simpler for people to understand but</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.740" end="00:27:50.510" style="s2">if we have systems in place then it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.169" end="00:27:53.179" style="s2">would just be like someone else said a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.510" end="00:27:55.820" style="s2">document of kind of what you&#39;ve at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.179" end="00:27:57.649" style="s2">attempted to learn what you&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.820" end="00:27:59.299" style="s2">time on and then I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.649" end="00:28:01.700" style="s2">also want to have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.299" end="00:28:03.620" style="s2">measurement system that says how well</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.700" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">did you kind of learn this I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.620" end="00:28:07.580" style="s2">if that&#39;s important but it&#39;d be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">to have that knowledge graph of each</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.580" end="00:28:11.510" style="s2">individual and then you could find when</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:13.460" style="s2">you want to collaborate with people on a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.510" end="00:28:15.049" style="s2">project to find people that have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.460" end="00:28:17.539" style="s2">skill sets that might help the project</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.049" end="00:28:19.220" style="s2">which is another thing we&#39;re doing one</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.539" end="00:28:21.740" style="s2">of the things I wanted to say about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">future is that teachers like when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.740" end="00:28:24.919" style="s2">have UB I covered the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:26.690" style="s2">teaching are doing people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.919" end="00:28:28.250" style="s2">teach whether that&#39;s kids or adults it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.690" end="00:28:29.510" style="s2">gonna be that that is part and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.250" end="00:28:31.070" style="s2">gonna be teachers and students</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.510" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">constantly so maybe I don&#39;t consider</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.070" end="00:28:33.950" style="s2">myself a teacher but I&#39;m teaching you</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:37.429" style="s2">the one thing that I&#39;m adding to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.950" end="00:28:40.070" style="s2">curriculum and also in the future having</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.429" end="00:28:41.899" style="s2">maker spaces for things of all ages so</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.070" end="00:28:43.309" style="s2">all interests and all like if you can go</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.899" end="00:28:45.529" style="s2">and look under a microscope because you</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.309" end="00:28:47.299" style="s2">want to and see what things look like be</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.529" end="00:28:50.389" style="s2">able to have actual access to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.299" end="00:28:50.570" style="s2">lifelong shops that you can create you</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.389" end="00:28:53.149" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.570" end="00:28:54.620" style="s2">anything your your mind desires with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.149" end="00:28:56.389" style="s2">help of other people who that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.620" end="00:29:00.889" style="s2">passion right helping people create</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.389" end="00:29:02.539" style="s2">their their vision to to reality and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.889" end="00:29:05.990" style="s2">more we&#39;re able to share in that right</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.539" end="00:29:07.880" style="s2">sharing tools sharing space for various</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.990" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">ages and skill levels maybe those</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.880" end="00:29:10.669" style="s2">microscopes that you don&#39;t get let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:13.309" style="s2">stare at a certain skill level right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.669" end="00:29:14.929" style="s2">and what Bentley said like knowing where</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.309" end="00:29:17.570" style="s2">your skills are so you can be matched up</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.929" end="00:29:19.970" style="s2">with other people and a project you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.570" end="00:29:21.559" style="s2">the best people on it a great team of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.970" end="00:29:23.570" style="s2">people right who are taught but you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.559" end="00:29:25.100" style="s2">always work on a project like this</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.570" end="00:29:28.039" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re having were maybe all</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.100" end="00:29:29.750" style="s2">a little bit expert at this but I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.039" end="00:29:31.580" style="s2">you can get any five people together and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.750" end="00:29:34.370" style="s2">they could come up with eighth something</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.580" end="00:29:35.899" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s it&#39;s like what what</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.370" end="00:29:37.730" style="s2">level do you want to talk to people at</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.899" end="00:29:41.750" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t mean that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.730" end="00:29:44.450" style="s2">participate in it one more little tiny</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.750" end="00:29:46.149" style="s2">aspirational thing to add that came to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.450" end="00:29:48.889" style="s2">my mind while Bentley was talking that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.149" end="00:29:52.789" style="s2">education in the future will be not</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.889" end="00:29:54.470" style="s2">about as it largely is now not about so</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.789" end="00:29:56.179" style="s2">that the world can judge you you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.470" end="00:29:57.950" style="s2">what I mean of what do you know how well</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.179" end="00:30:00.860" style="s2">have you learned this not it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.950" end="00:30:02.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s about your own wish to find</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.860" end="00:30:04.549" style="s2">out about things and discover things and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.600" end="00:30:07.909" style="s2">improve yourself right so it actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.549" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">turns the whole feeling of it if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.909" end="00:30:12.590" style="s2">like on its head you know what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">instead of being viewed by the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.590" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">because of what you&#39;ve learned you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:17.659" style="s2">learned what you&#39;ve learned because you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:19.700" style="s2">want it to learn it it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.659" end="00:30:20.779" style="s2">different thing yeah I know Nick looks</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.700" end="00:30:22.070" style="s2">like he&#39;s about to want to talk but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.779" end="00:30:23.929" style="s2">think a drill hasn&#39;t shared in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.070" end="00:30:25.759" style="s2">section and then it&#39;s time to go on to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.929" end="00:30:31.399" style="s2">the next section of like what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.759" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">now so building on families like</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.399" end="00:30:35.539" style="s2">statement there I one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:38.269" style="s2">things we&#39;re talking about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.539" end="00:30:40.250" style="s2">specializing in your interests and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.269" end="00:30:42.470" style="s2">your passions I think part of that too</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.250" end="00:30:44.870" style="s2">is and this is something that game a is</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.470" end="00:30:47.450" style="s2">terrible at is they&#39;ve just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.870" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">great different skills for no apparent</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.450" end="00:30:50.029" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.799" style="s2">like deterrent marketer or something</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.029" end="00:30:53.419" style="s2">like you need you know ten different</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.799" end="00:30:56.149" style="s2">skills that almost no one has that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.419" end="00:30:57.620" style="s2">combination and whereas somebody might</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.149" end="00:30:59.690" style="s2">be you know great at documentation or</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.620" end="00:31:00.980" style="s2">explaining or whatever skill that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.690" end="00:31:02.539" style="s2">that would also be useful somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.980" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re not good at you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.539" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">copywriting</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:07.430" style="s2">but because they&#39;re in that role that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:09.860" style="s2">just what they do I think teaching</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.430" end="00:31:12.350" style="s2">suffers from the same challenge where</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.860" end="00:31:15.140" style="s2">you have somebody who&#39;s good at like</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.350" end="00:31:16.460" style="s2">trying to to relay information to trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.140" end="00:31:18.440" style="s2">to you know sort of alternate how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.460" end="00:31:20.630" style="s2">explain something but they might be not</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.440" end="00:31:22.340" style="s2">very good at making curriculum and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.630" end="00:31:25.190" style="s2">might also not be you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.340" end="00:31:26.390" style="s2">world-class expert in that topic so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.190" end="00:31:30.110" style="s2">you know 100 percent of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.390" end="00:31:33.080" style="s2">showing is you know as reasonably as we</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.110" end="00:31:34.430" style="s2">can be certain to be correct so I part</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.080" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">of it it is separating that you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.430" end="00:31:39.830" style="s2">your library of knowledge you have you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:42.410" style="s2">know all your curriculum made by people</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.830" end="00:31:44.060" style="s2">who are the best who you know and not</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.410" end="00:31:45.830" style="s2">just the best as far as they know it the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.060" end="00:31:47.540" style="s2">best also they&#39;re the best at making</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.830" end="00:31:49.190" style="s2">curriculum and making it so that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.540" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">could take something complex and explain</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.190" end="00:31:52.580" style="s2">it in a way that can make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:54.710" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s you know five or somebody</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.580" end="00:31:57.830" style="s2">who&#39;s ten or somebody who&#39;s fifteen or</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.710" end="00:32:00.500" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s at a different stage in</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.830" end="00:32:03.950" style="s2">learning about that thing I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.500" end="00:32:05.720" style="s2">as far as accreditation goes there needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.950" end="00:32:09.530" style="s2">to be something to make sure that like</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.720" end="00:32:12.260" style="s2">people note like I don&#39;t really care if</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.530" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">you know most accreditation goes away</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.260" end="00:32:16.940" style="s2">but like if if I go to see a doctor I</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:18.710" style="s2">want some assurance that they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.940" end="00:32:20.270" style="s2">know that they&#39;ve got some base level of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.710" end="00:32:21.890" style="s2">knowledge if we put an engineer in</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.270" end="00:32:24.260" style="s2">charge of building a bridge I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.890" end="00:32:26.330" style="s2">make sure you know hey that we can be as</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.260" end="00:32:27.650" style="s2">reasonably confident as possible that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.330" end="00:32:29.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to collapse when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.650" end="00:32:32.900" style="s2">know three cars were on at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.800" end="00:32:34.940" style="s2">but I do agree that most accreditation</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.900" end="00:32:38.870" style="s2">is kind of pointless and people just get</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.940" end="00:32:41.840" style="s2">a degree to to take a box and then what</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.870" end="00:32:43.610" style="s2">people who have master&#39;s degrees working</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:45.410" style="s2">in a job that you don&#39;t need a master&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.610" end="00:32:48.140" style="s2">degree to do just because they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.410" end="00:32:50.420" style="s2">take a box and get that thing absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.140" end="00:32:52.220" style="s2">so now we&#39;ve we&#39;ve talked about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.420" end="00:32:53.660" style="s2">wrong and right with the current one</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.220" end="00:32:55.610" style="s2">what it could look like in the future</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.660" end="00:32:57.170" style="s2">now we&#39;re gonna go into something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.610" end="00:33:00.350" style="s2">is actually possible that is an</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.170" end="00:33:01.730" style="s2">invitation not coercive enforce that ten</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.350" end="00:33:03.980" style="s2">thousand people could get together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.730" end="00:33:07.130" style="s2">create with a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.980" end="00:33:09.650" style="s2">so again I have ideas but if anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.130" end="00:33:10.790" style="s2">would like to like to start and will</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.650" end="00:33:12.740" style="s2">this build on it so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.790" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">necessarily need to be something that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.740" end="00:33:17.270" style="s2">like if next thing counteracts my thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.550" style="s2">that&#39;s fine is it doable</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.270" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">is it within that budget and that number</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.550" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.100" end="00:33:26.150" style="s2">I really think what&#39;s doable now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.250" end="00:33:28.850" style="s2">this thing called the floating</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.150" end="00:33:30.440" style="s2">University and it was this weird little</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.850" end="00:33:32.540" style="s2">micro project that was occurring</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.440" end="00:33:35.480" style="s2">somewhere I&#39;m not quite sure the year</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.540" end="00:33:41.000" style="s2">maybe 2012-2013 and it was twelve</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.480" end="00:33:44.770" style="s2">lectures from 12 from 12 really</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.000" end="00:33:48.200" style="s2">different topics from demography to</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.770" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">psychology to linguistics and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.200" end="00:33:55.580" style="s2">theoretical physics and if we could tap</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:58.220" style="s2">into that if we create if I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.580" end="00:34:04.820" style="s2">create a medium between teachers</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.220" end="00:34:07.550" style="s2">themselves and a library of videos in</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.820" end="00:34:08.860" style="s2">order to be able to express themselves I</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.550" end="00:34:12.050" style="s2">really think that that&#39;s possible now</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.860" end="00:34:14.840" style="s2">with a certain form of networking an</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.050" end="00:34:19.730" style="s2">investment in servers and just getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.840" end="00:34:22.370" style="s2">people to really express what knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.730" end="00:34:24.370" style="s2">that they have and be open when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.370" end="00:34:26.390" style="s2">talking in a lecture like for example</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.370" end="00:34:32.390" style="s2">like we&#39;re talking about accreditation</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.390" end="00:34:36.140" style="s2">and how it&#39;s kind of ridiculous in most</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.390" end="00:34:37.850" style="s2">cases people should just say okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.140" end="00:34:39.110" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna teach metaphysics but there</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.850" end="00:34:40.910" style="s2">are some things of course that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.110" end="00:34:42.260" style="s2">know about metaphysics and let&#39;s walk</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.910" end="00:34:44.680" style="s2">through this together and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.260" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">should feel like the lecture is</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.680" end="00:34:50.420" style="s2">interactive and maybe we with with an</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:54.680" style="s2">application that reaches out to teachers</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.420" end="00:34:57.320" style="s2">and creating that and creating a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.680" end="00:35:00.110" style="s2">into making videos I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.320" end="00:35:01.820" style="s2">really the easiest solution and we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.110" end="00:35:04.070" style="s2">talk about how that would relate to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.820" end="00:35:07.990" style="s2">physical spaces and with places without</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.070" end="00:35:07.990" style="s2">internet and the little complexities I</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.010" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">have we&#39;re talking about teachers there</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.780" end="00:35:15.530" style="s2">was just this little thing that was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:17.960" style="s2">a teacher spends so much of their time</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.530" end="00:35:19.340" style="s2">doing the class planning right which I</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.960" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think they know how to yet tailor</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.340" end="00:35:23.060" style="s2">make it to the kid especially within the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:24.710" style="s2">current system but having that be</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.060" end="00:35:27.080" style="s2">something that they could tap into a</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.710" end="00:35:28.340" style="s2">reason or space and say you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.080" end="00:35:30.590" style="s2">what I did last year and so I can just</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.340" end="00:35:31.530" style="s2">redo my own but also sharing amongst</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.590" end="00:35:33.660" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.530" end="00:35:35.790" style="s2">so that they can say like here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.660" end="00:35:37.830" style="s2">lesson plan and sharing that with one</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.790" end="00:35:40.290" style="s2">another so there&#39;s there&#39;s a database no</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.830" end="00:35:41.820" style="s2">matter what you&#39;re teaching and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.290" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">those could also made available to</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.820" end="00:35:46.860" style="s2">people anywhere in the world can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:49.350" style="s2">translated right so so what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.860" end="00:35:51.300" style="s2">in China to teach math translate it into</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.350" end="00:35:54.420" style="s2">English is like oh wait that&#39;s all we do</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.300" end="00:35:55.890" style="s2">this is really interesting and could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.420" end="00:35:59.970" style="s2">a possibility something that could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.890" end="00:36:01.710" style="s2">made now such things do exist at least</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.970" end="00:36:03.120" style="s2">in the UK such things do already exist</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.710" end="00:36:05.160" style="s2">quite extensively actually there&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.120" end="00:36:06.510" style="s2">a wide network of teachers who share and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.160" end="00:36:07.890" style="s2">use each other&#39;s lesson plans they</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.510" end="00:36:09.840" style="s2">upload them to a website and other</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.890" end="00:36:12.090" style="s2">people can use them if they want to kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.840" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">of think so it does already exist but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.090" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">do agree there&#39;s no international</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:18.810" style="s2">a bigger burden is that internet I feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:23.400" style="s2">might actually you know malcontent I</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.810" end="00:36:26.040" style="s2">know if you go to tes Co UK there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.400" end="00:36:28.620" style="s2">section on there resources and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.040" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s I mean thousands and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.620" end="00:36:33.030" style="s2">thousands of teachers upload lesson</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:34.740" style="s2">plans and tests and all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.030" end="00:36:36.510" style="s2">and as you quite rightly say there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.740" end="00:36:38.580" style="s2">point in 10,000 teachers essentially</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.510" end="00:36:40.020" style="s2">doing exactly the same work right one</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.580" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">person can do it well and everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.020" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">can share it you know me and then tweak</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:46.200" style="s2">it as they want to for their own</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:48.750" style="s2">particular purposes you know so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.200" end="00:36:50.820" style="s2">know I absolutely agree with that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.750" end="00:36:52.380" style="s2">shocking ridiculous waste of time the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.820" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">lack of coordination of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.380" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">thing especially given how standardized</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:58.860" style="s2">the curricular again I speak for the UK</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:01.140" style="s2">you know but basically every single</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.860" end="00:37:02.550" style="s2">school teaches essentially exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.140" end="00:37:04.440" style="s2">same content you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.550" end="00:37:06.630" style="s2">they do exactly the same exams and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.440" end="00:37:07.680" style="s2">are exactly the same basic mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.630" end="00:37:10.950" style="s2">going from plastic plastic plastic</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.680" end="00:37:13.950" style="s2">plastic glass I mean III really I really</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.950" end="00:37:15.720" style="s2">like your idea in it the ideas you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.950" end="00:37:18.840" style="s2">expressed generally throughout this of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.720" end="00:37:23.430" style="s2">sort of blend between a digital library</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.840" end="00:37:24.840" style="s2">and and actual teaching in order me and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.430" end="00:37:27.660" style="s2">I also think the notion that Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.840" end="00:37:29.490" style="s2">mentioned of the tutor role you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.660" end="00:37:32.520" style="s2">guidance thing not the delivering of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.490" end="00:37:34.200" style="s2">content but the guidance thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.520" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">is I think is also a really important</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.200" end="00:37:40.140" style="s2">idea that the idea occurred to me of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:42.300" style="s2">sort of meta learning that needs to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.140" end="00:37:42.990" style="s2">place really quite early in life you</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.300" end="00:37:45.150" style="s2">know where you</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.990" end="00:37:46.980" style="s2">you learn about your learning if you see</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.150" end="00:37:48.690" style="s2">what I mean and so you understand what</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.980" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">works for you and that would allow you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.690" end="00:37:51.720" style="s2">to self tutor to a certain degree I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:52.980" style="s2">not saying you wouldn&#39;t need some</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.720" end="00:37:54.750" style="s2">guidance from the outside as well but</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.980" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">you could do a great deal of self</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.750" end="00:37:58.530" style="s2">tutoring in that respect if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:01.080" style="s2">nice wide open field that you can go but</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.530" end="00:38:03.270" style="s2">but but all of this stuff all of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.080" end="00:38:05.310" style="s2">stuff and this is really my point in</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.270" end="00:38:07.890" style="s2">this section and I&#39;d pretty sure jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.310" end="00:38:10.770" style="s2">knows what&#39;s coming but all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.890" end="00:38:14.850" style="s2">you know none of these innovations are</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.770" end="00:38:18.930" style="s2">possible while the needs to evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.850" end="00:38:20.369" style="s2">outcomes in this current way that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.930" end="00:38:21.869" style="s2">have right we&#39;re you know this is your</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.369" end="00:38:23.490" style="s2">grade point average of this many people</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.869" end="00:38:24.570" style="s2">get a&#39;s and this many people get B&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.490" end="00:38:27.510" style="s2">this many people go to this great</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.570" end="00:38:28.980" style="s2">university most mediocre universities go</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.510" end="00:38:32.940" style="s2">to universities and so on this</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.980" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">whole this whole treadmill thing in my</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.940" end="00:38:38.190" style="s2">opinion revolves around one thing which</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">is the notion of standardized testing</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.190" end="00:38:43.470" style="s2">you know in the UK as GCSEs and a-levels</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:45.780" style="s2">at the ages of 16 and 18 respectively in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.470" end="00:38:48.570" style="s2">the u.s. is the SATs in the UK as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.780" end="00:38:50.100" style="s2">even ages 7 and 11 kids sit these</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.570" end="00:38:52.109" style="s2">standards are you offering the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.100" end="00:38:53.580" style="s2">standardized testing topic just because</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.109" end="00:38:55.619" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about what is possible and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.580" end="00:39:01.970" style="s2">so we can&#39;t we can&#39;t change standardized</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.619" end="00:39:07.140" style="s2">testing right now 10,000 people at</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.970" end="00:39:13.020" style="s2">$100,000 actually probably flip it</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.140" end="00:39:14.970" style="s2">around okay so so MD and standardized</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.020" end="00:39:18.330" style="s2">testing would be one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.970" end="00:39:20.820" style="s2">we could that is a very little money</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.330" end="00:39:22.619" style="s2">zero downside zero risk because if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.820" end="00:39:24.600" style="s2">don&#39;t reach the threshold number then</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.619" end="00:39:26.280" style="s2">nothing happens right and so nobody uses</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.600" end="00:39:28.980" style="s2">anything all the people at our</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.280" end="00:39:30.810" style="s2">maintenance yeah and because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.980" end="00:39:33.960" style="s2">also like even if schools are doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.810" end="00:39:36.330" style="s2">standardized testing having a learning</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.960" end="00:39:38.490" style="s2">system outside but if it was engaging</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.330" end="00:39:40.590" style="s2">enough kids would want to spend an hour</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.490" end="00:39:43.290" style="s2">two four hours on it a week learning</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.590" end="00:39:44.660" style="s2">with their peers or and to me that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.290" end="00:39:49.650" style="s2">something that you can do that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.660" end="00:39:52.470" style="s2">requiring me sorry in addition to their</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.650" end="00:39:54.119" style="s2">six hours of mandatory schooling yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.470" end="00:39:56.290" style="s2">mean if it&#39;s engaging and they do soccer</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.119" end="00:39:57.580" style="s2">they do ballet they DS piano they do</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.290" end="00:39:59.140" style="s2">you don&#39;t I mean like what do you want</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.580" end="00:40:01.080" style="s2">to learn here are other people who want</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.140" end="00:40:03.550" style="s2">to learn that and then facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.080" end="00:40:05.530" style="s2">finding a course or creating a course</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.550" end="00:40:07.630" style="s2">and adults can do that as well right</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.530" end="00:40:09.490" style="s2">it&#39;s saying hey I want to learn many</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.630" end="00:40:10.690" style="s2">stories they say but what about all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.490" end="00:40:12.070" style="s2">parents that you know you should be</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.690" end="00:40:13.330" style="s2">spending all that extra time gaining</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.070" end="00:40:14.500" style="s2">extra credit because you won&#39;t get into</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.330" end="00:40:15.970" style="s2">the top university if you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.500" end="00:40:19.690" style="s2">extra credit blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.970" end="00:40:21.100" style="s2">you know this isn&#39;t about convincing</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.690" end="00:40:23.080" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s only ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.100" end="00:40:25.420" style="s2">right it&#39;s ten thousand parents or ten</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.080" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">thousand kids so it&#39;s about how could I</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.420" end="00:40:29.980" style="s2">get my kid something she&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:31.660" style="s2">without requiring I don&#39;t need her to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.980" end="00:40:33.220" style="s2">get into university I don&#39;t need I want</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.660" end="00:40:35.680" style="s2">her to be happy I want her to be engaged</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.220" end="00:40:37.240" style="s2">I&#39;m you know so what resources could I</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:39.610" style="s2">create with other parents that are like</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.240" end="00:40:41.530" style="s2">me so that I could give that to my kid</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.610" end="00:40:42.700" style="s2">and then I think other people would see</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.530" end="00:40:44.140" style="s2">what that gives to your kid and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.700" end="00:40:46.150" style="s2">would want to be part of it but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.140" end="00:40:47.860" style="s2">not that&#39;s not a guarantee that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.150" end="00:40:49.600" style="s2">hopefully what happens it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.860" end="00:40:51.700" style="s2">Invitational right it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.600" end="00:40:53.230" style="s2">does give you something right away it</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.700" end="00:40:54.700" style="s2">gives the kid enjoyment and learning if</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.230" end="00:40:56.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a feedback system or like wait</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.700" end="00:40:58.570" style="s2">they&#39;re not choosing to be on this I</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.290" end="00:40:59.800" style="s2">have to force them to be on it okay well</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.570" end="00:41:01.060" style="s2">that&#39;s not working what would make it</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.800" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">more fun what would make it more</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.060" end="00:41:06.130" style="s2">engaging oh just to add to what you guys</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:07.870" style="s2">are saying and this could this goes into</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.130" end="00:41:13.030" style="s2">resources as well and I really think</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.870" end="00:41:14.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a simple way to achieve these</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.030" end="00:41:19.990" style="s2">types of things within education</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.560" end="00:41:23.590" style="s2">everything that we&#39;ve mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.990" end="00:41:26.920" style="s2">discriminatory form of psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.590" end="00:41:30.490" style="s2">that&#39;s individualistic the main problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.920" end="00:41:35.410" style="s2">is that people not not teachers mostly</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.490" end="00:41:38.590" style="s2">but institutions lack the basic decency</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.410" end="00:41:42.310" style="s2">and don&#39;t understand the deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.590" end="00:41:45.400" style="s2">complexities of a person&#39;s psyche to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.310" end="00:41:48.550" style="s2">able to even consider that as as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.400" end="00:41:50.950" style="s2">category for making making a curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.550" end="00:41:52.660" style="s2">so well if I just say something like oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.950" end="00:41:55.180" style="s2">you know just tailor it to someone</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.660" end="00:41:56.590" style="s2">psychology the the typical reaction is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.180" end="00:41:58.570" style="s2">like are you nuts how we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.590" end="00:42:03.300" style="s2">that I said well that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.570" end="00:42:07.770" style="s2">you could do that with with $10,000 oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.300" end="00:42:09.780" style="s2">sorry what was it a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.770" end="00:42:11.640" style="s2">yeah see you could do that because all</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.780" end="00:42:14.310" style="s2">you have to do is spark that attitude</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.640" end="00:42:16.970" style="s2">because we are we think it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.310" end="00:42:19.830" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we continue to use</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.970" end="00:42:21.660" style="s2">statistics as a basis for measuring</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.830" end="00:42:23.550" style="s2">people and measuring how things are</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.660" end="00:42:26.520" style="s2">going and having all the grades but in</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.550" end="00:42:28.920" style="s2">fact we&#39;re using statistics on something</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.520" end="00:42:30.330" style="s2">that is very ambiguous when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.920" end="00:42:33.869" style="s2">measurement and that is the human mind</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.330" end="00:42:35.430" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s absurd that we exist in</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.869" end="00:42:38.690" style="s2">this level of reality where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.430" end="00:42:41.910" style="s2">maybe if we just find this one equation</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.690" end="00:42:43.650" style="s2">to kind of simplify how people act in</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.910" end="00:42:45.869" style="s2">groups maybe we could develop a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.650" end="00:42:48.810" style="s2">curriculum it doesn&#39;t work that way and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.869" end="00:42:50.310" style="s2">that&#39;s why I emphasize on the digital</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.810" end="00:42:52.830" style="s2">space because I really think there needs</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.310" end="00:42:55.670" style="s2">to be a form of preservation and a form</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.830" end="00:42:58.500" style="s2">of possibility and infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.670" end="00:43:00.750" style="s2">personalizing to the kids unto the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.500" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">people who are trying to learn and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.750" end="00:43:04.109" style="s2">have to start with the digital first</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:06.810" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.109" end="00:43:09.000" style="s2">preservation space and you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.810" end="00:43:11.880" style="s2">the potential to infinitely personalize</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.000" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">to the person&#39;s leisure to actually help</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.880" end="00:43:17.460" style="s2">them then you cannot create a physical</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:19.500" style="s2">space that will appeal in every single</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.460" end="00:43:22.650" style="s2">thing the person needs psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.500" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s my opinion so let me throw an</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.650" end="00:43:26.040" style="s2">idea out there and it&#39;s kind of building</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.660" end="00:43:30.920" style="s2">on some things that people have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.040" end="00:43:35.760" style="s2">working on and like Khan Academy so</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.920" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">creating an online resource that builds</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.760" end="00:43:42.260" style="s2">a custom curriculum for each individual</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:46.260" style="s2">based on like there&#39;s there&#39;s no honor</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.260" end="00:43:48.690" style="s2">and and in the United States we have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.260" end="00:43:50.609" style="s2">option of doing homeschooling so the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.690" end="00:43:52.920" style="s2">of kind of getting them out of the six</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.609" end="00:43:54.300" style="s2">to eight hour grind of school is you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.920" end="00:43:55.590" style="s2">know you designate your kids as</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.300" end="00:43:57.960" style="s2">homeschooling we make it as easy as</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.590" end="00:43:59.369" style="s2">possible for the parents to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.960" end="00:44:01.859" style="s2">they have resources to find other</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.369" end="00:44:06.030" style="s2">students in the area and other tours in</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.859" end="00:44:08.690" style="s2">the area and the kind of system that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.030" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">tracks what you&#39;ve attempted to learn</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.690" end="00:44:12.990" style="s2">there might have to be a tool</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:15.300" style="s2">temporarily that&#39;s that matches it up</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.990" end="00:44:17.130" style="s2">against the standardized testing and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.300" end="00:44:21.029" style="s2">expectations of the area that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.130" end="00:44:23.489" style="s2">to help make sure that in a way too</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.029" end="00:44:25.439" style="s2">what&#39;s your current interests and bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.489" end="00:44:27.269" style="s2">that in so if you&#39;re learning dance if</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.439" end="00:44:29.309" style="s2">you if you like dancing maybe learning</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.269" end="00:44:30.929" style="s2">about the mathematics of movement and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.309" end="00:44:32.279" style="s2">stuff could help you learn enough about</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.929" end="00:44:35.339" style="s2">the math it&#39;s kind of a thing we&#39;d want</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.279" end="00:44:37.589" style="s2">anyways and then kind of track your</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.339" end="00:44:39.569" style="s2">knowledge skill and help encourage you</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.589" end="00:44:44.369" style="s2">to learn the things necessary to pass</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.569" end="00:44:46.559" style="s2">the standardized tests and then have it</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.369" end="00:44:50.130" style="s2">also include within it some that record</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.559" end="00:44:51.749" style="s2">so that maybe we can get beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.130" end="00:44:54.299" style="s2">whole idea of having go to an Ivy League</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.749" end="00:44:57.269" style="s2">college because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.299" end="00:44:59.309" style="s2">evidence that there&#39;s not an actual</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.269" end="00:45:00.929" style="s2">value in the in the actual education</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.309" end="00:45:04.529" style="s2">there&#39;s a value in having that name on</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.929" end="00:45:08.819" style="s2">your resume but it&#39;s not worth the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.529" end="00:45:11.789" style="s2">cost right now so I think it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.819" end="00:45:13.229" style="s2">solve any of those issues solidly but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.789" end="00:45:14.669" style="s2">would kinda it sounds like it might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.229" end="00:45:16.289" style="s2">good to have kind of a platform like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.669" end="00:45:19.619" style="s2">that that would then allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.289" end="00:45:22.079" style="s2">experiment with Nick&#39;s ideas about sake</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.619" end="00:45:24.449" style="s2">you know using some psychology to to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.079" end="00:45:27.619" style="s2">focus it on what would be best for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.449" end="00:45:29.819" style="s2">student and Eric&#39;s concerns about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.619" end="00:45:33.029" style="s2">about the standardized tests and create</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.819" end="00:45:35.400" style="s2">an alternative and show it working or I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.029" end="00:45:38.539" style="s2">have a area to experiment with stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.400" end="00:45:41.819" style="s2">like that that then later we can use to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.539" end="00:45:44.009" style="s2">convince others of these better</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.819" end="00:45:45.630" style="s2">solutions yeah I don&#39;t know how it is in</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.009" end="00:45:48.059" style="s2">the UK or in the United States but I</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.630" end="00:45:50.929" style="s2">know here in Canada you are allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.059" end="00:45:52.949" style="s2">&#39;unschool your kid you are allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.929" end="00:45:55.679" style="s2">not take them out of standardized</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.949" end="00:45:56.909" style="s2">testing including in school but then of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.679" end="00:45:58.979" style="s2">course they can&#39;t get into University</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.909" end="00:46:00.809" style="s2">and they can&#39;t do those things but also</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.979" end="00:46:02.249" style="s2">just to say that like my kid doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.809" end="00:46:04.199" style="s2">need this my kid can follow their</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.249" end="00:46:05.729" style="s2">passion and do and that&#39;s hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.199" end="00:46:07.709" style="s2">within a system where everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.729" end="00:46:10.859" style="s2">ranked and it comes with a disadvantage</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.709" end="00:46:13.229" style="s2">but when there&#39;s enough people who are</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.859" end="00:46:16.279" style="s2">learning in that way and able to come</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.229" end="00:46:18.989" style="s2">together and find their peers and like</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.279" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">it starts to be omni wind from day one</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.989" end="00:46:22.619" style="s2">like i already can see that after two</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:25.079" style="s2">years of school in the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.619" end="00:46:27.569" style="s2">community what that does for children</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.079" end="00:46:30.900" style="s2">and then and the teenagers that come out</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.569" end="00:46:33.419" style="s2">of that and like they&#39;re ready to be in</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.900" end="00:46:34.470" style="s2">this world in a way that other high</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.419" end="00:46:36.020" style="s2">schoolers aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.470" end="00:46:38.520" style="s2">so although they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.020" end="00:46:40.650" style="s2">credentials to necessarily get into</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.520" end="00:46:44.520" style="s2">university and a lot of them do they</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.650" end="00:46:46.890" style="s2">have the the skill set to be a lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.520" end="00:46:49.800" style="s2">learner and to critique things and to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.890" end="00:46:52.200" style="s2">have their voice heard which is better</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.800" end="00:46:53.940" style="s2">in some ways than having in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.200" end="00:46:58.140" style="s2">ways than having the credentials yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.940" end="00:46:59.700" style="s2">yeah just just to add to that and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.140" end="00:47:02.190" style="s2">this is a problem with almost every</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.700" end="00:47:04.770" style="s2">field of study and and I&#39;ve noticed this</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.190" end="00:47:08.300" style="s2">in game B as well where the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.770" end="00:47:11.460" style="s2">hyper-rational people like to think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.300" end="00:47:13.619" style="s2">we already figured out the secret to how</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.460" end="00:47:16.290" style="s2">to be a person now we can work on all</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.619" end="00:47:18.210" style="s2">the problems of like how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.290" end="00:47:20.250" style="s2">communicate how do we do this but in</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.210" end="00:47:22.680" style="s2">fact we have not found the secret to how</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.250" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">to be a person our own person yet so</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.680" end="00:47:26.790" style="s2">education should have that same thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:29.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like hey I&#39;m still figuring myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.790" end="00:47:31.890" style="s2">out I&#39;m a work in progress I know some</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.130" end="00:47:35.010" style="s2">things and other things I don&#39;t but if</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.890" end="00:47:37.800" style="s2">you look at any field of study including</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.010" end="00:47:40.890" style="s2">education there is still this myth that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.800" end="00:47:42.330" style="s2">it&#39;s like well clearly you&#39;re alive and</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.890" end="00:47:45.750" style="s2">you&#39;re a person and you can think for</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.330" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">yourself that&#39;s enough and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.750" end="00:47:52.619" style="s2">enough if education didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:55.080" style="s2">specific definition of what a person is</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.619" end="00:47:57.180" style="s2">we&#39;re all unique we&#39;re all our own you</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.080" end="00:48:01.700" style="s2">individuals and immediately when we try</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.180" end="00:48:04.020" style="s2">to put personhood as a defined quality</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.700" end="00:48:05.640" style="s2">that&#39;s where things break down and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.020" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">that&#39;s why like how you&#39;re mentioned you</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.640" end="00:48:10.230" style="s2">believe when when we get people in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:12.660" style="s2">kind of environment and when we unschool</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.230" end="00:48:15.690" style="s2">them and we teach them social skills and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.660" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">we just get them in the raw realm of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.690" end="00:48:20.220" style="s2">experience and that&#39;s where things begin</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:23.010" style="s2">to learn that&#39;s where wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.220" end="00:48:25.410" style="s2">curiosity and emotion and thought all</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.010" end="00:48:27.750" style="s2">grow from in order to achieve this</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.410" end="00:48:29.339" style="s2">higher education of like oh yes I want</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.750" end="00:48:33.290" style="s2">to think philosophically I want to think</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.339" end="00:48:36.420" style="s2">about why I&#39;m here you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.290" end="00:48:38.130" style="s2">stable you have to have a stability in</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.420" end="00:48:39.630" style="s2">yourself where you feel like you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.130" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">I&#39;m enough of a person that I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.630" end="00:48:44.339" style="s2">I can I can abstract for myself but most</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:46.890" style="s2">of us if not all of us can and do that</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.339" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">yet and we shouldn&#39;t feel peer pressured</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.890" end="00:48:53.880" style="s2">to feel like we already have that luck</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:56.910" style="s2">I just realized a pretty big hole in my</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.880" end="00:48:58.800" style="s2">suggestion that a lot of people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.910" end="00:48:59.970" style="s2">have the luxury to home-school because</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.800" end="00:49:01.260" style="s2">it still takes a lot of attention or</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.970" end="00:49:04.740" style="s2">someone to watch so you&#39;d still need</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.260" end="00:49:08.280" style="s2">some sort of either either do an actual</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.740" end="00:49:13.170" style="s2">school or have a resource to where</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.280" end="00:49:15.330" style="s2">parents can group together and create a</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.170" end="00:49:17.310" style="s2">space that their children can go during</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.330" end="00:49:20.369" style="s2">the day while they&#39;re head doing their</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.310" end="00:49:22.080" style="s2">game a jobs that they could then</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.369" end="00:49:26.070" style="s2">participate in a situation like this so</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.080" end="00:49:27.660" style="s2">maybe also facilitating those that kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.070" end="00:49:33.800" style="s2">of school replacement for those that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.660" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">need it general point but the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.800" end="00:49:37.650" style="s2">experimentation space to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:40.920" style="s2">several of you have said that in one</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.650" end="00:49:43.859" style="s2">context to another and I wonder whether</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.920" end="00:49:45.900" style="s2">a good first step might not be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.859" end="00:49:47.250" style="s2">about how to create those spaces to</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.900" end="00:49:49.590" style="s2">actually experiment without it impacting</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.250" end="00:49:52.230" style="s2">too much other people do the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.590" end="00:49:54.030" style="s2">you know then that that that freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.230" end="00:49:57.900" style="s2">experiment with stuff feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.030" end="00:49:59.880" style="s2">really good starting point yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.900" end="00:50:02.460" style="s2">like building on what we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.880" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">and with like specific goal of you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.460" end="00:50:06.180" style="s2">the ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">thousand dollars and talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.180" end="00:50:12.060" style="s2">having some sort of like an online you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:15.089" style="s2">know repository or or or marketplace for</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.060" end="00:50:18.050" style="s2">curriculum I think if you like step one</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.089" end="00:50:21.450" style="s2">explicitly try to identify the different</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.050" end="00:50:24.390" style="s2">learning styles and specifically where</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.450" end="00:50:26.460" style="s2">existing education falls flat and focus</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.390" end="00:50:29.070" style="s2">on the areas where typical education</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.460" end="00:50:31.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really handle it that well and</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.070" end="00:50:34.230" style="s2">offer that as a tool to existing people</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.950" end="00:50:36.780" style="s2">and say oh if your kid isn&#39;t doing well</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.230" end="00:50:38.190" style="s2">in math in standardized testing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.780" end="00:50:40.020" style="s2">might be because they don&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.190" end="00:50:43.140" style="s2">one learning style the education focuses</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.020" end="00:50:45.240" style="s2">on here&#39;s another three and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.140" end="00:50:47.160" style="s2">start to help kids a get better at</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.240" end="00:50:48.839" style="s2">Saturday&#39;s to testing with education</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.160" end="00:50:50.970" style="s2">gear towards their learning style and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.839" end="00:50:52.380" style="s2">then also you don&#39;t care about that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.970" end="00:50:55.290" style="s2">you just want to learn it same thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.380" end="00:50:57.060" style="s2">same content there&#39;s yeah you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.290" end="00:50:58.320" style="s2">learning it it&#39;s just do you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.060" end="00:50:59.640" style="s2">learn it because you&#39;re trying to fit</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.320" end="00:51:02.099" style="s2">into standardized testing and you want</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.640" end="00:51:04.380" style="s2">to get into school and et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.099" end="00:51:05.970" style="s2">still helps there or no it&#39;s not a part</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.380" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">of that my kid just shows like you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.970" end="00:51:11.430" style="s2">they want to be an engineer so they need</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:13.079" style="s2">to understand these topics great you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.430" end="00:51:16.200" style="s2">go do that even if your school&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.079" end="00:51:17.849" style="s2">testing for it a lot yeah that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.200" end="00:51:20.609" style="s2">like a really good kind of path for</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.849" end="00:51:22.979" style="s2">creating this is start with augmenting</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.609" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">the current education system with all</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.979" end="00:51:28.890" style="s2">the tools we&#39;ve discussed and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:30.660" style="s2">slowly dominate replace exactly and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.890" end="00:51:32.729" style="s2">if it gets big enough you might actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.660" end="00:51:33.900" style="s2">end up where oh we actually made a deal</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.729" end="00:51:35.579" style="s2">with some you know schools or some</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.900" end="00:51:38.609" style="s2">education where now you can get credits</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.579" end="00:51:40.920" style="s2">for it you get you you actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.609" end="00:51:43.349" style="s2">completed these sets of curriculum you</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.920" end="00:51:44.940" style="s2">can absolutely do do that like there are</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.349" end="00:51:47.579" style="s2">if you make a deal with certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.940" end="00:51:49.529" style="s2">organizations it&#39;s now like yep that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.579" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">counts as a credit all these schools</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.529" end="00:51:52.380" style="s2">will accept it go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:54.690" style="s2">yeah and build it out to where the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.380" end="00:51:57.210" style="s2">schools can also use any of the tools</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.690" end="00:52:00.180" style="s2">that we have and encourage that so that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.210" end="00:52:01.710" style="s2">they can if they choose they can start</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.180" end="00:52:04.650" style="s2">implementing this process internally</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.710" end="00:52:06.630" style="s2">right and then you end up with a like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.650" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">full collection and this might even sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.630" end="00:52:12.390" style="s2">of be related to last week&#39;s topic of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.640" end="00:52:14.579" style="s2">the digital native system where you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.390" end="00:52:15.809" style="s2">old students of that like who actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.579" end="00:52:17.369" style="s2">learned it but we&#39;re like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.809" end="00:52:19.469" style="s2">I didn&#39;t like how the existing</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.369" end="00:52:22.200" style="s2">curriculum taught it like I did terrible</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.469" end="00:52:24.569" style="s2">in school because I didn&#39;t teach like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.200" end="00:52:27.960" style="s2">don&#39;t learn how schools teach and so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.569" end="00:52:29.670" style="s2">struggled through a lot of it and if I</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.960" end="00:52:31.349" style="s2">could then go back especially if there</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.670" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">was some sort of a framework of here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.349" end="00:52:35.160" style="s2">the different ways people learn here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:37.170" style="s2">the areas we have this part covered</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.160" end="00:52:39.539" style="s2">already is the education system if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.170" end="00:52:40.920" style="s2">learned it this way you know by hearing</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.539" end="00:52:42.869" style="s2">information and then you can write a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.920" end="00:52:44.940" style="s2">test if that&#39;s how you learn you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.869" end="00:52:47.579" style="s2">already set we can have some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.940" end="00:52:50.249" style="s2">working but really you&#39;re probably off</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.579" end="00:52:52.739" style="s2">to the race anyway everyone else here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.249" end="00:52:54.269" style="s2">the gaps that we&#39;re trying to fill sorry</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.739" end="00:52:55.769" style="s2">you know if we don&#39;t have these ones yet</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.269" end="00:52:57.390" style="s2">well we&#39;ll just try to get them but if</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.769" end="00:52:58.920" style="s2">you have these two learning styles we</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.390" end="00:53:01.049" style="s2">can help you now oh now we just added</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.920" end="00:53:02.549" style="s2">the third one and the fourth one I start</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.049" end="00:53:04.739" style="s2">to build that content and then start to</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.549" end="00:53:06.059" style="s2">rank of yeah that helps my learning</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.739" end="00:53:08.999" style="s2">style but it&#39;s not a great content oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.059" end="00:53:10.710" style="s2">that one is and I think a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.999" end="00:53:12.420" style="s2">is possibly curating what&#39;s already out</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.710" end="00:53:15.150" style="s2">there and TED Talks and YouTube videos</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.420" end="00:53:15.840" style="s2">in like having a debate for it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.150" end="00:53:18.120" style="s2">here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.840" end="00:53:19.770" style="s2">learn or eat door if it&#39;s for kids</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.120" end="00:53:21.450" style="s2">here&#39;s what my kid wants to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.770" end="00:53:23.340" style="s2">then how you like you said if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.450" end="00:53:25.230" style="s2">interested is interests or ballet and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.340" end="00:53:27.090" style="s2">nine craft there&#39;s a lot you can learn</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.230" end="00:53:28.800" style="s2">with us like here&#39;s how they would might</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.090" end="00:53:30.870" style="s2">learn math and here&#39;s here is someone</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.800" end="00:53:32.850" style="s2">teaching that or and then it can also</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.870" end="00:53:35.130" style="s2">showcase what doesn&#39;t exist right like</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.850" end="00:53:37.860" style="s2">there are no ballerina math YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.130" end="00:53:39.930" style="s2">videos strangely so but then people</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.860" end="00:53:41.430" style="s2">would know to create that right</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.930" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2">guaranteed there&#39;s people who are into</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.430" end="00:53:45.990" style="s2">ballet and math who could make it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:47.010" style="s2">then possibly putting them together with</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.990" end="00:53:51.270" style="s2">someone who knows how to actually make a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.010" end="00:53:54.030" style="s2">youtube video so it sounds a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.270" end="00:53:55.530" style="s2">you want the same cut sort of catalog</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.030" end="00:53:57.240" style="s2">that that we&#39;ve all mentioned I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.530" end="00:53:59.460" style="s2">it&#39;s some form or another</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.240" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">you you track what it&#39;s trying to teach</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.460" end="00:54:04.440" style="s2">you possibly like auxilary things of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:06.690" style="s2">late methods to use right like hey if</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.440" end="00:54:07.860" style="s2">your kid likes minecraft here&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.690" end="00:54:10.170" style="s2">these things on how you can teach</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.860" end="00:54:12.150" style="s2">different topics using minecraft but</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.170" end="00:54:13.980" style="s2">then a specific here&#39;s what this</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.150" end="00:54:16.380" style="s2">curriculum here&#39;s the learning style</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.980" end="00:54:19.020" style="s2">that it is you know trying to help or</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.380" end="00:54:19.410" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to appease or fulfill that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.020" end="00:54:22.290" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.410" end="00:54:24.270" style="s2">and then yeah if you have a essentially</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.290" end="00:54:26.490" style="s2">a database of curriculums</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.270" end="00:54:27.960" style="s2">with these you know topics and learning</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.490" end="00:54:30.930" style="s2">styles you can then say show me the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.960" end="00:54:32.820" style="s2">oh look hey it&#39;s no you know or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.930" end="00:54:34.080" style="s2">one piece of curriculum for you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.820" end="00:54:37.170" style="s2">trying to teach math to somebody with</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.080" end="00:54:39.600" style="s2">this look learning style let&#39;s go great</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.170" end="00:54:41.220" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know this is impossible at</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.600" end="00:54:44.220" style="s2">all with a hundred thousand dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.220" end="00:54:46.050" style="s2">ten thousand people but having like my</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.220" end="00:54:47.310" style="s2">kids on YouTube and she chooses what she</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.050" end="00:54:48.570" style="s2">watches and there&#39;s of course the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.310" end="00:54:51.240" style="s2">YouTube algorithm that tells her the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.570" end="00:54:53.130" style="s2">next one to watch but if it could learn</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.240" end="00:54:56.540" style="s2">that and actually be like oh you like</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.130" end="00:54:59.580" style="s2">Minecraft and LPS here&#39;s math right like</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.540" end="00:55:01.260" style="s2">one that comes up and like add it on to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.580" end="00:55:03.480" style="s2">YouTube where it&#39;s like hey this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.260" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">actually gonna teach them to use they</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.480" end="00:55:13.800" style="s2">like social media like try to get your</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:16.320" style="s2">time but like use it to help people like</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.800" end="00:55:19.080" style="s2">did I just learn relative physics what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.320" end="00:55:21.690" style="s2">going on that&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.080" end="00:55:24.780" style="s2">because I am literally working on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.690" end="00:55:27.300" style="s2">neural network that already has that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.780" end="00:55:28.860" style="s2">specific function the neural network is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.300" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">not created for that function but could</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.860" end="00:55:32.310" style="s2">very easily go</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:35.130" style="s2">in that direction because I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.310" end="00:55:37.010" style="s2">because I&#39;m very interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.130" end="00:55:39.750" style="s2">essence of thought not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.010" end="00:55:41.820" style="s2">computation or complexity but the actual</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.750" end="00:55:43.500" style="s2">quality the substance of thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.820" end="00:55:45.870" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s made out of and how it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.500" end="00:55:47.610" style="s2">operates metaphysically and I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.870" end="00:55:50.220" style="s2">to get the neural network to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.610" end="00:55:53.100" style="s2">move in that direction of like okay if</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.220" end="00:55:55.440" style="s2">this if this is implemented on to me</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.100" end="00:55:56.910" style="s2">well it could lead here and then oh look</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.440" end="00:55:58.710" style="s2">at that that could lead to that and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.910" end="00:56:00.960" style="s2">could lead to all these other branches</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.710" end="00:56:03.480" style="s2">and so that&#39;s literally what the neural</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.960" end="00:56:05.400" style="s2">network does now and it didn&#39;t cost me</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.480" end="00:56:07.350" style="s2">any money you just you just look up free</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.400" end="00:56:09.050" style="s2">neural network programs and and like</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.350" end="00:56:12.120" style="s2">most of this doesn&#39;t require any money</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.050" end="00:56:14.760" style="s2">it just requires a lot of people willing</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.120" end="00:56:17.220" style="s2">to take the time to put in the research</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.760" end="00:56:19.170" style="s2">and then organize and actually be</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.220" end="00:56:22.020" style="s2">activists in that domain but the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.170" end="00:56:24.870" style="s2">difficulty is getting our psychological</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.020" end="00:56:27.420" style="s2">states in tune what we intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.870" end="00:56:30.840" style="s2">want to accomplish and then being able</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.420" end="00:56:33.690" style="s2">to network in a decent way to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.840" end="00:56:36.150" style="s2">convince people that hey I&#39;m authentic</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.690" end="00:56:38.790" style="s2">enough you can trust me we just really</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.150" end="00:56:41.160" style="s2">got a stick with it I really think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.790" end="00:56:49.740" style="s2">those are the two key issues that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.160" end="00:56:52.290" style="s2">have yet to accomplish yet I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.740" end="00:56:54.420" style="s2">to ask we&#39;ve come with a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.290" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">during this this half an hour there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.420" end="00:57:00.200" style="s2">a lot of them very feasible with the ten</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:03.660" style="s2">thousand and hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.200" end="00:57:06.210" style="s2">is there anyone like literally any of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.660" end="00:57:08.130" style="s2">those things I would throw $10 at like</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.210" end="00:57:10.350" style="s2">if that could exist in six months to a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.130" end="00:57:14.250" style="s2">year for me in humanity I would</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.350" end="00:57:16.260" style="s2">absolutely put money towards that am I</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.250" end="00:57:18.420" style="s2">the only one like would you need that to</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.260" end="00:57:19.770" style="s2">be exactly what you wanted it to be like</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.420" end="00:57:21.090" style="s2">all the features you want it to be and</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.770" end="00:57:24.470" style="s2">under features you didn&#39;t in order to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.090" end="00:57:26.310" style="s2">put $10 towards it or would like</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.470" end="00:57:27.780" style="s2">literally any step in the right</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.310" end="00:57:31.830" style="s2">direction I would throw $10 towards</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.780" end="00:57:34.170" style="s2">nobody like that if it seemed like it</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.830" end="00:57:36.300" style="s2">would go there and to be fair a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.170" end="00:57:38.250" style="s2">what we talked about the technical part</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.300" end="00:57:40.740" style="s2">is fairly easy a lot of it is based on</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.250" end="00:57:43.010" style="s2">like being able to categorize and like</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.740" end="00:57:45.710" style="s2">really dissect education and learn</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.010" end="00:57:47.420" style="s2">like most of my assumption was based on</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.710" end="00:57:48.950" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;ve identified and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.420" end="00:57:50.660" style="s2">know we know what the learning styles</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.950" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">are if they&#39;re still a bunch of work</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.660" end="00:57:53.540" style="s2">they&#39;re to be done we can&#39;t do that with</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:55.700" style="s2">a hundred thousand dollars if that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.540" end="00:57:57.020" style="s2">information already exists we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.700" end="00:57:59.450" style="s2">saying oh here&#39;s this you know five</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.020" end="00:58:01.340" style="s2">seven ten learning sales however many</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.450" end="00:58:03.410" style="s2">there are we can just plug that into a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.340" end="00:58:05.270" style="s2">system then it&#39;s actually fairly easy</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.410" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">and then it&#39;s just trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.270" end="00:58:10.910" style="s2">content and possibly find existing</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:13.490" style="s2">content and categorize it yeah and I and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.910" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">I think to jubblies idea just link to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.490" end="00:58:22.550" style="s2">the existing content as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:25.280" style="s2">resource to to store it also it for if</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.550" end="00:58:27.290" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t exist anywhere yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.280" end="00:58:30.020" style="s2">put ten dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.290" end="00:58:32.900" style="s2">towards that with just those goals and</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.020" end="00:58:34.370" style="s2">then you know if I see it completely</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.900" end="00:58:36.710" style="s2">going off the rails that not stop</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.370" end="00:58:38.930" style="s2">funding but I&#39;d definitely be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.710" end="00:58:41.270" style="s2">put some money into a patreon and but</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.930" end="00:58:43.970" style="s2">and I think to get that started you</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.270" end="00:58:45.350" style="s2">would need like a one pager and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.970" end="00:58:47.360" style="s2">ideally it&#39;d be good to have some people</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.350" end="00:58:50.660" style="s2">that have done some work in this space</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.360" end="00:58:53.090" style="s2">be the people trusted to over look the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.660" end="00:58:54.860" style="s2">projects so that I think those are the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.090" end="00:58:57.410" style="s2">two things you need to need a team and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.860" end="00:58:59.210" style="s2">you need a description a one-page</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.410" end="00:59:02.440" style="s2">description yeah we&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.210" end="00:59:06.340" style="s2">gonna do that but you guys like to come</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.440" end="00:59:09.500" style="s2">and then after doing several of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.340" end="00:59:12.980" style="s2">showcasing that like 10,000 people with</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.500" end="00:59:16.010" style="s2">$10 each can change any industry how do</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.980" end="00:59:17.690" style="s2">we get 10,000 people right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.010" end="00:59:19.760" style="s2">actually bring people together to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.690" end="00:59:22.010" style="s2">this conversation and then pick one and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.760" end="00:59:23.720" style="s2">then like work through that process but</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.010" end="00:59:25.880" style="s2">right now it&#39;s just what is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.720" end="00:59:27.470" style="s2">possibility what is the thing we could</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.880" end="00:59:29.600" style="s2">create and we came up with a bun should</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.470" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">it be like organizing what would we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.600" end="00:59:33.380" style="s2">right what would we need to do what are</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:34.490" style="s2">the features and benefits and then what</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.380" end="00:59:36.170" style="s2">would we need for each feature in</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.490" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">benefit right learning styles well there</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.170" end="00:59:39.200" style="s2">needs to be learning styles we need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:41.000" style="s2">know what they are do they exist in</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.200" end="00:59:42.290" style="s2">order to be able to do that and working</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.000" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">through that process which can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.290" end="00:59:48.620" style="s2">in an hour but is absolutely possible</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:50.420" style="s2">all of these things are feasible and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.620" end="00:59:51.800" style="s2">kind of thing especially done out in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.420" end="00:59:56.500" style="s2">open with everyone being able to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.800" end="00:59:56.500" style="s2">involved are amazing</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.810" end="01:00:05.660" style="s2">I agree I think this was a good first</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.300" end="01:00:06.980" style="s2">solution reason I tried it all right to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.660" end="01:00:08.330" style="s2">say goodbye you can say goodbye to</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.980" end="01:00:09.680" style="s2">YouTube unless anyone else has any</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.330" end="01:00:10.780" style="s2">closing thoughts they would like to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.680" end="01:00:15.520" style="s2">on me</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.780" end="01:00:15.520" style="s2">all right goodbye YouTube</p>
