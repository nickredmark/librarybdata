<p begin="00:00:09.050" end="00:00:15.680" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been thinking this week about</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.559" end="00:00:20.210" style="s2">doing this one from once a month on a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.680" end="00:00:20.210" style="s2">continuing basis so</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.440" end="00:00:30.160" style="s2">so I think if I do that I think it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.660" end="00:00:32.770" style="s2">here although it&#39;s harder to rent this</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.160" end="00:00:34.240" style="s2">theater during the academic year but if</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.770" end="00:00:36.010" style="s2">it isn&#39;t here it&#39;ll be somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.240" end="00:00:38.110" style="s2">and because I&#39;d like to continue doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.010" end="00:00:40.720" style="s2">this I&#39;m learning a lot from doing it</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.110" end="00:00:42.160" style="s2">and and once a month would really be</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.720" end="00:00:46.180" style="s2">good because then I could really do the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.160" end="00:00:47.470" style="s2">background work and and I could probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.180" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">do that for a couple of years because</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.470" end="00:00:52.450" style="s2">obviously this is going very quickly but</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.320" end="00:00:54.670" style="s2">that&#39;s okay you know I mean it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.450" end="00:00:56.519" style="s2">go any faster than it can go and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.670" end="00:01:05.590" style="s2">how it that&#39;s how it seems to me anyways</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.519" end="00:01:07.480" style="s2">so this has been this has been a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.590" end="00:01:08.710" style="s2">steep learning curve for me with regards</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.480" end="00:01:10.930" style="s2">to these stories because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.710" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">understand them very well and I got</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.930" end="00:01:15.640" style="s2">better at using the resources on line to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:17.530" style="s2">help me do my background investigation I</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.640" end="00:01:21.390" style="s2">have a lot of books and some of you may</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.530" end="00:01:24.010" style="s2">have noticed that online I posted a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:26.950" style="s2">conversation I had with Jonathan Powell</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.010" end="00:01:30.040" style="s2">and his and his brother Matthew</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.950" end="00:01:31.630" style="s2">I hope it&#39;s Matthew ivory names escape</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.040" end="00:01:33.580" style="s2">me so badly but I believe that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.630" end="00:01:35.650" style="s2">he just finished a book on them on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.580" end="00:01:37.930" style="s2">Bible and so I&#39;ve been doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.650" end="00:01:40.270" style="s2">thinking and talking about these stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.930" end="00:01:42.250" style="s2">trying to understand what they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.270" end="00:01:44.830" style="s2">and and then there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.250" end="00:01:47.370" style="s2">commentaries there&#39;s a great site I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.830" end="00:01:49.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s called Bible hub that has</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.370" end="00:01:52.900" style="s2">every single verse of the Bible is</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.720" end="00:01:55.000" style="s2">listed there and then with each verse</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.900" end="00:01:57.490" style="s2">there are like they&#39;ve aggregated ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.000" end="00:01:58.780" style="s2">commentaries from about ten commentaries</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.490" end="00:02:01.930" style="s2">from over the last four hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.780" end="00:02:04.300" style="s2">and so there&#39;s like a dense page on</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.930" end="00:02:05.560" style="s2">every line and that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.300" end="00:02:08.110" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting about this</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.560" end="00:02:10.929" style="s2">book too is that it&#39;s it&#39;s aggregated so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.110" end="00:02:12.760" style="s2">much commentary that it&#39;s that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.929" end="00:02:14.680" style="s2">much bigger than looks the book is much</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.760" end="00:02:16.150" style="s2">bigger than it looks and so it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.680" end="00:02:18.250" style="s2">very interesting to become familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.150" end="00:02:19.989" style="s2">those two and the fact that this site is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.250" end="00:02:21.430" style="s2">set up with all the commentaries split</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.989" end="00:02:23.290" style="s2">up by verses means you can rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.430" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">compare the commentaries and get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.290" end="00:02:27.129" style="s2">of you know how people have interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:28.510" style="s2">this over while at least several hundred</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.129" end="00:02:30.340" style="s2">years but of course much longer than</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.510" end="00:02:31.870" style="s2">that because the people who wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.340" end="00:02:33.549" style="s2">commentaries were of course reading</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.870" end="00:02:37.439" style="s2">things that were older than that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.549" end="00:02:37.439" style="s2">that&#39;s been very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.659" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">so last week we talked about a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.120" end="00:02:45.659" style="s2">things we talked about how you might</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">understand the idea of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.659" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">encounter and then we also paralleled</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">that with the idea that God disappears</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">in the Old Testament he he boughs out as</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:02:59.189" style="s2">the stories progress and that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">be a an emergent property of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.189" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">sequencing of the stories right because</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:03.989" style="s2">all the books were written by</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:05.670" style="s2">independent people different people and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.989" end="00:03:08.190" style="s2">then they were aggregated by other</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.670" end="00:03:10.049" style="s2">people and so the narrative continuity</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.190" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">is some kind of emergent property that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.049" end="00:03:15.090" style="s2">it&#39;s a consequence of this interaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">between people readers and writers over</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">centuries and it&#39;s it&#39;s strange that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">given that there are also multiple</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.019" end="00:03:23.159" style="s2">coherent narratives that United you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:24.510" style="s2">it&#39;s really it&#39;s really not that easy to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.159" end="00:03:27.989" style="s2">understand that but it does at least</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.510" end="00:03:30.510" style="s2">seem to be the case and so and the third</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.989" end="00:03:34.519" style="s2">thing we talked about was that as God</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.510" end="00:03:37.379" style="s2">bows out so to speak the the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.519" end="00:03:39.180" style="s2">individual personality seems of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.379" end="00:03:40.440" style="s2">characters that are involved the human</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.180" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">characters that are involved seems to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.440" end="00:03:44.609" style="s2">become more and more developed and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:46.410" style="s2">isn&#39;t exactly clear what that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.609" end="00:03:48.449" style="s2">what it means is that God steps away and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.410" end="00:03:51.150" style="s2">man steps forward that&#39;s what it means</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.449" end="00:03:53.400" style="s2">but why it&#39;s arranged like that or they</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.150" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">or they say ultimate significance of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.400" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">that is by no means clear and so so</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:01.470" style="s2">Abraham who we&#39;re going to concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:05.579" style="s2">on today is quite a well-developed</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.470" end="00:04:07.889" style="s2">character and I would say there are two</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.579" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">there multiple endings and beginnings in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.889" end="00:04:13.049" style="s2">the biblical stories the most important</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">ending I suppose is the ending of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.049" end="00:04:18.739" style="s2">the garden of paradise and and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">disenchantment of the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.739" end="00:04:24.120" style="s2">sending forth of Adam and Eve into</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:26.220" style="s2">history right into the future into into</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.120" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">a mode of being that has a future as</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.220" end="00:04:30.990" style="s2">part of it and that has history as part</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:33.030" style="s2">of it and that has the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.990" end="00:04:35.699" style="s2">sacrifice and toil as part of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.030" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">obviously crucial and then that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.699" end="00:04:39.539" style="s2">is replayed with the story of Noah</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">because everything is destroyed and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.539" end="00:04:43.229" style="s2">the world is created anew and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:45.090" style="s2">sacrifices have to be made in order for</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.229" end="00:04:46.830" style="s2">the world to begin and then you see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.090" end="00:04:48.260" style="s2">same thing happen again after the Noah</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.830" end="00:04:50.040" style="s2">story in the Tower of Babel because</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.260" end="00:04:51.990" style="s2">history as we really</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.040" end="00:04:54.120" style="s2">understand history seems to start with</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.990" end="00:04:57.660" style="s2">Abraham because the stories of Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.120" end="00:04:59.490" style="s2">sound like historical stories and no</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.660" end="00:05:01.350" style="s2">scholars debate about the historical</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.490" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">accuracy of the Bible and I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.350" end="00:05:05.850" style="s2">there&#39;s no way of ever determining once</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:08.550" style="s2">and for all the degree to which you</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.850" end="00:05:12.480" style="s2">might regard the accounts as equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.550" end="00:05:15.060" style="s2">to modern empirical history but this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.480" end="00:05:16.500" style="s2">a psychological interpretation of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.060" end="00:05:18.480" style="s2">biblical stories not a historical</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.500" end="00:05:19.650" style="s2">interpretation and it certainly does</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.480" end="00:05:21.750" style="s2">seem to be the case that from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.650" end="00:05:23.450" style="s2">psychological perspective we enter</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.750" end="00:05:25.380" style="s2">something like the domain of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.450" end="00:05:26.820" style="s2">conceptualization relatively modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.380" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">conceptualization of history with</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.820" end="00:05:32.010" style="s2">Abraham beyond the accounts of divine</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:33.960" style="s2">commands that Abraham carries out this</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.240" end="00:05:42.060" style="s2">worth reading the narrative also</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.770" end="00:05:44.580" style="s2">includes a variety of stories in which</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.380" end="00:06:10.350" style="s2">really struck by reading this in depth</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.900" end="00:06:13.290" style="s2">and read the commentary is how much like</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.350" end="00:06:16.200" style="s2">a story about a person it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.290" end="00:06:18.870" style="s2">Abraham isn&#39;t a divine figure in any in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.200" end="00:06:20.250" style="s2">any archetypal sense precisely when he</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.870" end="00:06:23.670" style="s2">has archetypal elements because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.250" end="00:06:25.890" style="s2">also obviously the founder of a nation</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.670" end="00:06:28.500" style="s2">but fundamentally he&#39;s a human being and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.890" end="00:06:30.360" style="s2">and he makes he has the adventures and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.500" end="00:06:32.280" style="s2">he makes the mistakes of a human being</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.360" end="00:06:35.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s it&#39;s the mistake part that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.280" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">really struck me you know because it did</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.400" end="00:06:41.040" style="s2">I was talking with a friend of mine this</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:43.740" style="s2">week Norman Doidge who&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.040" end="00:06:45.450" style="s2">remarkable person in many ways and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.740" end="00:06:46.890" style="s2">was taking me to task he was reading my</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.450" end="00:06:49.110" style="s2">book which I&#39;m going to publish sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.890" end="00:06:51.720" style="s2">which will be out in January and in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.110" end="00:06:53.100" style="s2">the book I in one section I contrasted</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.720" end="00:06:55.560" style="s2">the God of the Old Testament with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.100" end="00:06:57.750" style="s2">god of the New Testament and made the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.560" end="00:06:59.130" style="s2">case sort of based on north of Freud&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.750" end="00:07:01.919" style="s2">ideas that the God of the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.130" end="00:07:03.150" style="s2">was really harsh and judgmental you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.919" end="00:07:03.980" style="s2">and that the god of the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.150" end="00:07:07.220" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.980" end="00:07:08.930" style="s2">more merciful and you know at least to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.220" end="00:07:11.300" style="s2">some degree more sweetness and light and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.930" end="00:07:13.730" style="s2">Norman took me to task about that saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.300" end="00:07:15.230" style="s2">that that was a overly Christianized</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.730" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">interpretation which would make sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.230" end="00:07:19.370" style="s2">because I derived it in part from</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">Northrop Frye and I really have come to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.370" end="00:07:22.970" style="s2">understand that more that he&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:26.060" style="s2">because that he&#39;s right about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.970" end="00:07:27.920" style="s2">because the God in the Old Testament is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.060" end="00:07:29.390" style="s2">actually far more merciful than he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.920" end="00:07:30.610" style="s2">generally made out to be and you really</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.390" end="00:07:33.860" style="s2">see this with it&#39;s good news</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.610" end="00:07:36.260" style="s2">fundamentally if you regard the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.860" end="00:07:38.060" style="s2">representation of God as somehow key to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.260" end="00:07:39.740" style="s2">the description of being itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.060" end="00:07:42.830" style="s2">I mean Abraham makes a lot of mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.740" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">you know serious mistakes and and yet he</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:46.610" style="s2">has a life and he&#39;s and he&#39;s blessed by</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:48.620" style="s2">God despite the fact that he&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.610" end="00:07:50.420" style="s2">deeply flawed and engages in deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.620" end="00:07:52.010" style="s2">practice I mean he&#39;s a good man but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.420" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">not a perfect man by any stretch of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.010" end="00:07:55.430" style="s2">imagination and and things work out</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:57.260" style="s2">really well for him and he&#39;s the founder</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.430" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">of the nation and all of that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.260" end="00:08:01.220" style="s2">good news for everyone because perfect</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:05.510" style="s2">people are very very hard to find and if</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.220" end="00:08:08.450" style="s2">the only pathway to having a rich and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.510" end="00:08:10.310" style="s2">meaningful life was through perfection</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.450" end="00:08:12.680" style="s2">then we would all be in deep trouble and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.310" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">so that that&#39;s very satisfying to read</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.680" end="00:08:17.960" style="s2">that and the other the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:19.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve been struck by is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.960" end="00:08:22.370" style="s2">Abraham and I think this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.730" end="00:08:24.260" style="s2">absolutely key to the interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.370" end="00:08:27.260" style="s2">the story Abraham goes out and does</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.260" end="00:08:28.760" style="s2">things that&#39;s the thing and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.260" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve noticed in my life</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.760" end="00:08:34.910" style="s2">is that nothing I&#39;ve ever done was</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:37.390" style="s2">wasted and by done I mean put my heart</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.910" end="00:08:40.150" style="s2">and soul into you know like like</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.390" end="00:08:42.680" style="s2">attempted with with all of my effort</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.150" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">that always worked now it didn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.680" end="00:08:46.490" style="s2">work the way I expected it to work</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:48.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different issue but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.490" end="00:08:51.080" style="s2">payoff from it was always positive I</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.770" end="00:08:53.180" style="s2">always something always a something of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.080" end="00:08:54.980" style="s2">value always accrued to me when I made</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.180" end="00:08:57.740" style="s2">the sacrifices necessary to do something</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.980" end="00:08:59.690" style="s2">worthwhile and so I think part of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.740" end="00:09:02.300" style="s2">message in in this in the story of a and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.690" end="00:09:06.020" style="s2">the Abrahamic stories is go do something</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.300" end="00:09:07.430" style="s2">and and I thought about this in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.020" end="00:09:08.870" style="s2">variety of ways outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.430" end="00:09:10.430" style="s2">interpretation of this story because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.870" end="00:09:12.470" style="s2">have this program some of you might be</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.430" end="00:09:14.750" style="s2">familiar with which is called future</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.470" end="00:09:16.520" style="s2">authoring program and it&#39;s it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.750" end="00:09:18.529" style="s2">to help people</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.520" end="00:09:20.600" style="s2">make a plan for three to five years into</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.529" end="00:09:23.810" style="s2">the future you know and we so what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.600" end="00:09:25.490" style="s2">do is you you answer some questions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.810" end="00:09:27.589" style="s2">a writing program you know answer some</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.490" end="00:09:29.510" style="s2">questions about how you would like your</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.589" end="00:09:31.730" style="s2">life to be what you would like your</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.510" end="00:09:33.470" style="s2">character to be three to five years down</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.730" end="00:09:35.029" style="s2">the road if you were taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.470" end="00:09:36.980" style="s2">yourself like you were taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.029" end="00:09:38.450" style="s2">someone that you actually cared about so</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.980" end="00:09:40.820" style="s2">you kind of have to split yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.450" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">two people and treat yourself like you</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.820" end="00:09:44.149" style="s2">like someone you have respect for and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:45.380" style="s2">that you want the best for now it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.149" end="00:09:47.330" style="s2">easy because people don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.380" end="00:09:48.950" style="s2">have respect for themselves and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.330" end="00:09:50.750" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily want what&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.950" end="00:09:52.220" style="s2">for themselves because they have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.750" end="00:09:53.899" style="s2">of self contempt and a lot of self</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.220" end="00:09:56.649" style="s2">hatred a lot of guilt and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.899" end="00:09:58.670" style="s2">existential angst and and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.649" end="00:10:00.440" style="s2">self-consciousness and all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.670" end="00:10:02.360" style="s2">and so people don&#39;t necessarily take</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.440" end="00:10:04.279" style="s2">care of themselves very well and and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.360" end="00:10:06.350" style="s2">think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s I think you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.279" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">an obligation it&#39;s one of the highest</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.350" end="00:10:11.000" style="s2">moral obligations to treat yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:13.580" style="s2">if you&#39;re a creature of value and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.000" end="00:10:15.380" style="s2">that is in some sense it&#39;s in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.580" end="00:10:16.490" style="s2">that&#39;s independent of your actions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.380" end="00:10:19.399" style="s2">you might think about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.490" end="00:10:21.140" style="s2">metaphorically as a recognition of your</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.399" end="00:10:23.870" style="s2">divine worth in the biblical sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.140" end="00:10:26.120" style="s2">regardless of your of your sins so to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.870" end="00:10:27.620" style="s2">speak and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.120" end="00:10:29.300" style="s2">powerful language as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.620" end="00:10:31.520" style="s2">concerned once you understand it anyways</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.300" end="00:10:34.010" style="s2">with the self authoring program the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.520" end="00:10:37.490" style="s2">future authoring program you you ask you</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.010" end="00:10:38.839" style="s2">answer questions about what what how you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.490" end="00:10:40.490" style="s2">would like your friendships to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.839" end="00:10:41.930" style="s2">conducted because it&#39;s useful to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.490" end="00:10:43.430" style="s2">surround yourself with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.930" end="00:10:45.649" style="s2">trying to move forward and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.430" end="00:10:47.510" style="s2">importantly who are happy when you move</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.649" end="00:10:49.730" style="s2">forward and not happy when you move back</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.510" end="00:10:51.290" style="s2">backwards not when you fall that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.730" end="00:10:52.670" style="s2">what I mean but when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.290" end="00:10:54.140" style="s2">self-destructive things your friends</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.670" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be there to cheer you on and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.140" end="00:10:58.220" style="s2">because then they&#39;re really not acting</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:00.140" style="s2">like friends obviously you know I know</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.220" end="00:11:01.610" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious but it still happens all</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.140" end="00:11:03.500" style="s2">the time and people allow it to happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.610" end="00:11:06.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not a good idea and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.500" end="00:11:08.060" style="s2">would you like to sort your family out</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.110" end="00:11:09.770" style="s2">and I was thinking about this this week</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.060" end="00:11:12.170" style="s2">too because I was thinking about Noah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.770" end="00:11:13.579" style="s2">Ark and there was a phrase in that story</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.170" end="00:11:15.709" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t understand which was that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.579" end="00:11:18.140" style="s2">Noah was perfect in his generations I</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.709" end="00:11:19.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that means you know when</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.140" end="00:11:21.079" style="s2">you&#39;re when you&#39;re going through a book</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.640" end="00:11:22.279" style="s2">like the Bible if you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.079" end="00:11:23.959" style="s2">the phrase that actually means you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.279" end="00:11:25.760" style="s2">missed something it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.959" end="00:11:27.199" style="s2">that&#39;s just not you know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:29.300" style="s2">germane to the story it means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.199" end="00:11:30.700" style="s2">stupid you didn&#39;t get it man</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.300" end="00:11:34.900" style="s2">you didn&#39;t get it you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.700" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">standard and so the idea that Noah was</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.900" end="00:11:38.770" style="s2">perfect in his generations and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:41.740" style="s2">why he could build an ark that would</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.770" end="00:11:43.840" style="s2">sustain him and him and and humanity</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.740" end="00:11:46.060" style="s2">itself through the flood it meant that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.840" end="00:11:47.590" style="s2">he not only did he walk with God which</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.060" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">is something that we talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.590" end="00:11:51.310" style="s2">context of the Sermon on the Mount but</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:54.010" style="s2">he established proper relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.310" end="00:11:55.930" style="s2">his family with his children and so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.010" end="00:11:58.420" style="s2">that meant was that his not only was he</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.930" end="00:11:59.890" style="s2">well integrated as a person but his</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.420" end="00:12:01.450" style="s2">level of integration had reached the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.890" end="00:12:04.030" style="s2">point where it stretched out beyond him</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.450" end="00:12:05.800" style="s2">and encompassed his family and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.030" end="00:12:07.510" style="s2">Noah and the family that was in the ark</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.800" end="00:12:09.280" style="s2">and I can tell you and I really</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.510" end="00:12:11.110" style="s2">understood this this year because I had</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.280" end="00:12:12.910" style="s2">a very tumultuous year you could think</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.110" end="00:12:14.530" style="s2">about it from a personal perspective I</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.910" end="00:12:16.870" style="s2">could think about it as a year that had</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.530" end="00:12:19.510" style="s2">no shortage of floods and might and part</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.870" end="00:12:21.280" style="s2">of the reason that I was able to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.510" end="00:12:23.740" style="s2">through it I also had terrible health</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.280" end="00:12:25.330" style="s2">problems and one of the reasons I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.740" end="00:12:27.790" style="s2">able to get through it was because my</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.330" end="00:12:30.430" style="s2">family really came together around me my</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.790" end="00:12:34.420" style="s2">kids my wife my parents and my friends</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.430" end="00:12:37.870" style="s2">as well and particularly a certain group</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.420" end="00:12:39.400" style="s2">of friends and that&#39;s partly all of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.870" end="00:12:40.600" style="s2">came together in my mind that&#39;s we can I</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.400" end="00:12:43.390" style="s2">thought well that&#39;s what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.600" end="00:12:44.650" style="s2">perfect in his generations meant that he</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.390" end="00:12:47.550" style="s2">hadn&#39;t just straightened himself out</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.650" end="00:12:50.290" style="s2">he&#39;d also straightened out his</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.550" end="00:12:52.150" style="s2">relationships with his family and I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.290" end="00:12:54.850" style="s2">tell you that when crisis strikes you</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.150" end="00:12:56.650" style="s2">which it will it will the flood will</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.850" end="00:12:58.390" style="s2">come right that&#39;s why the apocalypse is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.650" end="00:13:00.190" style="s2">always upon us the flood will definitely</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.390" end="00:13:02.050" style="s2">come in your life and to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.190" end="00:13:04.420" style="s2">you&#39;ve organized yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.050" end="00:13:06.220" style="s2">psychologically and also healed the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.420" end="00:13:07.810" style="s2">relationships between you and your</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.220" end="00:13:09.670" style="s2">family that could be the critical</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.810" end="00:13:11.560" style="s2">element that that determines whether you</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.670" end="00:13:13.240" style="s2">live or die when a crisis comes or or</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.560" end="00:13:15.520" style="s2">whether someone in your family lives or</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.240" end="00:13:17.860" style="s2">dies and so the idea of the Ark</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.520" end="00:13:19.690" style="s2">containing the man who&#39;s who walks with</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.860" end="00:13:22.030" style="s2">God and who&#39;s generations are perfect</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.690" end="00:13:23.590" style="s2">and that that&#39;s what sustains humanity</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.030" end="00:13:25.270" style="s2">through the crisis it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.590" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be more psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.270" end="00:13:30.250" style="s2">accurate than that no the other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:32.140" style="s2">was thinking about this weekend I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.250" end="00:13:33.880" style="s2">thinking about another line in the New</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.140" end="00:13:35.890" style="s2">Testament I think it&#39;s from the Sermon</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.880" end="00:13:39.730" style="s2">on the Mount but I&#39;m not absolutely sure</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.890" end="00:13:41.710" style="s2">Christ compares the Kingdom of Heaven to</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.730" end="00:13:43.660" style="s2">a mustard seed and so I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.710" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">about a mustard seed as a very tiny seed</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.660" end="00:13:47.660" style="s2">and it grows into</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:50.360" style="s2">a spectacular complex plant and I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.660" end="00:13:52.190" style="s2">thinking about how you should operate in</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.360" end="00:13:54.139" style="s2">the world in order to make it a better</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.190" end="00:13:55.790" style="s2">place assuming that that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.139" end="00:13:58.579" style="s2">should be doing and that is what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.790" end="00:14:00.920" style="s2">should be doing and there&#39;s lots in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.579" end="00:14:03.170" style="s2">world to fix everything that bothers you</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.920" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">about the world and about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.170" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">should be fixed and you can do that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:11.870" style="s2">my dawning realization I have a friend</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:14.180" style="s2">he is in Montreal his name is James</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.870" end="00:14:15.740" style="s2">Simon he&#39;s a great painter and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.180" end="00:14:17.510" style="s2">taught me a lot of things helped he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.740" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">helped me design my house and beautify</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.510" end="00:14:23.060" style="s2">it and I bought some paintings from him</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:24.620" style="s2">a couple of years ago and he did this</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.060" end="00:14:27.230" style="s2">series of paintings where he went around</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.620" end="00:14:29.839" style="s2">North America and and stood in different</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.230" end="00:14:33.170" style="s2">places and then he painted the view from</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">here down and so it&#39;s his feet planted</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.170" end="00:14:37.610" style="s2">in different places on roads in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:39.199" style="s2">desert on the ocean I have one actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.610" end="00:14:42.829" style="s2">hanging over my toilet which is him</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.199" end="00:14:44.269" style="s2">standing at a urinal yeah well you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.829" end="00:14:46.550" style="s2">he was trying to make a point and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.269" end="00:14:47.959" style="s2">point was that wherever you are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.550" end="00:14:49.699" style="s2">worth paying attention and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.959" end="00:14:52.490" style="s2">because you know so all these places</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.699" end="00:14:54.019" style="s2">that he visited he looked exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.490" end="00:14:56.180" style="s2">he was from standing by the side of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.019" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">road in the desert sort of mundane in</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.180" end="00:15:00.230" style="s2">some sense but then maybe he put 40</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:02.149" style="s2">hours into that painting you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.230" end="00:15:04.310" style="s2">very very realistic painting with really</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.149" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">good light and what he&#39;s telling you as</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.310" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">a painter is everything is worth paying</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:11.000" style="s2">attention to an infinite amount but you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.959" end="00:15:12.649" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough time so the artist</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.000" end="00:15:14.329" style="s2">does that for you right the artist looks</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.649" end="00:15:16.430" style="s2">and looks and looks and looks and looks</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.329" end="00:15:17.720" style="s2">and then gives you that vision and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.430" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">then you can look at the painting and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.720" end="00:15:22.670" style="s2">reminds you that right where you are is</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:24.769" style="s2">there&#39;s every everything that there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.670" end="00:15:26.540" style="s2">is right where you are and that&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.769" end="00:15:29.899" style="s2">thing to realize but it&#39;s actually true</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.540" end="00:15:32.029" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve been telling people online</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.899" end="00:15:33.829" style="s2">in various ways and in lectures that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.029" end="00:15:36.230" style="s2">they should start fixing up the world by</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.829" end="00:15:37.760" style="s2">cleaning up their room and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.230" end="00:15:39.980" style="s2">just elaborate on that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.760" end="00:15:43.760" style="s2">before I get back to the lecture itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.980" end="00:15:48.829" style="s2">so as it&#39;s becoming this internet weird</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.760" end="00:15:51.380" style="s2">internet meme you know and and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.829" end="00:15:52.850" style="s2">a joke and good it&#39;s a joke I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.380" end="00:15:54.890" style="s2">happy about the fact that so much of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.850" end="00:15:56.839" style="s2">this has got like the leaving of humor</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.890" end="00:15:58.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s really important because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.839" end="00:16:01.200" style="s2">what stops things from degenerate</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.350" end="00:16:03.510" style="s2">getting into into conflict humor and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.200" end="00:16:04.980" style="s2">was thinking about this idea of cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.510" end="00:16:07.320" style="s2">up your room in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.980" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">mustard seed idea and you see the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.320" end="00:16:11.250" style="s2">about cleaning up your room this is also</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:14.250" style="s2">something I learned from Carl Jung and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.250" end="00:16:16.410" style="s2">his study is on alchemy because for Jung</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.250" end="00:16:18.120" style="s2">when the alchemist was attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.410" end="00:16:19.890" style="s2">make the philosopher&#39;s stone he was not</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.120" end="00:16:21.510" style="s2">only engaged in the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.890" end="00:16:23.760" style="s2">the material world but he was engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.510" end="00:16:26.790" style="s2">the process of self transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.760" end="00:16:28.440" style="s2">occurred at the same time as the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.790" end="00:16:30.540" style="s2">chemical Trent as the chemical</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.440" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">transformation so the psychological work</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.540" end="00:16:34.380" style="s2">in some sense let&#39;s say you want to sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:36.120" style="s2">out your room and beautify it because</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.380" end="00:16:37.590" style="s2">the beauty is also important and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.120" end="00:16:39.450" style="s2">say that all you have is just a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.590" end="00:16:41.400" style="s2">room like you&#39;re not rich you&#39;re poor</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.450" end="00:16:42.630" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have any power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.400" end="00:16:44.730" style="s2">another thing but you&#39;ve got your damn</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.630" end="00:16:46.980" style="s2">room and you&#39;ve got this space right in</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.730" end="00:16:48.990" style="s2">front of you you know that that&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.980" end="00:16:50.940" style="s2">of the cosmos that you can come to grips</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.990" end="00:16:52.620" style="s2">with and you might think well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.940" end="00:16:54.570" style="s2">there in front of you right in front of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.620" end="00:16:56.280" style="s2">you and the answer to that is it depends</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.570" end="00:16:58.500" style="s2">on how open your eyes are that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.280" end="00:17:01.110" style="s2">the proper answer because you could say</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.500" end="00:17:02.940" style="s2">and William Blake said this for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.110" end="00:17:05.010" style="s2">Aldous Huxley made comments that were</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.940" end="00:17:07.110" style="s2">very similar that in a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.010" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">state you can see infinity in the finite</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.110" end="00:17:10.770" style="s2">and you might say well you can say and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:12.990" style="s2">you can see infinity and what you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.770" end="00:17:14.460" style="s2">within your grasp if you look and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.990" end="00:17:17.160" style="s2">could say maybe that&#39;s the case with</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.460" end="00:17:18.930" style="s2">your room and so you want to clean up</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.160" end="00:17:21.540" style="s2">your room well okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.930" end="00:17:24.690" style="s2">how do you do that exactly well a room</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.540" end="00:17:26.340" style="s2">is a room is a place to sleep and so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.690" end="00:17:27.690" style="s2">you say your room ups properly then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.340" end="00:17:29.550" style="s2">figure out how to sleep and when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.690" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">should sleep and how you should sleep</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.550" end="00:17:32.700" style="s2">and then you figure out when you should</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:33.930" style="s2">wake up and then you figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.700" end="00:17:35.340" style="s2">clothes you should wear because they</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.930" end="00:17:36.660" style="s2">have to be arranged properly in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.340" end="00:17:38.190" style="s2">dresser then you have to have some place</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.660" end="00:17:39.180" style="s2">to put your clothes and you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.190" end="00:17:40.170" style="s2">have some clothes you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.180" end="00:17:42.840" style="s2">what you&#39;re going to wear those clothes</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.170" end="00:17:43.950" style="s2">to do right and then that means you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.840" end="00:17:45.960" style="s2">to figure out what you&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.950" end="00:17:47.730" style="s2">and then your room has to serve that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.960" end="00:17:50.010" style="s2">purpose because otherwise it doesn&#39;t set</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.730" end="00:17:52.830" style="s2">up properly and if it doesn&#39;t set up if</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.010" end="00:17:54.990" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t serve your purposes you will</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.830" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">be unhappy and not happy in the room</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.990" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">because the way that we perceive the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:03.990" style="s2">world is as a place to move from point A</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:06.180" style="s2">to point B in and then if the place that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.990" end="00:18:07.800" style="s2">were in facilitates that movement then</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.180" end="00:18:09.960" style="s2">we&#39;re happy to be there and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.800" end="00:18:12.300" style="s2">place that we&#39;re in serves as an</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.960" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">obstacle to that movement then we run</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.300" end="00:18:15.960" style="s2">happy to be there and so what it means</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:17.790" style="s2">to set up your room is that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.960" end="00:18:19.650" style="s2">have somewhere to go that&#39;s worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.790" end="00:18:21.000" style="s2">or you can&#39;t set up your room and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.650" end="00:18:23.820" style="s2">your room has to be set up to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.000" end="00:18:25.770" style="s2">that and then the next thing is well</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.820" end="00:18:27.150" style="s2">maybe you have to make it beautiful but</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.770" end="00:18:29.310" style="s2">that&#39;s not easy right that means you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.150" end="00:18:30.840" style="s2">have to have some taste and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.310" end="00:18:33.540" style="s2">mean you have to have money it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.840" end="00:18:36.510" style="s2">because you can be garish with money and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.540" end="00:18:38.580" style="s2">you can be tasteful with nothing all you</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.510" end="00:18:40.200" style="s2">need is taste and taste beats money when</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.580" end="00:18:41.850" style="s2">it comes to beautifying things you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.200" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">I mean not that money is trivial because</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.850" end="00:18:46.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not the taste is crucial and people</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:48.360" style="s2">who are very artistically oriented can</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.710" end="00:18:50.460" style="s2">make beautiful things out of virtually</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.360" end="00:18:52.020" style="s2">nothing and not only that the literature</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.460" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">suggests that if you&#39;re going to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.020" end="00:18:55.650" style="s2">beautiful things putting real</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:58.140" style="s2">constraints on on what you allow</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.650" end="00:19:00.060" style="s2">yourself to do facilitates creativity</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.140" end="00:19:01.800" style="s2">instead of interfering with it because</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.060" end="00:19:03.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say you have to make something out</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.800" end="00:19:06.390" style="s2">of nothing right which I suppose would</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.960" end="00:19:08.010" style="s2">be a godly act right you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.390" end="00:19:10.110" style="s2">something out of nothing it you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.010" end="00:19:13.290" style="s2">be creative in order to do that and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.110" end="00:19:14.670" style="s2">then to beautify your room means that</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.290" end="00:19:16.890" style="s2">you also have to develop your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.670" end="00:19:20.910" style="s2">to be creative and so then you can make</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.890" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">your room shines but then what will</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.910" end="00:19:23.940" style="s2">happen is that if your family isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:26.130" style="s2">together they will interfere with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.940" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll interfere with that because you</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.130" end="00:19:28.860" style="s2">won&#39;t have the discipline to do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:31.650" style="s2">properly but then when you start</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.860" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">building this is this little microcosm</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.650" end="00:19:36.780" style="s2">of perfection with what you have at hand</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">and Italy evoke all the pathologies of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.780" end="00:19:39.330" style="s2">everyone in your household they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:40.800" style="s2">wonder what the hell you&#39;re up to in</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.330" end="00:19:43.590" style="s2">there and they won&#39;t necessarily be</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.800" end="00:19:45.660" style="s2">happy because if you&#39;re if they&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.590" end="00:19:47.340" style="s2">lowly place let&#39;s say and so are you and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.660" end="00:19:49.710" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to move out of that then</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.340" end="00:19:52.230" style="s2">the higher you move out of that the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.710" end="00:19:53.430" style="s2">the place they&#39;re in looks bad and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.230" end="00:19:55.950" style="s2">might say well what they should do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.430" end="00:19:57.450" style="s2">celebrate your victory over chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.950" end="00:19:58.740" style="s2">evil but that isn&#39;t what will happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.450" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">what will happen instead is that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.740" end="00:20:03.210" style="s2">will attempt to pull you back down</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:05.460" style="s2">they&#39;ll attempt to and I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.210" end="00:20:08.190" style="s2">all families don&#39;t do that but but all</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.460" end="00:20:10.650" style="s2">families do that to some degree and some</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.190" end="00:20:12.450" style="s2">families do almost nothing but that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.650" end="00:20:15.180" style="s2">so what that means is that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.450" end="00:20:16.950" style="s2">going to organize your room then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.180" end="00:20:19.320" style="s2">going to have to confront the devil&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.950" end="00:20:20.910" style="s2">your house and that&#39;s often that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.320" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">a terrifying thing because some of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.910" end="00:20:25.670" style="s2">Devils have have lineages that go back</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:27.320" style="s2">many many many generations</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.670" end="00:20:28.970" style="s2">and god only knows what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.320" end="00:20:33.020" style="s2">struggle with in order to overcome that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.970" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">and so and so to sort your self out and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.020" end="00:20:37.850" style="s2">to fix up your room is a non trivial</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:39.890" style="s2">matter you know and you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.850" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll learn by doing that and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.890" end="00:20:42.920" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ll learn enough by doing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:44.660" style="s2">so that you can fix up your family a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.920" end="00:20:46.370" style="s2">little bit and then having done that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.660" end="00:20:48.440" style="s2">you&#39;ll have enough character so that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.370" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">when you try to operate in the world at</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.440" end="00:20:52.730" style="s2">your job or maybe in the broader social</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.350" style="s2">spheres that you&#39;ll be a force for good</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.730" end="00:20:56.930" style="s2">instead of harm because you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.350" end="00:20:58.820" style="s2">learned some humility by noting just how</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.930" end="00:21:00.950" style="s2">difficult it was to put your damn room</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.820" end="00:21:03.080" style="s2">together well and yourself for that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.950" end="00:21:04.580" style="s2">matter and so you&#39;ll proceed cautiously</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.080" end="00:21:08.930" style="s2">with your eyes open</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.580" end="00:21:10.490" style="s2">towards the good and so well those are</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.930" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">some of the things I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.490" end="00:21:13.700" style="s2">about this week and they&#39;re Jermaine</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:15.020" style="s2">they&#39;re like they&#39;re germane to what</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.700" end="00:21:17.210" style="s2">we&#39;re going to discuss tonight because</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.020" end="00:21:19.550" style="s2">what happens at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.210" end="00:21:23.780" style="s2">abrahamic stories is basically God comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.550" end="00:21:26.210" style="s2">to Abraham and just says go get going</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.780" end="00:21:28.160" style="s2">man do something do something get going</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.210" end="00:21:31.490" style="s2">and you might think well where should I</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.160" end="00:21:33.350" style="s2">go and God God is somewhat vague about</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.490" end="00:21:35.300" style="s2">that and where he sends Abraham it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.350" end="00:21:37.400" style="s2">real fixer-upper man it&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.300" end="00:21:39.320" style="s2">starvation there and there&#39;s tyranny and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.400" end="00:21:42.050" style="s2">there&#39;s and there&#39;s marital dissolution</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.320" end="00:21:43.580" style="s2">and there&#39;s deceit like it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.050" end="00:21:45.890" style="s2">like where you live you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.580" end="00:21:48.680" style="s2">exactly the same thing it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.890" end="00:21:50.690" style="s2">tyranny and catastrophe so that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.680" end="00:21:52.850" style="s2">know the the great the tyrannical Great</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.690" end="00:21:55.210" style="s2">Father because because Abraham ends up</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.850" end="00:21:57.650" style="s2">having to sojourn in Egypt and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.210" end="00:21:59.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a famine and so mother nature is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.650" end="00:22:02.120" style="s2">on the rampage and Abraham lies about</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.780" end="00:22:04.010" style="s2">his wife as we&#39;ll see and so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.120" end="00:22:06.650" style="s2">world it&#39;s the world it&#39;s tyranny and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.010" end="00:22:09.470" style="s2">and vulnerability and deceit and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.650" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">other God says Gold because if you do go</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.470" end="00:22:14.450" style="s2">then you&#39;ll become a father of Nations</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:15.890" style="s2">and you think well again that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.450" end="00:22:17.870" style="s2">good news although it&#39;s strange because</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.890" end="00:22:19.970" style="s2">you&#39;d expect that if God chose Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.870" end="00:22:22.490" style="s2">then he&#39;d send it immediately to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.970" end="00:22:23.810" style="s2">land of honey land of milk and honey and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.490" end="00:22:26.120" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what happens at all it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.810" end="00:22:28.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen at all and Abraham never</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.120" end="00:22:31.220" style="s2">gets there but his mission is still</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.610" end="00:22:32.990" style="s2">regarded as divine and thank God for</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.220" end="00:22:34.550" style="s2">that because that&#39;s what your mission</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.990" end="00:22:35.860" style="s2">will be because that&#39;s what you will</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.550" end="00:22:38.090" style="s2">encounter in your life those are</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.860" end="00:22:38.820" style="s2">archetypal things everyone encounters is</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.090" end="00:22:41.100" style="s2">the tear</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.059" end="00:26:45.640" style="s2">instead is that you know if you if you</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.970" end="00:26:58.390" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing that you see in</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.290" end="00:27:00.730" style="s2">the Abrahamic stories because Abraham is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.390" end="00:27:02.650" style="s2">not a perfect person by any stretch of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.730" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">the imagination he&#39;s a real person and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.650" end="00:27:07.080" style="s2">he makes mistakes but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:09.850" style="s2">the overarching narrative is you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.080" end="00:27:13.780" style="s2">maintain your covenant with God and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.850" end="00:27:15.400" style="s2">despite your inadequacies then not only</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.780" end="00:27:17.170" style="s2">will you prevail but your descendants</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.400" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">will prevail it&#39;s like great</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.170" end="00:27:21.340" style="s2">that&#39;s really good news you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:24.550" style="s2">been really something to see that in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.340" end="00:27:27.790" style="s2">in the stories it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.550" end="00:27:29.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s responsibility it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.790" end="00:27:31.630" style="s2">that Abraham is kinder gentler more</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.800" end="00:27:33.970" style="s2">intrepid ethical or a better debater</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.630" end="00:27:35.890" style="s2">than his ancestor Noah rather both the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.970" end="00:27:37.630" style="s2">Noah and Abraham stories are pieces of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.890" end="00:27:39.720" style="s2">development of an increasingly stronger</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.630" end="00:27:42.280" style="s2">stance of humans relative to the deity</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.720" end="00:27:44.260" style="s2">before the story is over humans will</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.280" end="00:27:46.180" style="s2">become a good deal stronger and bolder</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.260" end="00:27:48.220" style="s2">than Abraham oh that&#39;s really something</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.180" end="00:27:51.580" style="s2">to say because Abraham is pretty bold</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.220" end="00:27:54.220" style="s2">so we&#39;ll let&#39;s read the stories the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.580" end="00:27:56.620" style="s2">first one is about Abraham Sarah and lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.220" end="00:27:59.980" style="s2">now these are the generations of Tara</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.620" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">Tara begat Abram so his name is Abram to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.980" end="00:28:03.730" style="s2">begin with and that actually turns out</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:06.790" style="s2">to be important it&#39;s not Abraham Nahor</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.730" end="00:28:09.040" style="s2">and Haran and Haran begat lot so Haran</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.790" end="00:28:11.170" style="s2">is Abraham&#39;s brother and Haran died</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.040" end="00:28:13.540" style="s2">before his father Terah in the land of</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.860" end="00:32:36.100" style="s2">because you&#39;re not happy with who you</p>

<p begin="00:34:42.260" end="00:34:45.800" style="s2">much protection and they know it</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:48.440" style="s2">themselves and that means they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.800" end="00:34:49.970" style="s2">deprived of necessity you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.440" end="00:34:53.810" style="s2">the things that you see in the United</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.970" end="00:34:55.550" style="s2">States for example is that the children</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.810" end="00:34:57.109" style="s2">of first generation immigrants often do</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.550" end="00:34:58.970" style="s2">better than the children they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.109" end="00:35:00.490" style="s2">children and the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.970" end="00:35:02.990" style="s2">the children of first generation</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.490" end="00:35:04.700" style="s2">immigrants have necessity driving them</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.990" end="00:35:06.619" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know how much you need a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.700" end="00:35:08.900" style="s2">necessity to drive you because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.619" end="00:35:11.150" style="s2">you&#39;re not very disciplined and if the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.900" end="00:35:13.490" style="s2">catastrophe doesn&#39;t immediately befall</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.150" end="00:35:15.319" style="s2">you if you don&#39;t act forthrightly today</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.490" end="00:35:18.290" style="s2">then maybe you never act forthrightly</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.319" end="00:35:20.230" style="s2">right because the the gap between your</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.290" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">foolishness and the punishment is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.230" end="00:35:24.650" style="s2">lengthened by your unearned wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:26.359" style="s2">so you never grow up and learn and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.650" end="00:35:30.140" style="s2">have to get yourself away from your</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.359" end="00:35:32.540" style="s2">dependency in order to allow necessity</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.140" end="00:35:34.460" style="s2">to drive you forward and that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.540" end="00:35:36.859" style="s2">become independent and to become mature</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.460" end="00:35:40.730" style="s2">and I think part of what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.859" end="00:35:44.050" style="s2">our culture is that the the force that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.730" end="00:35:46.579" style="s2">attacking the the fourth right movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.050" end="00:35:49.790" style="s2">forward of young men in particular is</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.579" end="00:35:51.650" style="s2">afraid of the power of men because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.790" end="00:35:54.980" style="s2">confused about the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.650" end="00:35:58.520" style="s2">power and authority and competence like</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.980" end="00:36:01.700" style="s2">an a man who&#39;s who has Authority and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.520" end="00:36:02.869" style="s2">competence has power as a byproduct but</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.700" end="00:36:05.480" style="s2">the authority and competence is</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.869" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">everything and and and people who can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.480" end="00:36:10.760" style="s2">understand that failed to make the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:11.780" style="s2">distinction between power and authority</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.760" end="00:36:13.430" style="s2">of competence</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.780" end="00:36:15.260" style="s2">and they&#39;re afraid of power and so they</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.430" end="00:36:17.120" style="s2">destroy authority and competence and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.260" end="00:36:18.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible thing because we need</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.120" end="00:36:19.310" style="s2">authority and competence what else is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.680" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.310" end="00:36:24.110" style="s2">what else is going to allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:25.820" style="s2">prevail in the long run and so you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.110" end="00:36:27.740" style="s2">away from your country and you get away</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.820" end="00:36:30.230" style="s2">from your kin and from your father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.740" end="00:36:31.940" style="s2">house right and you go out there and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.230" end="00:36:34.250" style="s2">establish yourself in the world it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.940" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">call to adventure that&#39;s what this the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.250" end="00:36:40.490" style="s2">first lines in the Abrahamic story is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:43.640" style="s2">call to adventure so great unto a land</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.490" end="00:36:49.430" style="s2">that I will show you well you know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.640" end="00:36:52.970" style="s2">does that mean you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.430" end="00:36:55.310" style="s2">things that I&#39;d been struck very hard by</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.970" end="00:36:58.100" style="s2">a number of writers Carl young obviously</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.310" end="00:37:00.350" style="s2">among them I mean he he wrote things</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.100" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">like Nietzsche that if you understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.350" end="00:37:04.820" style="s2">them they just break you into pieces you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:06.230" style="s2">know and and one of the things that Jung</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.820" end="00:37:07.310" style="s2">understood in the psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.230" end="00:37:09.320" style="s2">understand it&#39;s one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.310" end="00:37:11.150" style="s2">terrifying elements of psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.320" end="00:37:13.430" style="s2">thinking is very tightly allied with</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.150" end="00:37:16.250" style="s2">religious thinking which is that you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.430" end="00:37:18.110" style="s2">not the master of your own house there</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.250" end="00:37:21.350" style="s2">are spirits that dwell in within you</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.110" end="00:37:24.470" style="s2">meaning you have a will and you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.350" end="00:37:26.150" style="s2">exercise a certain amount of conscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.470" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">control over your being but there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.150" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">all sorts of things that occur within</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:31.910" style="s2">you that seem to be beyond your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:33.350" style="s2">to control your dreams for example</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.910" end="00:37:34.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good example or your</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.350" end="00:37:36.620" style="s2">impulses for example you might you might</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.940" end="00:37:37.940" style="s2">think of those as so foreign from you</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.620" end="00:37:40.280" style="s2">that they&#39;re not even you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.940" end="00:37:42.260" style="s2">want them to be part of you but but more</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.280" end="00:37:44.780" style="s2">subtly even how about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.260" end="00:37:46.990" style="s2">interested in what compels you like</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.780" end="00:37:50.390" style="s2">where does that come from exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.990" end="00:37:52.550" style="s2">because you can&#39;t you can&#39;t conjure it</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.390" end="00:37:53.840" style="s2">up of your own accord you know so if</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.550" end="00:37:55.460" style="s2">you&#39;re a student and you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.840" end="00:37:57.230" style="s2">difficult course you might say to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.460" end="00:37:59.360" style="s2">yourself well I need to sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.230" end="00:38:01.100" style="s2">study for three hours but then you sit</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.360" end="00:38:03.020" style="s2">down and that is what happens your</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.100" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">attention goes everywhere and you might</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.020" end="00:38:07.490" style="s2">say well whose attention is it then if</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:09.770" style="s2">it goes everywhere because you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.490" end="00:38:11.150" style="s2">your attentions like well if it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.770" end="00:38:13.580" style="s2">attention maybe you would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.150" end="00:38:15.410" style="s2">control it but you can&#39;t and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.580" end="00:38:17.660" style="s2">might think well Jenin just exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.410" end="00:38:19.190" style="s2">the hell is controlling it and you might</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.660" end="00:38:21.260" style="s2">say well it&#39;s random it&#39;s the vall it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.190" end="00:38:23.270" style="s2">better not be random I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.260" end="00:38:24.710" style="s2">that&#39;s that happens to some degree in</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.270" end="00:38:25.430" style="s2">schizophrenia there&#39;s an element of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.710" end="00:38:28.610" style="s2">randomness and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.430" end="00:38:31.550" style="s2">it&#39;s not random it&#39;s driven by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.610" end="00:38:33.310" style="s2">action of phenomena that I think are</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.550" end="00:38:35.240" style="s2">best considered as something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.310" end="00:38:39.320" style="s2">subpersonalities although even that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.240" end="00:38:42.100" style="s2">only a partial description you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.320" end="00:38:45.940" style="s2">make yourself interested in something</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.100" end="00:38:49.490" style="s2">interest manifests itself and grips you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.940" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.490" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">what is it that&#39;s gripping you and how</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:54.020" style="s2">do you conceptualize that is that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:55.340" style="s2">divine power</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.020" end="00:38:57.350" style="s2">well it&#39;s divine as far as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.340" end="00:38:59.720" style="s2">concerned because it grips you and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.350" end="00:39:01.850" style="s2">can&#39;t do anything about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.720" end="00:39:03.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a calling in you towards what</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.850" end="00:39:04.400" style="s2">you&#39;re compelled by and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.080" end="00:39:07.400" style="s2">interested in and sometimes that might</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.400" end="00:39:09.170" style="s2">be very dark and sometimes not but</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.400" end="00:39:13.790" style="s2">you&#39;re compelled forward by your</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.170" end="00:39:16.340" style="s2">interest and so and so the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.790" end="00:39:17.960" style="s2">what moves you away from your country</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.340" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">and your father&#39;s house and the comforts</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.960" end="00:39:21.830" style="s2">of your child at home is it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:24.350" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond you and that you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.830" end="00:39:25.940" style="s2">and hearken to that&#39;s exactly right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.350" end="00:39:28.580" style="s2">you can say well I don&#39;t want to call</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.940" end="00:39:29.240" style="s2">that God it&#39;s like doesn&#39;t matter what</p>

<p begin="00:40:33.800" end="00:40:38.270" style="s2">established territory into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.630" end="00:40:39.109" style="s2">and that&#39;s a new land right maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.270" end="00:40:41.450" style="s2">even the land of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.109" end="00:40:43.489" style="s2">enemies for that matter but it&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.450" end="00:40:45.829" style="s2">land the frontier is always in front of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.489" end="00:40:47.779" style="s2">you and so you know when the earth was</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.829" end="00:40:50.299" style="s2">less inhabited than it is now the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.779" end="00:40:51.829" style="s2">frontier was the psychological frontier</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.299" end="00:40:53.539" style="s2">and the geographical frontier was the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.829" end="00:40:54.980" style="s2">same thing and now they&#39;ve separated to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.539" end="00:40:57.170" style="s2">some degree because there&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.980" end="00:40:58.660" style="s2">geographical volunteer but there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.170" end="00:41:01.309" style="s2">frontier is a place that never</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.660" end="00:41:03.170" style="s2">disappears and the land that&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.309" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">the land that you know is always there</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.170" end="00:41:07.249" style="s2">and it&#39;s always where you should go and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:12.499" style="s2">all of that packed into these what four</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.249" end="00:41:14.930" style="s2">phrases so well so when I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.499" end="00:41:16.430" style="s2">thinking about narrative you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.930" end="00:41:18.859" style="s2">world through a story you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.430" end="00:41:21.470" style="s2">can&#39;t help it and the story is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.859" end="00:41:23.210" style="s2">gives value to the world or or the story</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.470" end="00:41:24.670" style="s2">is what you extract from the value of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.210" end="00:41:26.839" style="s2">the world you can look at it either way</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.670" end="00:41:28.759" style="s2">you&#39;re somewhere and it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.839" end="00:41:30.710" style="s2">enough right that&#39;s the eternal human</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.759" end="00:41:31.999" style="s2">predicament wherever you are isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.710" end="00:41:33.559" style="s2">enough and to some degree that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.999" end="00:41:35.539" style="s2">actually a good thing because if it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.559" end="00:41:37.819" style="s2">good enough well there&#39;s nothing for you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.539" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">to do so it&#39;s actually maybe a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.819" end="00:41:42.349" style="s2">thing that it&#39;s insufficient and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:45.499" style="s2">might be why sometimes having lessons is</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.349" end="00:41:47.299" style="s2">better than having more and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.499" end="00:41:49.579" style="s2">to be a Pollyanna about that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.299" end="00:41:51.289" style="s2">know that there&#39;s deprivation that can</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.579" end="00:41:53.779" style="s2">reach to the point where it&#39;s no where</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.289" end="00:41:56.059" style="s2">it&#39;s completely counterproductive but it</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.779" end="00:41:59.390" style="s2">isn&#39;t always the case that starting with</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.059" end="00:42:01.099" style="s2">little is you if you start with little</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.390" end="00:42:02.779" style="s2">you start with more possibility it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.099" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">something like that so you moved from</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.779" end="00:42:07.849" style="s2">always from what&#39;s unbearable about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:09.710" style="s2">present to some better future right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.849" end="00:42:11.809" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have that then you have no</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.710" end="00:42:13.609" style="s2">you have nothing but threat and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.809" end="00:42:15.400" style="s2">negative emotion you have no positive</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.609" end="00:42:17.749" style="s2">emotion because the positive emotion is</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.400" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">generated in the conception of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.749" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">better future and then the evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:23.930" style="s2">you generate yourself that you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:25.489" style="s2">towards it that&#39;s where the positive and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.930" end="00:42:27.140" style="s2">fulfilling meaning of life comes so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.489" end="00:42:29.059" style="s2">want to set up the structure properly</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.140" end="00:42:31.430" style="s2">it&#39;s very very important and so what it</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.059" end="00:42:34.309" style="s2">means is that you want to be going</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.430" end="00:42:36.710" style="s2">somewhere that&#39;s good enough so that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.309" end="00:42:38.839" style="s2">going is worth the while and you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.710" end="00:42:40.279" style="s2">yourself that and that&#39;s partly what we</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.839" end="00:42:42.619" style="s2">tried to build into the future authoring</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.279" end="00:42:44.779" style="s2">program which is well we know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.619" end="00:42:46.970" style="s2">wrong with life it&#39;s rife with suffering</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.779" end="00:42:49.519" style="s2">and insufficiency and deception and evil</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.970" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s all of that obviously okay what</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.519" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">would make the journey worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">or you can ask yourself that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:42:58.789" style="s2">alright in order to bear up under this</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.890" style="s2">load what is it that I would need to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.789" end="00:43:03.589" style="s2">striving to attain and if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.890" end="00:43:05.450" style="s2">yourself that that&#39;s to knocking and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.589" end="00:43:07.549" style="s2">door will open that&#39;s what that means if</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.450" end="00:43:09.319" style="s2">you ask yourself that then you will find</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.549" end="00:43:10.819" style="s2">an answer and you&#39;ll think you&#39;ll shrink</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.319" end="00:43:12.950" style="s2">away from it you&#39;ll think well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.819" end="00:43:14.869" style="s2">no way I could do that it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.950" end="00:43:17.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what you could do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.869" end="00:43:20.839" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s possible and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.660" end="00:43:22.609" style="s2">not as much as you could be and so god</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.839" end="00:43:26.240" style="s2">only knows what you could what you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.609" end="00:43:29.690" style="s2">do and have and give if you sacrificed</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.240" end="00:43:31.249" style="s2">everything to it and that&#39;s the reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.690" end="00:43:33.529" style="s2">that Abraham is constantly making</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.249" end="00:43:36.950" style="s2">sacrifices and it&#39;s archaic right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.529" end="00:43:38.599" style="s2">burning up like baby lambs but like well</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.950" end="00:43:40.069" style="s2">they&#39;re alive you know that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.599" end="00:43:42.950" style="s2">and and they&#39;re valuable and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.069" end="00:43:44.210" style="s2">something it&#39;s you have to admit even if</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.950" end="00:43:46.609" style="s2">you think about it as a modern person</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.210" end="00:43:49.309" style="s2">but the act of sacrificing something</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.609" end="00:43:51.170" style="s2">might have some dramatic compulsion to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.309" end="00:43:53.420" style="s2">it you know to go out into a flock and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.170" end="00:43:55.039" style="s2">to take something that&#39;s newborn and to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.420" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">cut its throat and to bleed it and to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.039" end="00:43:59.029" style="s2">burn it might be a way of indicating to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:01.309" style="s2">yourself that you&#39;re actually serious</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.029" end="00:44:03.589" style="s2">about something and it isn&#39;t so obvious</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.309" end="00:44:05.690" style="s2">that we have rituals of seriousness like</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.589" end="00:44:07.130" style="s2">that now and so it&#39;s not so obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.690" end="00:44:09.019" style="s2">we&#39;re actually serious about anything</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.130" end="00:44:10.549" style="s2">and so maybe that&#39;s not such a good</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.019" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">thing and so maybe we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.549" end="00:44:13.220" style="s2">thinking that these people were so</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.839" end="00:44:15.499" style="s2">archaic and primitive and superstitious</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.220" end="00:44:18.680" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that they knew something</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.499" end="00:44:20.150" style="s2">that we don&#39;t it&#39;s certainly in the or</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.680" end="00:44:22.519" style="s2">hammock stories one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.150" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">maintains Abraham&#39;s covenant with God is</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.519" end="00:44:26.660" style="s2">his continual willingness to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">it it&#39;s so that sacrificial issue is so</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.660" end="00:44:30.440" style="s2">important because you are not committed</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:31.579" style="s2">to something unless you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.440" end="00:44:33.829" style="s2">sacrifice for it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.579" end="00:44:36.680" style="s2">commitment and sacrifice are the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.829" end="00:44:38.749" style="s2">thing and I think it&#39;s borders on</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.680" end="00:44:40.999" style="s2">miraculous that those concepts are</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.749" end="00:44:42.739" style="s2">embedded into this narrative at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.999" end="00:44:45.079" style="s2">level of dramatic action you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.739" end="00:44:46.819" style="s2">instead of abstract explanation people</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.079" end="00:44:48.829" style="s2">are acting this out and then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.819" end="00:44:50.410" style="s2">fundamental conception is so profound</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.829" end="00:44:53.869" style="s2">that it&#39;s really quite it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.410" end="00:44:56.660" style="s2">inspiring it&#39;s breathtaking really when</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.869" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">you understand what message is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.660" end="00:45:01.369" style="s2">be conveyed you have to make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">and what you have to sacrifice you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.369" end="00:45:05.690" style="s2">to sacrifice that which is most valuable</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:08.450" style="s2">to you currently</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.690" end="00:45:10.580" style="s2">that&#39;s stopping you and god only knows</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.450" end="00:45:12.980" style="s2">what that is it&#39;s certainly the worst of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.580" end="00:45:14.990" style="s2">you it&#39;s certainly that and god only</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.980" end="00:45:20.120" style="s2">knows to what degree you&#39;re in love with</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.990" end="00:45:21.950" style="s2">the worst of you so well so you move</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.120" end="00:45:24.890" style="s2">from the unbearable present to the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.950" end="00:45:26.210" style="s2">future and and you can&#39;t help that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.890" end="00:45:27.800" style="s2">have to live in the structure like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.210" end="00:45:29.510" style="s2">that&#39;s your house that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.800" end="00:45:30.950" style="s2">thinking about it and if you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.510" end="00:45:32.930" style="s2">your house in order and if it you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.950" end="00:45:36.950" style="s2">it to be a place that you can live</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.930" end="00:45:41.450" style="s2">properly then you have to plan the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.950" end="00:45:44.270" style="s2">future that is perfect and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.450" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">well what does that mean and it means</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.270" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s good for you right and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:51.620" style="s2">things that I&#39;m I do all the time with</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:53.180" style="s2">my clinical and consulting clients is</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.620" end="00:45:55.730" style="s2">trying to figure out what would be good</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.180" end="00:45:57.290" style="s2">for them but we do more than that we try</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.730" end="00:45:59.000" style="s2">to think okay well what how can we set</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.290" end="00:46:01.670" style="s2">this up so it&#39;s really good for you and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.000" end="00:46:02.900" style="s2">that all the side consequences of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.670" end="00:46:05.660" style="s2">are things that are good for other</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.900" end="00:46:07.190" style="s2">people and so because people are often</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.660" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">also tended about trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.190" end="00:46:09.950" style="s2">something that&#39;s good for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:11.840" style="s2">because they feel that it&#39;s selfish or</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.950" end="00:46:13.430" style="s2">that they don&#39;t deserve it so we set it</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.840" end="00:46:16.580" style="s2">up so that well look we&#39;re going to set</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.430" end="00:46:18.620" style="s2">it up so that it&#39;s plainly obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.580" end="00:46:21.230" style="s2">this will not harm the structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.620" end="00:46:23.300" style="s2">universe for you to have what you need</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.230" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">and to do it in a way that&#39;s of benefit</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.300" end="00:46:28.790" style="s2">to other people there&#39;s no downside to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:30.440" style="s2">that and so it&#39;s okay it&#39;s okay if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.790" end="00:46:31.820" style="s2">reach out and take that and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.440" end="00:46:34.070" style="s2">things that&#39;s interesting about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.820" end="00:46:35.990" style="s2">biblical stories Abrahamic stories as</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.070" end="00:46:38.180" style="s2">well is that God doesn&#39;t really seem to</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.990" end="00:46:40.850" style="s2">be opposed to the success of the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.180" end="00:46:42.350" style="s2">that he&#39;s chosen you know what happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.850" end="00:46:44.930" style="s2">to them is that they progress through</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.350" end="00:46:47.030" style="s2">their journey as they they get larger</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.930" end="00:46:49.400" style="s2">flocks and they they get more authority</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.030" end="00:46:51.650" style="s2">and they they get they get more they get</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.400" end="00:46:53.420" style="s2">life more abundant that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.650" end="00:46:55.610" style="s2">it&#39;s God isn&#39;t does it seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.420" end="00:46:58.130" style="s2">miser in the Old Testament it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.610" end="00:46:59.720" style="s2">you put in the effort and you and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.130" end="00:47:02.330" style="s2">accept the covenant and you make the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.720" end="00:47:04.280" style="s2">sacrifices then you get to be successful</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.330" end="00:47:06.950" style="s2">and maybe successful beyond your wildest</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.280" end="00:47:09.050" style="s2">dreams and that that&#39;s actually seems to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.950" end="00:47:11.330" style="s2">be okay with God and that&#39;s pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.050" end="00:47:13.580" style="s2">given that you know that the general</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.330" end="00:47:16.130" style="s2">notion of Old Testament God is that all</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.580" end="00:47:17.720" style="s2">he&#39;s doing is casting out curses and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.130" end="00:47:18.900" style="s2">death you know wherever he happens to</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.720" end="00:47:20.309" style="s2">wander and</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.900" end="00:47:23.369" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s certainly no shortage of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.309" end="00:47:24.930" style="s2">that but but again it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.369" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">that&#39;s very good news and that you also</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.930" end="00:47:29.039" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be perfect in order for to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:31.230" style="s2">have that happen and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.039" end="00:47:33.510" style="s2">thing this is the issue about going into</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.230" end="00:47:35.640" style="s2">the unknown it&#39;s like well if you leave</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.510" end="00:47:37.859" style="s2">your country and your kin and your</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.640" end="00:47:40.230" style="s2">father&#39;s house and you go out into a</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.859" end="00:47:42.900" style="s2">land that your intuition guides you to</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.230" end="00:47:44.700" style="s2">you&#39;re going to undergo these radical</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.900" end="00:47:46.440" style="s2">transformations this is the sacrificial</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.700" end="00:47:48.990" style="s2">transformation too because you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.440" end="00:47:51.240" style="s2">moving forthrightly and voluntarily into</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.990" end="00:47:53.099" style="s2">chaos right and that&#39;s the same as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.240" end="00:47:55.529" style="s2">dragon fight that&#39;s the hero story and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.099" end="00:47:58.260" style="s2">what will happen there is that you will</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.529" end="00:48:00.990" style="s2">transform yourself and so the call to an</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.260" end="00:48:03.660" style="s2">ideal is also the call to a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.990" end="00:48:05.940" style="s2">deaths and rebirths that move you closer</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.660" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">and closer to the ideal and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.940" end="00:48:15.289" style="s2">that&#39;s what God is calling Abraham to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:15.289" style="s2">in the first sentence of this story</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.680" end="00:48:27.260" style="s2">you see these things echoed in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.819" end="00:48:29.420" style="s2">strangest places and so these are stills</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.260" end="00:48:31.309" style="s2">that I took from Pinocchio and this</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.420" end="00:48:33.020" style="s2">little cricket so he&#39;s the still small</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.309" end="00:48:35.450" style="s2">voice right that&#39;s the thing that calls</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.020" end="00:48:37.369" style="s2">to you it&#39;s your conscious conscience</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.450" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">and part it&#39;s your intuition in part and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.369" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that opens up the great</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">book of the world the great sacred book</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:44.539" style="s2">of the world and that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">here right and the animators are at</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.539" end="00:48:48.859" style="s2">pains to show you that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:51.140" style="s2">leather-bound book with gilt lettering</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.859" end="00:48:53.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a valuable book and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.140" end="00:48:54.680" style="s2">that&#39;s quiet that&#39;s showing it to you</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.000" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">right you have to meditate let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.680" end="00:48:58.130" style="s2">have to be somewhere where the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:49:00.589" style="s2">isn&#39;t drowning you out in order to</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.130" end="00:49:03.049" style="s2">understand how to open this to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.589" end="00:49:05.000" style="s2">that voice that tells you where you</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.049" end="00:49:08.390" style="s2">should go with what you should do next</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.000" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">and then what happens is that something</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.390" end="00:49:13.190" style="s2">beckons to you in the night it&#39;s a star</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:15.890" style="s2">right it&#39;s something that transcends the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.190" end="00:49:18.710" style="s2">horizon it&#39;s it&#39;s glitters it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.890" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">brilliant it&#39;s it&#39;s not day to day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.710" end="00:49:23.089" style="s2">something that&#39;s beyond you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:25.789" style="s2">something that represents a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.089" end="00:49:27.950" style="s2">ideal and that makes it manifest to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.789" end="00:49:30.440" style="s2">if you&#39;re quiet enough to listen and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.950" end="00:49:32.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what you wish upon so strangely</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.440" end="00:49:33.980" style="s2">right and people do that they wish upon</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.510" end="00:49:36.619" style="s2">a star they teach their children that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.980" end="00:49:38.390" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know why well what do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.619" end="00:49:40.190" style="s2">mean you wish upon a star what the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.390" end="00:49:41.960" style="s2">does that mean it means you lift your</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.190" end="00:49:44.119" style="s2">eyes to the heavens and make a pact with</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.960" end="00:49:46.309" style="s2">the transcendent and then you&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.119" end="00:49:48.470" style="s2">then what your hearts desire will come</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.309" end="00:49:50.390" style="s2">to you that&#39;s what it means and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.470" end="00:49:52.730" style="s2">think well that&#39;s so that&#39;s not naive</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.390" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the most sophisticated thing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.730" end="00:49:58.970" style="s2">you can know and it&#39;s the birth of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:05.329" style="s2">hero right because that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.970" end="00:50:07.849" style="s2">nativity star obviously and this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.329" end="00:50:10.549" style="s2">where it takes place it&#39;s just anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.849" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">and the person it is just a carpenter</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.549" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">and a toy maker but that&#39;s pretty good a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:16.309" style="s2">carpenter if you&#39;re a deceitful</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:18.109" style="s2">carpenter then your house falls down and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.309" end="00:50:20.089" style="s2">if you&#39;re a toy maker then you love</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.109" end="00:50:22.069" style="s2">children it&#39;s that&#39;s good start you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.089" end="00:50:25.210" style="s2">so so Geppetto who lives in this little</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.069" end="00:50:27.890" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s not a grand house it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.210" end="00:50:29.299" style="s2">it&#39;s just in every day house but</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.890" end="00:50:31.579" style="s2">everything that&#39;s happening and it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.299" end="00:50:33.470" style="s2">good and so that means it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.579" end="00:50:34.339" style="s2">palace because everything in it is how</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.470" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.339" end="00:50:37.579" style="s2">good there&#39;s the saying and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:39.709" style="s2">remember where it comes from then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.579" end="00:50:42.170" style="s2">better to have bread and water in peace</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.709" end="00:50:44.239" style="s2">than a feast in conflict and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.170" end="00:50:46.130" style="s2">a saying that&#39;s just the starkest</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.239" end="00:50:47.539" style="s2">possible description of the truth</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.130" end="00:50:50.569" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing worse than</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.539" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">eating a grand meal with people you hate</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.569" end="00:50:54.619" style="s2">and despise that are at each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:58.009" style="s2">throats it&#39;s much better to have bread</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.619" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">and water in peace it&#39;s it&#39;s not it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.009" end="00:51:01.819" style="s2">just clear-headed analysis of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:02.329" style="s2">structure of the world to say things</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.819" end="00:51:04.969" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.329" end="00:51:06.859" style="s2">and so the magical transformation can</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.969" end="00:51:08.869" style="s2">happen in the most mundane of places</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.859" end="00:51:12.289" style="s2">because and the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.869" end="00:51:15.079" style="s2">the mundane nature of places is an</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.289" end="00:51:17.839" style="s2">illusion because every place is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.079" end="00:51:23.449" style="s2">potential birthplace of the kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:25.819" style="s2">God that&#39;s the case and so Geppetto he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.449" end="00:51:27.799" style="s2">a good guy he has a kitten</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.819" end="00:51:30.859" style="s2">you know the kitten likes him he makes</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.799" end="00:51:32.779" style="s2">puppets and he&#39;s humble person and he</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.859" end="00:51:35.059" style="s2">knows that compared to the ideal that</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.779" end="00:51:38.749" style="s2">he&#39;s attempting to subscribe to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.059" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s not a based before it or</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.749" end="00:51:43.160" style="s2">anything like that he&#39;s not despicable</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:44.929" style="s2">in relationship to it but the reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.160" end="00:51:47.660" style="s2">he&#39;s on his knees is because the thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.929" end="00:51:51.619" style="s2">he&#39;s pointing at is above him you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.660" end="00:51:53.299" style="s2">he he it wouldn&#39;t be the right aim if it</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.619" end="00:51:55.579" style="s2">wasn&#39;t above him and so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.299" end="00:51:57.229" style="s2">he&#39;s on his knees so to speak is only an</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.579" end="00:51:59.089" style="s2">indication that his aim is proper</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.229" end="00:52:01.369" style="s2">because you should be on your knees to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.089" end="00:52:03.229" style="s2">something that you actually admire and</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.770" end="00:53:26.420" style="s2">your life could be like if you organized</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.530" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">it from the smallest element to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.420" end="00:53:30.890" style="s2">largest element and that&#39;s a place that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:34.750" style="s2">you can inhabit if not forever in a</p>

<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:47.720" style="s2">well because of Gepetto&#39;s decisioned the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.530" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">transcendent manifests itself it takes</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.720" end="00:53:51.859" style="s2">the form of the blue fairy here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:54.859" style="s2">the positive element of nature right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.859" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">we could say well nature it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.859" end="00:53:59.240" style="s2">clear that she&#39;s on your side right</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">she&#39;s the Red Queen and Alice in</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.240" end="00:54:03.200" style="s2">Wonderland who runs around screaming</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:05.390" style="s2">when you go down the rabbit hole she</p>

<p begin="00:54:05.390" end="00:54:10.070" style="s2">heads and who says in my kingdom you</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.330" end="00:54:12.320" style="s2">have to run as fast as you can just to</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.070" end="00:54:14.900" style="s2">stay in the same place that&#39;s mother</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.320" end="00:54:16.490" style="s2">nature but then we might say well how do</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.900" end="00:54:18.650" style="s2">we know that mother nature&#39;s attitude</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.490" end="00:54:20.720" style="s2">towards you isn&#39;t negative because your</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.650" end="00:54:22.910" style="s2">attitude towards things isn&#39;t proper and</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.720" end="00:54:25.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what this film attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.910" end="00:54:27.950" style="s2">indicate the idea is that if you aim</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.400" end="00:54:31.790" style="s2">properly then nature aligns itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.950" end="00:54:33.349" style="s2">behind you now it also arrays itself in</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.790" end="00:54:37.010" style="s2">front of you perhaps even as an</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.349" end="00:54:39.800" style="s2">antagonist but the power that it it it</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.010" end="00:54:42.140" style="s2">provides you with from within might be</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.800" end="00:54:45.290" style="s2">sufficient to overcome it from without</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.140" end="00:54:46.940" style="s2">and i think that i think that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.290" end="00:54:48.950" style="s2">clinical evidence is clear about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.940" end="00:54:51.050" style="s2">because one of the things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.950" end="00:54:53.450" style="s2">know is that if you take people who are</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.050" end="00:54:56.540" style="s2">confronting terrible things and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.450" end="00:54:59.330" style="s2">shrinking from them and you teach them</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.540" end="00:55:01.140" style="s2">how to structure their behavior so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.330" end="00:55:05.730" style="s2">they can advance</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.140" end="00:55:08.340" style="s2">with courage everything works better for</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.730" end="00:55:11.880" style="s2">them their fears decrease and their</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.340" end="00:55:13.950" style="s2">character grows and so there might be</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.880" end="00:55:16.050" style="s2">enough of nature within us to help us</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.950" end="00:55:18.300" style="s2">withstand the nature that&#39;s outside of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.050" end="00:55:19.800" style="s2">us and it depends at least to some</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.300" end="00:55:22.440" style="s2">degree and how it is that we orient</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.800" end="00:55:28.980" style="s2">ourselves in the world to some into some</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.440" end="00:55:33.420" style="s2">unknowable degree now Geppetto wants an</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.980" end="00:55:35.820" style="s2">autonomous individual as a son and</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.420" end="00:55:38.910" style="s2">that&#39;s also something that makes him a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.820" end="00:55:41.550" style="s2">great person because autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.910" end="00:55:43.050" style="s2">individuals have their own will and if</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.550" end="00:55:44.790" style="s2">you&#39;re a tyrant it&#39;s the last thing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.050" end="00:55:47.100" style="s2">you&#39;re going to want and if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.790" end="00:55:49.110" style="s2">tyrant who&#39;s jealous of his son it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.100" end="00:55:52.230" style="s2">even more so the last thing you&#39;re ever</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.110" end="00:55:54.120" style="s2">going to want and so to aim high and to</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.230" end="00:55:55.590" style="s2">want the development of the autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.120" end="00:55:57.390" style="s2">individual are the same thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.590" end="00:55:59.730" style="s2">would say that&#39;s the core story in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.390" end="00:56:01.710" style="s2">sense of Western culture is that to aim</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.730" end="00:56:04.440" style="s2">high and to develop the autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.710" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">individual are the same thing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.440" end="00:56:08.660" style="s2">what happens in Pinocchio that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:10.200" style="s2">happens in the story of Abraham and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.660" end="00:56:13.140" style="s2">transformation takes place</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.200" end="00:56:14.910" style="s2">the magical transformation and in the</p>

<p begin="00:56:14.910" end="00:56:19.170" style="s2">so interesting about it and this is part</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.890" end="00:56:21.180" style="s2">of its mythological substructure from</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.170" end="00:56:24.510" style="s2">the scientific perspective there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.180" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">two determining forces with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.510" end="00:56:28.890" style="s2">the destiny of the individual there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:33.390" style="s2">nature deterministic and culture</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.890" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">deterministic and then scholars wrangle</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.390" end="00:56:37.200" style="s2">about which of those is the greater</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:38.670" style="s2">force but in mythological stories</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.200" end="00:56:40.320" style="s2">there&#39;s always a third element and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.670" end="00:56:42.780" style="s2">third element is something like</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.320" end="00:56:44.490" style="s2">autonomous consciousness and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.780" end="00:56:46.560" style="s2">place for autonomous consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.490" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">the deterministic story of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.560" end="00:56:51.840" style="s2">culture but we all act as if autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:53.730" style="s2">consciousness is the primary reality and</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.840" end="00:56:55.770" style="s2">the biblical stories are predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.730" end="00:56:57.870" style="s2">the idea that autonomous consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.770" end="00:56:59.700" style="s2">is what gives rise to the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.870" end="00:57:01.890" style="s2">don&#39;t think that we&#39;re in a position to</p>

<p begin="00:57:01.890" end="00:57:06.900" style="s2">error and so what that means is to aim</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.890" end="00:57:07.890" style="s2">high and to develop the autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.900" end="00:57:11.780" style="s2">individualist</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.890" end="00:57:14.740" style="s2">is simultaneously the decision to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.780" end="00:57:16.810" style="s2">formulate an allegiance with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.740" end="00:57:21.430" style="s2">the conscious power that brings being</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.810" end="00:57:24.130" style="s2">into existence and that all takes place</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.430" end="00:57:26.619" style="s2">inside this little puppet and then he</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.130" end="00:57:30.010" style="s2">has his adventures right he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.619" end="00:57:32.290" style="s2">still half jackass and half deceptive</p>

<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:57.010" style="s2">like this as far as I can tell you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.570" end="00:57:58.930" style="s2">when I talk to people about doing the</p>

<p begin="00:58:30.430" end="00:58:34.119" style="s2">thesis write a really bad first draft</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.740" end="00:58:35.589" style="s2">and then we have a little conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.119" end="00:58:38.410" style="s2">about that because they don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.589" end="00:58:40.810" style="s2">mean that because it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.410" end="00:58:46.780" style="s2">cliche in some sense it&#39;s not a cliche</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.810" end="00:58:48.849" style="s2">it&#39;s not a cliche at all it means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.780" end="00:58:50.589" style="s2">a terrible writer but but if someone put</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.849" end="00:58:53.290" style="s2">a gun to your head and said you have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.589" end="00:58:55.810" style="s2">have your hundred page pieces done by</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.290" end="00:58:58.420" style="s2">next Monday or I&#39;ll shoot you but I</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.810" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">don&#39;t care how terrible it is you would</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.420" end="00:59:02.320" style="s2">sit down and write it and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:03.970" style="s2">then you have it right then then you</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.320" end="00:59:06.010" style="s2">have something and then you can fix it</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.970" end="00:59:08.290" style="s2">you could iterate and fix it that bad</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.010" end="00:59:09.369" style="s2">first draft that&#39;s the most valuable</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.290" end="00:59:12.510" style="s2">thing and so that&#39;s what you need you</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.369" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">need a bad first draft of yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.510" end="00:59:17.170" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an idea that young</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.280" end="00:59:19.180" style="s2">developed about the trickster and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.170" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">Jester the comedian right that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.180" end="00:59:23.230" style="s2">trickster is the precursor to the Savior</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.520" end="00:59:25.660" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things I learned from</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.230" end="00:59:28.089" style="s2">young it was just it&#39;s so unlikely you</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.660" end="00:59:28.450" style="s2">never think that it&#39;s so amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.089" end="00:59:32.890" style="s2">that my</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.450" end="00:59:34.839" style="s2">be the case but the the the satirical in</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.890" end="00:59:37.660" style="s2">the Iran Akande and the troublemaker</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.839" end="00:59:40.780" style="s2">that the comedian the fool the fool is</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.660" end="00:59:42.280" style="s2">the precursor to the savior why because</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.780" end="00:59:44.560" style="s2">you&#39;re a fool when you start something</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.280" end="00:59:45.910" style="s2">new and so if you&#39;re not willing to be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.560" end="00:59:47.079" style="s2">fool then you&#39;ll never start anything</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.910" end="00:59:49.270" style="s2">new and if you never start anything new</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.079" end="00:59:50.829" style="s2">then you won&#39;t develop and so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.270" end="00:59:53.050" style="s2">willingness to be a fool is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.829" end="00:59:54.760" style="s2">precursor to transformation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.050" end="00:59:56.619" style="s2">the same as humility and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.760" end="00:59:58.630" style="s2">going to write your destiny you can do a</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.619" end="01:00:01.089" style="s2">bad first job you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.630" end="01:00:03.130" style="s2">smarter as you move forward that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.089" end="01:00:04.869" style="s2">thing is that so something beckons to</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.130" end="01:00:06.760" style="s2">you that&#39;s what happens here maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.869" end="01:00:09.010" style="s2">star that Geppetto wished on was the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.760" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">wrong damn star but at least it was a</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.010" end="01:00:14.740" style="s2">star right at least it was in the sky at</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:16.660" style="s2">least it moved him forward and so you</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.740" end="01:00:19.210" style="s2">say in your life well something grips</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.660" end="01:00:21.700" style="s2">you and it fills you with interest and</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.210" end="01:00:25.619" style="s2">you think well should I do that an</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.700" end="01:00:29.320" style="s2">answer is if not that then something</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.619" end="01:00:32.020" style="s2">what if it&#39;s a mistake it&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.320" end="01:00:33.700" style="s2">rest assured what do you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.020" end="01:00:35.650" style="s2">going to stumble around right and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.700" end="01:00:36.849" style="s2">going to happen is this you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.650" end="01:00:38.560" style="s2">move to you&#39;re going to not stay in</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.849" end="01:00:40.089" style="s2">stasis you&#39;re not going to wander around</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.560" end="01:00:42.040" style="s2">in circles and I see people like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.089" end="01:00:45.339" style="s2">they said well I never knew what to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.040" end="01:00:48.369" style="s2">and now I&#39;m 40 it&#39;s like that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.339" end="01:00:50.290" style="s2">good that&#39;s not so good and you might</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.369" end="01:00:52.619" style="s2">say well and there is a literature too</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.290" end="01:00:54.940" style="s2">that suggests that people are a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.619" end="01:00:57.460" style="s2">unhappy when they look back in their</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.940" end="01:00:59.710" style="s2">lives about the things they didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.460" end="01:01:01.960" style="s2">than they are about the mistakes they</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.710" end="01:01:03.430" style="s2">made while they were doing things and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.960" end="01:01:06.460" style="s2">that&#39;s really worth thinking about too</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.430" end="01:01:08.319" style="s2">because there&#39;s redemptive mistakes and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.460" end="01:01:09.670" style="s2">a redemptive mistake would be a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.319" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">that you make when you go out and try to</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.670" end="01:01:12.670" style="s2">do something you know you actually you</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.200" end="01:01:14.560" style="s2">think okay I&#39;m going to try to do this</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.670" end="01:01:16.630" style="s2">when you&#39;re not good at it you make a</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.560" end="01:01:18.190" style="s2">bunch of mistakes it&#39;s like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.630" end="01:01:19.810" style="s2">consequence if you pay attention is</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.190" end="01:01:22.270" style="s2">you&#39;re not quite so stupid anymore</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.810" end="01:01:24.069" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing is you&#39;ve been informed</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.270" end="01:01:27.910" style="s2">by your by the results of your errors</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.069" end="01:01:30.280" style="s2">and so what happens is you follow the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.910" end="01:01:31.450" style="s2">beacon you follow the light and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.280" end="01:01:34.390" style="s2">you&#39;re blind so you don&#39;t know where the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.450" end="01:01:35.800" style="s2">light is it&#39;s dimly apprehended only and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.390" end="01:01:38.050" style="s2">you&#39;re afraid to follow it but you</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.800" end="01:01:40.839" style="s2">decide to take some stumbling steps</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.050" end="01:01:41.829" style="s2">towards it and as you take stumbling</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.839" end="01:01:44.289" style="s2">steps towards it</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.829" end="01:01:46.450" style="s2">you become illuminated and enlightened</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.289" end="01:01:47.859" style="s2">and informed because of the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.450" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">your experience because you&#39;re pushing</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.859" end="01:01:51.219" style="s2">yourself beyond where you are and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:53.589" style="s2">going into the country that you have not</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.219" end="01:01:55.739" style="s2">yet been in and you learn something and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.589" end="01:01:58.660" style="s2">so what happens then is the star moves</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.739" end="01:02:00.130" style="s2">you move 10 feet towards it you think no</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.660" end="01:02:02.079" style="s2">that&#39;s not right I didn&#39;t get it right</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.130" end="01:02:04.299" style="s2">it isn&#39;t there it&#39;s actually there</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.079" end="01:02:06.309" style="s2">and so then you you see it somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.299" end="01:02:08.380" style="s2">else and you shift yourself slightly and</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.309" end="01:02:13.809" style="s2">you move forward and that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.380" end="01:02:16.559" style="s2">is that you continue as you change the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.809" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">thing that guides you forward moves</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.559" end="01:02:22.180" style="s2">right it&#39;s like God in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:24.430" style="s2">desert in Egypt the pillar of light that</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.180" end="01:02:26.799" style="s2">you&#39;re following it&#39;s moving it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.430" end="01:02:29.469" style="s2">permanent thing you move towards it it</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.799" end="01:02:32.109" style="s2">moves away it guides you forward and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.469" end="01:02:34.209" style="s2">you say well is what I&#39;m aiming at</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.109" end="01:02:36.670" style="s2">paradise itself and the answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.209" end="01:02:38.319" style="s2">is no because what do you know you you</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.670" end="01:02:40.119" style="s2">couldn&#39;t see paradise if it was right in</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.319" end="01:02:43.059" style="s2">front of you but you might get a glimmer</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.119" end="01:02:45.459" style="s2">of it and so you move towards it and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.059" end="01:02:47.199" style="s2">grow and then the next time you open</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.459" end="01:02:48.999" style="s2">your eyes you see a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.199" end="01:02:51.339" style="s2">clearly and that&#39;s what happens is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.999" end="01:02:56.910" style="s2">just happens over and over right it</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.339" end="01:02:59.229" style="s2">keeps moving and so you move like this</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.910" end="01:03:01.420" style="s2">but the thing that&#39;s so cool is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.229" end="01:03:03.339" style="s2">although zigs and zags you say in each</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.420" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">of those zags is it and zigs is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.339" end="01:03:07.690" style="s2">catastrophe I hit a wall my god and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">I had to die a little bit and I barely</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.690" end="01:03:11.589" style="s2">got back up it&#39;s a Phoenix</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:13.959" style="s2">transformation at each at each turn and</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.589" end="01:03:16.839" style="s2">it&#39;s painful but the thing is is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.959" end="01:03:19.839" style="s2">even though you&#39;ve you&#39;ve traveled 20</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.839" end="01:03:22.180" style="s2">miles let&#39;s say on that road and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.839" end="01:03:24.849" style="s2">only moved 3 miles forward you&#39;ve moved</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.180" end="01:03:26.499" style="s2">three miles forward instead of falling</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.849" end="01:03:29.170" style="s2">backwards because that&#39;s the thing too</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.499" end="01:03:32.319" style="s2">is that if you stand still you fall</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.170" end="01:03:34.269" style="s2">backwards you cannot stand still because</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:36.940" style="s2">the world moves away from you if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.269" end="01:03:39.249" style="s2">stand still and there&#39;s no stasis</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.940" end="01:03:41.739" style="s2">there&#39;s only backwards and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.249" end="01:03:46.380" style="s2">not moving backward back forwards then</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.739" end="01:03:46.380" style="s2">you&#39;re moving backwards and that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.739" end="01:03:51.609" style="s2">more of the underlying truth of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.420" end="01:03:53.979" style="s2">Matthieu principle to those who have</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.609" end="01:03:55.300" style="s2">everything more will be given from those</p>

<p begin="01:04:07.870" end="01:04:11.980" style="s2">each transformation starts to lessen</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.540" end="01:04:16.750" style="s2">there&#39;s not so much of you that has to</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.980" end="01:04:19.300" style="s2">die with every mistake and maybe you end</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.750" end="01:04:21.040" style="s2">up oriented at least reasonably properly</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.300" end="01:04:23.500" style="s2">if you were sensible that would have</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.040" end="01:04:25.090" style="s2">been your trip but it wasn&#39;t right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.500" end="01:04:26.980" style="s2">that and perhaps it&#39;s a lot worse than</p>

<p begin="01:04:28.480" end="01:04:34.420" style="s2">because as you stumble forward you</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.680" end="01:04:36.370" style="s2">illuminate and inform yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.420" end="01:04:39.660" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s partly because the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.370" end="01:04:42.550" style="s2">is made of information and if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.660" end="01:04:45.040" style="s2">encounter it and tangle with it then it</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.550" end="01:04:47.290" style="s2">informs you and then you become informed</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.040" end="01:04:53.590" style="s2">and then your information and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.290" end="01:04:59.050" style="s2">you&#39;re ready and so God says to Abraham</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.590" end="01:05:01.300" style="s2">I will make of thee a great nation and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.050" end="01:05:06.760" style="s2">will bless thee and make thy name great</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.300" end="01:05:08.790" style="s2">and thou shalt be a blessing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.760" end="01:05:15.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a good offer</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.790" end="01:05:18.780" style="s2">fundamentally I mean it means what does</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.610" end="01:05:20.950" style="s2">it mean to to be made a great nation of</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.780" end="01:05:22.630" style="s2">well perhaps it has something to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.950" end="01:05:24.460" style="s2">directly with your descendants but I</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.630" end="01:05:26.620" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s just that you know is</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.460" end="01:05:29.380" style="s2">if you&#39;re a force for good in the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.620" end="01:05:31.540" style="s2">then that radiates out from you and if</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.380" end="01:05:33.340" style="s2">you&#39;re good enough it&#39;s difficult to say</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.540" end="01:05:36.040" style="s2">how much of an impact on things you</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.340" end="01:05:38.770" style="s2">could have you know Dostoyevsky who is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.040" end="01:05:41.890" style="s2">very crazy person partly because of his</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.770" end="01:05:43.660" style="s2">epilepsy he said a man is not only</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.890" end="01:05:45.100" style="s2">responsible for everything he does but</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.660" end="01:05:53.740" style="s2">for everything that everyone else does</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.100" end="01:05:56.980" style="s2">and you think well no no no and yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.740" end="01:05:58.110" style="s2">sometimes no sometimes that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.980" end="01:06:00.190" style="s2">think if you&#39;re cataclysmic</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.110" end="01:06:03.520" style="s2">cataclysmically depressed right is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.190" end="01:06:05.890" style="s2">your sins are so egregious that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.520" end="01:06:07.720" style="s2">they&#39;re unforgivable and that in some</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.890" end="01:06:08.990" style="s2">manner you&#39;re at you&#39;re at fault for</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.720" end="01:06:10.610" style="s2">everything that&#39;s terrible with</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.990" end="01:06:12.170" style="s2">world but there&#39;s actually truth than</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.610" end="01:06:14.450" style="s2">that and there&#39;s actually redemptive</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.170" end="01:06:19.550" style="s2">truth in that is that things wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.450" end="01:06:22.310" style="s2">so bad if you weren&#39;t so if you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.550" end="01:06:24.500" style="s2">so far from what you could be and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.310" end="01:06:26.510" style="s2">terribly pessimistic because it&#39;s all on</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.500" end="01:06:28.790" style="s2">you man but it&#39;s terribly optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.510" end="01:06:31.160" style="s2">because God there&#39;s a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.790" end="01:06:32.750" style="s2">you could do and if you&#39;re crying out</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.160" end="01:06:34.420" style="s2">for something to do then that&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.750" end="01:06:37.520" style="s2">news you could possibly have it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.420" end="01:06:40.280" style="s2">things aren&#39;t so good but you know are</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.520" end="01:06:42.650" style="s2">you so if you stop doing the things that</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.280" end="01:06:43.970" style="s2">you knew to be destructive which is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.650" end="01:06:45.110" style="s2">right place to start you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.970" end="01:06:47.030" style="s2">going to clean up your room what do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.110" end="01:06:49.160" style="s2">do first well you just get rid of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.030" end="01:06:50.660" style="s2">mess you know and you know what</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.160" end="01:06:53.150" style="s2">now no one has to come in and tell you</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.660" end="01:06:55.520" style="s2">hopefully what&#39;s the worst mess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.150" end="01:06:57.110" style="s2">just it announces itself to you and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.520" end="01:06:59.150" style="s2">can certainly know yourself and this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.110" end="01:07:01.369" style="s2">a very easy meditative exercise to sit</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.150" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">down and think okay I&#39;m doing one thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.369" end="01:07:05.750" style="s2">really stupidly that I should stop doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:07.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like how long is it going to take</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.750" end="01:07:09.350" style="s2">you to figure out what that is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.220" end="01:07:11.810" style="s2">about two seconds right you&#39;ve known it</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.350" end="01:07:14.930" style="s2">forever but you could even make it less</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.810" end="01:07:17.480" style="s2">demanding you could say there are some</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.930" end="01:07:21.200" style="s2">stupid things that I&#39;m doing that I know</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.480" end="01:07:25.940" style="s2">are stupid and wrong that I could stop</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.200" end="01:07:28.100" style="s2">doing that I would stop doing and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.940" end="01:07:29.630" style="s2">you can just start with that and you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.100" end="01:07:31.070" style="s2">just do that and maybe it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.630" end="01:07:33.740" style="s2">little thing although it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.070" end="01:07:35.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a step forward on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.740" end="01:07:37.490" style="s2">proper voyage it&#39;s not a small thing and</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.600" end="01:07:39.200" style="s2">you think well what would happen you</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.490" end="01:07:41.600" style="s2">could say let&#39;s do this for a year even</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.200" end="01:07:43.730" style="s2">a month just try not to do things you</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.600" end="01:07:45.859" style="s2">know to be stupid and wrong for a month</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.730" end="01:07:47.210" style="s2">and that means not to say things you</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.859" end="01:07:48.500" style="s2">know to be stupid and wrong as well</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.210" end="01:07:51.200" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the most important thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.500" end="01:07:53.359" style="s2">just do it as an experiment see what</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.200" end="01:07:54.890" style="s2">happens and so fun because I have people</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.359" end="01:07:56.060" style="s2">writing to me from all over the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.890" end="01:07:58.190" style="s2">who are saying they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.060" end="01:08:00.380" style="s2">they&#39;re saying well you know I cleaned</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.190" end="01:08:02.780" style="s2">up my room and and then I stopped saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.380" end="01:08:05.180" style="s2">stupid things and my god it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.780" end="01:08:08.740" style="s2">things are way better it&#39;s like who</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.180" end="01:08:12.230" style="s2">would have guessed it you know and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.740" end="01:08:13.490" style="s2">it&#39;s low-hanging fruits man because</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.230" end="01:08:14.750" style="s2">they&#39;re saying that&#39;s the other thing if</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.490" end="01:08:16.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things wrong with you</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.750" end="01:08:18.170" style="s2">then it&#39;s it&#39;s really easy to start</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.250" end="01:08:20.180" style="s2">fixing it you know you got so much</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.170" end="01:08:21.509" style="s2">there&#39;s so much territory that you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.180" end="01:08:24.750" style="s2">inhabit</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.509" end="01:08:27.210" style="s2">I will make of thee a great nation I</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.750" end="01:08:28.920" style="s2">will bless thee that&#39;s good I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.210" end="01:08:31.559" style="s2">whole nation thing that&#39;s positive but</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.920" end="01:08:34.409" style="s2">to have God on your side that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.559" end="01:08:36.659" style="s2">you might want that when things get</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.409" end="01:08:38.639" style="s2">rough that would be good and make that</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.659" end="01:08:43.339" style="s2">name great and now it shall be a</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.639" end="01:08:45.449" style="s2">blessing wonderful that&#39;s a good deal</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.339" end="01:08:47.039" style="s2">then I will bless them that bless thee</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.449" end="01:08:49.500" style="s2">that&#39;s good too</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.039" end="01:08:50.940" style="s2">and curse him that curseth thee and in</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.500" end="01:08:57.960" style="s2">thee shall all families of the earth be</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.940" end="01:08:59.219" style="s2">blessed that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.960" end="01:09:03.199" style="s2">something that wouldn&#39;t it be something</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.219" end="01:09:05.699" style="s2">if you could wake up and your day was</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.199" end="01:09:07.230" style="s2">composed in part of people thanking you</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.699" end="01:09:12.750" style="s2">for all the good things you&#39;ve done in</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.230" end="01:09:16.079" style="s2">the world would that be good it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.750" end="01:09:19.769" style="s2">impossible for that to happen so Abram</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.079" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">departed yes as the Lord had spoken unto</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.769" end="01:09:23.400" style="s2">him and Lord went with and the neighbor</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:27.449" style="s2">him was seventy in five years when he</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.400" end="01:09:29.130" style="s2">departed out of her and that&#39;s all now</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.449" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">Abraham lives a long time but this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.130" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">also part of the story so he has a wife</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:35.009" style="s2">who can&#39;t have children he has nothing</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">obviously he&#39;s been hanging around dad&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.009" end="01:09:39.659" style="s2">Shack for a little too long given that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:42.719" style="s2">he&#39;s 75 right it&#39;s kind of time to get a</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.659" end="01:09:44.699" style="s2">fire lit underneath him a bit and so it</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.719" end="01:09:46.859" style="s2">is not got much going for him but he</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.699" end="01:09:48.659" style="s2">still decides to to move forward and</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.859" end="01:09:50.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen this too you know like if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.659" end="01:09:53.819" style="s2">don&#39;t have your destiny in hand by your</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.880" end="01:09:55.289" style="s2">time you&#39;re thirty it&#39;s it&#39;s rough you</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.819" end="01:09:57.030" style="s2">start hurting and if you don&#39;t have your</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.289" end="01:10:00.360" style="s2">destiny in hand by the time you&#39;re 40</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.030" end="01:10:07.289" style="s2">then you really start hurting and 40 is</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.360" end="01:10:08.550" style="s2">a real fork in the road the fork in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.289" end="01:10:10.590" style="s2">road that&#39;s always where you meet the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.550" end="01:10:11.940" style="s2">devil by the way and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.590" end="01:10:15.000" style="s2">every time you have to make a decision</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.940" end="01:10:15.750" style="s2">the possibility of evil beckons that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.000" end="01:10:17.429" style="s2">why that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.750" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">I had a friend I told you a little about</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.429" end="01:10:22.050" style="s2">him and he killed himself just after 40</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.679" end="01:10:23.670" style="s2">you know he had had a book published and</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.050" end="01:10:25.920" style="s2">with a very small press he was quite a</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.670" end="01:10:28.349" style="s2">good writer but he could not get himself</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.920" end="01:10:30.150" style="s2">together and it hit him too hard at 40</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.349" end="01:10:32.099" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s hopeless at</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.150" end="01:10:33.780" style="s2">40 I&#39;m not saying that and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.099" end="01:10:35.370" style="s2">saying that partly because of these</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.780" end="01:10:37.350" style="s2">verses but also partly because of</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.370" end="01:10:39.930" style="s2">in my clinical practice I&#39;ve had people</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.350" end="01:10:43.080" style="s2">come to me who have had very chaotic and</p>

<p begin="01:11:35.130" end="01:11:38.580" style="s2">suppose it depends to degree to some</p>

<p begin="01:11:43.860" end="01:11:49.830" style="s2">isn&#39;t setting this up to be easy right</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.230" end="01:11:51.780" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s old and his and his wife is</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.830" end="01:11:53.550" style="s2">old too and more than that she&#39;s barren</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.780" end="01:11:55.500" style="s2">how is he going to be the father of</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.550" end="01:12:00.350" style="s2">Nations how is he going to be successful</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.500" end="01:12:02.790" style="s2">well the initial departure point is</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.350" end="01:12:08.040" style="s2">insufficient radically insufficient and</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.790" end="01:12:09.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s very inspiring because it</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.040" end="01:12:13.710" style="s2">means that you can start from where you</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.930" end="01:12:15.180" style="s2">are so Abram departed as the Lord had</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.710" end="01:12:17.610" style="s2">spoken unto him and lot went with him</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.180" end="01:12:19.320" style="s2">and Abram was 75 years old when he</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.610" end="01:12:21.390" style="s2">departed out of Haran and Abram took</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.320" end="01:12:23.370" style="s2">Sarai his wife and lot his brother&#39;s son</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.390" end="01:12:25.980" style="s2">and all their substance that they had</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.370" end="01:12:27.930" style="s2">gathered and they know he has a</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.980" end="01:12:29.970" style="s2">relationship with law right he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.930" end="01:12:32.010" style="s2">have his own son but he his brother died</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.970" end="01:12:34.740" style="s2">and so he takes his nephew as his son</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.010" end="01:12:37.110" style="s2">that&#39;s grateful you know he could be</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.740" end="01:12:38.520" style="s2">very angry and have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.110" end="01:12:40.200" style="s2">him because he didn&#39;t get his own son</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.520" end="01:12:42.360" style="s2">but that isn&#39;t that isn&#39;t what happens</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.200" end="01:12:45.090" style="s2">is he&#39;s offered a substitute let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.360" end="01:12:49.140" style="s2">and he accepts it and so good for him</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.090" end="01:12:51.090" style="s2">you know and and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.140" end="01:12:53.220" style="s2">it&#39;s also something that I&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.090" end="01:12:55.070" style="s2">characterizes people who can make the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.220" end="01:12:57.060" style="s2">best of a bad lot is they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.070" end="01:12:59.460" style="s2">exactly what they want but something</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.060" end="01:13:03.270" style="s2">comes along that offers possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.460" end="01:13:05.640" style="s2">that are sufficient perhaps if exploited</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.270" end="01:13:07.260" style="s2">properly and they open their heart and</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.640" end="01:13:09.270" style="s2">welcome them in instead of rejecting</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.260" end="01:13:10.650" style="s2">them in bitterness and so that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.270" end="01:13:14.490" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s part of Abraham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.650" end="01:13:16.050" style="s2">character and Abram took Sarai his wife</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.490" end="01:13:17.580" style="s2">and law his brothers son and all their</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.050" end="01:13:19.260" style="s2">substance that they had gathered and all</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.580" end="01:13:20.700" style="s2">the souls that they had gotten in her on</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.260" end="01:13:23.340" style="s2">and they went for us to go into the land</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.700" end="01:13:26.790" style="s2">of Canaan into exile let&#39;s say and into</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.340" end="01:13:30.090" style="s2">the land of Canaan they came and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.790" end="01:13:32.160" style="s2">another repetition of the transformation</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.090" end="01:13:36.750" style="s2">story right you have to go to a land</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.160" end="01:13:38.910" style="s2">where you&#39;re not welcome an abram passed</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.750" end="01:13:41.520" style="s2">through the land unto the place of CGM</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.910" end="01:13:43.170" style="s2">unto the plain of mora and the Canaanite</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.520" end="01:13:44.790" style="s2">was then in the land and the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.170" end="01:13:46.770" style="s2">appeared unto Abram and said unto thy</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.790" end="01:13:48.390" style="s2">seed I will give you this land and there</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.770" end="01:13:50.610" style="s2">he builded an altar to the Lord who</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.390" end="01:13:52.620" style="s2">appeared unto him and he removed from</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.610" end="01:13:54.270" style="s2">thence unto a mountain on the east of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.620" end="01:13:55.740" style="s2">the cell and pitched his tent having the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.270" end="01:13:57.510" style="s2">fell on the west and high on the east</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.740" end="01:13:58.890" style="s2">and there he built an altar unto the</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.510" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">Lord and called upon the name of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.890" end="01:14:04.380" style="s2">Lord now we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:06.390" style="s2">these rituals precisely you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.380" end="01:14:08.970" style="s2">know if the people who did this engaged</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.390" end="01:14:11.460" style="s2">in a meditative ritual without the idea</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.970" end="01:14:11.880" style="s2">that you take something of value you do</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.460" end="01:14:14.330" style="s2">this</p>

<p begin="01:14:23.550" end="01:14:28.950" style="s2">to ask you know - what do I do next</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.520" end="01:14:31.290" style="s2">how do I orient myself in the world as a</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.950" end="01:14:32.310" style="s2">useful exercise to do that - I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.290" end="01:14:34.440" style="s2">it&#39;s something that people could do</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.310" end="01:14:36.540" style="s2">every morning I think it&#39;s useful to sit</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.440" end="01:14:38.300" style="s2">down and think okay what&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.540" end="01:14:40.890" style="s2">important thing I should do today</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.300" end="01:14:45.000" style="s2">what I have an array of things that call</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.890" end="01:14:47.790" style="s2">to me to be done some of which I will do</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.000" end="01:14:50.490" style="s2">with joy and some of which I will bear</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.790" end="01:14:52.110" style="s2">as responsibilities but I raised em</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.490" end="01:14:53.550" style="s2">selves in front of me and with what</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.110" end="01:14:57.510" style="s2">should I attend to first</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.550" end="01:14:59.370" style="s2">well do you ask or do you decide and it</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.510" end="01:15:01.110" style="s2">seems to me when I do it because I do it</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.370" end="01:15:02.670" style="s2">all the time I do it every morning I try</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.110" end="01:15:04.230" style="s2">to sit down and think okay I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.670" end="01:15:07.160" style="s2">things that I would like to do and</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.230" end="01:15:10.110" style="s2">things that call to me out of necessity</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.160" end="01:15:13.140" style="s2">what do i do first and it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.110" end="01:15:15.150" style="s2">a decision as it is a question and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.140" end="01:15:17.580" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I&#39;m calling on it&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.150" end="01:15:19.590" style="s2">calling on my capacity to think I</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.580" end="01:15:23.969" style="s2">suppose but that&#39;s not my capacity</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.590" end="01:15:26.340" style="s2">exactly I&#39;m there I can I can commune</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.969" end="01:15:30.420" style="s2">with whatever provides answers and I can</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.340" end="01:15:32.429" style="s2">think that that&#39;s me thinking but and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.420" end="01:15:34.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t that I believe that I can&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.429" end="01:15:36.179" style="s2">I do believe that I can consciously</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.320" end="01:15:37.830" style="s2">think but that&#39;s not the same as calling</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.179" end="01:15:39.989" style="s2">for inspiration it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.830" end="01:15:41.429" style="s2">process just like a dream is not</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.989" end="01:15:42.840" style="s2">conscious thinking it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.429" end="01:15:44.160" style="s2">happens to you and that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.840" end="01:15:45.989" style="s2">inspiration is also something that</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.160" end="01:15:47.760" style="s2">happens to you because I ask myself well</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.989" end="01:15:51.239" style="s2">what&#39;s the most important thing I could</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.760" end="01:15:52.620" style="s2">do next and then I have an answer to</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.239" end="01:15:55.110" style="s2">that but it isn&#39;t because I decided</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.620" end="01:15:56.460" style="s2">exactly I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.110" end="01:15:58.590" style="s2">whatever it is and that I want to know</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.460" end="01:16:01.860" style="s2">what it is those are the decisions but</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.590" end="01:16:04.949" style="s2">but there&#39;s an involuntary aspect to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.860" end="01:16:06.900" style="s2">sorting that occurs and and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.949" end="01:16:11.190" style="s2">psychological equivalent I suppose to</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.900" end="01:16:14.120" style="s2">this and I guess the sacrifice is when I</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.190" end="01:16:18.120" style="s2">feel that I will do whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.120" end="01:16:20.010" style="s2">calls to be done then I don&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.120" end="01:16:23.370" style="s2">other things that I might want to do and</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.010" end="01:16:25.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a sacrifice it&#39;s to me it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.370" end="01:16:29.010" style="s2">proper sacrifice because my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.710" end="01:16:32.070" style="s2">that things don&#39;t go properly unless you</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.010" end="01:16:35.760" style="s2">do what&#39;s most important and if I want</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.070" end="01:16:37.560" style="s2">things to go properly and I do because</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.760" end="01:16:39.929" style="s2">I&#39;ve had my taste of things not going</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.560" end="01:16:45.179" style="s2">properly I want things to go properly</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.929" end="01:16:48.210" style="s2">and so then it&#39;s not so difficult to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.179" end="01:16:49.560" style="s2">what&#39;s necessary to to do what makes</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.210" end="01:16:55.440" style="s2">things go properly under those</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.560" end="01:16:57.120" style="s2">circumstances and it&#39;s partly see this</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.440" end="01:16:59.130" style="s2">is partly why the story of Sodom and</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.120" end="01:17:01.770" style="s2">Gomorrah is embedded in the Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.130" end="01:17:04.350" style="s2">stories I think because that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.770" end="01:17:07.020" style="s2">apocalyptic story right if things go</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.350" end="01:17:11.310" style="s2">badly enough the whole city is destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.020" end="01:17:12.900" style="s2">and then and the reason it goes badly is</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.310" end="01:17:16.170" style="s2">because the people in the city do not</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.900" end="01:17:16.680" style="s2">behave properly and the people in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.170" end="01:17:19.470" style="s2">city might</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.680" end="01:17:21.480" style="s2">bu and so if you&#39;re not behaving</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.470" end="01:17:24.120" style="s2">properly then you go and so does the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.480" end="01:17:26.250" style="s2">city and maybe you don&#39;t want maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.120" end="01:17:28.050" style="s2">do want that but maybe you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.250" end="01:17:30.900" style="s2">that and if you don&#39;t want that then</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.050" end="01:17:32.610" style="s2">maybe and you know that if you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.900" end="01:17:35.040" style="s2">things property then it&#39;s you and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.610" end="01:17:37.320" style="s2">city if you actually know that then</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.040" end="01:17:38.280" style="s2">maybe that terrifies you badly enough so</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.320" end="01:17:40.260" style="s2">that you&#39;re willing to make the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.280" end="01:17:42.030" style="s2">sacrifice to do the right things instead</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.260" end="01:17:47.160" style="s2">of the impulsive things that you might</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.030" end="01:17:50.160" style="s2">otherwise want to do you know I learned</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.160" end="01:17:52.770" style="s2">from Viktor Frankl and from Karl yoga</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.160" end="01:17:55.080" style="s2">and from Alexander Solzhenitsyn and for</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.770" end="01:17:57.320" style="s2">many of the people whose works on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.080" end="01:18:00.210" style="s2">Holocaust that I read and on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.320" end="01:18:02.460" style="s2">catastrophes in the Soviet Union and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.210" end="01:18:05.760" style="s2">people who studied it most deeply always</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.460" end="01:18:07.950" style="s2">came to the same conclusion the state</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.760" end="01:18:10.560" style="s2">became corrupted because each individual</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.950" end="01:18:13.200" style="s2">allowed themselves to be corrupted or</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.560" end="01:18:14.940" style="s2">perhaps participated joyfully in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.200" end="01:18:17.880" style="s2">process of being corrupted and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.940" end="01:18:21.270" style="s2">consequence of that was the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.880" end="01:18:23.640" style="s2">world and so what that means is that if</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.270" end="01:18:26.700" style="s2">you don&#39;t behave properly then you bring</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.640" end="01:18:28.020" style="s2">about the end of the world and maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.700" end="01:18:28.560" style="s2">think well that&#39;s only the end of your</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.020" end="01:18:30.570" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.560" end="01:18:32.610" style="s2">fair enough or maybe it&#39;s the only the</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.570" end="01:18:34.410" style="s2">end of your family&#39;s world you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.610" end="01:18:37.520" style="s2">which I suppose might give you some</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.410" end="01:18:39.870" style="s2">pause but there&#39;s more to it than that</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.520" end="01:18:40.320" style="s2">because you&#39;re connected to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.870" end="01:18:44.720" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.320" end="01:18:44.720" style="s2">and what you do that isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.230" end="01:18:50.160" style="s2">distributes itself and all the things</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.610" end="01:18:53.790" style="s2">you don&#39;t do that could be good take</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.160" end="01:18:56.280" style="s2">away from the whole and so if you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.790" end="01:18:59.420" style="s2">that and I do think you know that if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.280" end="01:19:03.270" style="s2">take it seriously because if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.420" end="01:19:05.490" style="s2">if you look at historical events the</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.270" end="01:19:08.130" style="s2">cataclysmic events of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.490" end="01:19:14.600" style="s2">seriously I do not think that you can</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.130" end="01:19:17.160" style="s2">fail to come to that conclusion and</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.600" end="01:19:21.690" style="s2">Abraham journeyed going on still towards</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.160" end="01:19:24.090" style="s2">the south that&#39;s interesting because to</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.690" end="01:19:27.260" style="s2">go south means to go downhill too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.090" end="01:19:30.270" style="s2">not good to go south it&#39;s colloquial for</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.260" end="01:19:32.100" style="s2">going to where you shouldn&#39;t go and</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.270" end="01:19:36.420" style="s2">this is what happens to Abram you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.100" end="01:19:38.700" style="s2">he his a cent is preceded by a descent</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.420" end="01:19:43.410" style="s2">and that&#39;s very common in life I would</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.700" end="01:19:45.960" style="s2">say and so it&#39;s a little the redemptive</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.410" end="01:19:48.570" style="s2">element of this narrative is that if the</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.960" end="01:19:51.330" style="s2">Covenant is constructed properly so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.570" end="01:19:54.390" style="s2">an arc which is your decision to align</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.330" end="01:19:57.330" style="s2">yourself with God for all intents and</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.390" end="01:20:01.290" style="s2">purposes then even the journey south can</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.330" end="01:20:05.400" style="s2">be part of a broader journey upward and</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.290" end="01:20:08.190" style="s2">there was a famine in the land that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.400" end="01:20:09.600" style="s2">Mother Nature failing to cooperate I</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.190" end="01:20:11.160" style="s2">mean that&#39;s going to be pretty</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.600" end="01:20:12.780" style="s2">disheartening for Abraham don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.160" end="01:20:16.380" style="s2">think is he finally gets it together</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.780" end="01:20:18.390" style="s2">when he&#39;s 75 to leave and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.380" end="01:20:20.700" style="s2">because God says well do you not get</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.390" end="01:20:22.650" style="s2">going and and so the first place he goes</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.700" end="01:20:24.300" style="s2">everyone&#39;s starving to death it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.650" end="01:20:25.110" style="s2">you know you might think about that as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.300" end="01:20:28.170" style="s2">test of faith</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.110" end="01:20:30.120" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you say but he keeps going and</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.170" end="01:20:32.640" style="s2">then what happens well he has to go to</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.120" end="01:20:34.590" style="s2">Egypt so great he goes where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.640" end="01:20:36.480" style="s2">starving where everyone&#39;s starving and</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.590" end="01:20:40.050" style="s2">then to get away from where everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.480" end="01:20:41.550" style="s2">starving he goes to a tyranny so the</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.050" end="01:20:44.760" style="s2">whole beginning of the story is not</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.550" end="01:20:46.590" style="s2">particularly auspicious and Abram went</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.760" end="01:20:48.830" style="s2">down into Egypt to sojourn there for the</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.590" end="01:20:51.630" style="s2">famine was Grievous in the land</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.830" end="01:20:54.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a repetition of the same idea again</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.630" end="01:20:55.980" style="s2">there&#39;s downhill voyage out into chaos</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.150" end="01:20:58.320" style="s2">right it&#39;s repeated over and over that</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.980" end="01:21:02.550" style="s2">the beginning of Abraham&#39;s journey is</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.320" end="01:21:05.640" style="s2">basically a sequence of of experiences</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.550" end="01:21:07.500" style="s2">of Exile chaos tyranny and catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.640" end="01:21:08.900" style="s2">well you should be able to relate to</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.500" end="01:21:11.430" style="s2">that you know how hard it is to get</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.900" end="01:21:14.190" style="s2">things together you know you go out to</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.430" end="01:21:16.080" style="s2">do what you&#39;re supposed to do say and</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.190" end="01:21:18.270" style="s2">there&#39;s you&#39;re beset by the</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.080" end="01:21:19.920" style="s2">intransigence of the world and failure</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.270" end="01:21:24.720" style="s2">well so what are you supposed to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:26.340" style="s2">about that well maintain your faith in</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.720" end="01:21:29.190" style="s2">the good and continue to move forward</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.340" end="01:21:31.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea and part of that even if</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.190" end="01:21:33.410" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t buy the metaphor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.440" end="01:21:38.160" style="s2">like what are you going to do instead</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.410" end="01:21:39.660" style="s2">that won&#39;t make it worse so even if</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.160" end="01:21:43.260" style="s2">there it isn&#39;t enough that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.660" end="01:21:44.050" style="s2">pursuing your at least for stalling the</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.260" end="01:21:46.270" style="s2">transfer may</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.050" end="01:21:48.970" style="s2">of the chaos into your of your life into</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.270" end="01:21:51.220" style="s2">sheer hell and that can certainly happen</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.970" end="01:21:53.530" style="s2">you know you see people who are having a</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.220" end="01:21:55.210" style="s2">terrible time and then you see people</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.530" end="01:21:57.970" style="s2">who are having a terrible time who are</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.210" end="01:22:00.250" style="s2">also in hell and it&#39;s a lot better to</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.970" end="01:22:02.500" style="s2">just have a terrible time than to have a</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.250" end="01:22:06.640" style="s2">terrible time and be in hell at the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.500" end="01:22:08.560" style="s2">time and it came to pass when he was</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.640" end="01:22:10.810" style="s2">come too near to enter into Egypt that</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.560" end="01:22:12.640" style="s2">he said unto Sarai his wife behold now I</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.810" end="01:22:14.440" style="s2">know that thou art a fair woman to look</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.640" end="01:22:16.240" style="s2">upon therefore it shall come to pass</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.440" end="01:22:18.100" style="s2">when the Egyptians shall see thee</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.240" end="01:22:19.840" style="s2">that they shall say this is his wife and</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.100" end="01:22:22.330" style="s2">they will kill me that they will save</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.840" end="01:22:24.310" style="s2">thee alive so look I mean Abraham is</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.330" end="01:22:27.160" style="s2">Abram is really having a rough time he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.310" end="01:22:28.900" style="s2">a failure right I mean he&#39;s wandering</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.160" end="01:22:31.360" style="s2">around through the land of starvation</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.900" end="01:22:34.180" style="s2">now he&#39;s going to go be a quasi slave in</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.360" end="01:22:37.030" style="s2">Egypt he has this incredibly attractive</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.180" end="01:22:40.750" style="s2">wife and all he can look forward to is</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.030" end="01:22:43.740" style="s2">the fact that the most successful man in</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.750" end="01:22:46.840" style="s2">Egypt the Pharaoh will take her from him</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.740" end="01:22:49.240" style="s2">so he&#39;s got the whole embitterment thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.840" end="01:22:51.190" style="s2">pretty much nailed down as far as I can</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.240" end="01:22:54.310" style="s2">tell and this is when he makes one of</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.190" end="01:22:57.490" style="s2">his errors let&#39;s say and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.310" end="01:22:59.560" style="s2">errors that humanizes him say I pray</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.490" end="01:23:01.840" style="s2">thee that thou art my sister that may be</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.560" end="01:23:05.110" style="s2">well for me for thy sake and my soul</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.840" end="01:23:06.910" style="s2">shall live because of thee and it came</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.110" end="01:23:08.470" style="s2">to pass that when Abram was coming to</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.910" end="01:23:10.270" style="s2">Egypt the Egyptians beheld the woman</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.470" end="01:23:12.130" style="s2">that was she was very fair the Prince is</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.270" end="01:23:13.870" style="s2">also a pharaoh saw her and commended her</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.130" end="01:23:15.760" style="s2">before Pharaoh and the woman was taken</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.870" end="01:23:18.370" style="s2">into Pharaoh&#39;s house and he entreated</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.760" end="01:23:20.380" style="s2">Abram well for her sake and he had sheep</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.370" end="01:23:22.060" style="s2">and oxen and he houses and menservants</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.380" end="01:23:24.010" style="s2">and maidservants as she houses and</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.060" end="01:23:26.320" style="s2">camels so actually things work out</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.010" end="01:23:28.570" style="s2">pretty well for for Abram despite his</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.320" end="01:23:31.360" style="s2">deceit right which is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.570" end="01:23:33.850" style="s2">and I guess it&#39;s because if the</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.360" end="01:23:35.500" style="s2">overarching structure is solid something</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.850" end="01:23:39.690" style="s2">like that it&#39;s something like that then</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.500" end="01:23:41.950" style="s2">then errors can still be forgiven to</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.690" end="01:23:45.250" style="s2">speak about it from a metaphorical</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.950" end="01:23:46.960" style="s2">perspective and the Lord plagued Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.250" end="01:23:50.950" style="s2">and his house with great plagues because</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.960" end="01:23:54.730" style="s2">of Sarai Abrams wife well it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.950" end="01:23:56.860" style="s2">seem very fair but because the Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.730" end="01:23:57.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t know but but it&#39;s not the right</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.860" end="01:23:59.710" style="s2">way to look at it</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.940" end="01:24:01.990" style="s2">the right way to look at it see there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.710" end="01:24:06.220" style="s2">a story later in the in the Bible about</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.990" end="01:24:08.440" style="s2">David and David David could be a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.220" end="01:24:11.560" style="s2">bad guy you know so one of the things he</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.440" end="01:24:14.200" style="s2">does is when he becomes king he&#39;s in his</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.560" end="01:24:17.800" style="s2">castle and he&#39;s looking over the city</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.200" end="01:24:20.920" style="s2">and he sees a woman nude bathing nude</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.800" end="01:24:23.950" style="s2">sunbathing nude on a roof out on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.920" end="01:24:26.740" style="s2">city and he&#39;s smitten by her floored by</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.950" end="01:24:29.920" style="s2">her and he has inquiries made about who</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.740" end="01:24:32.140" style="s2">she is her name is Beth Sheba and and he</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.920" end="01:24:34.240" style="s2">finds out who her husband is and her</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.140" end="01:24:40.060" style="s2">husband actually happens to be a general</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.240" end="01:24:42.040" style="s2">in his army and he arranges for that</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.060" end="01:24:44.500" style="s2">general to be put at the thick of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.040" end="01:24:51.460" style="s2">battle and killed and then he takes</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.500" end="01:24:53.290" style="s2">Bathsheba so and and and the Lord is not</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.460" end="01:24:56.230" style="s2">pleased by that let&#39;s put it that way</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.290" end="01:24:58.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s interesting is only did it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.230" end="01:25:01.300" style="s2">an interesting story because you might</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.750" end="01:25:03.820" style="s2">say well why can&#39;t the King do whatever</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.300" end="01:25:06.460" style="s2">the hell he wants like seriously</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.820" end="01:25:08.680" style="s2">he&#39;s the king he&#39;s not just he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.460" end="01:25:12.100" style="s2">like the Prime Minister the president</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.680" end="01:25:13.420" style="s2">right he&#39;s the king and so you might say</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.100" end="01:25:16.870" style="s2">well why is the King subject to any</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.420" end="01:25:18.840" style="s2">rules whatsoever what&#39;s the rationale</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.870" end="01:25:21.460" style="s2">for the king being subject to rules</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.840" end="01:25:24.130" style="s2">well the rationale emerges in these</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.460" end="01:25:28.150" style="s2">stories if there are social strictures</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.130" end="01:25:30.730" style="s2">that are such that even if the ruler of</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.150" end="01:25:31.930" style="s2">the land transgresses against them there</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.730" end="01:25:34.270" style="s2">will be hell to pay</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.930" end="01:25:35.710" style="s2">and that&#39;s continually presented over</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.270" end="01:25:37.840" style="s2">and over in the biblical stories and</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.710" end="01:25:41.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a natural law sort of idea that</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.840" end="01:25:44.800" style="s2">there are there are intrinsic rules to</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.770" end="01:25:48.040" style="s2">the game of social human being and if</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.800" end="01:25:50.860" style="s2">you and maybe intrinsic rules to this to</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.040" end="01:25:53.470" style="s2">the natural state of human being you</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.860" end="01:25:56.530" style="s2">break those rules consciously or</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.470" end="01:25:58.840" style="s2">unconsciously at your absolute peril and</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.530" end="01:26:00.940" style="s2">not only at your peril but at the peril</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.840" end="01:26:03.070" style="s2">of the state and it doesn&#39;t matter who</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.940" end="01:26:05.830" style="s2">you are and so I would say this is</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.070" end="01:26:08.230" style="s2">actually an indication of God being fair</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.830" end="01:26:11.920" style="s2">rather than being unfair because the</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.230" end="01:26:13.540" style="s2">rule here is Pharaoh or not</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.920" end="01:26:16.719" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to take someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.540" end="01:26:18.100" style="s2">wife and the ignorance is no excuse now</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.719" end="01:26:19.929" style="s2">you might say that&#39;s a little bit harsh</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.100" end="01:26:22.390" style="s2">and perhaps it is a little bit harsh but</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.929" end="01:26:26.219" style="s2">it&#39;s not without merit the idea is not</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.390" end="01:26:29.440" style="s2">without merit and of course Abram is</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.219" end="01:26:33.370" style="s2">implicit in this despite that he is</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.440" end="01:26:35.530" style="s2">successful and Pharaoh called Abram and</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.370" end="01:26:37.660" style="s2">said what is this that thou has done</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.530" end="01:26:40.600" style="s2">unto me why did so now tell me that she</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.660" end="01:26:43.210" style="s2">was thy wife why said Stowe you she is</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.600" end="01:26:46.000" style="s2">my sister I might have taken her to me</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.210" end="01:26:48.429" style="s2">to wife now therefore behold thy wife</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.000" end="01:26:49.989" style="s2">take her and go thy way and Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.429" end="01:26:51.460" style="s2">commanded his men concerning him and</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.989" end="01:26:54.760" style="s2">they sent him away and his wife and all</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.460" end="01:26:56.110" style="s2">that he had and Abram went out of Egypt</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.760" end="01:26:58.179" style="s2">he and his wife and all that he had in</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.110" end="01:27:00.190" style="s2">lot with him into the south and Abram</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.179" end="01:27:03.130" style="s2">was very rich in cattle in silver and in</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.190" end="01:27:06.640" style="s2">gold and that&#39;s it so what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.130" end="01:27:08.230" style="s2">you know big Abraham he he goes to the</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.640" end="01:27:11.380" style="s2">place of famine and then he goes to the</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.230" end="01:27:13.719" style="s2">to the place of charity and then he he</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.380" end="01:27:18.520" style="s2">lies and then he almost loses his wife</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.719" end="01:27:23.739" style="s2">but because he goes things work out for</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.520" end="01:27:25.239" style="s2">him and so hooray for that and he went</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.739" end="01:27:26.860" style="s2">on his journeys from the south even to</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.239" end="01:27:28.300" style="s2">Bethel unto the place where his tent had</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.860" end="01:27:30.580" style="s2">been at the beginning between Bethel and</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.300" end="01:27:32.440" style="s2">high unto the place of the altar so he</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.580" end="01:27:34.750" style="s2">makes another sacrifice which he had</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.440" end="01:27:36.429" style="s2">made there at the first and there Abram</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.750" end="01:27:38.710" style="s2">called on the name of the Lord well so</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.429" end="01:27:41.860" style="s2">he&#39;s had an adventure right he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.710" end="01:27:43.570" style="s2">he&#39;s finished his journey and and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.860" end="01:27:44.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a culminating point in this</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.570" end="01:27:46.929" style="s2">narrative and now I just know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.890" end="01:27:49.060" style="s2">he&#39;s left the place he said he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.929" end="01:27:50.500" style="s2">know what to do so it&#39;s time to build an</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.060" end="01:27:52.929" style="s2">altar and make a sacrifice and figure</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.500" end="01:27:55.060" style="s2">out and to ask for divine guidance once</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.929" end="01:27:57.880" style="s2">again to figure out okay well I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.060" end="01:28:00.370" style="s2">that been there done that what&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.880" end="01:28:02.920" style="s2">and I&#39;m the question is asked seriously</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.370" end="01:28:05.410" style="s2">and this is something to consider if you</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.920" end="01:28:09.460" style="s2">want to know what to do ask seriously</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.410" end="01:28:14.500" style="s2">and say I&#39;m willing to see Abraham</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.460" end="01:28:16.060" style="s2">sacrifices a life to his vow well so</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.500" end="01:28:17.770" style="s2">what do you do well you don&#39;t sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.060" end="01:28:19.150" style="s2">an animal you don&#39;t you don&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.770" end="01:28:21.460" style="s2">blood sacrifice you do it</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.150" end="01:28:25.050" style="s2">psychologically you say I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.460" end="01:28:25.050" style="s2">sacrifice my life to the same</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.689" end="01:28:28.749" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do if you&#39;re serious</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.070" end="01:28:31.419" style="s2">what do I do next well I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.749" end="01:28:32.349" style="s2">sacrifice my life to this aim what is it</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.419" end="01:28:35.320" style="s2">that I should do that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.349" end="01:28:37.659" style="s2">sacrificing my life to that&#39;s a serious</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.320" end="01:28:38.679" style="s2">question well then maybe that&#39;s the sort</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.659" end="01:28:39.760" style="s2">of question that people don&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.679" end="01:28:42.550" style="s2">because they&#39;re afraid of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.760" end="01:28:44.769" style="s2">seriousness of the question and and what</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.550" end="01:28:46.179" style="s2">the magnitude of the potential answer do</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.769" end="01:28:47.679" style="s2">you really want to know what you should</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.179" end="01:28:50.349" style="s2">do that would be worth sacrificing your</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.679" end="01:28:53.139" style="s2">life to well the answer is yes because</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.349" end="01:28:56.919" style="s2">it&#39;s worth it but the answer is also no</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.139" end="01:29:00.669" style="s2">because what really it&#39;s your life you</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.919" end="01:29:04.030" style="s2">know what if you&#39;re wrong and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.669" end="01:29:05.739" style="s2">probably wrong but maybe that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.030" end="01:29:07.780" style="s2">matter maybe it doesn&#39;t matter because</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.739" end="01:29:10.570" style="s2">maybe the rightness is in the process</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.780" end="01:29:12.070" style="s2">and not in the and not in the decision</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.570" end="01:29:13.719" style="s2">right because it&#39;s not it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.070" end="01:29:15.909" style="s2">beginning of a sequence of decisions as</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.719" end="01:29:17.289" style="s2">we&#39;ve already pointed out to the place</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.909" end="01:29:19.059" style="s2">of the altar which he had made there at</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.289" end="01:29:21.999" style="s2">the first and there Abram called on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.059" end="01:29:24.309" style="s2">name of the Lord and Lord also and Lord</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.999" end="01:29:26.229" style="s2">also which went with Abraham Abram had</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.309" end="01:29:28.030" style="s2">flocks and herds and tents and the land</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.229" end="01:29:29.499" style="s2">was not able to bear them that they</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.030" end="01:29:30.999" style="s2">might dwell together for their substance</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.499" end="01:29:32.739" style="s2">was great so that they could not dwell</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.999" end="01:29:34.749" style="s2">together and there was a strife between</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.739" end="01:29:37.360" style="s2">the herdsmen of Abrams cattle the</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.749" end="01:29:38.679" style="s2">Cowboys and the herdmen of lost cattle</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.360" end="01:29:41.019" style="s2">and the Canaanite and the perizzite</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.679" end="01:29:42.639" style="s2">dwelled then in the land well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.019" end="01:29:44.260" style="s2">interesting too because you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.639" end="01:29:46.510" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s having a pretty good time of</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.260" end="01:29:49.269" style="s2">it now right he&#39;s out of starvation hey</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.510" end="01:29:51.820" style="s2">that&#39;s good he&#39;s out of the tyranny now</p>

<p begin="01:29:51.820" end="01:29:55.689" style="s2">flips on him he&#39;s wealthy and now a bad</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.039" end="01:29:57.130" style="s2">thing happens to him right it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.689" end="01:29:58.510" style="s2">he&#39;s got all this wealth and so does his</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.130" end="01:30:00.669" style="s2">nephew now they can&#39;t get along because</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.510" end="01:30:02.469" style="s2">they have too much stuff so that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.669" end="01:30:04.599" style="s2">comical as well that I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.469" end="01:30:08.229" style="s2">comic interlude here now they handle it</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.599" end="01:30:09.820" style="s2">properly and Abram said unto Lord let</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.229" end="01:30:11.889" style="s2">there be no strife I pray they between</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.820" end="01:30:14.229" style="s2">me and thee and between my herdmen and I</p>

<p begin="01:30:22.900" end="01:30:26.650" style="s2">to the left so basically they sit down</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.550" end="01:30:29.050" style="s2">and say well you know one of us has got</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.650" end="01:30:30.489" style="s2">to get out of town and it can be one or</p>

<p begin="01:30:30.489" end="01:30:33.699" style="s2">can flip a coin or but we have to we</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.139" end="01:30:37.149" style="s2">have to separate and so they do it</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.699" end="01:30:39.610" style="s2">amicably and Lord lifted up his eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.149" end="01:30:41.350" style="s2">looked at all of the plain of Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.610" end="01:30:42.850" style="s2">that it was well watered everywhere so</p>

<p begin="01:30:42.850" end="01:30:47.350" style="s2">because you remember he even means well</p>

<p begin="01:31:35.290" end="01:31:40.000" style="s2">think it&#39;s an interesting word it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.719" end="01:31:42.070" style="s2">the derivation of an archery term in my</p>

<p begin="01:31:42.070" end="01:31:46.780" style="s2">the Greek word was hamartia and Hammar</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.530" end="01:31:49.630" style="s2">he is an archery term which means to to</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.780" end="01:31:51.219" style="s2">miss the bullseye and you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.630" end="01:31:52.449" style="s2">worth thinking about that metaphorically</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.219" end="01:31:53.530" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got to think about all</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.449" end="01:31:54.940" style="s2">the ways that you could miss the</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.530" end="01:31:57.730" style="s2">bullseye right you can close your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.940" end="01:31:59.409" style="s2">that&#39;s very common you could just not</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.730" end="01:32:02.050" style="s2">lift up the damned bow and arrow to</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.409" end="01:32:05.380" style="s2">begin with you could face the wrong way</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.050" end="01:32:07.750" style="s2">you could be unskilled in your aim but</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.380" end="01:32:09.760" style="s2">I&#39;m and I also like the the archery</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.750" end="01:32:11.949" style="s2">metaphor because human beings are built</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.760" end="01:32:13.630" style="s2">on a hunting platform right and we</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.949" end="01:32:16.060" style="s2">always aim at things were things that</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.630" end="01:32:18.280" style="s2">were ballistic creatures on a trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.060" end="01:32:19.420" style="s2">always and we&#39;re always aiming at</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.280" end="01:32:21.130" style="s2">something we&#39;re always aiming at the</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.420" end="01:32:22.510" style="s2">mark and which is of course what you do</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.130" end="01:32:24.489" style="s2">when you hunt right because you have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.510" end="01:32:26.320" style="s2">hit the mark precisely and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.489" end="01:32:27.820" style="s2">we&#39;re like and so what we&#39;re like that</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.320" end="01:32:29.440" style="s2">psychologically we have to aim at</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.820" end="01:32:33.070" style="s2">something and then move towards it and</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.440" end="01:32:36.610" style="s2">and so to sin is to miss the mark is to</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.070" end="01:32:40.540" style="s2">is to miss the bullseye to to fail to</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.610" end="01:32:43.360" style="s2">take aim to aim badly gain carelessly or</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.540" end="01:32:47.409" style="s2">to not aim at all and that says well</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.360" end="01:32:49.510" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s like a sin of omission</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.409" end="01:32:51.670" style="s2">that&#39;s to not do and then to be wicked</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.510" end="01:32:53.440" style="s2">is to aim at what you know you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.670" end="01:32:55.179" style="s2">aim at and</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.440" end="01:32:57.850" style="s2">again I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think of that as</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.179" end="01:32:59.530" style="s2">an external morality precisely I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.850" end="01:33:01.510" style="s2">that you can read the entire biblical</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.530" end="01:33:04.179" style="s2">narrative again from a psychological</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.510" end="01:33:06.280" style="s2">perspective and say we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.179" end="01:33:09.040" style="s2">about external codes of conduct here</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.280" end="01:33:12.280" style="s2">although we could we&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.040" end="01:33:14.139" style="s2">wickedness that&#39;s being described is the</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.280" end="01:33:15.030" style="s2">act of you doing something that you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.139" end="01:33:18.010" style="s2">to be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.030" end="01:33:19.270" style="s2">period you know and you may do something</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.010" end="01:33:20.350" style="s2">you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s wrong or not that</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.270" end="01:33:21.790" style="s2">isn&#39;t a sort of thing that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.350" end="01:33:23.530" style="s2">about and we&#39;re not talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.790" end="01:33:25.840" style="s2">things that you do that are right there</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.530" end="01:33:27.520" style="s2">that other people think are wrong we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.840" end="01:33:28.870" style="s2">not talking about those either we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.520" end="01:33:30.760" style="s2">talking about those things that you</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.870" end="01:33:33.460" style="s2">consciously do although you know them to</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.760" end="01:33:35.050" style="s2">be wrong yourself and that&#39;s the things</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.460" end="01:33:37.030" style="s2">that seem to get people into the most</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.050" end="01:33:38.590" style="s2">trouble in these stories and I believe</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.030" end="01:33:40.960" style="s2">that to be the case I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.590" end="01:33:43.420" style="s2">accurate psychologically it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.960" end="01:33:45.100" style="s2">because I see this all the time if you</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.420" end="01:33:47.260" style="s2">do something wrong it&#39;s because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.100" end="01:33:50.080" style="s2">Stig nur n&#39;t you don&#39;t know better it</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.260" end="01:33:51.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go well for you that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.080" end="01:33:55.110" style="s2">but if you do something wrong and you</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.760" end="01:33:57.250" style="s2">know it&#39;s wrong the punishment is is</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.110" end="01:33:58.420" style="s2">manifold and I think the reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.250" end="01:34:01.420" style="s2">I think the reason for that is because</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.420" end="01:34:03.730" style="s2">that makes you Cain it means you betray</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.420" end="01:34:05.290" style="s2">your own ideal right if you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.730" end="01:34:07.540" style="s2">know well you haven&#39;t betrayed your</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.290" end="01:34:09.550" style="s2">ideal you&#39;re just not together maybe</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.540" end="01:34:10.929" style="s2">you&#39;re even willfully blind but if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.550" end="01:34:12.670" style="s2">do something you know to be wrong then</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.929" end="01:34:15.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve betrayed your own ideal and that</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.670" end="01:34:17.380" style="s2">lands you Cain says to God once Cain</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.190" end="01:34:24.070" style="s2">destroys Abel he says I cannot bear my</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.380" end="01:34:26.560" style="s2">punishment and the Lord said unto Abram</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.070" end="01:34:30.909" style="s2">after that lot was separated from lift</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.560" end="01:34:32.230" style="s2">up now thine eyes look upward and look</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.909" end="01:34:33.670" style="s2">from the place where thou art northward</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.230" end="01:34:36.130" style="s2">and southward and eastward and westward</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.670" end="01:34:37.989" style="s2">for all the land which thou seest to</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.130" end="01:34:40.690" style="s2">thee I will give it and to thy seed</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.989" end="01:34:42.159" style="s2">forever and I will make thy seed as the</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.690" end="01:34:44.230" style="s2">dust of the earth so that if a man can</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.159" end="01:34:47.679" style="s2">number the dust of the earth then shall</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.230" end="01:34:49.270" style="s2">all the I seed be numbered arise walk</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.679" end="01:34:50.530" style="s2">through the land in the length of it and</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.270" end="01:34:52.920" style="s2">the breadth of it for I will give it</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.530" end="01:34:52.920" style="s2">unto thee</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.100" end="01:35:02.930" style="s2">in the cathedral at shark I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.020" end="01:35:05.450" style="s2">that properly because my French is</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.930" end="01:35:08.660" style="s2">non-existent</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.450" end="01:35:11.220" style="s2">so a cathedral is across and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.660" end="01:35:13.410" style="s2">transformation takes place at the crux</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.220" end="01:35:15.750" style="s2">of the cross which is exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.410" end="01:35:17.640" style="s2">because the transformation takes place</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.750" end="01:35:19.830" style="s2">at the point of maximal suffering and</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.640" end="01:35:28.050" style="s2">the cathedral is designed to indicate</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.830" end="01:35:29.640" style="s2">that right symbolically now what happens</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.050" end="01:35:32.460" style="s2">in the religious ceremony is also a</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.640" end="01:35:34.710" style="s2">journey and it&#39;s a journey in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.460" end="01:35:36.150" style="s2">to the holy city and then that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.710" end="01:35:37.530" style="s2">played out in the idea of pilgrimage</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.150" end="01:35:39.660" style="s2">right because you go to the holy city</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.530" end="01:35:41.520" style="s2">actually you go to Jerusalem or wherever</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.660" end="01:35:43.500" style="s2">it is that you think the holy city is</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.520" end="01:35:45.240" style="s2">you go there and that takes you out of</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.500" end="01:35:47.430" style="s2">your country and away from your kin and</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.240" end="01:35:49.710" style="s2">away from your family into the strange</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.430" end="01:35:51.330" style="s2">land and as you make the journey you</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.710" end="01:35:53.520" style="s2">transform and when you come back you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.330" end="01:35:56.370" style="s2">not the same that&#39;s the Hobbit right</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.520" end="01:35:57.450" style="s2">that&#39;s the story of the Hobbit but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.370" end="01:36:00.210" style="s2">say you can&#39;t afford to go on a</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.450" end="01:36:01.740" style="s2">pilgrimage so you go to the cathedral at</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.210" end="01:36:05.280" style="s2">Chartres and there&#39;s a huge maze on the</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.740" end="01:36:07.380" style="s2">ground and it&#39;s the world north west</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.280" end="01:36:11.550" style="s2">south and east just as God describes</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.380" end="01:36:14.160" style="s2">here so it&#39;s laid out and you enter the</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.550" end="01:36:17.190" style="s2">maze at one side and in the middle is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.160" end="01:36:20.610" style="s2">stone pattern that looks like a flower</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.190" end="01:36:22.470" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s the place where being</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.610" end="01:36:25.740" style="s2">wells forth and it&#39;s at the center of</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.470" end="01:36:27.480" style="s2">the Cathedral and what that means is</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.740" end="01:36:29.670" style="s2">that if you accept your suffering then</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.480" end="01:36:31.470" style="s2">you move to the place where the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.670" end="01:36:36.240" style="s2">of being wells forth that&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.470" end="01:36:39.320" style="s2">means and so you enter the maze and you</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.240" end="01:36:42.150" style="s2">walk and it&#39;s divided into quadrants and</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.320" end="01:36:43.860" style="s2">you walk one quadrant completely and</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.150" end="01:36:45.390" style="s2">then the mains pathway takes you into</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.860" end="01:36:46.980" style="s2">the next quadrant and you walk that</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.390" end="01:36:48.600" style="s2">completely and then it takes you to the</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.980" end="01:36:50.730" style="s2">third one and the fourth one and then</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.600" end="01:36:52.980" style="s2">when you walk the maze completely</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.730" end="01:36:54.870" style="s2">everywhere when you&#39;ve gone everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.980" end="01:36:57.240" style="s2">in the world north south east and west</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.870" end="01:37:00.330" style="s2">where you when you traverse the</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.240" end="01:37:02.160" style="s2">territory completely then you come to</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.330" end="01:37:05.280" style="s2">the center and then it&#39;s yours and</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.160" end="01:37:07.260" style="s2">that&#39;s what this is so I&#39;ve noticed when</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.280" end="01:37:09.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve been renovating houses I like to do</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.260" end="01:37:11.969" style="s2">that I paid a lot of attention to</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.960" end="01:37:14.969" style="s2">the psychological process of a house</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.969" end="01:37:18.840" style="s2">renovation because I learned from young</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.969" end="01:37:21.210" style="s2">that young said this this is something</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.840" end="01:37:23.010" style="s2">man he said if he was he was talking</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.210" end="01:37:25.020" style="s2">about the stages of integration</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.010" end="01:37:28.080" style="s2">psychological integration and he looked</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.020" end="01:37:31.320" style="s2">beyond Piaget I would say although</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.080" end="01:37:33.960" style="s2">Piaget looked very far he said here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.320" end="01:37:36.060" style="s2">conjunction you have to get your</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.960" end="01:37:37.770" style="s2">rationality on your emotion together</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.060" end="01:37:40.469" style="s2">that&#39;s a male/female conjunction</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.770" end="01:37:41.969" style="s2">symbolically speaking male rationality</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.469" end="01:37:43.770" style="s2">female emotionality you want to bring</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.969" end="01:37:45.810" style="s2">those together so that they&#39;re oriented</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.770" end="01:37:47.150" style="s2">in the same direction your emotions in</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.810" end="01:37:49.530" style="s2">your rationality served the same purpose</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.150" end="01:37:51.560" style="s2">so then you&#39;re unified in mind and</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.530" end="01:37:53.580" style="s2">spirit let&#39;s say that&#39;s are good enough</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.560" end="01:37:55.679" style="s2">once you&#39;ve got that together then</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.580" end="01:37:57.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a boat you have a body and then</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.679" end="01:38:00.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a male/female conjunction again a</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.750" end="01:38:03.390" style="s2">divine conjunction the recreation of</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.540" end="01:38:05.850" style="s2">Adam before his division into female and</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.390" end="01:38:07.980" style="s2">male and the reconstruction of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.850" end="01:38:10.650" style="s2">androgynous Christ that all that all</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.980" end="01:38:12.330" style="s2">those ideas are linked together so now</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.650" end="01:38:13.830" style="s2">you have your emotion and your</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.330" end="01:38:17.640" style="s2">rationality moving in the same direction</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.830" end="01:38:20.310" style="s2">but you&#39;re not acting it out so now you</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.640" end="01:38:22.949" style="s2">have to unite that abstract part of you</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.310" end="01:38:25.739" style="s2">with your body and start acting out what</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.949" end="01:38:27.360" style="s2">you think and feel and that&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.739" end="01:38:30.179" style="s2">conjunction but it&#39;s not the last one</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.360" end="01:38:32.159" style="s2">the last conjunction is when you realize</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.179" end="01:38:35.100" style="s2">that there is no distinction between you</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.159" end="01:38:37.020" style="s2">and your experience they&#39;re the same</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.100" end="01:38:38.460" style="s2">thing and so then when you put together</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.020" end="01:38:43.020" style="s2">your house you&#39;re putting together</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.460" end="01:38:45.449" style="s2">yourself so I&#39;ve noticed in when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.020" end="01:38:47.640" style="s2">lived in places rented or owned didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.449" end="01:38:49.260" style="s2">matter and if there were part of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.640" end="01:38:52.140" style="s2">place if there was a part of the place</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.260" end="01:38:54.390" style="s2">that I hadn&#39;t attended to whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.140" end="01:38:55.890" style="s2">might mean it might meant cleaned it</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.390" end="01:38:58.290" style="s2">might have meant fix but it certainly</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.890" end="01:39:01.350" style="s2">meant at least thoroughly investigated</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.290" end="01:39:03.179" style="s2">then that was chaos it was like it was</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.350" end="01:39:04.469" style="s2">it was like the desert that part that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.179" end="01:39:06.090" style="s2">that&#39;s a way of thinking about it it</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.469" end="01:39:06.510" style="s2">wasn&#39;t mine even if I owned it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.090" end="01:39:08.190" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.510" end="01:39:10.500" style="s2">I had to interact with it before it</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.190" end="01:39:12.060" style="s2">became mine and I had to interact with</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.500" end="01:39:15.120" style="s2">it and I had to put it in order and then</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.060" end="01:39:16.710" style="s2">it became mine and then and then to the</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.120" end="01:39:19.620" style="s2">degree that it became mine and was in</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.710" end="01:39:21.239" style="s2">order then I was also put in order now</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.620" end="01:39:23.310" style="s2">you know that because you go into places</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.239" end="01:39:24.660" style="s2">that make you uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.310" end="01:39:27.510" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s your own house it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.660" end="01:39:29.610" style="s2">highly probable it&#39;s highly probable I</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.510" end="01:39:31.020" style="s2">you know I walk into well Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.610" end="01:39:32.670" style="s2">doctors do this traditional Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.020" end="01:39:34.560" style="s2">doctors they go into place people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.670" end="01:39:36.930" style="s2">place and they they diagnose their</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.560" end="01:39:40.020" style="s2">health conditions on the on the balance</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.930" end="01:39:41.490" style="s2">of yin and yang chaos an order they</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.020" end="01:39:43.260" style="s2">walked into a house that this is easy to</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.490" end="01:39:45.510" style="s2">do you walk into a house there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.260" end="01:39:46.290" style="s2">much chaos hey you can detect that in no</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.510" end="01:39:48.990" style="s2">time flat</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.290" end="01:39:50.400" style="s2">everything is out of order and chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.990" end="01:39:51.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t even want to be there you</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.400" end="01:39:53.880" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t want to open the</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.480" end="01:39:55.110" style="s2">refrigerator that&#39;s for sure and there</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.880" end="01:39:57.330" style="s2">are things that should have been done</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.110" end="01:39:58.920" style="s2">years ago everywhere and every one of</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.330" end="01:40:00.540" style="s2">those things is a fight that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.920" end="01:40:02.550" style="s2">happened and something that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.540" end="01:40:04.020" style="s2">avoided and you can&#39;t even walk in there</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.550" end="01:40:05.610" style="s2">and maintain your health this is you</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.020" end="01:40:07.500" style="s2">walk in there you&#39;re sicker than you</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.610" end="01:40:09.180" style="s2">were when you were outside and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.500" end="01:40:12.060" style="s2">one sort of place and then another sort</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.180" end="01:40:15.420" style="s2">of place is you go and look at the</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.060" end="01:40:19.260" style="s2">living room and the person has vacuumed</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.420" end="01:40:21.540" style="s2">the living room rug and the lines that</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.260" end="01:40:22.080" style="s2">were vacuumed are parallel to one</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.540" end="01:40:24.420" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.080" end="01:40:26.610" style="s2">and the and the furniture is covered</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.420" end="01:40:28.020" style="s2">with plastic and you get a glass of</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.610" end="01:40:29.700" style="s2">water and then just as you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.020" end="01:40:31.350" style="s2">set it down on the coffee table the</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.700" end="01:40:33.210" style="s2">person rushes over and puts a coaster</p>

<p begin="01:40:33.210" end="01:40:37.560" style="s2">house says to you that it would be a lot</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.610" end="01:40:39.990" style="s2">more perfect in that house if you were</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.560" end="01:40:41.970" style="s2">either not there or dead and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.990" end="01:40:44.310" style="s2">there and that&#39;s the message that the</p>

<p begin="01:54:06.400" end="01:54:13.900" style="s2">more than just a sense but Abraham does</p>

<p begin="01:54:26.010" end="01:54:32.200" style="s2">well maybe it&#39;s no surprise that people</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.239" end="01:54:33.610" style="s2">don&#39;t do that and he believed in the</p>

<p begin="01:54:33.610" end="01:54:38.350" style="s2">righteousness and he said unto him I am</p>

<p begin="01:55:15.430" end="01:55:20.380" style="s2">Abram and lo a horror of great darkness</p>

<p begin="01:55:22.210" end="01:55:25.930" style="s2">thought it meant when I first read it it</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.010" end="01:55:27.730" style="s2">isn&#39;t what it means it means that he</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.930" end="01:55:28.030" style="s2">fell into a trance or something like</p>

<p begin="01:55:28.030" end="01:55:33.850" style="s2">and then he was enveloped by absolute</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.840" end="01:55:37.239" style="s2">horror so that&#39;s how this story begins</p>

<p begin="01:56:14.199" end="01:56:23.829" style="s2">you wonder what Abraham was up to in his</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.940" end="01:56:25.780" style="s2">campsite so he was participating in</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.829" end="01:56:29.290" style="s2">something that enabled this experience</p>

<p begin="01:57:39.849" end="01:57:44.469" style="s2">is that Abraham&#39;s descendants will end</p>

<p begin="01:57:48.040" end="01:57:51.520" style="s2">interesting to because this is part of</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.630" end="01:57:53.530" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s bargain with God and in this</p>

<p begin="01:57:53.530" end="01:57:58.900" style="s2">everything but it&#39;s a pretty tough</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.929" end="01:58:00.849" style="s2">bargain because you know when God is</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.900" end="01:58:02.110" style="s2">pushed or reveals himself let&#39;s say he</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.849" end="01:58:04.599" style="s2">says look you&#39;re going to get your</p>

<p begin="01:58:16.510" end="01:58:21.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s a realistic promise in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.780" end="01:58:23.050" style="s2">and you might say well Abram is so</p>

<p begin="01:59:45.610" end="01:59:51.940" style="s2">and she had a handmaid wait a second I</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.880" end="01:59:55.119" style="s2">think we&#39;ll stop there I&#39;m tiring out</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.940" end="01:59:59.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s just at its 929 so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.119" end="02:00:02.770" style="s2">very good place to stop so yes</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.330" end="02:00:09.020" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.770" end="02:00:11.630" style="s2">so so I should I should close properly</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.020" end="02:00:15.500" style="s2">and just sum up so what happens here is</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.630" end="02:00:18.500" style="s2">that that Abram enters into a covenant</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.500" end="02:00:21.170" style="s2">with God to act in the world and the</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.500" end="02:00:24.800" style="s2">action is an adventure story essentially</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.170" end="02:00:28.810" style="s2">and the adventures repeat and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.800" end="02:00:31.490" style="s2">and they&#39;re punctuated by success and</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.810" end="02:00:33.710" style="s2">sacrifice and re contemplation right and</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.490" end="02:00:36.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s this it&#39;s this journey it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.710" end="02:00:39.430" style="s2">it&#39;s the hero&#39;s journey uphill I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.440" end="02:00:41.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a crisis I collapse i</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.430" end="02:00:43.550" style="s2">reconstruct myself to a higher place and</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.990" end="02:00:45.320" style="s2">life is like that continually and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.550" end="02:00:47.030" style="s2">the story of Abram and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.320" end="02:00:48.590" style="s2">contained though it&#39;s all contained and</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.030" end="02:00:49.940" style="s2">this is the thing that&#39;s so cool because</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.590" end="02:00:51.860" style="s2">that is what your life is going to be</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.940" end="02:00:53.780" style="s2">like whether you plan out your life or</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.860" end="02:00:56.210" style="s2">not it&#39;s going to be punctuated like</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.780" end="02:00:57.590" style="s2">that maybe it won&#39;t go up maybe it&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.210" end="02:00:59.840" style="s2">down the question is what sort of</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.590" end="02:01:02.480" style="s2">container of you need to be in in order</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.840" end="02:01:04.250" style="s2">to tolerate movement up and down and</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.480" end="02:01:06.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what the story of Abraham</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.250" end="02:01:08.300" style="s2">provides it provides a it provides a</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.320" end="02:01:09.950" style="s2">description of the Covenant that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.300" end="02:01:12.260" style="s2">the Ark the Covenant in the Ark are the</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.950" end="02:01:14.900" style="s2">same thing right except the Covenant is</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.260" end="02:01:19.820" style="s2">the psychological equivalent of the ark</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.900" end="02:01:22.180" style="s2">and the Covenant is have faith in the</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.820" end="02:01:25.400" style="s2">structure of existence and go forth</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.180" end="02:01:29.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the Covenant and that and the</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.400" end="02:01:33.470" style="s2">story is that&#39;s the best possible</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.060" end="02:01:36.770" style="s2">solution that you have at hand all right</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.470" end="02:01:38.960" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to make a request with</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.770" end="02:01:40.820" style="s2">regards to the questions which may mean</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.960" end="02:01:43.340" style="s2">you have to reorient yourself in the</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.820" end="02:01:47.270" style="s2">line I would like the first two</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.340" end="02:01:49.250" style="s2">questions on each side if possible to</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.270" end="02:01:54.980" style="s2">relate specifically to tonight&#39;s lecture</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.250" end="02:01:57.230" style="s2">and then I can and then I can address</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.980" end="02:01:58.180" style="s2">more general issues if that&#39;s if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.230" end="02:02:01.300" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.180" end="02:02:04.220" style="s2">so and I again I would like you to</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.300" end="02:02:06.620" style="s2">carefully speak into the mic so that the</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.220" end="02:02:10.970" style="s2">people who are watching can hear can you</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.620" end="02:02:12.769" style="s2">hear me yeah I can I the story about</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.970" end="02:02:14.989" style="s2">Abraham</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.769" end="02:02:16.969" style="s2">as saying his wife was his sister you</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.989" end="02:02:19.010" style="s2">referred to that as him making a mistake</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.969" end="02:02:21.409" style="s2">I&#39;m not quite sure I understand how</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.010" end="02:02:23.569" style="s2">you&#39;re reading that as a mistake seeing</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.409" end="02:02:25.879" style="s2">as it was a very deliberate decision and</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.569" end="02:02:28.010" style="s2">it had a pretty good outcome for him and</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.879" end="02:02:30.769" style="s2">he does the same thing a few chapters</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.010" end="02:02:33.619" style="s2">later yes this is true</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.769" end="02:02:35.149" style="s2">you see I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.619" end="02:02:37.369" style="s2">that I have cracked that part of that</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.149" end="02:02:39.169" style="s2">story properly now the reason I said it</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.369" end="02:02:42.079" style="s2">was a mistake is because it&#39;s clearly an</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.169" end="02:02:43.879" style="s2">act of deceit and in it and it does put</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.079" end="02:02:46.249" style="s2">the Pharaoh in a very awkward position</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.879" end="02:02:47.929" style="s2">not to mention sir I by the way are sir</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.249" end="02:02:52.279" style="s2">how do you say that I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.929" end="02:02:55.099" style="s2">say that sir i sir i it&#39;s awry to begin</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.279" end="02:02:57.409" style="s2">with yes is that right sir I yes okay</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.099" end="02:03:00.199" style="s2">and then it&#39;s Sarah and that so Abram</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.409" end="02:03:02.149" style="s2">means High King something like that and</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.199" end="02:03:04.389" style="s2">Abraham means father of the people and</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.149" end="02:03:06.679" style="s2">Sarai means princess and Sarah means</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.389" end="02:03:08.389" style="s2">mother of the people it&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.679" end="02:03:09.589" style="s2">have it exactly right I&#39;ll tell you next</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.389" end="02:03:12.559" style="s2">week but that&#39;s part of the name</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.589" end="02:03:15.289" style="s2">transformation the the it seems to me</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.559" end="02:03:20.289" style="s2">that at least in part it&#39;s an indication</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.289" end="02:03:23.510" style="s2">of Abraham&#39;s willingness to use a</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.289" end="02:03:25.489" style="s2">suboptimal solution when driven to it by</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.510" end="02:03:27.619" style="s2">necessity I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a heroic</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.489" end="02:03:30.829" style="s2">act to pretend that your wife is your</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.619" end="02:03:32.299" style="s2">sister now you know and and and maybe</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.829" end="02:03:33.769" style="s2">you might say well under the</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.299" end="02:03:36.469" style="s2">circumstances there was nothing else he</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.769" end="02:03:38.239" style="s2">could have done but it does seem it I</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.469" end="02:03:41.049" style="s2">can&#39;t see how you can interpret it other</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.239" end="02:03:43.429" style="s2">than as a departure from the truth</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.049" end="02:03:45.260" style="s2">but I know that that&#39;s not all there is</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.429" end="02:03:47.869" style="s2">to it and it does seem to work out well</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.260" end="02:03:50.449" style="s2">for him and my interpretation is that</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.869" end="02:03:54.019" style="s2">well if you&#39;re oriented properly in the</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.449" end="02:03:56.119" style="s2">world the grace of God allows you a few</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.019" end="02:04:00.069" style="s2">necessary mistake something like that</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.119" end="02:04:00.069" style="s2">you have an alternative idea</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.670" end="02:04:08.349" style="s2">well why not what what is it about that</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.139" end="02:04:10.150" style="s2">that because it&#39;s Abraham and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.349" end="02:04:12.340" style="s2">reasonable to attribute mistakes to him</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.150" end="02:04:15.880" style="s2">or what is it because at least I think</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.340" end="02:04:19.360" style="s2">it says in the text that he&#39;s looking to</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.880" end="02:04:21.699" style="s2">get out of a bad situation and he does</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.360" end="02:04:24.429" style="s2">whatever is the best thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.699" end="02:04:26.500" style="s2">available to him and not to mention as I</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.429" end="02:04:29.560" style="s2">said he does the same trick a few</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.500" end="02:04:32.199" style="s2">chapters later yeah well maybe maybe it</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.560" end="02:04:34.900" style="s2">is the case that you know it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.199" end="02:04:37.750" style="s2">white lie issue you know you say well</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.900" end="02:04:39.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a white lie acceptable I would say</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.750" end="02:04:41.380" style="s2">well the best that you can come up with</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.190" end="02:04:45.329" style="s2">is acceptable that that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.380" end="02:04:48.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s optimal though right like I</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.329" end="02:04:49.780" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you a foolish example because</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.520" end="02:04:51.849" style="s2">it&#39;s the best that I could do at the</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.780" end="02:04:54.130" style="s2">moment but you know if you if you have a</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.849" end="02:04:58.480" style="s2">loved one who says does this dress make</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.130" end="02:05:00.670" style="s2">me look fat the answer to that question</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.480" end="02:05:02.380" style="s2">is I don&#39;t answer questions like that</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.670" end="02:05:03.820" style="s2">that&#39;s the answer right</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.380" end="02:05:06.610" style="s2">because the other answer is the white</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.820" end="02:05:09.010" style="s2">lie I mean at least in this context and</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.610" end="02:05:12.520" style="s2">that means that on the one hand you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.010" end="02:05:14.800" style="s2">maintaining the positive contract</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.520" end="02:05:16.389" style="s2">between you and the person who&#39;s asking</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.800" end="02:05:18.940" style="s2">the question but then you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.389" end="02:05:21.460" style="s2">sacrificing the truth within that so</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.940" end="02:05:23.320" style="s2">your your you&#39;re maintaining your</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.460" end="02:05:25.719" style="s2">relationship with the higher order truth</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.320" end="02:05:27.520" style="s2">but sacrificing a lower order truth and</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.719" end="02:05:30.130" style="s2">that would be better than the reverse</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.520" end="02:05:32.380" style="s2">but it&#39;s not as good as not sacrificing</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.130" end="02:05:35.260" style="s2">the truth at all and I would say that if</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.380" end="02:05:36.699" style="s2">you&#39;re maybe fortunate because sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.260" end="02:05:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter because you can be in a</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.699" end="02:05:41.290" style="s2">situation where all your choices are bad</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.800" end="02:05:42.699" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen people in situations like that</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.290" end="02:05:44.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve probably been in situations like</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.699" end="02:05:46.300" style="s2">that and maybe that is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.260" end="02:05:48.159" style="s2">in that stories every choice Abraham is</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.300" end="02:05:50.260" style="s2">in front of him is bad but I can&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.159" end="02:05:53.679" style="s2">but think that it&#39;s more than that it</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.260" end="02:05:56.829" style="s2">means that if you&#39;re doing the best you</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.679" end="02:06:00.449" style="s2">can and it&#39;s not perfect it can still be</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.829" end="02:06:03.599" style="s2">good enough that&#39;s how it looks to me</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.449" end="02:06:03.599" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.329" end="02:06:10.709" style="s2">hello dr. Peterson you mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.820" end="02:06:14.010" style="s2">there&#39;s been a pervasive problem of</p>

<p begin="02:06:27.869" end="02:06:31.889" style="s2">which is nowadays a hotbed for this kind</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.539" end="02:06:35.869" style="s2">of nihilistic morally relativist</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.889" end="02:06:38.820" style="s2">thinking great I&#39;m glad you asked that</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.869" end="02:06:40.769" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to tell you I was thinking</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.820" end="02:06:42.479" style="s2">about saying this at the beginning but I</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.769" end="02:06:44.309" style="s2">decided not to but now I get to say it</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.479" end="02:06:51.119" style="s2">because I got this question so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.309" end="02:06:55.409" style="s2">cool um I I have plans and so his plan</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.119" end="02:06:57.090" style="s2">number one I have worked with some</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.409" end="02:06:59.519" style="s2">people to design a website that will</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.090" end="02:07:02.189" style="s2">enable high university students to enter</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.519" end="02:07:04.530" style="s2">their course descriptions their</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.189" end="02:07:06.300" style="s2">professors name the sub discipline and</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.530" end="02:07:09.179" style="s2">the university and an artificial</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.300" end="02:07:11.429" style="s2">intelligence agent will tell them if the</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.179" end="02:07:19.110" style="s2">course is postmodern neo-marxist</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.429" end="02:07:22.979" style="s2">indoctrination not not only and I have</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.110" end="02:07:26.760" style="s2">made tentative arrangements with someone</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.979" end="02:07:30.840" style="s2">to finance a advertising campaign for</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.760" end="02:07:33.689" style="s2">that site and so the goal is well to</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.840" end="02:07:34.829" style="s2">inform the consumer do you want to be</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.689" end="02:07:37.079" style="s2">educated or do you want to be</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.829" end="02:07:38.729" style="s2">indoctrinated and happily you&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.079" end="02:07:41.519" style="s2">to use the site equally for both</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.729" end="02:07:46.050" style="s2">purposes right because if you want to if</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.519" end="02:07:47.699" style="s2">you want to take the the the courses</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.050" end="02:07:49.709" style="s2">that I would regard as into oxidation</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.699" end="02:07:51.449" style="s2">then this will give you a way of</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.709" end="02:07:54.840" style="s2">ensuring that nothing that you get</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.449" end="02:07:57.030" style="s2">exposed to won&#39;t be of that sort so and</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.840" end="02:08:00.479" style="s2">then I&#39;m going to make a video to</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.030" end="02:08:02.400" style="s2">introduce that to university students</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.479" end="02:08:03.959" style="s2">and their parents and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.400" end="02:08:06.269" style="s2">outline what I think the universities</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.959" end="02:08:08.249" style="s2">are doing wrong is about 20 things</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.269" end="02:08:11.699" style="s2">they&#39;re doing wrong and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.249" end="02:08:14.610" style="s2">seriously wrong things and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.699" end="02:08:16.110" style="s2">start by describing the utility of a</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.610" end="02:08:17.309" style="s2">university education in humanities</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.110" end="02:08:18.210" style="s2">education because the humanities</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.309" end="02:08:20.070" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.210" end="02:08:22.920" style="s2">makes you into the kind of autonomous</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.070" end="02:08:25.170" style="s2">individual that can go away from that</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.920" end="02:08:27.840" style="s2">can be independent and can communicate</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.170" end="02:08:30.989" style="s2">and think and that has immense economic</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.840" end="02:08:33.600" style="s2">value not not just spiritual value and</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.989" end="02:08:35.820" style="s2">cultural value but economic value and so</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.600" end="02:08:37.140" style="s2">there&#39;s I don&#39;t want to tell people not</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.820" end="02:08:38.550" style="s2">to go to university I want to tell them</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.140" end="02:08:40.770" style="s2">to go to university and grow the hell up</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.550" end="02:08:42.390" style="s2">and and learn to communicate and think</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.770" end="02:08:44.100" style="s2">and I want them to avoid the people who</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.390" end="02:08:46.560" style="s2">will take the spirit away from them and</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.100" end="02:08:49.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s what that website is going to</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.560" end="02:08:51.870" style="s2">do I hope and the goal is to drop the</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.920" end="02:08:55.050" style="s2">enrollment in the indoctrination courses</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.870" end="02:09:03.540" style="s2">across the english-speaking world by 75%</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.050" end="02:09:05.160" style="s2">within five years that&#39;s the goal so and</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.540" end="02:09:07.530" style="s2">then you ask that you ask more</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.160" end="02:09:10.890" style="s2">specifically about high school students</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.530" end="02:09:12.330" style="s2">well we have this future authoring</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.890" end="02:09:14.250" style="s2">program that has been used for</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.330" end="02:09:17.370" style="s2">university students and it produces</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.250" end="02:09:19.680" style="s2">about a 30% improvement in retention and</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.370" end="02:09:21.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve tested several thousand University</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.680" end="02:09:23.340" style="s2">students anyone can use it by the way</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.120" end="02:09:25.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not for university students but it</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.340" end="02:09:27.390" style="s2">was easy for us to test it&#39;s beneficial</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.110" end="02:09:29.730" style="s2">impact even if people only spend under</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.390" end="02:09:32.610" style="s2">90 minutes on it it still has</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.730" end="02:09:36.210" style="s2">approximately that effect especially on</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.610" end="02:09:39.090" style="s2">young men especially if they&#39;re ethnic</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.210" end="02:09:41.340" style="s2">minorities especially if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.090" end="02:09:43.200" style="s2">oriented towards a career and didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.340" end="02:09:45.090" style="s2">very well in school and so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.200" end="02:09:47.640" style="s2">cool because it&#39;s really hard to design</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.090" end="02:09:49.590" style="s2">a psychological intervention that helps</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.640" end="02:09:51.390" style="s2">the people who are doing the worst most</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.590" end="02:09:52.500" style="s2">psychological interventions so imagine</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.390" end="02:09:53.820" style="s2">there are people who are doing not so</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.500" end="02:09:55.950" style="s2">well and people who are doing well and</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.820" end="02:09:57.870" style="s2">you produce a psychological intervention</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.950" end="02:10:00.719" style="s2">what usually happens is the people who</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.870" end="02:10:02.400" style="s2">are doing well benefit even more right</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.719" end="02:10:04.860" style="s2">but this seems to work for the</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.400" end="02:10:05.280" style="s2">disenfranchised so we&#39;re thrilled about</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.860" end="02:10:08.070" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.280" end="02:10:11.219" style="s2">really and so we produced a version for</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.070" end="02:10:12.870" style="s2">high school students yes and so but we</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.219" end="02:10:14.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have them look three to five years</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.870" end="02:10:17.310" style="s2">out into the future because they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.520" end="02:10:20.580" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know enough you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.310" end="02:10:22.739" style="s2">hard for fully mature adults to look</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.580" end="02:10:24.480" style="s2">that far into the future high school</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.739" end="02:10:26.160" style="s2">kids can probably manage three to six</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.480" end="02:10:28.050" style="s2">months and so we&#39;re going to have them</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.160" end="02:10:30.960" style="s2">concentrate on character development and</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.050" end="02:10:32.099" style="s2">and what they want for their from their</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.960" end="02:10:33.570" style="s2">friendships and</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.099" end="02:10:35.159" style="s2">how they would like to orient themselves</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.570" end="02:10:37.079" style="s2">in school and to start thinking about</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.159" end="02:10:39.239" style="s2">the sorts of person that they would like</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.079" end="02:10:41.489" style="s2">to be and that never happens in schools</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.239" end="02:10:44.189" style="s2">weirdly enough there&#39;s a guy named John</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.489" end="02:10:46.260" style="s2">Gatto who won the Teacher of the Year</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.189" end="02:10:47.939" style="s2">award in New York City and then in New</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.260" end="02:10:50.609" style="s2">York State and then stopped being a</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.939" end="02:10:52.409" style="s2">teacher by the way he wrote a series of</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.609" end="02:10:56.519" style="s2">books about the education system that</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.409" end="02:10:59.639" style="s2">explained why students in pre-university</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.519" end="02:11:02.249" style="s2">education aren&#39;t taught to be autonomous</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.639" end="02:11:05.189" style="s2">individuals it&#39;s very interesting what</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.249" end="02:11:08.159" style="s2">he&#39;s discovered historically but anyways</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.189" end="02:11:09.629" style="s2">we&#39;re going to market that probably to</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.159" end="02:11:11.189" style="s2">parents and to university students</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.629" end="02:11:13.699" style="s2">themselves rather than to the schools</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.189" end="02:11:15.899" style="s2">because our experience has been that</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.699" end="02:11:17.849" style="s2">producing this sort of material directly</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.899" end="02:11:19.979" style="s2">for individuals works much better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.849" end="02:11:22.679" style="s2">much more efficient and so then students</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.979" end="02:11:24.030" style="s2">will be able to or their parents will be</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.679" end="02:11:25.829" style="s2">able to purchase the program and the</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.030" end="02:11:29.729" style="s2">students will be able to use it to</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.829" end="02:11:32.579" style="s2">design their own personality in a manner</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.729" end="02:11:34.979" style="s2">that would make them thrilled to be</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.579" end="02:11:39.140" style="s2">alive let&#39;s say that would be the goal</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.979" end="02:11:45.720" style="s2">right yes</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.140" end="02:11:45.720" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.390" end="02:11:56.200" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get you to turn it to put it</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.460" end="02:12:10.770" style="s2">down a little more heed excellent</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.200" end="02:12:12.400" style="s2">perfect yes yes yeah and I think I</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.770" end="02:12:13.870" style="s2">specially the literature in</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.400" end="02:12:15.910" style="s2">developmental psychology I think bears</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.870" end="02:12:17.620" style="s2">this out but I think a huge part of</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.910" end="02:12:20.800" style="s2">learning is interaction and discourse</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.620" end="02:12:23.050" style="s2">and that seems very difficult in an</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.800" end="02:12:24.760" style="s2">online setting even if it&#39;s through text</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.050" end="02:12:26.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t quite see it it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.760" end="02:12:28.180" style="s2">same thing and additionally I think</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.440" end="02:12:32.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge motivational factor</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.180" end="02:12:33.910" style="s2">that&#39;s difficult to arm it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.350" end="02:12:36.190" style="s2">to keep motivated when you&#39;re isolated</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.910" end="02:12:38.230" style="s2">and nobody else around you is pursuing</p>
<p begin="02:12:36.190" end="02:12:40.660" style="s2">the same goal so how would you dress</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.230" end="02:12:44.320" style="s2">though you&#39;re absolutely right on both</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.660" end="02:12:46.300" style="s2">counts um I would say that the idea of</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.320" end="02:12:49.360" style="s2">an online humanities university is</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.300" end="02:12:51.970" style="s2">grandiose and it may not be possible and</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.360" end="02:12:54.100" style="s2">the reason for that is that and as</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.970" end="02:12:57.160" style="s2">you&#39;re alluding to we actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.100" end="02:12:59.980" style="s2">understand what the university is we</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.160" end="02:13:04.450" style="s2">think it&#39;s lectures and exams but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.980" end="02:13:06.520" style="s2">probably not it&#39;s certainly being</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.450" end="02:13:09.310" style="s2">together with people of your own age as</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.520" end="02:13:12.490" style="s2">you start your life it&#39;s moving away</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.310" end="02:13:14.770" style="s2">from your household it&#39;s establishing</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.490" end="02:13:18.180" style="s2">yourself as a credible intellect right</p>

<p begin="02:14:06.160" end="02:14:11.380" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a discussion that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.200" end="02:14:14.680" style="s2">take a year or two years to to flesh out</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.380" end="02:14:17.110" style="s2">we started to conceptualize what the</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.680" end="02:14:17.710" style="s2">system might look like but but to your</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.110" end="02:14:21.610" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.710" end="02:14:23.380" style="s2">it isn&#39;t we&#39;re not taking lectures and</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.610" end="02:14:25.480" style="s2">putting them online although obviously</p>

<p begin="02:14:25.480" end="02:14:29.320" style="s2">going to make an online humanities</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.130" end="02:14:31.030" style="s2">University and we know that I think</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.320" end="02:14:34.210" style="s2">everything you said is exactly is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.030" end="02:14:35.860" style="s2">very accurate and also indicative of the</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.210" end="02:14:38.890" style="s2">high probability that something like</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.860" end="02:14:40.510" style="s2">this would sail so but well you know</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.890" end="02:14:43.510" style="s2">where we&#39;re going to try to be aware of</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.510" end="02:14:45.130" style="s2">the pitfalls we&#39;re also going to I read</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.510" end="02:14:47.110" style="s2">this great book I would recommend this</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.130" end="02:14:48.940" style="s2">book it&#39;s a very funny book by a guy</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.110" end="02:14:51.090" style="s2">named John gall it&#39;s called system</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.940" end="02:14:53.800" style="s2">antics and it&#39;s a cult classic</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.090" end="02:14:56.050" style="s2">systematics and it&#39;s about how systems</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.800" end="02:14:57.880" style="s2">really work and how they fail and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.050" end="02:15:00.550" style="s2">work of ironic comedy but it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.880" end="02:15:02.140" style="s2">brilliant and one of the things when one</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.550" end="02:15:04.120" style="s2">line he needs it&#39;s made of a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.140" end="02:15:06.850" style="s2">axioms and here&#39;s one axiom I just love</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.120" end="02:15:09.940" style="s2">this is the system does not do what its</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.850" end="02:15:11.890" style="s2">name says it does and so one guy worked</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.940" end="02:15:13.810" style="s2">in Alberta Social Services when I was a</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.890" end="02:15:18.100" style="s2">kid about eighteen or so and I worked as</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.810" end="02:15:19.630" style="s2">a consultant and I one of the and I got</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.100" end="02:15:21.580" style="s2">involved in projects that were above my</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.630" end="02:15:24.460" style="s2">pay grade I would say and I learned a</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.580" end="02:15:26.500" style="s2">lot about how how large bureaucracies</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.460" end="02:15:29.350" style="s2">functioned and I was asked at one point</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.500" end="02:15:31.420" style="s2">to update a report that had been made</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.350" end="02:15:33.370" style="s2">the year before about what percentage of</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.420" end="02:15:35.020" style="s2">the spending of the Social Services</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.370" end="02:15:38.230" style="s2">Department actually went to the</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.020" end="02:15:41.410" style="s2">recipients of welfare and and social aid</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.230" end="02:15:44.320" style="s2">in general and the answer was the system</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.410" end="02:15:46.510" style="s2">did not know and could not find out and</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.320" end="02:15:49.210" style="s2">they had hired a very expensive</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.510" end="02:15:50.920" style="s2">consulting firm to answer that question</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.210" end="02:15:52.720" style="s2">the year before and I was asked to</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.920" end="02:15:54.730" style="s2">update it which was quite odd to begin</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.720" end="02:15:56.260" style="s2">with but then I did I went and looked at</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.730" end="02:15:59.530" style="s2">the consulting report and I went into</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.260" end="02:16:01.930" style="s2">the data and what I found was that none</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.530" end="02:16:03.280" style="s2">of it was real but even more importantly</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.930" end="02:16:04.960" style="s2">there was no way of knowing whether it</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.280" end="02:16:07.510" style="s2">was true or false because the system had</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.960" end="02:16:09.250" style="s2">never been set up to calculate what</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.510" end="02:16:11.350" style="s2">percentage of its total spending</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.250" end="02:16:13.390" style="s2">actually went to the recipients of</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.350" end="02:16:14.740" style="s2">social aid it just blew me away and then</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.390" end="02:16:17.530" style="s2">I thought and I was reading this book at</p>
<p begin="02:16:14.740" end="02:16:19.120" style="s2">the same time and I thought oh the</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.530" end="02:16:21.220" style="s2">purpose of the social services</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.120" end="02:16:23.440" style="s2">department is to employ people in the</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.220" end="02:16:25.540" style="s2">social services department and I mean I</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.440" end="02:16:27.400" style="s2">wasn&#39;t being cynical about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:25.540" end="02:16:30.100" style="s2">like charity most charities you know</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.400" end="02:16:33.969" style="s2">it&#39;s like 90% overhead so what is the</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.100" end="02:16:35.200" style="s2">charity do it runs itself now you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:16:33.969" end="02:16:37.480" style="s2">want to be cynical about that because</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.200" end="02:16:38.800" style="s2">big businesses are the same most like</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.480" end="02:16:40.960" style="s2">even if they&#39;re running at a profit the</p>
<p begin="02:16:38.800" end="02:16:43.150" style="s2">profit is like five percent so the</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.960" end="02:16:45.340" style="s2">business spends 95% of its time</p>
<p begin="02:16:43.150" end="02:16:46.810" style="s2">maintaining itself you know and it makes</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.340" end="02:16:48.310" style="s2">a bit of product and it makes a bit of</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.810" end="02:16:51.370" style="s2">profit but most of what it does is</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.310" end="02:16:54.010" style="s2">maintain itself so anyways</p>
<p begin="02:16:51.370" end="02:16:55.450" style="s2">one of the axioms in that book that was</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.010" end="02:16:58.210" style="s2">one of them is the system does not do</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.450" end="02:16:59.620" style="s2">what it says it does so that&#39;s then you</p>
<p begin="02:16:58.210" end="02:17:02.590" style="s2">can face the system with a clear head</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.620" end="02:17:03.820" style="s2">and say okay well this thing isn&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="02:17:02.590" end="02:17:05.380" style="s2">what it says it&#39;s doing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.820" end="02:17:07.030" style="s2">probably doing something and the thing</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.380" end="02:17:08.380" style="s2">it&#39;s doing might be useful but we should</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.030" end="02:17:09.969" style="s2">figure out what that thing is so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:08.380" end="02:17:12.070" style="s2">been really useful to me as a guide to</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.969" end="02:17:13.840" style="s2">thinking the other thing he said was if</p>
<p begin="02:17:12.070" end="02:17:15.580" style="s2">you want to build a big system that</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.840" end="02:17:18.190" style="s2">works start with by building a small</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.580" end="02:17:19.750" style="s2">system that works and scale it and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.190" end="02:17:21.310" style="s2">done that for example with the self</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.750" end="02:17:23.320" style="s2">authoring programs you know has built</p>
<p begin="02:17:21.310" end="02:17:25.389" style="s2">small scale systems that are very robust</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.320" end="02:17:26.560" style="s2">with the hope that they&#39;ll scale and</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.389" end="02:17:30.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the same we&#39;ll do the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.560" end="02:17:33.400" style="s2">here is start with a small amount of</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.310" end="02:17:35.050" style="s2">content see if we can reward see what I</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.400" end="02:17:36.219" style="s2">would like to have happen is you know</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.050" end="02:17:38.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people out there who</p>
<p begin="02:17:36.219" end="02:17:40.330" style="s2">are pretty intensely educated and some</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.410" end="02:17:42.730" style="s2">of them are really creative and so</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.330" end="02:17:44.530" style="s2">imagine that there&#39;s a timeline imagine</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.730" end="02:17:46.300" style="s2">you could do a humanity since you</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.530" end="02:17:49.630" style="s2">imagine there&#39;s a timeline say of a</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.300" end="02:17:51.820" style="s2">thousand years but scalable then imagine</p>
<p begin="02:17:49.630" end="02:17:53.560" style="s2">that that there would be lectures</p>
<p begin="02:17:51.820" end="02:17:55.389" style="s2">associated with the timeline at</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.560" end="02:17:58.270" style="s2">different levels of resolution so we</p>
<p begin="02:17:55.389" end="02:18:01.090" style="s2">might call for a lecture on the 3rd</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.270" end="02:18:02.800" style="s2">century AD what happened in the 3rd</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.090" end="02:18:04.719" style="s2">century ad you&#39;ve got half an hour to</p>
<p begin="02:18:02.800" end="02:18:06.849" style="s2">explain it you can explain it any way</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.719" end="02:18:08.830" style="s2">you want you can use animation you can</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.849" end="02:18:11.080" style="s2">use lecture you can use text you can</p>
<p begin="02:18:08.830" end="02:18:13.360" style="s2">make a movie we don&#39;t care what you have</p>
<p begin="02:18:11.080" end="02:18:15.460" style="s2">to do is that&#39;s the topic that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.360" end="02:18:18.160" style="s2">timespan that&#39;s the amount of time and</p>
<p begin="02:18:15.460" end="02:18:20.260" style="s2">then you can post it and so we could</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.160" end="02:18:22.710" style="s2">generate content that way and let people</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.260" end="02:18:25.900" style="s2">experiment and then we can have people</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.710" end="02:18:28.330" style="s2">review the content as part of their</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.900" end="02:18:30.430" style="s2">generate questions about the content as</p>
<p begin="02:18:28.330" end="02:18:32.200" style="s2">part of their assignments rate the</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.430" end="02:18:35.050" style="s2">questions as part of their assignments</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.200" end="02:18:37.480" style="s2">and rate the content and then if we</p>
<p begin="02:18:35.050" end="02:18:39.100" style="s2">charge people imagine you had to pay $50</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.480" end="02:18:42.700" style="s2">a month to enroll something like that</p>
<p begin="02:18:39.100" end="02:18:46.240" style="s2">maybe we would allow you when you first</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.700" end="02:18:48.160" style="s2">enroll maybe you get to use five dollars</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.240" end="02:18:50.080" style="s2">of it as disposable income you can</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.160" end="02:18:52.450" style="s2">reward that to any creator you want but</p>
<p begin="02:18:50.080" end="02:18:54.730" style="s2">as you progress through the courses your</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.450" end="02:18:57.310" style="s2">right to determine where your money goes</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.730" end="02:18:58.960" style="s2">would increase as you became more and</p>
<p begin="02:18:57.310" end="02:19:00.370" style="s2">more educated hopefully that way we</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.960" end="02:19:02.170" style="s2">would get some quality control built</p>
<p begin="02:19:00.370" end="02:19:03.820" style="s2">into it so those are some of the ideas</p>
<p begin="02:19:02.170" end="02:19:06.730" style="s2">that were that we&#39;re starting to play</p>
<p begin="02:19:03.820" end="02:19:08.410" style="s2">around with so the only one I&#39;m consider</p>
<p begin="02:19:06.730" end="02:19:11.070" style="s2">about is the motivation yeah what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.410" end="02:19:14.710" style="s2">the motivation issue for individuals</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.070" end="02:19:16.990" style="s2">well then I&#39;m not going to go into that</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.710" end="02:19:18.640" style="s2">because it would take too long but but</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.990" end="02:19:20.650" style="s2">rest assured that we are thinking about</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.640" end="02:19:22.600" style="s2">that very hard as well we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.650" end="02:19:24.340" style="s2">build competition into it we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.600" end="02:19:26.740" style="s2">build cooperation into it we hope to</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.340" end="02:19:28.780" style="s2">build peer into relationships into it I</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.740" end="02:19:30.880" style="s2">think all that&#39;s possible but but</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.780" end="02:19:34.060" style="s2">complex right because it&#39;s we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.880" end="02:19:36.340" style="s2">how to build an online education system</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.060" end="02:19:37.750" style="s2">really and but it would be fun to</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.340" end="02:19:48.730" style="s2">experiment and see if we can figure out</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.750" end="02:19:51.400" style="s2">how to do it so thank you hi so I I</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.730" end="02:19:53.021" style="s2">couldn&#39;t really zero in on any</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.400" end="02:19:54.550" style="s2">particular question so it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.021" end="02:19:56.650" style="s2">family questions that I have about the</p>
<p begin="02:19:54.550" end="02:19:59.340" style="s2">nature and cultivation of conscience</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.650" end="02:20:02.800" style="s2">which was in a sense what this story</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.340" end="02:20:04.630" style="s2">exemplified about Abraham why do you say</p>
<p begin="02:20:02.800" end="02:20:06.010" style="s2">that why do you think that the story</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.630" end="02:20:07.320" style="s2">exemplified the development of</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.010" end="02:20:10.420" style="s2">conscience of conscience</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.320" end="02:20:12.730" style="s2">specifically well going back to the</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.420" end="02:20:14.230" style="s2">zigzag yeah right and the star how you</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.730" end="02:20:14.891" style="s2">have to keep okay so that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.230" end="02:20:16.990" style="s2">were referring to</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.891" end="02:20:19.570" style="s2">okay orienting yourself completely</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.990" end="02:20:23.500" style="s2">autonomously yeah on your own terms</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.570" end="02:20:25.210" style="s2">right yeah okay okay so you we hit on</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.500" end="02:20:27.280" style="s2">some great there I think you know and</p>
<p begin="02:20:25.210" end="02:20:29.260" style="s2">this is something weirdly enough that I</p>
<p begin="02:20:27.280" end="02:20:30.910" style="s2">learned most particularly from the</p>
<p begin="02:20:29.260" end="02:20:33.550" style="s2">Pinocchio movie which I spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.910" end="02:20:35.740" style="s2">time studying is because in in the</p>
<p begin="02:20:33.550" end="02:20:38.110" style="s2">Pinocchio movie Jiminy Cricket is an</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.740" end="02:20:38.590" style="s2">avatar of Christ essentially but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.110" end="02:20:40.240" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.590" end="02:20:42.160" style="s2">because he&#39;s a bug that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.240" end="02:20:44.140" style="s2">thing that&#39;s kind of weird and because</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.160" end="02:20:46.060" style="s2">Jiminy Cricket is southern US slang for</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.140" end="02:20:49.240" style="s2">Jesus Christ among other things but and</p>
<p begin="02:20:46.060" end="02:20:50.979" style="s2">these things get aggregated in in great</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.240" end="02:20:52.840" style="s2">mythic dramas like that and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.979" end="02:20:54.939" style="s2">great mythic drama but you know one of</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.840" end="02:20:56.770" style="s2">the things that really makes Jiminy</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.939" end="02:20:58.300" style="s2">Cricket different from Christ apart from</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.770" end="02:21:01.660" style="s2">the fact that Christ wasn&#39;t a cricket is</p>
<p begin="02:20:58.300" end="02:21:03.640" style="s2">that Craig the cricket learns as he</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.660" end="02:21:05.590" style="s2">progresses right even though he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.640" end="02:21:07.750" style="s2">conscience and so you&#39;d think that he</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.590" end="02:21:09.160" style="s2">would be the infallible guide that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.750" end="02:21:12.100" style="s2">how the moviemakers set it up but not so</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.160" end="02:21:14.170" style="s2">cool is that he is just as muddle-headed</p>
<p begin="02:21:12.100" end="02:21:17.590" style="s2">as Pinocchio at the beginning and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.170" end="02:21:19.090" style="s2">bit arrogant and puffed up too and so it</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.590" end="02:21:20.560" style="s2">took me a long time to think that</p>
<p begin="02:21:19.090" end="02:21:24.010" style="s2">through and then I realized that well</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.560" end="02:21:26.080" style="s2">you you have the voice of you have the</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.010" end="02:21:28.899" style="s2">voice of culture in you you have the</p>
<p begin="02:21:26.080" end="02:21:30.700" style="s2">voice of culture within you but it&#39;s old</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.899" end="02:21:33.609" style="s2">and dead and out-of-date and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:21:30.700" end="02:21:35.290" style="s2">fully articulated and updated and then</p>
<p begin="02:21:33.609" end="02:21:38.740" style="s2">what happens is that if you enter into a</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.290" end="02:21:40.899" style="s2">dialogue with it and you hammer yourself</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.740" end="02:21:42.760" style="s2">against the world then you get hammered</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.899" end="02:21:46.210" style="s2">into shape and so does your conscience</p>
<p begin="02:21:42.760" end="02:21:49.120" style="s2">and so you both become elevated and so</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.210" end="02:21:51.130" style="s2">well so anyways I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.120" end="02:21:52.990" style="s2">ridiculously cool because it means that</p>
<p begin="02:21:51.130" end="02:21:54.460" style="s2">your conscience you don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.990" end="02:21:56.109" style="s2">infallible guide but you have something</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.460" end="02:21:58.359" style="s2">within you that you could build into an</p>
<p begin="02:21:56.109" end="02:22:02.439" style="s2">infallible guide if you cooperated with</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.359" end="02:22:04.540" style="s2">it and and said it so well so I think</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.439" end="02:22:06.939" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting so that being</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.540" end="02:22:09.460" style="s2">said yes the picture that I have in my</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.939" end="02:22:12.250" style="s2">mind of the cultivation of virtue in</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.460" end="02:22:13.720" style="s2">general it&#39;s kind of like taking a block</p>
<p begin="02:22:12.250" end="02:22:16.210" style="s2">of wood and trying to carve out a sphere</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.720" end="02:22:18.160" style="s2">out of it it&#39;ll never be perfectly round</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.210" end="02:22:20.200" style="s2">but the more you carve right the rounder</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.160" end="02:22:22.840" style="s2">and rounder right that&#39;s successive</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.200" end="02:22:25.810" style="s2">approximation yeah well one of it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="02:22:22.840" end="02:22:27.760" style="s2">like what do you call that compound</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.810" end="02:22:29.350" style="s2">interest this is one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.760" end="02:22:32.350" style="s2">that&#39;s also and I think this puts you on</p>
<p begin="02:22:29.350" end="02:22:36.460" style="s2">the to those who more shall be given</p>
<p begin="02:22:32.350" end="02:22:38.620" style="s2">part of the curve it&#39;s like you know you</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.460" end="02:22:42.130" style="s2">don&#39;t have to improve yourself very much</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.620" end="02:22:44.500" style="s2">each week to really improve yourself on</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.130" end="02:22:46.060" style="s2">the ridiculous amount in a year you know</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.500" end="02:22:50.109" style="s2">so you could make you could you could</p>
<p begin="02:22:46.060" end="02:22:52.570" style="s2">you could Wow make your day 1/100 of a</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.109" end="02:22:54.400" style="s2">percent better than the day before</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.570" end="02:22:57.790" style="s2">not would do the trick if you were if</p>
<p begin="02:22:54.400" end="02:22:59.620" style="s2">you were constant about that that would</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.790" end="02:23:02.141" style="s2">do the trick so that that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.620" end="02:23:03.761" style="s2">successive approximation is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.141" end="02:23:05.950" style="s2">want to underestimate the utility of</p>
<p begin="02:23:03.761" end="02:23:09.851" style="s2">incremental progress man it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:23:05.950" end="02:23:12.580" style="s2">kids deadly powerful so so let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.851" end="02:23:14.351" style="s2">get to the you know the higher ends of</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.580" end="02:23:16.990" style="s2">the curve right you&#39;re like a pretty</p>
<p begin="02:23:14.351" end="02:23:19.301" style="s2">virtuous person let&#39;s say you even</p>
<p begin="02:23:16.990" end="02:23:25.061" style="s2">become a sage or something of the sort</p>
<p begin="02:23:19.301" end="02:23:27.700" style="s2">and I mean one should you doubt your</p>
<p begin="02:23:25.061" end="02:23:29.440" style="s2">conscience like what are things that we</p>
<p begin="02:23:27.700" end="02:23:30.190" style="s2">should watch out for even when we got</p>
<p begin="02:23:29.440" end="02:23:33.730" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.190" end="02:23:36.460" style="s2">well that&#39;s yep okay um just just to get</p>
<p begin="02:23:33.730" end="02:23:39.160" style="s2">it out of the way right yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.460" end="02:23:41.950" style="s2">know how much this relates well it does</p>
<p begin="02:23:39.160" end="02:23:43.931" style="s2">relate but Psychopaths for example the</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.950" end="02:23:46.030" style="s2">entire idea that they lack a conscience</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.931" end="02:23:49.150" style="s2">and that&#39;s why right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.030" end="02:23:51.431" style="s2">psychopathy is whether or not you agree</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.150" end="02:23:53.710" style="s2">with that definition right but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:51.431" end="02:23:58.000" style="s2">an issue of conscience again a play with</p>
<p begin="02:23:53.710" end="02:24:01.870" style="s2">psychopathy how can we the first</p>
<p begin="02:23:58.000" end="02:24:03.641" style="s2">question doubt ourselves in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.870" end="02:24:09.130" style="s2">warranted right regardless of how</p>
<p begin="02:24:03.641" end="02:24:11.110" style="s2">virtuous we&#39;ve become and can you treat</p>
<p begin="02:24:09.130" end="02:24:13.420" style="s2">a psychopath could they call fate a</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.110" end="02:24:15.370" style="s2">conscience okay so let we&#39;ll start with</p>
<p begin="02:24:13.420" end="02:24:18.700" style="s2">the first one part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.370" end="02:24:23.051" style="s2">that I believe that freedom of speech is</p>
<p begin="02:24:18.700" end="02:24:25.181" style="s2">the canonical right let&#39;s end obligation</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.051" end="02:24:27.880" style="s2">right more importantly even obligation</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.181" end="02:24:31.511" style="s2">is that that&#39;s how you figure out if</p>
<p begin="02:24:27.880" end="02:24:32.740" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong you know because so I said</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.511" end="02:24:36.000" style="s2">home and I think and I think and I think</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.740" end="02:24:38.500" style="s2">let&#39;s say but I&#39;m like who am I to think</p>
<p begin="02:24:36.000" end="02:24:41.410" style="s2">there&#39;s so many things I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.500" end="02:24:44.521" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just there&#39;s the what I know</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.410" end="02:24:48.040" style="s2">compared to what I don&#39;t know is so</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.521" end="02:24:52.150" style="s2">miniscule that it&#39;s a preposterous act</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.040" end="02:24:53.561" style="s2">just to say something okay so so no</p>
<p begin="02:24:52.150" end="02:24:54.851" style="s2">matter how much I sit at home and think</p>
<p begin="02:24:53.561" end="02:24:56.681" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to fix that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.851" end="02:24:58.391" style="s2">be flat and then I have biases but my</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.681" end="02:25:00.761" style="s2">temperament and I have biases because of</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.391" end="02:25:04.570" style="s2">my malevolence and I have biases because</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.761" end="02:25:07.771" style="s2">of my my gender my sex let&#39;s say since</p>
<p begin="02:25:04.570" end="02:25:10.540" style="s2">we&#39;re not so fond of that word</p>
<p begin="02:25:07.771" end="02:25:12.490" style="s2">so Eva no matter how much I said home</p>
<p begin="02:25:10.540" end="02:25:15.490" style="s2">and think I&#39;m still going to be wrong</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.490" end="02:25:16.750" style="s2">and malevolent so then what do I have to</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.490" end="02:25:20.021" style="s2">do is I have to talk to some other</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.750" end="02:25:24.900" style="s2">people and I have to say this is what I</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.021" end="02:25:29.530" style="s2">think and it&#39;s going to be ugly you know</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.900" end="02:25:34.061" style="s2">because what the hell do I know but then</p>
<p begin="02:25:29.530" end="02:25:36.040" style="s2">if I listen people will tell me why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:25:34.061" end="02:25:38.530" style="s2">wrong and lots of people have been</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.040" end="02:25:41.261" style="s2">telling me why I&#39;m wrong like a lot and</p>
<p begin="02:25:38.530" end="02:25:43.660" style="s2">it&#39;s hard you know it&#39;s hard but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:41.261" end="02:25:47.351" style="s2">but I&#39;ve learned something from it like</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.660" end="02:25:49.900" style="s2">I had this revelation let&#39;s say about</p>
<p begin="02:25:47.351" end="02:25:51.641" style="s2">being yelled at by your father now I</p>
<p begin="02:25:49.900" end="02:25:54.700" style="s2">know that you can be yelled at too much</p>
<p begin="02:25:51.641" end="02:25:57.551" style="s2">by your father but it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.700" end="02:25:58.960" style="s2">wrong man and so someone&#39;s yelling at</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.551" end="02:26:01.750" style="s2">you and maybe they&#39;re only ten percent</p>
<p begin="02:25:58.960" end="02:26:04.181" style="s2">right but if you shut the hell up and</p>
<p begin="02:26:01.750" end="02:26:06.400" style="s2">listen then you can figure out where</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.181" end="02:26:08.021" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong and then maybe you can be</p>
<p begin="02:26:06.400" end="02:26:10.721" style="s2">thankful for that and then maybe if you</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.021" end="02:26:12.400" style="s2">shut up and listen your father would</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.721" end="02:26:14.080" style="s2">quit yelling at you you know because</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.400" end="02:26:16.091" style="s2">he&#39;s wrong - what the hell does he know</p>
<p begin="02:26:14.080" end="02:26:17.650" style="s2">he knows how to yell at you and tell you</p>
<p begin="02:26:16.091" end="02:26:19.391" style="s2">how you&#39;re wrong and he&#39;s throwing</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.650" end="02:26:23.681" style="s2">things out you add you that are probably</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.391" end="02:26:25.150" style="s2">not true but some of its true and you</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.681" end="02:26:26.771" style="s2">know if someone can tell you why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.150" end="02:26:29.440" style="s2">wrong they&#39;ve given you a great gift</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.771" end="02:26:30.641" style="s2">because then you don&#39;t have to be wrong</p>
<p begin="02:26:29.440" end="02:26:32.320" style="s2">anymore and you might think well who</p>
<p begin="02:26:30.641" end="02:26:34.570" style="s2">cares if you&#39;re wrong but you know</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.320" end="02:26:37.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a line in the New Testament - is</p>
<p begin="02:26:34.570" end="02:26:39.820" style="s2">if the blind lead the blind won&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="02:26:37.150" end="02:26:41.110" style="s2">fall in won&#39;t they fall into a ditch the</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.820" end="02:26:44.381" style="s2">answer to that question by the way is</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.110" end="02:26:46.511" style="s2">yes they will and so the reason that you</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.381" end="02:26:51.391" style="s2">want to think is because thinking is how</p>
<p begin="02:26:46.511" end="02:26:54.040" style="s2">you like when you think you creative the</p>
<p begin="02:26:51.391" end="02:26:55.480" style="s2">fictional world that&#39;s an analog of the</p>
<p begin="02:26:54.040" end="02:26:57.730" style="s2">world and then you make an avatar of</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.480" end="02:26:59.681" style="s2">yourself to act in that world and then</p>
<p begin="02:26:57.730" end="02:27:02.790" style="s2">if the Avatar dies you don&#39;t act out</p>
<p begin="02:26:59.681" end="02:27:05.801" style="s2">those actions right well so if you think</p>
<p begin="02:27:02.790" end="02:27:07.631" style="s2">properly then you don&#39;t have to suffer</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.801" end="02:27:09.580" style="s2">and die and so if you can say what you</p>
<p begin="02:27:07.631" end="02:27:11.830" style="s2">think and people can tell you why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:27:09.580" end="02:27:14.230" style="s2">wrong and you know to say what you think</p>
<p begin="02:27:11.830" end="02:27:15.341" style="s2">under extreme circumstances means that</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.230" end="02:27:17.110" style="s2">you&#39;re going to say things that no one</p>
<p begin="02:27:15.341" end="02:27:18.341" style="s2">wants to hear because those are the</p>
<p begin="02:27:17.110" end="02:27:19.631" style="s2">things you don&#39;t know about those are</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.341" end="02:27:20.080" style="s2">the things that are conflictual and</p>
<p begin="02:27:19.631" end="02:27:21.400" style="s2">differ</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.080" end="02:27:23.650" style="s2">called it are going to be hard</p>
<p begin="02:27:21.400" end="02:27:25.420" style="s2">conversations man and you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.650" end="02:27:27.960" style="s2">wrong about them a lot if you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="02:27:25.420" end="02:27:31.930" style="s2">to stumble forward with your stupidity</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.960" end="02:27:33.730" style="s2">then you can&#39;t be corrected and so so</p>
<p begin="02:27:31.930" end="02:27:35.050" style="s2">there&#39;s no distinction between free</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.730" end="02:27:36.670" style="s2">speech and thinking and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:27:35.050" end="02:27:38.530" style="s2">distinction between thinking and</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.670" end="02:27:41.530" style="s2">thriving and so those who want to</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.530" end="02:27:48.000" style="s2">inhibit free speech do not wish for</p>
<p begin="02:27:41.530" end="02:27:48.000" style="s2">people to thrive and I believe that so</p>
<p begin="02:27:48.240" end="02:27:52.990" style="s2">thinking does not happen inside your</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.680" end="02:27:54.850" style="s2">head that&#39;s only the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.990" end="02:27:58.870" style="s2">thinking and it&#39;s this that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="02:27:54.850" end="02:28:04.510" style="s2">here that&#39;s thinking you know so we have</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.870" end="02:28:08.021" style="s2">to protect that psychopath I don&#39;t I say</p>
<p begin="02:28:04.510" end="02:28:10.180" style="s2">this I hope non naively also having</p>
<p begin="02:28:08.021" end="02:28:12.040" style="s2">dealt with Psychopaths in my clinical</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.180" end="02:28:15.630" style="s2">practice and I would say now and then in</p>
<p begin="02:28:12.040" end="02:28:18.730" style="s2">my life I don&#39;t believe in Psychopaths I</p>
<p begin="02:28:15.630" end="02:28:21.190" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that we know enough to say</p>
<p begin="02:28:18.730" end="02:28:25.210" style="s2">there are people born without conscience</p>
<p begin="02:28:21.190" end="02:28:27.400" style="s2">um I don&#39;t think the psychometric</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.210" end="02:28:29.140" style="s2">measurement of psychopathy is everything</p>
<p begin="02:28:27.400" end="02:28:31.150" style="s2">that it should be I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.140" end="02:28:33.970" style="s2">model it bei in the Big Five domain I</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.150" end="02:28:35.650" style="s2">think now it&#39;s complicated because so I</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.970" end="02:28:37.300" style="s2">would say a psychopath the classic</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.650" end="02:28:40.170" style="s2">psychopath is likely extroverted</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.300" end="02:28:43.900" style="s2">especially assertive disagreeable and</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.170" end="02:28:45.610" style="s2">unconscious and maybe extremely low in</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.900" end="02:28:49.360" style="s2">neuroticism so you can&#39;t frighten them</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.610" end="02:28:51.700" style="s2">but so that&#39;s a rare combination because</p>
<p begin="02:28:49.360" end="02:28:53.830" style="s2">it&#39;s extreme on many traits right but</p>
<p begin="02:28:51.700" end="02:28:55.300" style="s2">that I don&#39;t believe that that means</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.830" end="02:28:58.620" style="s2">that someone with that personality</p>
<p begin="02:28:55.300" end="02:29:00.521" style="s2">configuration is doomed from birth to a</p>
<p begin="02:28:58.620" end="02:29:02.920" style="s2">pathological existence because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:00.521" end="02:29:05.771" style="s2">things about psychopathy that that the</p>
<p begin="02:29:02.920" end="02:29:07.600" style="s2">that the classifiers those who claim</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.771" end="02:29:10.420" style="s2">like correctly that the psychopath is</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.600" end="02:29:14.950" style="s2">born in some sense can&#39;t explain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:10.420" end="02:29:16.390" style="s2">like well what about the cruelty there</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.950" end="02:29:18.521" style="s2">seems to be a motive they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.390" end="02:29:21.250" style="s2">they&#39;re passionless and they lack no</p>
<p begin="02:29:18.521" end="02:29:25.390" style="s2">they lack emotion well why are they</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.250" end="02:29:26.830" style="s2">cruel then for entertainment well but</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.390" end="02:29:28.960" style="s2">then you have to explain the</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.830" end="02:29:30.940" style="s2">entertainment motivation like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.960" end="02:29:33.010" style="s2">failure in some sense with the classic</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.940" end="02:29:33.970" style="s2">psychopathy theorist to come to grips</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.010" end="02:29:36.520" style="s2">with the problem</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.970" end="02:29:37.689" style="s2">malevolence it skirted over and you</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.520" end="02:29:39.850" style="s2">can&#39;t do that if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.689" end="02:29:44.499" style="s2">psychopathy it&#39;s like malevolence is the</p>
<p begin="02:29:39.850" end="02:29:45.789" style="s2">bloody issue here and so the other issue</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.499" end="02:29:49.649" style="s2">with the psychopaths is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:45.789" end="02:29:51.939" style="s2">irredeemable right that&#39;s the idea I</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.649" end="02:29:54.489" style="s2">don&#39;t think we know enough to make such</p>
<p begin="02:29:51.939" end="02:29:56.109" style="s2">claims now and that doesn&#39;t I know the</p>
<p begin="02:29:54.489" end="02:29:57.729" style="s2">psych office a literature quite well and</p>
<p begin="02:29:56.109" end="02:29:59.380" style="s2">I have great respect for their primary</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.729" end="02:30:01.119" style="s2">research is in the field I want to make</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.380" end="02:30:03.220" style="s2">that perfectly clear but we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="02:30:01.119" end="02:30:04.749" style="s2">at a different we&#39;re talking we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.220" end="02:30:06.189" style="s2">approaching the problem from a different</p>
<p begin="02:30:04.749" end="02:30:08.649" style="s2">level of analysis here something like a</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.189" end="02:30:10.090" style="s2">spiritual level of analysis and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:30:08.649" end="02:30:12.189" style="s2">think that there&#39;s an easy easy</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.090" end="02:30:15.600" style="s2">translation from the descriptive</p>
<p begin="02:30:12.189" end="02:30:19.029" style="s2">psychometric psychiatric approach to the</p>
<p begin="02:30:15.600" end="02:30:22.180" style="s2">spiritual level they don&#39;t match and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.029" end="02:30:25.449" style="s2">more likely to say let&#39;s not assume the</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.180" end="02:30:28.510" style="s2">soul is doomed from birth right and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.449" end="02:30:31.779" style="s2">loathe to think that there are people</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.510" end="02:30:34.659" style="s2">born irredeemable although I do think</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.779" end="02:30:36.520" style="s2">there are irredeemable people know the</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.659" end="02:30:38.800" style="s2">death penalty issues interesting in that</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.520" end="02:30:41.619" style="s2">regard you know because I&#39;ve read a lot</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.800" end="02:30:43.300" style="s2">about really terrible people and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.619" end="02:30:45.069" style="s2">also read a lot about what really</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.300" end="02:30:47.229" style="s2">terrible people said about themselves</p>
<p begin="02:30:45.069" end="02:30:50.079" style="s2">and many of them wished for the death</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.229" end="02:30:51.699" style="s2">penalty and so it&#39;s absolutely clear</p>
<p begin="02:30:50.079" end="02:30:55.600" style="s2">that there are things that you can do</p>
<p begin="02:30:51.699" end="02:30:56.829" style="s2">that deserve the death penalty but that</p>
<p begin="02:30:55.600" end="02:30:58.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that the state should have</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.829" end="02:31:04.649" style="s2">the right to impose it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.810" end="02:31:04.649" style="s2">different question so yep</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.601" end="02:31:13.230" style="s2">in the previous lecture you mentioned</p>

<p begin="02:31:51.570" end="02:31:53.641" style="s2">interesting to compare and contrast with</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.221" end="02:31:55.950" style="s2">yours</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.641" end="02:31:57.120" style="s2">he certainly not your typical Marxist or</p>
<p begin="02:31:55.950" end="02:31:58.830" style="s2">post modernist even though not really</p>
<p begin="02:31:57.120" end="02:32:00.181" style="s2">sure what that means but if you look at</p>
<p begin="02:31:58.830" end="02:32:01.860" style="s2">his work during the Greek debt crisis</p>
<p begin="02:32:00.181" end="02:32:03.181" style="s2">and his current work with diem25</p>
<p begin="02:32:01.860" end="02:32:05.910" style="s2">he seems to be well reasoned</p>
<p begin="02:32:03.181" end="02:32:07.290" style="s2">well-positioned and and articulate now I</p>
<p begin="02:32:05.910" end="02:32:09.511" style="s2">wanted to know if you had an opinion on</p>
<p begin="02:32:07.290" end="02:32:11.070" style="s2">that type of criticism of MIL or his</p>
<p begin="02:32:09.511" end="02:32:16.261" style="s2">taking of a position as a neurotic</p>
<p begin="02:32:11.070" end="02:32:19.440" style="s2">Marxist okay I would say I would say no</p>
<p begin="02:32:16.261" end="02:32:22.110" style="s2">to the specifics of the question I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:32:19.440" end="02:32:24.480" style="s2">think that I have that detailed</p>
<p begin="02:32:22.110" end="02:32:26.160" style="s2">expertise in order to answer the</p>
<p begin="02:32:24.480" end="02:32:30.330" style="s2">question at the level of analysis that</p>
<p begin="02:32:26.160" end="02:32:32.101" style="s2">you where you formulated it but I have</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.330" end="02:32:33.960" style="s2">something to say that&#39;s more general</p>
<p begin="02:32:32.101" end="02:32:37.131" style="s2">about the set of phenomena that you</p>
<p begin="02:32:33.960" end="02:32:39.780" style="s2">described there&#39;s no doubt that</p>
<p begin="02:32:37.131" end="02:32:43.681" style="s2">distribution is a major problem that</p>
<p begin="02:32:39.780" end="02:32:46.740" style="s2">capitalism contends with imperfectly at</p>
<p begin="02:32:43.681" end="02:32:48.360" style="s2">best and the distribution problem is the</p>
<p begin="02:32:46.740" end="02:32:50.040" style="s2">pre de distribution problem right and</p>
<p begin="02:32:48.360" end="02:32:52.351" style="s2">it&#39;s something that Marx commented on</p>
<p begin="02:32:50.040" end="02:32:54.030" style="s2">which mostly in the monetary sphere is</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.351" end="02:32:55.471" style="s2">that money tends to accumulate in the</p>
<p begin="02:32:54.030" end="02:32:58.021" style="s2">hands of very few people it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:32:55.471" end="02:33:00.900" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about that now as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:32:58.021" end="02:33:03.301" style="s2">discussed before the people in whom</p>
<p begin="02:33:00.900" end="02:33:06.301" style="s2">hands the money accumulates do turnover</p>
<p begin="02:33:03.301" end="02:33:09.120" style="s2">more than people say think especially in</p>
<p begin="02:33:06.301" end="02:33:10.471" style="s2">in countries that are functioning me</p>
<p begin="02:33:09.120" end="02:33:13.950" style="s2">reasonably well and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:33:10.471" end="02:33:18.240" style="s2">important that that happens yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="02:33:13.950" end="02:33:20.820" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t solve the</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.240" end="02:33:24.360" style="s2">problem of the fact</p>
<p begin="02:33:20.820" end="02:33:25.620" style="s2">that produced goods gravitate towards an</p>
<p begin="02:33:24.360" end="02:33:27.870" style="s2">extreme minority now they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="02:33:25.620" end="02:33:33.080" style="s2">produced often by extreme minority which</p>
<p begin="02:33:27.870" end="02:33:36.630" style="s2">is also a problem I would say then that</p>
<p begin="02:33:33.080" end="02:33:40.561" style="s2">the idea that capitalism is more prone</p>
<p begin="02:33:36.630" end="02:33:43.440" style="s2">to that distribution problem than any</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.561" end="02:33:46.051" style="s2">other system I don&#39;t believe that to</p>
<p begin="02:33:43.440" end="02:33:47.880" style="s2">have been demonstrated at all and I</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.051" end="02:33:49.590" style="s2">think that capitalism is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="02:33:47.880" end="02:33:52.080" style="s2">good at self-destruction</p>
<p begin="02:33:49.590" end="02:33:53.641" style="s2">except when that&#39;s interfered with and I</p>
<p begin="02:33:52.080" end="02:33:56.851" style="s2">think that&#39;s particularly the case in</p>
<p begin="02:33:53.641" end="02:34:00.030" style="s2">the United States where generally the</p>
<p begin="02:33:56.851" end="02:34:02.101" style="s2">policy has been if you&#39;re an idle with</p>
<p begin="02:34:00.030" end="02:34:04.681" style="s2">feet of clay no matter how big you are</p>
<p begin="02:34:02.101" end="02:34:07.740" style="s2">you get to fail now that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="02:34:04.681" end="02:34:10.830" style="s2">compromised severely in the last 20</p>
<p begin="02:34:07.740" end="02:34:12.690" style="s2">years and we&#39;re probably going to pay</p>
<p begin="02:34:10.830" end="02:34:16.170" style="s2">for that I think they really paid for</p>
<p begin="02:34:12.690" end="02:34:18.960" style="s2">that in Japan right where there is every</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.170" end="02:34:25.590" style="s2">attempt to prop out that the gods that</p>
<p begin="02:34:18.960" end="02:34:28.410" style="s2">should have died so so fair enough for</p>
<p begin="02:34:25.590" end="02:34:31.410" style="s2">the critique of capitalism that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:34:28.410" end="02:34:36.120" style="s2">the issue the issue is do you have a</p>
<p begin="02:34:31.410" end="02:34:38.811" style="s2">better idea and if the idea is well we</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.120" end="02:34:43.851" style="s2">could kind of do it marks suggested then</p>
<p begin="02:34:38.811" end="02:34:49.710" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to have that position and</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.851" end="02:34:52.051" style="s2">claim what should I say I haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.710" end="02:34:54.391" style="s2">any evidence that systems predicated on</p>
<p begin="02:34:52.051" end="02:34:57.540" style="s2">that set of actions have done anything</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.391" end="02:34:59.101" style="s2">but more harm than good thank you yeah</p>
<p begin="02:34:57.540" end="02:35:01.620" style="s2">and when will you be announcing the</p>
<p begin="02:34:59.101" end="02:35:03.330" style="s2">monthly extension to the circuses as</p>
<p begin="02:35:01.620" end="02:35:07.681" style="s2">soon as I find out whether or not I can</p>
