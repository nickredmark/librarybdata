<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">in the 21st century we need to be asking</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:59.129" style="s2">themselves a fourfold question we want</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.330" end="00:01:19.650" style="s2">foundations so it means a local question</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.189" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">and a global question a social question</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.650" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">in ecological so this four part question</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:24.600" style="s2">what does it thriving mean to people</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">here and what does it mean for this</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.600" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">place to thrive how do we do that while</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:28.710" style="s2">respecting the rights of all people and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">how do I do</p>

<p begin="00:01:57.100" end="00:02:00.370" style="s2">I&#39;m going to start the local question</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.370" end="00:02:04.660" style="s2">let the people of this place to find</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.800" end="00:02:06.520" style="s2">what thriving means it will be very</p>

<p begin="00:02:14.920" end="00:02:18.100" style="s2">to create a threshold level what is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.540" end="00:02:21.100" style="s2">threshold and where are we now</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.100" end="00:02:22.960" style="s2">so to get the threshold what targets has</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.100" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">this place set for itself already and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.960" end="00:02:26.800" style="s2">what can you see that stir now we took</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:29.590" style="s2">the Doolin bomb which is the target tree</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.800" end="00:02:30.940" style="s2">and Saddam has forty nine goals that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.590" end="00:02:32.770" style="s2">set for itself is that what these year</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.940" end="00:02:34.060" style="s2">already agreed targets but also one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.770" end="00:02:35.490" style="s2">the people at this place think is a</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.940" end="00:03:44.530" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t ask the water so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.010" end="00:03:47.650" style="s2">would the world landing but go to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.530" end="00:03:49.930" style="s2">bar next door help the ecosystem of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.650" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">bio region of this habitat and take its</p>

<p begin="00:03:57.610" end="00:04:02.890" style="s2">biodiversity is housing these become the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.830" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">metrics for the city and an aim of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.890" end="00:04:07.570" style="s2">city is to match or exceed nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:10.030" style="s2">performance it&#39;s wonderfully</p>

<p begin="00:04:10.030" end="00:04:15.160" style="s2">natural common-sense that&#39;s what I love</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.190" end="00:04:17.590" style="s2">about this idea so you go to the wild</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.160" end="00:04:19.480" style="s2">land next door measuring its metrics in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.590" end="00:04:22.120" style="s2">all these ecological performance of how</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.480" end="00:04:23.650" style="s2">nature is regenerating itself and these</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.120" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">become the metrics of the city and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.650" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">you meander where the city is this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:31.450" style="s2">this is imaginary this is the shortfall</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:33.580" style="s2">now what kind of design use could be put</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.450" end="00:04:36.460" style="s2">into place in this place that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.580" end="00:04:39.970" style="s2">store more water purify more air cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.460" end="00:04:44.110" style="s2">the air stop erosion with sequester more</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.970" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">carbon for example I find it so exciting</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.110" end="00:04:49.720" style="s2">as the design starting point for 21st</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:51.490" style="s2">century place so we could then put those</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.720" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">two together this is all imaginary what</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.490" end="00:04:54.790" style="s2">I&#39;m showing you is the no real data you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:56.410" style="s2">can put these two together and say the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.790" end="00:04:57.669" style="s2">social goals were set by the people of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.410" end="00:04:59.080" style="s2">this place of what they think writing</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.669" end="00:05:01.330" style="s2">means and we&#39;re probably falling short</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.080" end="00:05:02.620" style="s2">and the ecological goals are set by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.330" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">world line next door and we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.620" end="00:05:06.700" style="s2">currently falling short in our city now</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:09.850" style="s2">we need to move aim to fill all of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.700" end="00:05:13.300" style="s2">in to live up to those thresholds or</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.850" end="00:05:15.460" style="s2">even exceed them many places could say</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.300" end="00:05:16.120" style="s2">that&#39;s all that&#39;s better thank you we</p>

<p begin="00:05:24.940" end="00:05:27.940" style="s2">how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.140" end="00:05:30.010" style="s2">wonderful hi our mission here in</p>
