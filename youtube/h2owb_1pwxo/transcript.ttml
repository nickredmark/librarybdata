<p begin="00:03:04.829" end="00:03:12.389" style="s2">stoicism just like kind of comes to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:15.719" style="s2">when you when you need it let&#39;s hope it</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.719" end="00:03:20.819" style="s2">feel like it&#39;s kind of metabolizing of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.609" end="00:03:24.030" style="s2">that of that energy and like you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.819" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">move forward from that kind of crunchy</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.030" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">place yeah yeah and it was it was good</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">saying it out loud too cuz I didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:32.699" style="s2">judgment on your end is sort of like you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">just accepted that reality and so saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.699" end="00:03:37.650" style="s2">what I believe to be true in front of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:39.359" style="s2">someone and then having them accept it</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.650" end="00:03:41.069" style="s2">or just have that essence of accepting</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.359" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">it feels like it accomplished what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.069" end="00:03:50.489" style="s2">just said great yeah it&#39;s actually super</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">similar but it&#39;s a little bit more like</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.489" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">kind of on the meta scale of that which</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:57.629" style="s2">is when you feel an emotion how often</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t involve a physical bodily</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.629" end="00:04:01.169" style="s2">sensation in addition to a mental state</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.169" end="00:04:08.459" style="s2">okay so paraphrasing so when you feel an</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:11.189" style="s2">emotion so what was it like how is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.459" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">relate to a mental state or are they</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.189" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">coupled like do you feel both the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:18.750" style="s2">physical sensation and also kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:20.609" style="s2">mental expression of that emotion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.750" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">so so even so when you experience an</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.609" end="00:04:25.259" style="s2">emotion do you feel a mental state</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:30.360" style="s2">that&#39;s adjacent to the emotion when when</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.259" end="00:04:31.620" style="s2">you experience it yeah yeah absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:33.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.620" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">about this question and kind of going</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.900" end="00:04:41.260" style="s2">back into my own history of experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:44.170" style="s2">different kinds of like intense</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.260" end="00:04:46.740" style="s2">like deep sense of love or deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.170" end="00:04:50.950" style="s2">embarrassment or shame or guilt or anger</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:51.640" style="s2">and recognizing that at those times in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.950" end="00:04:54.550" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.640" end="00:04:56.830" style="s2">I was really feeling those things and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.550" end="00:04:59.290" style="s2">parts of my body and the same thing goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.830" end="00:05:02.650" style="s2">just the kind of micro emotional</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.290" end="00:05:05.290" style="s2">landscape that I engage with now like</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.650" end="00:05:08.290" style="s2">even today approaching was called okay a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.290" end="00:05:12.190" style="s2">little bit of nervousness here I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.290" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">feel it in my in my belly and some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.190" end="00:05:16.330" style="s2">weird things about the sensations and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:18.210" style="s2">why like I think some of these practices</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.330" end="00:05:22.510" style="s2">like circling where they really have you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.210" end="00:05:23.920" style="s2">describe the sensations are so important</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.510" end="00:05:25.990" style="s2">is because when you sit with them</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.920" end="00:05:28.660" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of hard hard to describe it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.990" end="00:05:31.210" style="s2">hard to put words to and sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.660" end="00:05:32.890" style="s2">not even in like an organ or like a kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.210" end="00:05:36.310" style="s2">of centralized place it could just be</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.890" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">kind of like a prickling or I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.310" end="00:05:41.080" style="s2">almost feels like a pseudo sensation</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:43.750" style="s2">like it may not even be a physical thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.080" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">that is happening but rather a mapping</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.750" end="00:05:50.470" style="s2">of like an emotion onto the body that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:52.630" style="s2">kind of creating a feedback loop right</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.470" end="00:05:54.790" style="s2">because like there&#39;s the story that kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.630" end="00:05:57.150" style="s2">of emerges alongside an emotion the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.790" end="00:06:00.250" style="s2">thoughts that kind of like ricocheting</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.150" end="00:06:02.590" style="s2">images or or whatever it for me like I</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.250" end="00:06:05.620" style="s2">have a very imaged base like spatial</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.590" end="00:06:07.930" style="s2">mind so a lot of the things that I draw</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.620" end="00:06:11.950" style="s2">in terms of associations when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.930" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">catalyzed by emotion is like flashes of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.950" end="00:06:17.290" style="s2">images and then that kind of circles</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">back into kind of a on the body</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.290" end="00:06:22.930" style="s2">somewhere and those things kind of feed</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:25.240" style="s2">into each other and create this whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.930" end="00:06:26.680" style="s2">world that I&#39;m inside of both no not</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.240" end="00:06:30.430" style="s2">like a physical level and of immense</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.680" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">level that is the kind of larger</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.430" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">experience of the emotional state s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:39.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of uh you know K I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:40.510" style="s2">I&#39;m going to go on gallery reviews to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.910" end="00:06:42.820" style="s2">compulsory</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.510" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">faces in the recording now and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.820" end="00:06:48.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of good threads to go down</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:51.850" style="s2">there but I wanted to pause and maybe go</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.430" end="00:06:53.290" style="s2">back to the beginning so to speak about</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.850" end="00:06:54.520" style="s2">you know how we met</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.290" end="00:06:58.930" style="s2">or even before that like</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.520" end="00:07:00.550" style="s2">how you got on the stove&#39;s radar and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.930" end="00:07:02.620" style="s2">stuff that you&#39;re doing in Portland and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.550" end="00:07:04.449" style="s2">how it kind of relates and then maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.620" end="00:07:06.970" style="s2">can talk about Socratic speed-dating the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.449" end="00:07:09.550" style="s2">project that we&#39;re working on so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.970" end="00:07:11.289" style="s2">maybe we start like you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.550" end="00:07:13.389" style="s2">you doing in Portland with your project</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.389" end="00:07:19.770" style="s2">philosophical intellectual trajectory so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.060" end="00:07:25.000" style="s2">far yeah right now like on the precipice</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.770" end="00:07:26.949" style="s2">I&#39;m really excited that I have the space</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.000" end="00:07:29.289" style="s2">to explore right now within within my</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.949" end="00:07:32.259" style="s2">community in Portland so when I moved</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.289" end="00:07:35.139" style="s2">here in June of last year I immediately</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.259" end="00:07:37.180" style="s2">sought out a like philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.139" end="00:07:39.639" style="s2">community to engage with for</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.180" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">conversation dialogue and I found this</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.639" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">group called the people&#39;s colloquium and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:46.780" style="s2">that had been in operation since right</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:49.719" style="s2">after occupy kind of been the swell of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.780" end="00:07:51.990" style="s2">activity that was happening during that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.719" end="00:07:54.849" style="s2">time a group of people came together and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.990" end="00:07:56.710" style="s2">much like today with this fella actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.849" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">they were like you know it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.710" end="00:08:00.849" style="s2">important for us to be engaging in deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:02.710" style="s2">conversations about the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.849" end="00:08:04.030" style="s2">zeitgeist and like how we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.710" end="00:08:06.580" style="s2">together as communities and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.030" end="00:08:09.400" style="s2">doing sense making and basically that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:12.150" style="s2">object has been nurtured over time and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.400" end="00:08:16.180" style="s2">has grown and has like evolved into this</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.150" end="00:08:18.759" style="s2">large like substantially attended like</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.180" end="00:08:21.430" style="s2">and really dedicated core group of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.759" end="00:08:24.210" style="s2">people who hold this space for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.430" end="00:08:28.389" style="s2">community to come and discuss ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:30.039" style="s2">I immediately joined in and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.389" end="00:08:32.229" style="s2">made a huge difference in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.039" end="00:08:34.419" style="s2">of moving here just having this</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.229" end="00:08:37.979" style="s2">continuous dialogue and this group of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.419" end="00:08:40.690" style="s2">friends to speak about these like large</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.979" end="00:08:45.310" style="s2">ideas and share my own ideas with them</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.690" end="00:08:47.320" style="s2">the first book that I facilitated was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.310" end="00:08:48.820" style="s2">book that I just fell in love with it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.320" end="00:08:50.620" style="s2">was the first book of philosophy I ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.820" end="00:08:55.209" style="s2">fell in love with and it&#39;s called hyper</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.620" end="00:08:57.220" style="s2">objects by Timothy Martin and I was able</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.209" end="00:08:59.529" style="s2">to like kind of explore into the space</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.220" end="00:09:01.450" style="s2">of being a facilitator and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.529" end="00:09:05.140" style="s2">about how to make it exciting for people</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.450" end="00:09:06.190" style="s2">how to like draw out voices and opinions</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.140" end="00:09:09.130" style="s2">in the room</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.190" end="00:09:10.960" style="s2">so grounded in a kind of like inquiry so</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.130" end="00:09:14.770" style="s2">that we don&#39;t end up only scratching the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.960" end="00:09:18.120" style="s2">surface of dialogue and that was my</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.770" end="00:09:21.880" style="s2">first foray kind of into facilitating a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.120" end="00:09:24.910" style="s2">book a book of philosophy and then that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.880" end="00:09:26.140" style="s2">just kind of cascaded from there and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.910" end="00:09:28.830" style="s2">the winter I started doing my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.140" end="00:09:31.860" style="s2">seminar called the black box women and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.830" end="00:09:35.050" style="s2">we read finite and infinite games and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.860" end="00:09:36.760" style="s2">also like read some pieces like from</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.050" end="00:09:39.160" style="s2">Scott Alexander we read meditations</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.760" end="00:09:40.840" style="s2">almalik we&#39;ve had some existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.160" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">papers by Nick Bostrom</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.840" end="00:09:47.620" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to kind of I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:50.740" style="s2">bring game B to this space right and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.620" end="00:09:53.260" style="s2">the ways that I thought about bridging</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.740" end="00:09:56.050" style="s2">from like the philosophical into this</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.260" end="00:09:57.520" style="s2">more contemporary space was through</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.050" end="00:09:58.930" style="s2">finite of the games because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.520" end="00:10:02.470" style="s2">work a philosophy that&#39;s attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.930" end="00:10:04.360" style="s2">integrate game theory with Taoism and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.470" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">other like long-standing philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.360" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">practices and it really let people up</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:12.570" style="s2">like it was it was very exciting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:16.390" style="s2">bring that to the group and to see who</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.570" end="00:10:17.890" style="s2">really enjoyed with right like people</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.390" end="00:10:20.080" style="s2">were like yeah that&#39;s like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.890" end="00:10:23.020" style="s2">this framework is so powerful and it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.080" end="00:10:25.420" style="s2">also really important I think to can</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.020" end="00:10:27.820" style="s2">talk to those ideas and to like bring</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.420" end="00:10:31.410" style="s2">them alive in dialog coming into this</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.820" end="00:10:35.380" style="s2">crisis right so having kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.410" end="00:10:38.440" style="s2">immediately being in my mind and those</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.380" end="00:10:40.270" style="s2">ideas kind of like surfacing and trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.440" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">to make sense of things with within them</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.270" end="00:10:45.840" style="s2">in the world when approaching this</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:48.010" style="s2">situation was super powerful as well so</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.840" end="00:10:50.589" style="s2">things are really just been leading in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.010" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">to one another and when we all moved on</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.589" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">to zoom and be the social distancing I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:11:00.850" style="s2">was like honestly I was like this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:02.230" style="s2">great I get to like close the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.850" end="00:11:04.810" style="s2">loop a little bit more in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.230" end="00:11:06.100" style="s2">creating experiences intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.810" end="00:11:08.380" style="s2">experiences that people and engage with</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.100" end="00:11:10.810" style="s2">because suddenly the cost of attendance</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.380" end="00:11:12.550" style="s2">sounds like lowered dramatically I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.810" end="00:11:13.900" style="s2">have to find a place you know people</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.550" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">don&#39;t have to negotiate whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.900" end="00:11:18.730" style="s2">they&#39;re going to drive there you know so</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:19.620" style="s2">all of those logistical things that kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.730" end="00:11:22.500" style="s2">of men</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.620" end="00:11:24.120" style="s2">that before I was being very careful and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.500" end="00:11:25.950" style="s2">you know trying to really put in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.120" end="00:11:28.470" style="s2">of work upfront to create an experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.950" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">that people wanted I can now really just</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.470" end="00:11:32.790" style="s2">begin to experiment in this medium so</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:37.110" style="s2">those were the things that were on my</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.790" end="00:11:40.290" style="s2">mind when I saw the stoah like blossom I</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.110" end="00:11:43.350" style="s2">was just like oh my god this is so cool</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.290" end="00:11:46.080" style="s2">and initially I was thinking of it like</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.350" end="00:11:47.940" style="s2">first of all I wanted to sit in on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.080" end="00:11:50.490" style="s2">situational assessments I wanted to sit</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.940" end="00:11:51.960" style="s2">in on the dialogue I wanted to know what</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.490" end="00:11:54.089" style="s2">was happening and I wanted to connect</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.960" end="00:11:57.630" style="s2">with community and you know I did the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.089" end="00:12:01.170" style="s2">communit Oz prayer with with you and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.630" end="00:12:03.060" style="s2">Andrew and then saw some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.170" end="00:12:04.470" style="s2">activities that were going on but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.060" end="00:12:06.510" style="s2">there was a meta level for me which was</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.470" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">like what can I learn from how you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.510" end="00:12:11.070" style="s2">facilitating this and the different</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:14.339" style="s2">psycho technologies that you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.070" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">kind of exploring and so when I sent you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.339" end="00:12:21.000" style="s2">that message on meetup you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:22.589" style="s2">spirit of which I was like approaching</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.000" end="00:12:24.900" style="s2">that conversation with you was just like</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.589" end="00:12:27.570" style="s2">there&#39;s both the level at which as a as</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.900" end="00:12:31.290" style="s2">a participant and someone who is able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.570" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">come into the space I feel really really</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.290" end="00:12:34.830" style="s2">grateful and then as someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:38.010" style="s2">trying to learn how to do these things</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.830" end="00:12:43.940" style="s2">myself it&#39;s really rich territory for</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.010" end="00:12:49.170" style="s2">playing with this psycho technology yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.940" end="00:12:52.110" style="s2">what&#39;s coming to mind is just the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.170" end="00:12:54.630" style="s2">richness of the online space cuz</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.110" end="00:12:57.779" style="s2">personally like I&#39;m enjoying myself so</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.630" end="00:13:00.420" style="s2">much more right now doing these events</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.779" end="00:13:02.400" style="s2">than doing them in person even though I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.420" end="00:13:04.950" style="s2">had a lot of fun in person and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.400" end="00:13:06.540" style="s2">some really rich sweet moments but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.950" end="00:13:10.940" style="s2">like all that hassle like administrative</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.540" end="00:13:13.230" style="s2">stuff finding a room doing all that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.940" end="00:13:14.850" style="s2">yeah and the Wellsville came to mind is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.230" end="00:13:16.980" style="s2">like you know Colin Morris from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.850" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">existential dance party he&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.980" end="00:13:20.910" style="s2">he started his own digital dance studio</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:22.260" style="s2">now that has the same kind of model of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.910" end="00:13:23.820" style="s2">stoah where it&#39;s based off the gift</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.260" end="00:13:25.620" style="s2">economy you know he&#39;s sort of its</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.820" end="00:13:27.540" style="s2">steward over there he he&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.620" end="00:13:30.810" style="s2">speaking to people&#39;s de mons to come in</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.540" end="00:13:32.070" style="s2">and and would Jared Jaynes was it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.810" end="00:13:33.690" style="s2">mentioning to me it&#39;s like sorta like</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.070" end="00:13:36.300" style="s2">these digital campfires are just</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.690" end="00:13:38.730" style="s2">hang up right there kind of like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.300" end="00:13:42.210" style="s2">like proto game B or proto be whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.730" end="00:13:43.350" style="s2">gym rat calls right it feels like a good</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.210" end="00:13:46.500" style="s2">experiment it feels like the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.350" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">experiment to be doing right now oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.500" end="00:13:51.060" style="s2">definitely and it just it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:52.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s like the adjacent move this</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.060" end="00:13:53.940" style="s2">is something I kind of a model that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.680" end="00:13:55.470" style="s2">think about a lot which is like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.940" end="00:13:57.690" style="s2">the next step that creates a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.470" end="00:13:59.640" style="s2">optionality right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.690" end="00:14:01.530" style="s2">especially for you like you already had</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.640" end="00:14:03.300" style="s2">the infrastructure of the podcast and</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.710" end="00:15:19.980" style="s2">who are stepping into their leadership</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.450" end="00:15:22.530" style="s2">to create like worlds for people to come</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.689" end="00:15:56.060" style="s2">about I think I mentioned it before how</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.279" end="00:15:57.589" style="s2">you know I didn&#39;t know how to live my</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.060" end="00:16:01.069" style="s2">life and there&#39;s judgment associated</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.589" end="00:16:03.019" style="s2">with that and I thought just dis</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.069" end="00:16:04.279" style="s2">evaporated when I realized the insight</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.019" end="00:16:06.470" style="s2">where you know no one else knows I live</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.279" end="00:16:07.759" style="s2">my life either and I just saw I saw you</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.470" end="00:16:08.990" style="s2">just nodding your head just like it</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.990" end="00:16:14.660" style="s2">oh like I just kind of felt you in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.019" end="00:16:16.310" style="s2">moment I&#39;m feeling people like that into</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.660" end="00:16:18.920" style="s2">space - is this like you know I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.310" end="00:16:21.589" style="s2">maybe your your senses or our sensors</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.920" end="00:16:22.730" style="s2">are upgrading to adapt the zoom platform</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.589" end="00:16:25.100" style="s2">I don&#39;t know maybe there&#39;s some things</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.730" end="00:16:26.209" style="s2">going on there and then so like I</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.100" end="00:16:29.060" style="s2">already I already had a good feeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.209" end="00:16:30.740" style="s2">about you and then you meet up and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.060" end="00:16:33.170" style="s2">just inquired about your philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.740" end="00:16:35.240" style="s2">trajectory you just like look even this</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.170" end="00:16:36.649" style="s2">big paragraph over your books long as</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.240" end="00:16:40.779" style="s2">for his awesome let&#39;s let&#39;s connect</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.649" end="00:16:42.709" style="s2">write a good feeling and then I I</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.779" end="00:16:44.899" style="s2">mentioned to you this idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.709" end="00:16:46.790" style="s2">attempted in Toronto it didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.899" end="00:16:49.069" style="s2">fly and I was calling it philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.790" end="00:16:52.699" style="s2">speed-dating and then I told you the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.069" end="00:16:55.819" style="s2">basic idea about speed-dating mixed with</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.699" end="00:16:57.889" style="s2">inquiry and then we were spitballing</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.819" end="00:16:59.480" style="s2">back and forth and then the the the term</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.889" end="00:17:01.129" style="s2">Socratic speed-dating emerged I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.480" end="00:17:02.389" style="s2">your friend actually came up with it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.129" end="00:17:04.159" style="s2">then we came up with a really good</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.389" end="00:17:06.020" style="s2">format and then we launched the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.159" end="00:17:07.880" style="s2">session which was awesome and the second</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.020" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">session was yesterday I think was even</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.880" end="00:17:12.020" style="s2">better yeah yeah do you want to like</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:15.289" style="s2">fill in the gaps a little bit they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.020" end="00:17:16.730" style="s2">both about that meeting I missed well I</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.289" end="00:17:18.439" style="s2">think you&#39;ve got this the skeleton of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:20.089" style="s2">the story in terms of where we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.439" end="00:17:21.890" style="s2">have come together I think like the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.089" end="00:17:25.309" style="s2">that this is kind of fit into my larger</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.890" end="00:17:27.620" style="s2">kind of like narrative or whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.309" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">that in general I&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.620" end="00:17:33.169" style="s2">gravitated towards this idea of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:34.490" style="s2">and in that week that we were contacted</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.169" end="00:17:37.070" style="s2">that you contacted me and we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.490" end="00:17:39.309" style="s2">talking about this I had multiple things</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.070" end="00:17:43.000" style="s2">happen that were centered around</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.309" end="00:17:46.340" style="s2">questions and the practice of inquiry as</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.000" end="00:17:48.020" style="s2">the next step at least for me in terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.340" end="00:17:49.880" style="s2">of the skill set that I need to develop</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.020" end="00:17:51.500" style="s2">least that&#39;s what it felt like</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.880" end="00:17:54.020" style="s2">all of these synchronicities were</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.500" end="00:17:56.450" style="s2">telling me I had already kind of come up</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.020" end="00:17:58.280" style="s2">with this idea for for my seminar which</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.450" end="00:18:00.460" style="s2">was a question a question based seminar</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.280" end="00:18:05.890" style="s2">so we would propose a question</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.460" end="00:18:07.780" style="s2">people would come with their like idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.890" end="00:18:09.400" style="s2">in response to the question and we would</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.780" end="00:18:10.780" style="s2">discuss it and so that was something I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.400" end="00:18:13.750" style="s2">was already kind of working on and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.780" end="00:18:15.790" style="s2">um I&#39;m doing a leadership course with</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.750" end="00:18:18.930" style="s2">lamb nation right now the Alwyn</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.790" end="00:18:21.880" style="s2">Leadership Academy and that our weekly</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.930" end="00:18:23.830" style="s2">modules was about inquiry and then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.880" end="00:18:25.210" style="s2">came to me with Socratic speed-dating</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.830" end="00:18:27.780" style="s2">and there&#39;s just like all of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.210" end="00:18:30.670" style="s2">things centered around this practice of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.780" end="00:18:33.160" style="s2">questioning and I think it it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.670" end="00:18:35.260" style="s2">timely so timely because when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.160" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">facing uncertainty and just like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.260" end="00:18:40.210" style="s2">scale of uncertainty right now is just</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:41.500" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really hard to fathom like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.210" end="00:18:45.160" style="s2">can really only engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.500" end="00:18:47.410" style="s2">abstraction of uncertainty because like</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.160" end="00:18:49.540" style="s2">the time horizon the consequential gap</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.410" end="00:18:51.250" style="s2">right that Peter Wang was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.540" end="00:18:53.530" style="s2">and that&#39;s even just thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.250" end="00:18:55.450" style="s2">coronavirus right like and we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.530" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">into the summer time where we know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.450" end="00:19:01.420" style="s2">there are more climate cataclysms that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:03.730" style="s2">are likely to happen all of these other</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.420" end="00:19:05.590" style="s2">things that are creating fragility and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.730" end="00:19:09.970" style="s2">that are like pressing on the fragility</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.590" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">of our pre-existing systems or kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.970" end="00:19:13.000" style="s2">on the precipice we don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:15.220" style="s2">gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.000" end="00:19:17.230" style="s2">so returning to the Socratic rites</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.220" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">returning to the question for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.230" end="00:19:23.140" style="s2">inquiry I think it&#39;s just such a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:25.750" style="s2">beautiful thing to feel an affinity with</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.140" end="00:19:28.540" style="s2">right now and the fact that that could</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.750" end="00:19:32.380" style="s2">be a space that we are that we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.540" end="00:19:35.260" style="s2">of bringing was this very very timely</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.380" end="00:19:39.070" style="s2">for me and felt very in line with these</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.260" end="00:19:41.500" style="s2">other properties of my life right now so</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.070" end="00:19:43.000" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of my background like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.500" end="00:19:45.570" style="s2">meaning of this the meaning making of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.000" end="00:19:49.390" style="s2">this work for me as a as a facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.570" end="00:19:51.910" style="s2">yeah I like that it&#39;s almost like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.390" end="00:19:54.010" style="s2">um it goes with the speed dating frame</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.910" end="00:19:57.690" style="s2">but it&#39;s like an intimacy has to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.010" end="00:20:00.430" style="s2">developed with act of asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.690" end="00:20:01.900" style="s2">you know like individual intimacy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.430" end="00:20:05.050" style="s2">then kind of like a collective intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.900" end="00:20:07.480" style="s2">like asking the right questions you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.050" end="00:20:11.620" style="s2">in this moment and some of the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.480" end="00:20:13.480" style="s2">questions are about not knowing what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.620" end="00:20:15.230" style="s2">hell is going on and trying to find out</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.480" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.230" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">and so yeah I really like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">like how how you structured the last one</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:23.260" style="s2">how you&#39;re sort of like playing with</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:25.250" style="s2">different levels and then you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.260" end="00:20:27.049" style="s2">wasn&#39;t gonna get three different levels</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.250" end="00:20:30.200" style="s2">of types of questions like one that get</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.049" end="00:20:31.669" style="s2">to the head heart gut yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.200" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">yeah yeah cuz I was I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.669" end="00:20:38.120" style="s2">that I&#39;m very intellectual right so when</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:39.770" style="s2">I am engaging in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.120" end="00:20:42.980" style="s2">people like one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.770" end="00:20:45.320" style="s2">feel the most intimacy is being asking</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.980" end="00:20:46.279" style="s2">like a intellectual question like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.320" end="00:20:48.409" style="s2">know what do you what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.279" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">like the search for extraterrestrial</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.409" end="00:20:54.919" style="s2">life or what about the biosemiotics like</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:58.070" style="s2">what it what kind of meaning making can</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.919" end="00:20:59.929" style="s2">we create from the from the codes from</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.070" end="00:21:01.820" style="s2">genetic code from the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.929" end="00:21:04.220" style="s2">these like replicators in our bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.820" end="00:21:05.960" style="s2">we have all of these potential symbols</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.220" end="00:21:07.549" style="s2">in our natural environment that can</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.960" end="00:21:09.799" style="s2">bring us a sense of beauty and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.549" end="00:21:11.659" style="s2">right so you know for me I was like I</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.799" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have a question that gets</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.659" end="00:21:17.779" style="s2">at the mind so I was like okay well have</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:19.940" style="s2">a mind question and I think for this</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.779" end="00:21:22.460" style="s2">psychotic dating I had a question about</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.940" end="00:21:24.380" style="s2">the future of intelligence so thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.460" end="00:21:28.309" style="s2">about kind of AI like how is</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.380" end="00:21:30.049" style="s2">intelligence as a property of biological</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.309" end="00:21:32.090" style="s2">existence as life existence and our kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.049" end="00:21:34.549" style="s2">of affinity for creating this</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.090" end="00:21:38.390" style="s2">replication of intelligence in machines</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.549" end="00:21:41.029" style="s2">in in matter that is non-biological</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.390" end="00:21:42.620" style="s2">where is that going to go right so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.029" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">was my question for that and then I had</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.620" end="00:21:46.730" style="s2">you know a hard question and then I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.169" style="s2">thinking about a soul question which for</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.730" end="00:21:50.539" style="s2">me a so a question is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.169" end="00:21:53.270" style="s2">encompasses both things right it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.539" end="00:21:55.789" style="s2">what like and even you can even see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.270" end="00:21:58.340" style="s2">AI question you could turn that to</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.789" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">becomes somewhat of a soul question what</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.340" end="00:22:02.929" style="s2">does that mean for the human species</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:08.230" style="s2">what does that mean for how we make</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.929" end="00:22:11.779" style="s2">meaning as sentient beings knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.230" end="00:22:15.710" style="s2">the future may hold this new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.779" end="00:22:17.000" style="s2">sentience so that&#39;s kind of like the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.710" end="00:22:20.149" style="s2">model that I&#39;m working with right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.000" end="00:22:23.059" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s really good I like that a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.149" end="00:22:25.220" style="s2">lot and what came to mind there is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.059" end="00:22:27.080" style="s2">like you know people who are quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.220" end="00:22:27.530" style="s2">intellectual and investor like you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.080" end="00:22:31.490" style="s2">Sam</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.530" end="00:22:33.580" style="s2">that they play in that sometimes could</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.490" end="00:22:36.380" style="s2">be the best way to get to their heart</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.580" end="00:22:38.570" style="s2">exactly connection you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.380" end="00:22:40.700" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the entry point mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.570" end="00:22:42.050" style="s2">and then I remember you were talking and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.700" end="00:22:43.460" style="s2">then you said you know some of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.050" end="00:22:46.370" style="s2">spiritual communities don&#39;t resonate</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.460" end="00:22:47.750" style="s2">with you and I know a lot of people kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.370" end="00:22:49.010" style="s2">of a critical and circling and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.750" end="00:22:50.420" style="s2">like that because they get bored and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.010" end="00:22:54.740" style="s2">they go here come on let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.420" end="00:22:56.510" style="s2">something real here yeah people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.740" end="00:22:58.310" style="s2">sensitive to the spiritual bypass I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.510" end="00:22:59.690" style="s2">think you know and it really depends on</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.310" end="00:23:01.550" style="s2">where you are and I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.690" end="00:23:05.000" style="s2">once again like having a having a more</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.550" end="00:23:07.220" style="s2">complex model of people as falling into</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.000" end="00:23:09.470" style="s2">kind of different positions but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.220" end="00:23:11.300" style="s2">you&#39;re using Keegan scale or some other</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.470" end="00:23:13.310" style="s2">kind of like more amorphous model I</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.300" end="00:23:15.710" style="s2">don&#39;t I&#39;m not really like wedded to any</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.310" end="00:23:17.210" style="s2">model in particular but people at</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.710" end="00:23:19.130" style="s2">different places in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.210" end="00:23:21.020" style="s2">adjacent moves and for some people like</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.130" end="00:23:23.870" style="s2">circling is exactly the thing that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.020" end="00:23:26.020" style="s2">need to create more possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.870" end="00:23:29.060" style="s2">engaging with maybe some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.020" end="00:23:30.860" style="s2">intellectual or technical questions that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.060" end="00:23:33.580" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to face when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.860" end="00:23:36.200" style="s2">creating a regenerative future and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.580" end="00:23:38.810" style="s2">everybody&#39;s got to know like where are</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.200" end="00:23:40.040" style="s2">they coming from and I think the you</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.810" end="00:23:42.410" style="s2">know the thing that Jordan Hall talks</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.040" end="00:23:44.570" style="s2">about with developing sovereignty like</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.410" end="00:23:46.780" style="s2">sovereignty is really the center of all</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.570" end="00:23:49.850" style="s2">of this like it&#39;s a creation of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.780" end="00:23:53.060" style="s2">communities that are most of sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.850" end="00:23:55.400" style="s2">individuals you know and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.060" end="00:23:57.680" style="s2">challenge for all of us to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.400" end="00:24:01.490" style="s2">that sovereignty and to have this kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.680" end="00:24:04.090" style="s2">of like meta awareness of our ways of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.490" end="00:24:06.200" style="s2">being and you have to create all of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.090" end="00:24:08.750" style="s2">architecture in your mind through</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.200" end="00:24:10.580" style="s2">practice right the practice so you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.750" end="00:24:12.560" style="s2">you just kind of have to like see people</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.580" end="00:24:14.990" style="s2">where they are in their own possession</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.560" end="00:24:17.980" style="s2">of their own world and not approach it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.990" end="00:24:20.510" style="s2">as if you know what&#39;s best for them and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.980" end="00:24:22.160" style="s2">then be the bridge right so they need a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.510" end="00:24:23.960" style="s2">bridge to two people who have moved</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.160" end="00:24:27.470" style="s2">through circling and and I think about</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.960" end="00:24:29.750" style="s2">this in terms of like post post in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.470" end="00:24:32.120" style="s2">sense of integrating right integrating</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.750" end="00:24:34.940" style="s2">the knowledge and moving on to a new</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.120" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">edge and beginning to engage with new</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.940" end="00:24:39.980" style="s2">types of practices right right right</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:43.340" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.980" end="00:24:46.850" style="s2">with get my guess is that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.340" end="00:24:55.789" style="s2">intellectual circles you run in there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.850" end="00:24:59.870" style="s2">more men oh good guess I&#39;ve been running</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.789" end="00:25:03.549" style="s2">way more women yeah you bring the girls</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.870" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">to the yard in this psychotic days</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.549" end="00:25:10.159" style="s2">that&#39;s exciting for me I like that so</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:13.220" style="s2">the yeah that was kind of like I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.159" end="00:25:15.139" style="s2">to question about that because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.220" end="00:25:17.179" style="s2">the ratio on the store right now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.139" end="00:25:20.330" style="s2">more men than women and same thing could</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.179" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">be just a stoic attractor right and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.330" end="00:25:23.659" style="s2">I think that&#39;s gonna change cuz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:25.190" style="s2">inviting you know putting to roil</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.659" end="00:25:26.840" style="s2">yourself and I want to have more we</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.190" end="00:25:29.029" style="s2">space kinda interest objective kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.840" end="00:25:31.460" style="s2">experiences and that was actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.029" end="00:25:33.260" style="s2">the reasons why I came in this this</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.460" end="00:25:38.289" style="s2">conversation angry because someone I</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.260" end="00:25:42.049" style="s2">think in in a way that I didn&#39;t feel was</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.289" end="00:25:44.539" style="s2">let&#39;s say authentic criticized and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.049" end="00:25:47.870" style="s2">judged the ratio imbalance right now at</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.539" end="00:25:50.870" style="s2">the stoah industry kind of like a judgy</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.870" end="00:25:52.519" style="s2">way and it even inquired my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.870" end="00:25:54.529" style="s2">about it or kind of like question about</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.519" end="00:25:56.919" style="s2">like what I&#39;m doing to kind of richer</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.529" end="00:25:59.539" style="s2">address that or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.919" end="00:26:00.590" style="s2">so imagine that&#39;s gonna come up</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.539" end="00:26:03.769" style="s2">specially in a kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.590" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">spaces and for myself as someone as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.769" end="00:26:09.019" style="s2">know I was philosophy when the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:11.389" style="s2">university decoded by ideas very</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.019" end="00:26:13.789" style="s2">top-heavy and there&#39;s a I know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.389" end="00:26:15.889" style="s2">men are very intellectual men are very</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.789" end="00:26:17.960" style="s2">what I would call disembodied you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.889" end="00:26:19.730" style="s2">they don&#39;t have access of the heart they</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.960" end="00:26:22.820" style="s2">just have kind of like their their ideas</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.730" end="00:26:26.630" style="s2">in that idea space and I do sense a ego</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.820" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">associated with ideas and this is why I</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.630" end="00:26:29.690" style="s2">like engaging a circling these type of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:31.340" style="s2">practices because it kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.690" end="00:26:35.779" style="s2">ground your heart in your mind together</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.340" end="00:26:38.779" style="s2">right yes and you seem pretty good in</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.779" end="00:26:40.340" style="s2">both those areas so I guess the inquire</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.779" end="00:26:43.370" style="s2">there is what is your experience working</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.340" end="00:26:44.990" style="s2">if not working with thinking or lack of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.370" end="00:26:49.580" style="s2">feeling with a bunch of men in these</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.990" end="00:26:52.010" style="s2">intellectual spaces yeah it&#39;s such a no</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.580" end="00:26:53.420" style="s2">like I am so curious about this myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.010" end="00:26:56.570" style="s2">and I&#39;m the agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.420" end="00:26:59.060" style="s2">to the the kind of prescriptions that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.570" end="00:27:00.620" style="s2">people have it in terms of like our</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.210" end="00:27:06.890" style="s2">may be and I think that often it goes</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.270" end="00:27:08.630" style="s2">kind of unexamined as to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.890" end="00:27:09.800" style="s2">assumptions they&#39;re making about like</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.630" end="00:27:10.970" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying like what are some</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.140" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">kind of increasing the diversity of the</p>

<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:27.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know why I am the way that I am I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.680" end="00:27:30.140" style="s2">don&#39;t mind being in a group of men who</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.800" end="00:27:33.590" style="s2">are all having a heady conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.140" end="00:27:35.540" style="s2">can take a hang and I enjoy it like to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.590" end="00:27:38.630" style="s2">me that&#39;s a that is a domain where I</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:46.460" style="s2">and there&#39;s really not much of of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.740" end="00:27:49.130" style="s2">attention for me and I do think that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.460" end="00:27:51.530" style="s2">bring a different kind of quality you</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.130" end="00:27:53.330" style="s2">were talking about the lease pace out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.530" end="00:27:55.700" style="s2">why I like Rogoff to even start my own</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.330" end="00:27:59.030" style="s2">seminar was I had my own intentions in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.700" end="00:28:01.820" style="s2">terms of the kind of kind of space I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.030" end="00:28:03.110" style="s2">wanted to create through philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.820" end="00:28:04.100" style="s2">discourse that was different like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.110" end="00:28:06.380" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to get into these like</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.100" end="00:28:08.930" style="s2">argument Eddie&#39;s right like this like</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.380" end="00:28:12.200" style="s2">sounds like really a superficial level</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.930" end="00:28:14.900" style="s2">of argumentation that I found was</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.200" end="00:28:17.480" style="s2">happening in some of the more like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.900" end="00:28:19.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t even like all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.480" end="00:28:20.570" style="s2">male dominated spaces they were male</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.010" end="00:28:22.760" style="s2">dominated but like it was a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.570" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">of culture that had been cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.760" end="00:28:28.430" style="s2">there where people with with that kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:30.170" style="s2">of disagreeableness would just get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.430" end="00:28:33.080" style="s2">on some point and would be able to we</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.170" end="00:28:34.430" style="s2">were missing the spirit of the text they</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.080" end="00:28:36.740" style="s2">were missing the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.430" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">conversation and then we would all have</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.740" end="00:28:42.230" style="s2">to sit there and the rest of the seminar</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">all held up by these particular people</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.230" end="00:28:47.660" style="s2">who had to have their disagreeable</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:51.010" style="s2">intellectual conversation I think many</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.660" end="00:28:53.240" style="s2">of us have experienced that before and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.010" end="00:28:55.820" style="s2">so I think I had kind of a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.240" end="00:28:57.990" style="s2">culture that I wanted to cultivate much</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.820" end="00:29:01.240" style="s2">more about</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.990" end="00:29:03.220" style="s2">creating that weave space and I really</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.240" end="00:29:04.990" style="s2">want to get into high-level disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.220" end="00:29:06.400" style="s2">I like disagreement you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.990" end="00:29:07.720" style="s2">disagreement is extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.400" end="00:29:09.610" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.720" end="00:29:13.270" style="s2">ideas because there are competing models</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.610" end="00:29:14.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of models that share a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.270" end="00:29:17.500" style="s2">of underlying structure but they</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.860" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">illuminate different edges and they live</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.500" end="00:29:23.650" style="s2">their limited in different kinds of ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">and to get to that edge is difficult</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.650" end="00:29:27.250" style="s2">with with a group of people and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:29.290" style="s2">that that&#39;s why I&#39;ve gravitated so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.250" end="00:29:29.920" style="s2">towards this conversation of collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.290" end="00:29:32.770" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.920" end="00:29:34.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve been following Bonita Roy from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.770" end="00:29:37.090" style="s2">first time that I was exposed to her</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.360" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">with such excitement because of the work</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.090" end="00:29:41.770" style="s2">that she&#39;s doing to I think get people</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:43.420" style="s2">into these edges and even just like</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.770" end="00:29:45.400" style="s2">listening to her have conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.420" end="00:29:48.760" style="s2">Jim Wright for example where they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.400" end="00:29:52.180" style="s2">they don&#39;t agree on many things and yet</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.760" end="00:29:54.370" style="s2">they&#39;re able to get to the juicy parts</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.180" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">of their disagreement in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.370" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">and there&#39;s so much to be learned from</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">that because and I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:07.630" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s the one attractor that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:09.730" style="s2">like we disagree these ideologies are</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.630" end="00:30:12.030" style="s2">not compatible and there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.730" end="00:30:14.140" style="s2">find common ground and then there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.030" end="00:30:17.700" style="s2">everything&#39;s the same everything is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.140" end="00:30:20.590" style="s2">valid you know everything&#39;s subjective</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.700" end="00:30:22.060" style="s2">attractor as well and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.590" end="00:30:24.220" style="s2">either one of those are a very good</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.060" end="00:30:26.170" style="s2">option for the kind of uncertainty that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.220" end="00:30:28.690" style="s2">we&#39;re tackling right now you know you</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.170" end="00:30:31.180" style="s2">have to be ideologically agnostic right</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.690" end="00:30:34.360" style="s2">and you have to be seeking where your</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.180" end="00:30:37.780" style="s2">where your models are failing and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.360" end="00:30:39.640" style="s2">requires a kind of disagreeableness you</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.780" end="00:30:41.230" style="s2">know a willingness to say hey like</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.640" end="00:30:43.180" style="s2">actually I think maybe the model that</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.230" end="00:30:45.850" style="s2">you have isn&#39;t isn&#39;t encompassing this</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.180" end="00:30:48.090" style="s2">set of phenomenon this set of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.850" end="00:30:51.280" style="s2">observations isn&#39;t explained by this</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.090" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">idea how can we get into that space and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.280" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">what&#39;s maybe another model that we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:58.360" style="s2">use that make sense of these particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:31:00.220" style="s2">observations and I don&#39;t know that kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.360" end="00:31:02.110" style="s2">of high-level disagreement is is very</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.220" end="00:31:04.090" style="s2">hard to cultivate it takes time it takes</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.110" end="00:31:07.420" style="s2">like a group of people who are working</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.090" end="00:31:10.360" style="s2">on their sovereignty right in order to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.420" end="00:31:11.350" style="s2">open a conversation about let&#39;s say like</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.360" end="00:31:13.150" style="s2">okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.350" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">research question is like why do we see</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.150" end="00:31:18.039" style="s2">this like demographic asymmetry in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:20.350" style="s2">Shoah why do we see more men than women</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.039" end="00:31:22.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a question as an open question</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.350" end="00:31:25.450" style="s2">and we could create many different</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.260" end="00:31:27.309" style="s2">hypotheses to answer that question and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.450" end="00:31:29.530" style="s2">then predictions how would we test those</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.309" end="00:31:32.650" style="s2">hypotheses right what would we look for</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.530" end="00:31:36.309" style="s2">to figure out if we&#39;re on the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.650" end="00:31:38.440" style="s2">track right and that kind of process</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.309" end="00:31:41.080" style="s2">bringing that into the collective space</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.440" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">is certainly a kind of like it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.080" end="00:31:48.490" style="s2">a dance it&#39;s a it&#39;s an art form yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:50.890" style="s2">there&#39;s so much richness right there so</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.490" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">if I&#39;ll just tell you what what came up</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.890" end="00:31:58.270" style="s2">and then we can jam off that so my sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:32:03.789" style="s2">is this is the the correct order in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.270" end="00:32:06.299" style="s2">state is to first build good faith the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.789" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">capacity for good faith relationships</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.299" end="00:32:10.210" style="s2">step one and all that kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:13.179" style="s2">authentic relating practices you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.210" end="00:32:16.870" style="s2">gesture towards that then step two is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.179" end="00:32:19.630" style="s2">then speak your truth with with with</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.870" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">passion right but there could even be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.630" end="00:32:23.169" style="s2">middle step they&#39;re worth like having</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.000" style="s2">the capacity to be a performative</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.169" end="00:32:27.789" style="s2">agnostic like so you can kind of model</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.000" end="00:32:34.780" style="s2">different viewpoints and speak on their</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.789" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">behalf yes yes and then I do think you</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.780" end="00:32:37.809" style="s2">need to be able to get flitter between</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:39.370" style="s2">to like the economic thing but still</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.809" end="00:32:42.360" style="s2">speak your truth with some fucking</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.370" end="00:32:46.809" style="s2">thumos right and not be shy about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.360" end="00:32:51.130" style="s2">mhm and what I like about this digital</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.809" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">campfire idea is that it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.130" end="00:32:56.260" style="s2">really good for step one right let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:57.970" style="s2">gather everyone and keep them warm</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.260" end="00:33:04.090" style="s2">around the fire and so they build trust</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.970" end="00:33:06.190" style="s2">there and then we were thinking at both</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.090" end="00:33:08.409" style="s2">end eyes Jason and Jared were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.190" end="00:33:10.419" style="s2">of having a mediation mediation campfire</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.409" end="00:33:11.770" style="s2">sessions we&#39;re like the three of us just</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.419" end="00:33:13.929" style="s2">riff on like who would be good to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.770" end="00:33:15.610" style="s2">conversations and then we open up to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.929" end="00:33:18.700" style="s2">group for the like the remainder forty</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.610" end="00:33:19.990" style="s2">minutes so we can kind of source the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.700" end="00:33:21.190" style="s2">collective intelligence of how to like</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.990" end="00:33:22.690" style="s2">make it happen they all should be</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.190" end="00:33:24.730" style="s2">invited to a database we found through a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.690" end="00:33:26.500" style="s2">letter wiki exchange whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.730" end="00:33:28.780" style="s2">because like you said all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.500" end="00:33:31.090" style="s2">perspectives are so important to have in</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.780" end="00:33:32.530" style="s2">the mix and it can will work you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.090" end="00:33:33.730" style="s2">like no one&#39;s smart enough to be hundred</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.530" end="00:33:35.350" style="s2">percent wrong so there&#39;s always a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.730" end="00:33:36.730" style="s2">even like the most radical person</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.350" end="00:33:38.290" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of truth there and if</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.730" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">you can invite them around the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.290" end="00:33:42.460" style="s2">make them feel safe and make other</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:44.380" style="s2">people feel safe around them and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.460" end="00:33:48.340" style="s2">build a relationship then these juicy</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.380" end="00:33:49.600" style="s2">conversations could emerge and have some</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.340" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">follow-up questions but I want to see if</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:54.910" style="s2">anything came up for you oh yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:58.390" style="s2">definitely I I think the thing I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.910" end="00:33:59.980" style="s2">like excited is that there&#39;s this um I</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.390" end="00:34:01.150" style="s2">don&#39;t know and I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.980" end="00:34:04.030" style="s2">actually comes up when when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.150" end="00:34:05.620" style="s2">dancing right so there&#39;s this embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.030" end="00:34:07.540" style="s2">of all of these different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.620" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">qualities and characters and beings and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.540" end="00:34:14.020" style="s2">expressions and it&#39;s it&#39;s you can become</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:17.710" style="s2">sumos through dance right so like I can</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.020" end="00:34:20.470" style="s2">model I can perform I can kind of put my</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.710" end="00:34:23.230" style="s2">extend myself my being into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.470" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">expression of acceleration zone for</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.230" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">example I can extend my being into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:33.790" style="s2">game be perspective right I can extend</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:36.369" style="s2">my being into a model proposed by a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.790" end="00:34:38.379" style="s2">scene to life right so and I think when</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.369" end="00:34:40.149" style="s2">we come into conversation we can even do</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.379" end="00:34:41.859" style="s2">that with our own ideas we can even do</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.149" end="00:34:43.929" style="s2">that with our own ideas which we feel so</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.859" end="00:34:45.730" style="s2">personally attached to right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.929" end="00:34:48.129" style="s2">that this is the kind of a move of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.730" end="00:34:50.710" style="s2">decoupling right like that you that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.129" end="00:34:54.100" style="s2">you&#39;re being is not the same as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.710" end="00:34:58.930" style="s2">ideas right like you can create an idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.100" end="00:35:00.910" style="s2">and have it kind of lift off you and be</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.930" end="00:35:04.030" style="s2">something that is allowed to move into</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.910" end="00:35:07.480" style="s2">the space and if somebody challenges it</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.030" end="00:35:11.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t come back into you as this</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.480" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">like internalization of harm and that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.320" end="00:35:16.150" style="s2">it that is a tricky thing right you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:18.790" style="s2">to have the sovereignty in order to not</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.150" end="00:35:21.310" style="s2">see yourself attached to the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.790" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re birthing it maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.310" end="00:35:27.700" style="s2">like creating and can have so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:30.130" style="s2">personal attachment boom and I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.700" end="00:35:33.220" style="s2">me it&#39;s taken it&#39;s taken years it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.130" end="00:35:37.300" style="s2">taken years in order to develop ability</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.220" end="00:35:38.380" style="s2">and once I kind of went over the ridge</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.300" end="00:35:40.090" style="s2">line with</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.380" end="00:35:41.890" style="s2">and went over the ridge line into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.090" end="00:35:44.470" style="s2">into the attractor space where if</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.890" end="00:35:47.740" style="s2">somebody attacked my idea like in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.470" end="00:35:49.720" style="s2">seminar I just immediately slumped into</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.740" end="00:35:52.210" style="s2">this isn&#39;t personal rather than what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.720" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">used to slump into which was oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.210" end="00:35:57.310" style="s2">a personal attack and so once I made</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:59.860" style="s2">that move I was like oh my god Wow now I</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.310" end="00:36:02.980" style="s2">can engage in this intellectual space</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.860" end="00:36:05.590" style="s2">with so much freedom and so much</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.980" end="00:36:08.590" style="s2">willingness to take risks because I</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.590" end="00:36:10.690" style="s2">don&#39;t feel Interlake this internal</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.590" end="00:36:14.400" style="s2">conflict when somebody confronts me</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.690" end="00:36:20.170" style="s2">about an idea that I have you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.400" end="00:36:22.510" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m kind of struck how like how on</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.170" end="00:36:25.240" style="s2">the same page we are you know about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.510" end="00:36:27.240" style="s2">like we we just kind of like met each</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.240" end="00:36:31.750" style="s2">other I think like a two weeks ago - yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.240" end="00:36:36.250" style="s2">like I&#39;m like whoa yeah that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.750" end="00:36:38.920" style="s2">really cool and it&#39;s like you know how</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.250" end="00:36:41.350" style="s2">you you I word it like I stumbled my way</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.920" end="00:36:43.090" style="s2">towards this capacity right through all</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.350" end="00:36:44.890" style="s2">these kind of like not consciously just</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.090" end="00:36:46.030" style="s2">following my haphazardly following my</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.890" end="00:36:47.890" style="s2">dame on and then just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.030" end="00:36:50.830" style="s2">having the ability to do this now like</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.890" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">feed I perform at agnostic and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.830" end="00:36:54.220" style="s2">like you had a similar thing where you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:56.290" style="s2">just kind of stumbled your way to it now</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.220" end="00:36:58.780" style="s2">with the stoah I want to see if an</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.290" end="00:37:00.340" style="s2">ecology of practices can emerge</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.780" end="00:37:02.440" style="s2">organically from the collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.340" end="00:37:07.060" style="s2">intelligence in order to build this</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.440" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">capacity you know like soon for fur for</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.060" end="00:37:13.150" style="s2">many people because I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">needed right now totally honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.150" end="00:37:18.730" style="s2">think that a lot of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:21.310" style="s2">frameworks that you&#39;ve created are</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.730" end="00:37:23.050" style="s2">fostering that kind of thing I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.310" end="00:37:26.200" style="s2">fact that Socratic speed-dating is</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.050" end="00:37:28.260" style="s2">centered around questions and also the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.200" end="00:37:31.180" style="s2">fact that as you move through different</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.260" end="00:37:34.060" style="s2">phases in the event it goes from a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.180" end="00:37:35.770" style="s2">question that is really open like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.060" end="00:37:37.540" style="s2">really do like the one to just open up</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.770" end="00:37:40.210" style="s2">the the kind of fix the ceremonial</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.540" end="00:37:43.090" style="s2">opening is what&#39;s the most life or you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.210" end="00:37:44.830" style="s2">that really brings in the person and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.090" end="00:37:48.340" style="s2">like kind of commits them to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.830" end="00:37:52.300" style="s2">excitement of engaging with the fire of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.340" end="00:37:54.670" style="s2">others and then as it moves through more</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.300" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">sovereignty is like placed on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.670" end="00:37:57.960" style="s2">participants right so by at the end</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:38:00.100" style="s2">they&#39;re generating our own questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.960" end="00:38:02.440" style="s2">they&#39;re leaning into their own curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.100" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">and developing that practice and also</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.440" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">testing right so you create a quest one</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:08.050" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially kind of like oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:09.910" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to create an experience for</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.050" end="00:38:11.980" style="s2">this other person where I can connect</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.910" end="00:38:14.850" style="s2">and engage with them here&#39;s my question</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.980" end="00:38:18.070" style="s2">this is my theory about what will work</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.850" end="00:38:21.220" style="s2">you got four minutes to test it and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.070" end="00:38:23.980" style="s2">get to see how did it go immediately and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.220" end="00:38:25.900" style="s2">then the other person and this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.980" end="00:38:27.580" style="s2">amazing about like the the twofold</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.900" end="00:38:27.970" style="s2">question like how you can have one</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.580" end="00:38:29.560" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.970" end="00:38:31.420" style="s2">in one question and surprise and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.560" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">another person asking questions and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.420" end="00:38:36.700" style="s2">a surprise you get to see both you get</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:38.740" style="s2">to test both sides and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.700" end="00:38:43.150" style="s2">that&#39;s an amazing kind of feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.740" end="00:38:46.030" style="s2">that provided by these smaller segments</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.150" end="00:38:47.830" style="s2">inside the larger segments of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.030" end="00:38:50.080" style="s2">Socratic speed-dating in general and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.830" end="00:38:51.640" style="s2">then also the situational assessments</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.080" end="00:38:55.390" style="s2">right like the way that your voice comes</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.640" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">forward is through a question and like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.390" end="00:39:01.540" style="s2">the discernment that you use to select</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">the question also kind of creates a an</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.540" end="00:39:05.950" style="s2">awareness for others and you&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:08.260" style="s2">to write like which questions bring</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.950" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">forth like the most energy and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.260" end="00:39:11.710" style="s2">excitement from the person who is</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:13.210" style="s2">answering them right so there&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.710" end="00:39:16.359" style="s2">this learning around questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.210" end="00:39:19.770" style="s2">themselves and if people can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.359" end="00:39:22.270" style="s2">bring that to the fore as an element of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.770" end="00:39:24.820" style="s2">reflection that kind of meta awareness</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.270" end="00:39:26.619" style="s2">to all of these different events that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.820" end="00:39:29.050" style="s2">you&#39;re doing I think that they can even</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.619" end="00:39:31.090" style="s2">just begin to learn this through direct</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.050" end="00:39:33.130" style="s2">experience which is how I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.090" end="00:39:34.930" style="s2">learning right now I am just literally</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.130" end="00:39:39.990" style="s2">learning through direct experience I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.930" end="00:39:42.970" style="s2">up with an idea send out there I try and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.990" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">just let&#39;s say that something happens I</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.970" end="00:39:47.740" style="s2">integrate the information and then I</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:49.720" style="s2">come up with a new idea right and I see</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.740" end="00:39:52.089" style="s2">you doing the same thing which is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.720" end="00:39:54.220" style="s2">why I think there&#39;s so much synergy</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.089" end="00:39:55.480" style="s2">between the two of us now and and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.220" end="00:39:56.619" style="s2">also saying what Collins do you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.480" end="00:40:01.020" style="s2">these other folks are doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.619" end="00:40:07.510" style="s2">we&#39;re playing yes yes yeah that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.020" end="00:40:10.839" style="s2">well put we&#39;re playing which is games</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.510" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">right infinite player is just playing</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.839" end="00:40:16.330" style="s2">and creating more options for other</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:19.060" style="s2">people to join in on the play yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.330" end="00:40:21.550" style="s2">this is really good and it does feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.060" end="00:40:23.080" style="s2">like play and things are generating from</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.550" end="00:40:25.630" style="s2">it it seems like it&#39;s benefiting others</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.080" end="00:40:28.060" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but you I&#39;m not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.630" end="00:40:30.820" style="s2">too much ahead of what&#39;s coming forth</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.060" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">I&#39;m just sort of like listening playing</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.820" end="00:40:33.550" style="s2">and then seeing what emerges and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:35.610" style="s2">playing with that and it&#39;s like they</p>

<p begin="00:41:19.510" end="00:41:25.120" style="s2">speedy anything could be repurposed for</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:26.260" style="s2">so many different kind of I guess like</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.120" end="00:41:29.590" style="s2">the levels that you mentioned to make it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.260" end="00:41:34.420" style="s2">sort of intellectual the heart the gut</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.590" end="00:41:35.530" style="s2">so maybe maybe yeah like and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.420" end="00:41:38.020" style="s2">kind of curious if we can workshop</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.530" end="00:41:40.120" style="s2">something to how about you give us a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.020" end="00:41:41.260" style="s2">rundown of what last session was like or</p>

<p begin="00:41:43.630" end="00:41:48.840" style="s2">we can talk about the good potential of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.610" end="00:41:48.840" style="s2">this thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.800" end="00:41:55.510" style="s2">yeah two things one thing that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.780" end="00:41:57.880" style="s2">say in response to your idea of coining</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.510" end="00:42:01.270" style="s2">things and making it sexy I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.880" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">actually really important so that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.270" end="00:42:05.980" style="s2">we could come back to that later</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:07.420" style="s2">and then second in terms of kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.980" end="00:42:09.330" style="s2">know I&#39;m integrating I&#39;m integrating</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.420" end="00:42:12.130" style="s2">feedback and we had a really good brief</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.330" end="00:42:14.440" style="s2">for for the next one and I&#39;m also really</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.130" end="00:42:19.330" style="s2">looking forward to see if anybody emails</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.440" end="00:42:20.440" style="s2">you some some feedback in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.330" end="00:42:22.870" style="s2">things went</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.440" end="00:42:25.330" style="s2">it is kind of strange to be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.870" end="00:42:27.900" style="s2">facilitator of this event because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.330" end="00:42:27.900" style="s2">alone</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.090" end="00:42:33.550" style="s2">I have no idea what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.220" end="00:42:36.190" style="s2">breakout rooms what I would I get in</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.550" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">terms of like feedback is smiling faces</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.190" end="00:42:41.470" style="s2">coming back to the main session which</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:43.770" style="s2">did happen and like what I said to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.470" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">in a debrief was that on the last one</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.770" end="00:42:49.930" style="s2">nobody came back early they waited until</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.200" end="00:42:52.030" style="s2">they were forced to come back the main</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.930" end="00:42:53.380" style="s2">room and that was a good signal to me</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.030" end="00:42:55.090" style="s2">that people were engaged with their</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.380" end="00:42:56.620" style="s2">conversation and they were invested in</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.090" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">it to the point where they were running</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.620" end="00:43:00.310" style="s2">all the very last minute to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:03.430" style="s2">say what they wanted to say with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.310" end="00:43:05.350" style="s2">person that they were paired with and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.430" end="00:43:07.300" style="s2">have to kind of seek those types of</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.350" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">signs right so this is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.300" end="00:43:10.990" style="s2">challenge of facilitating I think in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:14.020" style="s2">digital space especially with breakout</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.990" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">rooms where if this was a real room I</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.020" end="00:43:18.730" style="s2">would be feeling people&#39;s energy right I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.710" style="s2">would be feeling all of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.730" end="00:43:22.330" style="s2">excitement and elevation and I would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.710" end="00:43:24.340" style="s2">able to tell if there was one group that</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.330" end="00:43:26.590" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t really working for I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.340" end="00:43:27.730" style="s2">maybe be able to kind of intervene in</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.590" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">some way that we create a better</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.730" end="00:43:33.250" style="s2">experience for them but the way that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:35.860" style="s2">this medium works that isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.250" end="00:43:37.420" style="s2">possible which is also kind of exciting</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.860" end="00:43:40.690" style="s2">in a way right because it means that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.420" end="00:43:44.140" style="s2">have to give up some amount of control</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.690" end="00:43:45.880" style="s2">and those people who are in that space</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.140" end="00:43:49.630" style="s2">become the facilitators of their own</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.880" end="00:43:52.270" style="s2">experience and I have to trust I have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.630" end="00:43:54.550" style="s2">trust that they&#39;re able to provide a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.270" end="00:43:55.900" style="s2">good experience for themselves and for</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.550" end="00:43:59.320" style="s2">the other person that they&#39;re with right</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.900" end="00:44:02.470" style="s2">so I think that I&#39;m learning that kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.320" end="00:44:05.540" style="s2">of thing kind of just like like taking a</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.470" end="00:44:08.030" style="s2">breath and just being like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.540" end="00:44:09.650" style="s2">people are gonna have a fine time</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.030" end="00:44:12.980" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have probably a great time</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.650" end="00:44:14.420" style="s2">you know and and fine tuning and so like</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.980" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.420" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">go through the questions that came up in</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:20.390" style="s2">the chat you know I downloaded the chat</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:23.570" style="s2">box and kind of see what other people</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.390" end="00:44:27.700" style="s2">were bringing up and see if there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.570" end="00:44:29.960" style="s2">of trend in the questions or you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.700" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">some some kind of little pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.960" end="00:44:32.660" style="s2">feedback like that and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:35.210" style="s2">you have any like pieces of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.660" end="00:44:40.100" style="s2">that you feel like you&#39;re coming forth</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.210" end="00:44:42.110" style="s2">for you right now and yeah I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.100" end="00:44:42.890" style="s2">processing how I&#39;m going to deploy the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.110" end="00:44:46.460" style="s2">next one</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.890" end="00:44:48.410" style="s2">I am also kind of thinking about in</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.460" end="00:44:52.580" style="s2">terms of the model of the mind on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.410" end="00:44:54.050" style="s2">heart and the soul kind of thing could</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.580" end="00:44:56.660" style="s2">we just like could we compartmentalize</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.050" end="00:44:59.120" style="s2">one and like okay have maybe a session</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.660" end="00:45:00.200" style="s2">where there&#39;s more mind questions and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.120" end="00:45:01.820" style="s2">then maybe a session where they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.200" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">hard questions and then maybe a session</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.820" end="00:45:05.450" style="s2">where they&#39;re more like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:07.220" style="s2">synthesis of the two you know how can I</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.450" end="00:45:10.010" style="s2">like riff how can I be like a jazz</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.220" end="00:45:14.600" style="s2">musician of this form right and like</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.010" end="00:45:17.240" style="s2">kind of provide full experiments of kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.600" end="00:45:18.950" style="s2">of focusing on one form or the form that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.240" end="00:45:22.130" style="s2">we print practice at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.950" end="00:45:24.710" style="s2">this which is you you know invite the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.130" end="00:45:27.710" style="s2">other person to ask a question that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.710" end="00:45:28.850" style="s2">want to be asked right yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.710" end="00:45:31.210" style="s2">kind of all over the place but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.850" end="00:45:33.890" style="s2">where I am right now in terms of she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.210" end="00:45:35.900" style="s2">elevating my orientation towards the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.890" end="00:45:38.650" style="s2">next one yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.900" end="00:45:42.500" style="s2">and what one cheek question that came up</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.650" end="00:45:44.990" style="s2">last time I was actually with cavae and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.500" end="00:45:46.820" style="s2">I said what is the question that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.990" end="00:45:48.530" style="s2">want to be asked if I couldn&#39;t know was</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.820" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">asking right and then then that then he</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.530" end="00:45:52.750" style="s2">told me then we did it so that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:58.820" style="s2">could be one that we could we could use</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.750" end="00:46:00.950" style="s2">and yeah my sense is to develop iterate</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.820" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">until there&#39;s like a general one like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.950" end="00:46:07.730" style="s2">really clear English one it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">like the level one yes and then once</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.730" end="00:46:12.290" style="s2">that is like you know robust or anti</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:16.100" style="s2">fragile or whatever whatever it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.290" end="00:46:18.730" style="s2">be then others can emerge from it yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.100" end="00:46:21.070" style="s2">yeah yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.730" end="00:46:23.109" style="s2">and I&#39;m also you know I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.070" end="00:46:24.280" style="s2">how I can use this and I like some in</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.109" end="00:46:26.369" style="s2">our space which is like more</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.280" end="00:46:28.750" style="s2">intentionally intellectual right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.369" end="00:46:30.700" style="s2">we&#39;re you know and right now I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.750" end="00:46:33.339" style="s2">like scheming as to like what type of</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.700" end="00:46:35.950" style="s2">content I&#39;m going to be like kind of</p>

<p begin="00:48:24.930" end="00:48:28.660" style="s2">honestly I mean I think that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.920" end="00:48:30.700" style="s2">thing that becomes exciting about this</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.660" end="00:48:32.900" style="s2">is that people are investing their time</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.700" end="00:48:36.200" style="s2">in this people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.900" end="00:48:39.650" style="s2">gauging and opening themselves up to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.200" end="00:48:42.650" style="s2">others in this space and we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.650" end="00:48:45.500" style="s2">lift that Network you know into a</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.650" end="00:48:48.500" style="s2">different level of cohesion just through</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.500" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">facilitating these spaces and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.500" end="00:48:54.220" style="s2">like the kind of beauty of of just like</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:56.420" style="s2">facilitating a new general I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.220" end="00:48:57.980" style="s2">facilitating is this beautiful thing and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.420" end="00:49:01.010" style="s2">it&#39;s very different than teaching right</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.980" end="00:49:02.980" style="s2">teaching is like this kind of I have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.010" end="00:49:04.820" style="s2">smell it and I&#39;m like giving it to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.980" end="00:49:08.720" style="s2">facilitating is more like I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.820" end="00:49:09.290" style="s2">create this situation yes we&#39;ll see what</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.720" end="00:49:13.160" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.290" end="00:49:14.630" style="s2">and then get the feedback and then who</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.160" end="00:49:17.660" style="s2">knows what it&#39;s like after a month of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.630" end="00:49:20.030" style="s2">doing this like you said this new kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.660" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">of opportunity of like emerges because</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.030" end="00:49:25.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a new need right like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:26.630" style="s2">new kind of cohesion that&#39;s created</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.400" end="00:49:29.930" style="s2">throughout the group that could lift</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.630" end="00:49:33.230" style="s2">into a new potential realm of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.930" end="00:49:36.620" style="s2">cooperation and collaboration and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.230" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">co-creation so but I mean that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.620" end="00:49:42.350" style="s2">potential you know yeah it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:43.850" style="s2">stay I think right now particularly very</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.350" end="00:49:45.020" style="s2">immediate but it&#39;s a kind of bet that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.850" end="00:49:46.460" style="s2">you&#39;re making you&#39;re like and this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.020" end="00:49:48.260" style="s2">the this is the play of optionality</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.460" end="00:49:50.630" style="s2">right you make moves that create</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.260" end="00:49:52.850" style="s2">optionality then you&#39;re kind of betting</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.630" end="00:49:55.460" style="s2">on that you&#39;ll have new moves to make in</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.850" end="00:49:57.770" style="s2">the future that will bring more</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.460" end="00:50:01.220" style="s2">optionality and more potential relations</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.770" end="00:50:05.960" style="s2">great and on that do you have like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.220" end="00:50:06.890" style="s2">10 15 more minutes to riff on this I got</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.960" end="00:50:08.630" style="s2">the metagame</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:19.870" style="s2">thinking about this whole thing this</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.530" end="00:50:22.730" style="s2">project the gift idea too</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.870" end="00:50:24.080" style="s2">I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll be transparent like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.730" end="00:50:27.530" style="s2">of good shits coming out of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.080" end="00:50:29.690" style="s2">right and these type of events that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.530" end="00:50:33.830" style="s2">model itself and then there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.690" end="00:50:37.010" style="s2">noticing just always having to check my</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.830" end="00:50:38.540" style="s2">attachment to things so like Collin</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.010" end="00:50:41.390" style="s2">starting his own digital dance studio</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.540" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">and then like I&#39;m so happy for him but</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.390" end="00:50:46.040" style="s2">then it&#39;s like Oh am I gonna lose Collin</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.089" end="00:52:04.130" style="s2">exercise alone just creates connection</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.059" end="00:52:05.420" style="s2">between everyone and then what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:52:09.829" end="00:52:13.369" style="s2">reflect on the emotion of fear right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.539" end="00:52:14.779" style="s2">so everyone is feeling the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.369" end="00:52:16.430" style="s2">and feel connected with that that state</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.779" end="00:52:18.019" style="s2">and so we can do that with any emotion</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.430" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">really or any kind of state that we want</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.210" end="00:53:08.370" style="s2">because that&#39;s something that we often</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.950" end="00:53:10.620" style="s2">feel like inclined to hide right but</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.370" end="00:53:14.340" style="s2">like the things that we&#39;re sharing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.620" end="00:53:17.460" style="s2">worried will be be taken or be lost and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.340" end="00:53:19.890" style="s2">this is the challenge for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.460" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">right is you know when you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.890" end="00:53:26.430" style="s2">big picture it&#39;s like who cares who</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:28.440" style="s2">cares you know what I mean like people</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.430" end="00:53:30.210" style="s2">have been asking Socratic method is so</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.440" end="00:53:33.030" style="s2">old right like it&#39;s just like who owns</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.210" end="00:53:35.760" style="s2">these ideas anyways right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.030" end="00:53:37.830" style="s2">the other thing too is like a like Peter</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.760" end="00:53:39.000" style="s2">you know I oh my god a kind the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.830" end="00:53:40.650" style="s2">situation where I&#39;m like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.000" end="00:53:42.810" style="s2">collaborating this person and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.650" end="00:53:44.220" style="s2">you know what if they find something</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.810" end="00:53:46.290" style="s2">else that they want to do and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.220" end="00:53:48.390" style="s2">but this there&#39;s also the bond on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.290" end="00:53:50.640" style="s2">other side right like we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.390" end="00:53:51.990" style="s2">together and like and like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.640" end="00:53:54.660" style="s2">creating relationships and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.990" end="00:53:57.480" style="s2">mutual benefit a mutual benefit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.660" end="00:54:00.450" style="s2">being created and there&#39;s also just like</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.480" end="00:54:02.340" style="s2">the eye I mean personally I love working</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.450" end="00:54:04.620" style="s2">with people I love working on teams I</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.340" end="00:54:06.090" style="s2">love the fact that this is an organic</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.620" end="00:54:08.190" style="s2">process that we&#39;re all coming together</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.090" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">not because we&#39;re being paid oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.190" end="00:54:12.690" style="s2">I&#39;m like blown away by this like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:14.910" style="s2">level of coordination that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.690" end="00:54:18.420" style="s2">without any currency moving between us</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.910" end="00:54:20.550" style="s2">like usually when when complex kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.420" end="00:54:22.730" style="s2">organizations are created they need a</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.550" end="00:54:26.010" style="s2">kind of currency in order to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.730" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">people&#39;s a long-term commitment to that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.010" end="00:54:31.950" style="s2">project and in this case you know people</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:34.200" style="s2">are coming in and out and and sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.950" end="00:54:38.040" style="s2">their relationship with this project</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.200" end="00:54:41.100" style="s2">without that like guarantee of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.040" end="00:54:43.560" style="s2">currency and what isn&#39;t what is like</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.100" end="00:54:45.690" style="s2">kind of growing or what you&#39;ve centered</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.560" end="00:54:50.300" style="s2">as an alternative to that is the gift</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.690" end="00:54:55.140" style="s2">and I think like the the move towards a</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.300" end="00:54:58.110" style="s2">way of exchanging from the heart and a</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.140" end="00:55:01.050" style="s2">way of exchanging that engenders more</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.110" end="00:55:05.310" style="s2">kind of like gifting and like sharing</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.050" end="00:55:06.960" style="s2">and also it&#39;s teaching us something that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.310" end="00:55:08.970" style="s2">I think is Westerners like we&#39;ve grown</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.960" end="00:55:11.700" style="s2">grown up within the context of a heavily</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.970" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">commodified society it&#39;s like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.700" end="00:55:16.819" style="s2">I can&#39;t just go and my</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:18.890" style="s2">participate without the expectation that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.819" end="00:55:21.890" style="s2">I&#39;m going to be compensated and with</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.890" end="00:55:25.579" style="s2">some sort of like currency and still</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.890" end="00:55:28.849" style="s2">find value and then also be surprised by</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.579" end="00:55:32.150" style="s2">the gifts that others are going to give</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.849" end="00:55:34.759" style="s2">me right in exchange for that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.150" end="00:55:36.410" style="s2">like being it&#39;s another level of being</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.759" end="00:55:39.380" style="s2">willing to play with the uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.410" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">right it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know how much is</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.380" end="00:55:44.269" style="s2">gonna come back to me because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:46.460" style="s2">aged with this and I&#39;m leaning into that</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.269" end="00:55:48.349" style="s2">and that&#39;s another level of fear here</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.460" end="00:55:50.960" style="s2">right like there&#39;s another level of fear</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.349" end="00:55:53.329" style="s2">it&#39;s like what if I what if I won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.960" end="00:55:55.489" style="s2">what I feel like I deserve because of</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.329" end="00:55:57.559" style="s2">this I mean the gift really just</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.489" end="00:55:59.690" style="s2">completely up ends that way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.559" end="00:56:01.460" style="s2">about this in general and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.690" end="00:56:01.880" style="s2">practice that I mean I was just done Joe</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.460" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">Burrell</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.880" end="00:56:07.460" style="s2">Burres um like seminar this morning and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:11.089" style="s2">his whole project is also based like</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.460" end="00:56:13.549" style="s2">through the gift and we we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.089" end="00:56:16.430" style="s2">practice it and it is challenging and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.549" end="00:56:20.469" style="s2">does leave us kind of vulnerable but</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.430" end="00:56:23.859" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a really beautiful way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.469" end="00:56:29.650" style="s2">creating collaborative spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.859" end="00:56:35.469" style="s2">creating more potential for more gifts</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.650" end="00:56:38.509" style="s2">and I&#39;m kind of like feeling into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.469" end="00:56:40.099" style="s2">art of giving a gift and when I was when</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.509" end="00:56:42.589" style="s2">you were talking I was feeling into it I</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.099" end="00:56:44.650" style="s2">was getting kind of emotional like it</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.589" end="00:56:49.279" style="s2">was like a little bit teary-eyed here</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.650" end="00:56:50.509" style="s2">because it&#39;s like the scary part is if</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.279" end="00:56:53.779" style="s2">you give a gift and no one wants to</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.509" end="00:56:55.279" style="s2">receive it like you buy someone a gift</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.779" end="00:56:56.719" style="s2">like this is to us I&#39;m at Christmas you</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.279" end="00:56:58.819" style="s2">buy a gift you put your heart and soul</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.719" end="00:57:00.499" style="s2">into it use at home I&#39;m just I just is</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.819" end="00:57:02.529" style="s2">really good and then no one no one likes</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.499" end="00:57:04.579" style="s2">it you know the person doesn&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.529" end="00:57:07.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s the feeling of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.579" end="00:57:10.789" style="s2">rejection loneliness all that nasty</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.880" end="00:57:12.200" style="s2">stuff most not nasty but you know if it</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.789" end="00:57:16.490" style="s2">feel nasty</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.200" end="00:57:18.250" style="s2">and you have to be like risk that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.490" end="00:57:23.980" style="s2">know you have to be bold enough to risk</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.250" end="00:57:27.410" style="s2">being rejected being unwanted and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.980" end="00:57:30.369" style="s2">you know being okay with it in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.410" end="00:57:33.170" style="s2">the other thing that came up is like I</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.369" end="00:57:34.430" style="s2">did so many free events in Toronto I</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.170" end="00:57:37.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t like charge anything I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.430" end="00:57:44.390" style="s2">have a gift economy but now that I had</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.730" end="00:57:46.640" style="s2">this frame that this is a gift now that</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.390" end="00:57:50.180" style="s2">I have this frame that this is a gift</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.640" end="00:57:52.010" style="s2">I&#39;m actually happy to have give people</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.180" end="00:57:54.589" style="s2">the opportunity to provide a gift if</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.010" end="00:57:57.530" style="s2">they&#39;re inspired to the stoah because</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.589" end="00:57:59.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like and this is my I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.530" end="00:58:00.560" style="s2">how they flush will architecture to back</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.150" end="00:58:03.770" style="s2">this stuff but this is my intuition is</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.560" end="00:58:05.540" style="s2">that in order to give your best gift you</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.770" end="00:58:07.430" style="s2">have to be willing to receive gifts in</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.540" end="00:58:10.190" style="s2">return you have to feel worthy enough to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.430" end="00:58:11.180" style="s2">receive a gift and that&#39;s a whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.190" end="00:58:13.720" style="s2">too if you know if you don&#39;t feel worthy</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.180" end="00:58:18.220" style="s2">enough to receive a gift and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.720" end="00:58:18.220" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna corrupt your gift in a way</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.810" end="00:58:24.339" style="s2">yeah I put you on mute because yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.319" end="00:58:31.790" style="s2">yeah and I think once again I think the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.569" end="00:58:34.369" style="s2">idea of sovereignty comes back into this</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.790" end="00:58:35.869" style="s2">and I think this may even connect this</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.369" end="00:58:37.670" style="s2">would be a hypothesis that I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.869" end="00:58:39.410" style="s2">propose in terms of thinking about like</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.670" end="00:58:41.869" style="s2">why there&#39;s so many men in these species</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.410" end="00:58:44.180" style="s2">is like this willingness to take risks I</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.869" end="00:58:46.750" style="s2">think men in many cases like are just</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.180" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">already kind of set up or kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.750" end="00:58:51.319" style="s2">risk-taking behavior and women have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">tendency to be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.319" end="00:58:55.880" style="s2">risk-averse in some cases and so like</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:57.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a develop like part of what</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.880" end="00:59:00.050" style="s2">sovereignty I think kind of creates or</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.980" end="00:59:04.190" style="s2">pull debates in a person is this like</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.050" end="00:59:06.230" style="s2">home a sense of home in oneself so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.190" end="00:59:09.109" style="s2">you can leave that you can run out the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.230" end="00:59:12.260" style="s2">front door and go and play and go climb</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.109" end="00:59:14.359" style="s2">up the tree and like go and and swim in</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.260" end="00:59:16.430" style="s2">the lake and do these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.359" end="00:59:19.490" style="s2">activities that put you at a personal</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.430" end="00:59:21.500" style="s2">risk and even though we may not be</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.490" end="00:59:24.800" style="s2">putting our bodies at risk by sharing</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.500" end="00:59:25.410" style="s2">right yes or by giving a gift there once</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.800" end="00:59:26.550" style="s2">again back</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.410" end="00:59:31.740" style="s2">the initial question that we started</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.550" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">with emotions have physical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.740" end="00:59:38.100" style="s2">and like the feeling of rejection shows</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:40.200" style="s2">up as a physical sensation it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.100" end="00:59:43.980" style="s2">something that is that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.200" end="00:59:45.390" style="s2">challenging the your body in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.980" end="00:59:49.350" style="s2">like a risk of falling out of a tree</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.390" end="00:59:51.810" style="s2">feels like you know and so cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.350" end="00:59:54.930" style="s2">that sovereignty is is having the home</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.810" end="00:59:57.120" style="s2">right for yourself to return to when you</p>

<p begin="01:01:04.560" end="01:01:09.930" style="s2">what we need to do it&#39;s it&#39;s personal</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.870" end="01:01:12.570" style="s2">development that is I think also aligned</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.930" end="01:01:14.430" style="s2">with just reaching out and creating</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.570" end="01:01:15.780" style="s2">things out in the world it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:01:15.780" end="01:01:18.390" style="s2">personal development world</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.010" end="01:01:21.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like personal development that</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.390" end="01:01:23.880" style="s2">happens in as kind of like a positive</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.420" end="01:01:25.650" style="s2">externality like an externality of doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.880" end="01:01:27.270" style="s2">other types of work of putting yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.650" end="01:01:29.580" style="s2">out there because you&#39;re creating art I</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.270" end="01:01:32.220" style="s2">mean like I don&#39;t know I think of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.580" end="01:01:34.680" style="s2">like I think a facilitation is my medium</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.220" end="01:01:36.210" style="s2">like the people are my medium right that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.680" end="01:01:37.590" style="s2">but like creating structures for</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.210" end="01:01:40.310" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.590" end="01:01:44.220" style="s2">creating experiences like hosting is my</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.310" end="01:01:47.010" style="s2">art form and so I&#39;m expressing my art</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.220" end="01:01:48.630" style="s2">and like you said that is like a gift</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.010" end="01:01:49.890" style="s2">right like when you express your art</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.630" end="01:01:52.860" style="s2">you&#39;re like giving your gift to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.890" end="01:01:56.370" style="s2">world and you really do cherish this</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.860" end="01:01:58.080" style="s2">thing and to like be able to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.370" end="01:02:00.150" style="s2">play with that space and return home and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.080" end="01:02:04.230" style="s2">learn from when you you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.150" end="01:02:20.070" style="s2">create a gift that yeah people might</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.230" end="01:02:28.200" style="s2">want to tweak yeah yeah Regas and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.070" end="01:02:29.910" style="s2">go and be like I inclusion/exclusion but</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.200" end="01:02:31.680" style="s2">that being based on someone&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.910" end="01:02:33.720" style="s2">individual sovereignty right so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:35.160" style="s2">create the space right everyone and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.720" end="01:02:42.390" style="s2">people just decide whether or not that</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.160" end="01:02:45.420" style="s2">work so I&#39;d like to end with the thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.390" end="01:02:48.150" style="s2">that came alive there the first one</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.420" end="01:02:52.010" style="s2">you&#39;re talking I&#39;ve I think I arrived</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.150" end="01:02:55.710" style="s2">home we wanted to announce that I felt</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.010" end="01:02:57.440" style="s2">there not that I didn&#39;t feel yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.710" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel quite there when I started</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.440" end="01:03:03.570" style="s2">because of what I came in with but I</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:05.640" style="s2">feel at home you know especially when I</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.570" end="01:03:07.290" style="s2">expressed that gift stuff you know that</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.640" end="01:03:12.510" style="s2">that&#39;s vulnerability there with the gift</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.290" end="01:03:14.580" style="s2">I felt really really right to say and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.510" end="01:03:17.130" style="s2">the when you&#39;re talking about this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.580" end="01:03:18.930" style="s2">your medium right your artistic medium</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.130" end="01:03:21.000" style="s2">and I&#39;m viewing these these kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.930" end="01:03:24.950" style="s2">being a really good facilitator is being</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.000" end="01:03:27.630" style="s2">an artist of experience oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.950" end="01:03:29.790" style="s2">and so I want to share an idea that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.630" end="01:03:31.830" style="s2">gonna do hopefully if the person is</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.790" end="01:03:33.390" style="s2">willing to do it but even if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.830" end="01:03:37.110" style="s2">a gesture to the spirit of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.390" end="01:03:41.930" style="s2">aiming at and okay so you know Steven</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.110" end="01:03:45.990" style="s2">Jenkinson names familiar but please yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.930" end="01:03:48.660" style="s2">he&#39;s gained my podcast a couple of days</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.990" end="01:03:50.610" style="s2">ago he&#39;s just Canadian guy he was in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.660" end="01:03:50.970" style="s2">death trade or he calls it the death</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.610" end="01:03:53.430" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.970" end="01:03:55.440" style="s2">that trade or whatever and I was like</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.430" end="01:03:57.690" style="s2">some poet and he talks about death his</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.440" end="01:04:00.870" style="s2">calls calls it or &#39;the orphan wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.690" end="01:04:02.460" style="s2">how the fact that we have a don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.870" end="01:04:04.370" style="s2">relationship with death kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.460" end="01:04:08.850" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t give us a culture really</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.370" end="01:04:10.110" style="s2">and sort of really really do the full</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.850" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">conversation I had with him and he has</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.110" end="01:04:14.670" style="s2">this kind of like elder vibe with and</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:16.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just the flow of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.670" end="01:04:18.410" style="s2">he actually talking to him snap me in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.200" end="01:04:19.830" style="s2">different state of being when I was</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.410" end="01:04:21.450" style="s2">conversing with him</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.830" end="01:04:23.460" style="s2">and so I was thinking like oh we</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.450" end="01:04:26.370" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t any Amy unis mentioned at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.460" end="01:04:30.150" style="s2">end of that conversations that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.370" end="01:04:33.300" style="s2">been visited by a god right now and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.150" end="01:04:36.680" style="s2">you know we have to acknowledge it in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.300" end="01:04:39.960" style="s2">way and then he kind of tied are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.680" end="01:04:42.590" style="s2">cutting off our truthfulness and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.960" end="01:04:45.240" style="s2">bullshitting a lying you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.590" end="01:04:47.460" style="s2">encouraged us to control dominions that</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.240" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">should not be controlled by us and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.460" end="01:04:52.200" style="s2">this created a deceives in the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:56.490" style="s2">right now that disease is spreading in</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.200" end="01:04:59.190" style="s2">more than one way and so that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.490" end="01:05:01.050" style="s2">really heightened this ethical act of</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.190" end="01:05:02.940" style="s2">being truthful for me and it almost</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.050" end="01:05:05.960" style="s2">feels like I feel pretty vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.940" end="01:05:08.910" style="s2">being truthful in the last couple weeks</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.960" end="01:05:10.500" style="s2">publicly and almost feels it it feels</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.910" end="01:05:12.630" style="s2">quite judicially truthful at times but</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.500" end="01:05:15.150" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it just really felt</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.630" end="01:05:16.860" style="s2">ethical thing to do right now ground</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.150" end="01:05:18.600" style="s2">yourself in that truthful muscle and may</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.860" end="01:05:20.160" style="s2">infuse it with the Dame on to right so</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.600" end="01:05:24.270" style="s2">like they have a relationship with each</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.160" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">other so anyway she said we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.270" end="01:05:28.770" style="s2">visited by God and I thought well you</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:31.800" style="s2">know we really cool experience is bring</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.770" end="01:05:33.390" style="s2">Steven in and then allow him to talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.800" end="01:05:35.490" style="s2">around the digital campfire about how</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.390" end="01:05:37.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve been visited by a god and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.490" end="01:05:40.230" style="s2">collectively we have a moment of silence</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.670" end="01:05:45.390" style="s2">to respect the God that has visited us</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.230" end="01:05:48.120" style="s2">and then with that I think food is</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.390" end="01:05:49.920" style="s2">coming right yeah it&#39;s my stomach is</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.120" end="01:05:56.570" style="s2">grumbling to so they we&#39;ve been visited</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.920" end="01:05:56.570" style="s2">by the delivery man and uh yeah so we</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.730" end="01:06:02.190" style="s2">and there&#39;s silence to respect the god</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.410" end="01:06:04.859" style="s2">that you know visited us and and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.190" end="01:06:06.750" style="s2">the youth asked questions to the elder</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.859" end="01:06:09.720" style="s2">in this case Steven he&#39;s like an old guy</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.750" end="01:06:12.119" style="s2">about how to conduct oneself during the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.720" end="01:06:14.190" style="s2">visitation of a God right and he has</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.119" end="01:06:15.570" style="s2">this extreme of consciousness thing and</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.190" end="01:06:17.340" style="s2">it could be framed basically it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.570" end="01:06:19.590" style="s2">someone says your shares of thoughts in</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.340" end="01:06:21.450" style="s2">the Q&amp;A but with the delicious framing</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.590" end="01:06:23.760" style="s2">of an artistic experience right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.450" end="01:06:25.650" style="s2">kind of like having that that decoration</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.760" end="01:06:27.359" style="s2">there and I&#39;m thinking like you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.650" end="01:06:28.890" style="s2">what like that still could act as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.359" end="01:06:31.440" style="s2">transformational experience for someone</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.890" end="01:06:34.290" style="s2">oh yeah I&#39;m like shit and this liminal</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.440" end="01:06:37.500" style="s2">space that we&#39;re in the the line between</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.290" end="01:06:40.800" style="s2">what is art and what is a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.500" end="01:06:43.350" style="s2">transformation no longer exists where</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.800" end="01:06:45.990" style="s2">it&#39;s like an old game a atomistic world</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.350" end="01:06:48.869" style="s2">it&#39;s like art was like you know boxed</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.990" end="01:06:51.330" style="s2">off into this like art gallery that was</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.869" end="01:06:53.160" style="s2">called up by rich people so they</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.330" end="01:06:54.869" style="s2">neutered art in a way and then didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.160" end="01:06:58.200" style="s2">make it dangerous because art is really</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.869" end="01:07:00.350" style="s2">dangerous mm-hmm let it be what it wants</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.200" end="01:07:00.350" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.460" end="01:07:22.500" style="s2">yeah the time Turner is running out but</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.609" end="01:07:23.910" style="s2">that sounds like a beautiful idea I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.500" end="01:07:26.850" style="s2">been feeling the need for something like</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.910" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2">that actually is is I mean feeling</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.850" end="01:07:31.380" style="s2">called towards a kind of prayer or a</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:34.970" style="s2">kind of reverence or kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.380" end="01:07:41.340" style="s2">community that where we just like are</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.970" end="01:07:45.420" style="s2">holding this sense this God this like I</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.340" end="01:07:48.869" style="s2">this idea in mind together has felt like</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.420" end="01:07:51.600" style="s2">something from for me just personally as</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.869" end="01:07:54.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve been living in my bedroom basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.600" end="01:07:56.730" style="s2">for the last three weeks that I would</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.450" end="01:07:59.310" style="s2">need I feel like I need I think also</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.730" end="01:08:02.550" style="s2">Justin Justin like my own personal level</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.310" end="01:08:05.430" style="s2">like I am kind of joyous all the time</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.550" end="01:08:08.670" style="s2">now because I am playing in a space that</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.430" end="01:08:10.619" style="s2">I find to be so generative and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.670" end="01:08:13.980" style="s2">so beautiful and feeling so many</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.619" end="01:08:16.080" style="s2">great like bonding kind of emotions</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.980" end="01:08:17.489" style="s2">because I am bonding with people and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.080" end="01:08:21.210" style="s2">collaborating with people and I love</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.489" end="01:08:23.790" style="s2">doing that and yet I know about this</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.210" end="01:08:25.469" style="s2">crisis and it&#39;s in turtle this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.790" end="01:08:27.060" style="s2">intertwined with the crisis I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.469" end="01:08:30.569" style="s2">is the anti-fertility of humans right</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.060" end="01:08:33.029" style="s2">like in them in death we have these</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.569" end="01:08:36.389" style="s2">rituals but bring the community together</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.029" end="01:08:39.810" style="s2">to make the community strong in the face</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.389" end="01:08:41.370" style="s2">of the loss of an individual of an</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.810" end="01:08:44.730" style="s2">important individual to the community</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.370" end="01:08:46.759" style="s2">and the fact that we have been distanced</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.730" end="01:08:49.920" style="s2">from death that we hide death in these</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.759" end="01:08:51.449" style="s2">institutions and we push it away and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.920" end="01:08:54.299" style="s2">make it a kind of professional class</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.449" end="01:08:56.549" style="s2">that handles death and in the world that</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.299" end="01:08:58.080" style="s2">we live in we have lost our connection</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.549" end="01:09:02.880" style="s2">to what life is right you have to dance</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.080" end="01:09:05.009" style="s2">with death to find meaning and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.880" end="01:09:07.319" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;m very excited by the by</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.009" end="01:09:09.480" style="s2">this this idea that you&#39;re a bringing</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.319" end="01:09:11.339" style="s2">forth and this person and can I can get</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.480" end="01:09:13.370" style="s2">the elder I also connected to elders who</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.339" end="01:09:15.569" style="s2">have practice that their life is like</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.370" end="01:09:18.359" style="s2">integration and this dance with death</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.569" end="01:09:21.000" style="s2">themselves like I found when I am with</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.359" end="01:09:24.750" style="s2">an elder who has integrated that</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.000" end="01:09:26.279" style="s2">practice for their life entire life as</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.750" end="01:09:28.650" style="s2">an adult sometimes since they were</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.279" end="01:09:31.080" style="s2">children there is just this quality of</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.650" end="01:09:34.020" style="s2">being around them that is is is like</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.080" end="01:09:36.420" style="s2">ineffable ineffable how much they have</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.020" end="01:09:39.509" style="s2">to teach and that is like the potential</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.420" end="01:09:40.739" style="s2">that we have as human beings imagine if</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.509" end="01:09:43.259" style="s2">we grew up in a culture where we were</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.739" end="01:09:45.929" style="s2">just intimately engaged with that since</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.259" end="01:09:48.870" style="s2">we were children who would be who would</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.929" end="01:09:50.639" style="s2">we become as elders what kind of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.870" end="01:09:53.179" style="s2">would we have that transcends the</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.639" end="01:09:55.980" style="s2">immediacy of of whatever particular</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.179" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">embodiment of economics or of governance</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.980" end="01:09:59.790" style="s2">settings existing within the framework</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:03.300" style="s2">of your life like that you could reach</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.790" end="01:10:05.159" style="s2">into the experience of someone who is 16</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.300" end="01:10:07.230" style="s2">when you&#39;re 86 and still bring them</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.159" end="01:10:09.840" style="s2">something of value because you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.230" end="01:10:13.560" style="s2">really sat with the human condition and</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.840" end="01:10:16.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve really engaged and confronted and</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.560" end="01:10:18.960" style="s2">played and integrated for the entirety</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.290" end="01:10:22.409" style="s2">of your life and to be invited into that</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.960" end="01:10:23.550" style="s2">I think right now is what a lot of this</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.409" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">is is in</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.550" end="01:10:30.780" style="s2">being invited into that process to lead</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:36.030" style="s2">a much more rich life in this in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.780" end="01:10:38.580" style="s2">stance with with death and the thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.030" end="01:10:39.660" style="s2">leaving this conversation with is what</p>

<p begin="01:10:50.910" end="01:10:53.400" style="s2">all these like range of emotion like</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.020" end="01:10:55.470" style="s2">this rollercoaster of emotions like</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.400" end="01:10:56.850" style="s2">anger fear hurt I just when I was</p>
