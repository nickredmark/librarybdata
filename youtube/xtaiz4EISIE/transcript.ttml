<p begin="00:01:39.650" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">alright so so Johannes so I think some</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.450" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">first some of you for most of you I</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">would imagine you probably watched my</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:56.450" style="s2">other discussions with Johannes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">always really struck with him about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.450" end="00:02:04.939" style="s2">in fact we talked about in this video</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:04.939" style="s2">the the sense of the divine madness of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.350" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">two wakened in you like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.760" end="00:02:16.069" style="s2">philosophical awakening right is</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:18.920" style="s2">precisely awakening to something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.069" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">you can&#39;t ever quite reach right in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.920" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">it awakens in some sense we talked a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">little bit about this about</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:29.560" style="s2">perhaps what Heidegger&#39;s disclosing when</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:34.330" style="s2">he says death right not death like an</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.560" end="00:02:41.140" style="s2">event in the future not not your demise</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.330" end="00:02:46.130" style="s2">but the the deepest horizon the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.140" end="00:02:50.750" style="s2">horizon that is also most near that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.130" end="00:02:53.380" style="s2">that in a certain sense allows it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.750" end="00:02:56.709" style="s2">it allows thinking itself to disclose</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.380" end="00:03:02.769" style="s2">right so we talked a lot about right</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.709" end="00:03:05.090" style="s2">about death about thought a radical</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.769" end="00:03:07.850" style="s2">understanding that Heidegger really</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.090" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">revealed about the movement of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.850" end="00:03:16.370" style="s2">and its relationship to negativity or</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:18.530" style="s2">the nothing or concealment</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.370" end="00:03:21.320" style="s2">and I and it&#39;s so interesting because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">just really appreciate Heidegger and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.320" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">in philosophy and all the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:30.049" style="s2">with the johannes and essentially all</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:33.410" style="s2">the conversations I&#39;ve been having seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.049" end="00:03:35.329" style="s2">to me that what what all of that has in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.410" end="00:03:38.690" style="s2">common right all these conversation all</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.329" end="00:03:40.370" style="s2">the people philosophy to me the thing it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.690" end="00:03:44.950" style="s2">reveals what I&#39;m most interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.370" end="00:03:48.079" style="s2">which is like that which can&#39;t be fully</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.950" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">fully revealed or taken over but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.079" end="00:03:54.380" style="s2">mystery the sense of getting closer and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:57.590" style="s2">closer to the mystery of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.380" end="00:04:03.380" style="s2">be and know awaken that and allow that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.590" end="00:04:07.299" style="s2">to reveal your life and how you respond</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.380" end="00:04:11.390" style="s2">right and everything that we do so in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.299" end="00:04:16.790" style="s2">that way of revealing like allowing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.390" end="00:04:20.769" style="s2">which is concealed to to come into</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.790" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">unconcealed meant without</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.769" end="00:04:27.879" style="s2">without making it a position but opening</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:31.909" style="s2">what&#39;s beyond the horizon right what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.879" end="00:04:33.409" style="s2">most near to us so we just get into that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.909" end="00:04:37.939" style="s2">sense of it that hermie Annette</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.409" end="00:04:39.289" style="s2">extensive of speaking into that so it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.939" end="00:04:42.759" style="s2">really it was a really rich conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.289" end="00:04:46.610" style="s2">and just an opportunity to really see</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.759" end="00:04:49.250" style="s2">somebody who I would say true think are</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.610" end="00:04:52.009" style="s2">a true philosopher who you could just</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.250" end="00:04:52.250" style="s2">feel it in him you know he can&#39;t not do</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.009" end="00:04:56.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.250" end="00:04:58.460" style="s2">right so and also he&#39;s got a he&#39;s got a</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.250" end="00:06:37.509" style="s2">liking it and they&#39;re paying for it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.659" end="00:06:40.659" style="s2">just and as you said just - you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.509" end="00:06:47.919" style="s2">actually just there to learn for its own</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.919" end="00:06:54.219" style="s2">started um to begin at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.610" end="00:07:00.659" style="s2">right that&#39;s always the poor kid you</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.219" end="00:07:05.710" style="s2">know weirdly enough I had the idea to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.659" end="00:07:09.400" style="s2">put up videos positive videos at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.710" end="00:07:13.300" style="s2">six or seven years ago when I moved to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.400" end="00:07:16.930" style="s2">London twenty thirteen or fourteen never</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.300" end="00:07:22.419" style="s2">did it of course and it was there was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.930" end="00:07:28.029" style="s2">moment and I finished my PhD in 2018 and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.419" end="00:07:30.069" style="s2">then moved back to London in the fall to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.029" end="00:07:32.830" style="s2">take up a very small position at</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.069" end="00:07:36.159" style="s2">Birkbeck and who is another day laborer</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.830" end="00:07:38.680" style="s2">you know right as we as we laborers of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.159" end="00:07:40.870" style="s2">the spitters are once or I have to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.680" end="00:07:43.690" style="s2">actually it cuz we also have to eat</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.870" end="00:07:47.430" style="s2">really enough and then and then I</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.690" end="00:07:47.430" style="s2">finally said I had a couple of weeks off</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.580" end="00:07:55.960" style="s2">and I sat down on my now infamous sofa</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.330" end="00:07:57.849" style="s2">upstairs the velvet sofa which was</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.960" end="00:07:58.270" style="s2">previously owned by Oscar Wilde just</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.849" end="00:08:04.689" style="s2">kidding</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.270" end="00:08:07.089" style="s2">and and said down and recorded a lecture</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.689" end="00:08:09.310" style="s2">which which is on the origin of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.089" end="00:08:12.189" style="s2">which is basically just an</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.310" end="00:08:14.349" style="s2">interpretation of an attempt in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.189" end="00:08:17.409" style="s2">philosophical interpretation of Stanley</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.349" end="00:08:19.870" style="s2">Kubrick&#39;s 2001 a Space Odyssey now put</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.409" end="00:08:23.770" style="s2">it up on in on Instagram on YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.870" end="00:08:27.580" style="s2">I think I got about two or three views</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.770" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">four of them mine and it took it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.580" end="00:08:31.500" style="s2">really weird because but but then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:33.840" style="s2">it&#39;s it started is how</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.500" end="00:08:36.930" style="s2">thing because I had the idea anyways to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.840" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">do it um I think it would be easy to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.930" end="00:08:43.020" style="s2">it&#39;s out of necessity because you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:45.510" style="s2">not really allowed what it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.020" end="00:08:48.330" style="s2">want to teach at University but I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.510" end="00:08:51.420" style="s2">it would be short-sighted to call it an</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.330" end="00:08:53.370" style="s2">SST it&#39;s rather that because then you</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.660" end="00:11:11.850" style="s2">yeah but then again not rigorous in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.170" end="00:11:13.950" style="s2">sense in which you would have to be now</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.850" end="00:11:16.700" style="s2">in order to get published yes yes the</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.940" end="00:11:35.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a death by numbers to speak in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.130" end="00:11:37.650" style="s2">slogan um which means you know you have</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.570" end="00:11:52.590" style="s2">learned very early on what you flip it</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.100" end="00:11:54.060" style="s2">by playing you&#39;re still playing the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.590" end="00:11:55.260" style="s2">numbers game right</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.060" end="00:11:57.480" style="s2">right because you&#39;re right to get you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.260" end="00:12:00.150" style="s2">need to get to some subscriber level</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.380" end="00:12:26.040" style="s2">yeah the one before was not actually on</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.510" end="00:12:28.310" style="s2">Heidegger the one before was on idleness</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:31.230" style="s2">which was on Plato Aristotle Cicero</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.310" end="00:12:33.420" style="s2">Russell Nietzsche homeboy Heidegger one</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.230" end="00:12:37.140" style="s2">lecture yes and chose his PIPA there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.420" end="00:12:38.430" style="s2">own to work etc right and and also again</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.140" end="00:12:40.770" style="s2">possibly the escapable</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.430" end="00:12:42.630" style="s2">I&#39;m see in with with these with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.770" end="00:12:44.220" style="s2">video I mean as you know I find it also</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.630" end="00:12:47.280" style="s2">quite dangerous but nothing is just</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.220" end="00:12:49.590" style="s2">promising a utopia there&#39;s the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.280" end="00:12:51.570" style="s2">turning something into into</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.590" end="00:12:55.140" style="s2">entertainment and background noise oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.570" end="00:12:57.480" style="s2">yeah but then again you can cut through</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.140" end="00:12:57.990" style="s2">so much with it and you can cut through</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.480" end="00:13:01.350" style="s2">the gate</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.990" end="00:13:03.330" style="s2">keepers yeah I you can you can not even</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.350" end="00:13:06.300" style="s2">cut through because that sounds all too</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.330" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">aggressive I would rephrase it as I you</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.300" end="00:13:12.180" style="s2">know you can just let them be yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:15.570" style="s2">let them be gatekeepers over here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.180" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">and and build your own space somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.570" end="00:13:22.380" style="s2">else or a we&#39;re through through through</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:26.310" style="s2">some eccentricity people actually begin</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.380" end="00:13:29.750" style="s2">to listen yeah that is a quite a monkey</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.310" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">or to do yeah I think that&#39;s a key word</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.750" end="00:13:39.450" style="s2">what if people listen yes yes yes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:40.860" style="s2">you know if this is if there&#39;s no status</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.450" end="00:13:43.050" style="s2">in this right this is the funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.860" end="00:13:46.649" style="s2">also that there&#39;s nothing actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.050" end="00:13:48.630" style="s2">probably the opposite um at least but</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.649" end="00:13:50.070" style="s2">it&#39;s changing a bit now I guess it that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.630" end="00:13:54.089" style="s2">might there might be the usual status</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.070" end="00:13:57.470" style="s2">hierarchies to but I think it&#39;s for me</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.089" end="00:14:02.100" style="s2">it was in the beginning just a way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.470" end="00:14:07.320" style="s2">experimenting with with text I had</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.100" end="00:14:10.620" style="s2">written to see whether they actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.320" end="00:14:12.899" style="s2">make sense right but also the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.620" end="00:14:15.060" style="s2">build something in such a way that if</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.899" end="00:14:17.520" style="s2">there is you know I really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.060" end="00:14:20.279" style="s2">teach a course I&#39;m hiding on Tekonsha I</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.520" end="00:14:23.270" style="s2">asked the University where I met idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.279" end="00:14:27.240" style="s2">whether I could teach it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.270" end="00:14:28.709" style="s2">practically impossible yeah yeah even</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.240" end="00:14:29.459" style="s2">though even though students actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.709" end="00:14:31.950" style="s2">demand it</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.459" end="00:14:34.589" style="s2">there&#39;s no I mean in pure market terms</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.950" end="00:14:39.630" style="s2">there&#39;s no higher demand and for Adorno</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.589" end="00:14:41.700" style="s2">and hiding at the moment mmm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.630" end="00:14:43.589" style="s2">because you know meaning is as you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.700" end="00:14:46.620" style="s2">is speaking as long as but meaning isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.589" end="00:14:49.800" style="s2">collapsing yeah those are figures who</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.620" end="00:14:52.350" style="s2">have attempted to provide answers right</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.800" end="00:14:56.760" style="s2">to what&#39;s going on and others of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.350" end="00:14:58.589" style="s2">to but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s made and even</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.760" end="00:15:00.149" style="s2">those who are in positions at</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.589" end="00:15:03.029" style="s2">universities where they can teach what</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.149" end="00:15:05.220" style="s2">they would like to teach it takes years</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.029" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">right sometimes until you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.220" end="00:15:10.860" style="s2">do it and here&#39;s there&#39;s no the stomach</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.920" end="00:15:11.860" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got something to say to share</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.860" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">for example I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.860" end="00:15:16.500" style="s2">book on how to go on death and peeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:20.019" style="s2">which is about to be published by</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.500" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">Springer yeah and congratulations on</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.019" end="00:15:26.050" style="s2">that by the way thank you sir yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:29.050" style="s2">the the course is on based on this book</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.050" end="00:15:32.140" style="s2">and on seven years of research mm-hmm no</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.050" end="00:15:34.089" style="s2">right my question maybe I&#39;m just overly</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.140" end="00:15:36.790" style="s2">pragmatic but might the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.089" end="00:15:40.180" style="s2">me would be either to wait forever until</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.790" end="00:15:44.140" style="s2">I&#39;m allowed perhaps that I could teach</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.180" end="00:15:46.149" style="s2">this or I just do it myself we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.140" end="00:15:49.000" style="s2">actually already filled the Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.149" end="00:15:51.490" style="s2">seminar and there was so much interested</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.950" end="00:17:51.810" style="s2">and then have people and offer that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.850" end="00:17:55.300" style="s2">then have people want to participate um</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.810" end="00:17:59.620" style="s2">not for a degree now for an outcome not</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.300" end="00:18:02.610" style="s2">for but because they want to learn yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.620" end="00:18:10.210" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.610" end="00:18:13.330" style="s2">encouraging right and so strange that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.210" end="00:18:16.510" style="s2">that you&#39;re becoming a new point in</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.330" end="00:18:18.550" style="s2">which we get to find that out right</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.510" end="00:18:21.640" style="s2">where people there are people that want</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.550" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">to learn for learnings sake yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.640" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">there&#39;s big about that that&#39;s is so</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:30.220" style="s2">encouraging to see happen yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:34.060" style="s2">did there&#39;s plenty of reasons for it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.220" end="00:18:36.190" style="s2">we don&#39;t meet to get into it why I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.060" end="00:18:39.070" style="s2">would philosophy though specifically it</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.190" end="00:18:43.140" style="s2">you know it&#39;s almost almost it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.070" end="00:18:45.940" style="s2">bound to happen with philosophy first um</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.140" end="00:18:48.100" style="s2">but philosophy leaves and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.940" end="00:18:50.830" style="s2">everything&#39;s quite open there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.400" end="00:26:48.940" style="s2">inspired now again to learn it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.620" end="00:26:51.640" style="s2">doctor in South Africa</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.940" end="00:26:54.540" style="s2">yeah um because you can&#39;t learn just on</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.640" end="00:26:57.970" style="s2">your own right all right also the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.540" end="00:27:00.640" style="s2">teacher is the learner and yeah yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.970" end="00:27:02.020" style="s2">and the teacher needs to be very aware</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.640" end="00:27:04.690" style="s2">of this also that you actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.020" end="00:27:06.040" style="s2">right well the one who&#39;s learning yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.690" end="00:27:08.230" style="s2">look I had a great sense of letting</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.040" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">learn yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.230" end="00:27:14.800" style="s2">and the and and I yeah so the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:17.110" style="s2">approach is just a different one because</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.800" end="00:27:19.510" style="s2">there&#39;s this you know there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.110" end="00:27:22.930" style="s2">no honor I mean there&#39;s no status that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.510" end="00:27:25.090" style="s2">comes with having having been in an</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.930" end="00:27:26.770" style="s2">online course with me there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.090" end="00:27:29.050" style="s2">that comes from that except for perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.770" end="00:27:34.300" style="s2">something learned someone&#39;s the engineer</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.050" end="00:27:34.660" style="s2">um was not going to Cornell said in an</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.300" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">email</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.660" end="00:27:40.630" style="s2">he&#39;s now more focused hmm after that he</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:44.440" style="s2">said oh I noticed that has noticed this</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.630" end="00:27:46.350" style="s2">over the seven weeks yeah yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.440" end="00:27:48.250" style="s2">not trying to make it instrumental or</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.350" end="00:27:50.050" style="s2">operational you know you can do of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.250" end="00:27:52.420" style="s2">course you will be more focused no but</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.050" end="00:27:58.690" style="s2">this was one of the ways in which it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.420" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">translated into into the practical in</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.690" end="00:28:04.420" style="s2">the sense that when you share</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:06.600" style="s2">conversation or with others or in a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.420" end="00:28:09.160" style="s2">focused manner and the wit thing is also</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.600" end="00:28:11.410" style="s2">no one ever looks at their phone during</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.160" end="00:28:16.030" style="s2">my online seminars but they knew all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.410" end="00:28:18.310" style="s2">time during my you&#39;re a my because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.030" end="00:28:20.950" style="s2">weird this kind of the focus is you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.310" end="00:28:22.870" style="s2">it&#39;s much more radical here if I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.950" end="00:28:25.270" style="s2">then in the classroom they was looking</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.870" end="00:28:26.830" style="s2">at their phone yeah it&#39;s not a fit not</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.270" end="00:28:28.750" style="s2">none of the questions they would have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.830" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">worry about is it relevant for the exam</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.750" end="00:28:35.410" style="s2">right here&#39;s what I always ask my</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.670" end="00:28:39.190" style="s2">students first seminar make sure I</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.410" end="00:28:40.900" style="s2">always ask why are you here hmm remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.190" end="00:28:42.130" style="s2">I did this five years ago for the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.900" end="00:28:45.250" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.130" end="00:28:48.220" style="s2">and warwick and a first-year students</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.250" end="00:28:52.840" style="s2">first semester ancient Greek philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.220" end="00:28:55.270" style="s2">well asked why are you here and one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.840" end="00:29:01.900" style="s2">them raised their hands and this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.270" end="00:29:07.930" style="s2">relevant for the exam right right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.900" end="00:29:13.090" style="s2">I&#39;m and I said no you you know you you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.930" end="00:29:14.350" style="s2">have to wonder why are you here</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.090" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">the good thing is the place I&#39;m at now</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.350" end="00:29:19.330" style="s2">is a bit different someone actually said</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:23.560" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for meaning but I think with</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.330" end="00:29:25.750" style="s2">these voluntary online courses that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.560" end="00:29:27.630" style="s2">very high level they&#39;re difficult</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.750" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">they&#39;re properly academically</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.630" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">philosophical but they they do address</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:39.460" style="s2">the kind of people who really want and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">there&#39;s many out there yeah we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.460" end="00:29:44.740" style="s2">get the chance to do a PhD yeah or we</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.120" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t get the chance to stay in</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.740" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">learning because as it is we said before</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">life happens they have to make ends meet</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:55.630" style="s2">um and then you get isolated right</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:58.540" style="s2">because everyday conversations are about</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.630" end="00:30:02.170" style="s2">Netflix shows and whatever else nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.540" end="00:30:05.110" style="s2">um and very often people are isolated</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.170" end="00:30:06.490" style="s2">yeah and and one too I mean literally</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.110" end="00:30:09.730" style="s2">what these seminars are about they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.490" end="00:30:11.290" style="s2">about a community yeah about people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.730" end="00:30:13.450" style="s2">like going to school you know the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.290" end="00:30:15.460" style="s2">university you become friends with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.450" end="00:30:17.830" style="s2">people you&#39;re around with right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.460" end="00:30:19.630" style="s2">seminars are also a you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.830" end="00:30:23.890" style="s2">philosophical and there&#39;s right now the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.630" end="00:30:28.870" style="s2">rigorous yeah I&#39;m big there&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.890" end="00:30:32.050" style="s2">banter obviously and and forget to stay</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.870" end="00:30:34.690" style="s2">in touch right it&#39;s up to the students</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.050" end="00:30:36.100" style="s2">but usually actually one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.690" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">that happened with the I to get the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.100" end="00:30:42.040" style="s2">Lewes course with Justin Murphy a</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:43.480" style="s2">reading group formed the reading Aaron&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.040" end="00:30:46.920" style="s2">doing her and Nietzsche and the doorman</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.480" end="00:30:49.960" style="s2">they&#39;re still meeting apparently hmm hmm</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.920" end="00:30:51.880" style="s2">that&#39;s um that&#39;s that&#39;s awesome well I</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.960" end="00:30:55.230" style="s2">think one of the things he said was you</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.880" end="00:30:59.240" style="s2">know eight he said you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.230" end="00:31:01.590" style="s2">they wanna they want to learn something</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.240" end="00:31:05.580" style="s2">like there is a sense when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.590" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">said that the the the what to learn what</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.580" end="00:31:09.809" style="s2">I even I could imagine even if they</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:12.470" style="s2">could say what they want to learn it</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.809" end="00:31:15.150" style="s2">probably didn&#39;t actually it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.470" end="00:31:17.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not representational there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.150" end="00:31:20.580" style="s2">something beyond there&#39;s a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.220" end="00:31:24.179" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a something beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.580" end="00:31:27.410" style="s2">horizon that calls forth the learning in</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.179" end="00:31:27.410" style="s2">the sense that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.160" end="00:31:36.550" style="s2">that seems to be what that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.550" end="00:31:39.070" style="s2">to point to what being like education</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.550" end="00:31:41.590" style="s2">actually is right like what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.070" end="00:31:47.740" style="s2">wants to learn what evokes learning</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.590" end="00:31:50.620" style="s2">right and it&#39;s so interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.740" end="00:31:53.980" style="s2">that like one of the things I I would</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.620" end="00:31:55.180" style="s2">imagine how successful this is unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.980" end="00:31:58.300" style="s2">cuz basically you&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.180" end="00:32:00.580" style="s2">oh yeah we I did this course I put up a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.300" end="00:32:03.460" style="s2">few videos it went really really well</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.580" end="00:32:05.740" style="s2">it did another one and then people that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.460" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">then the students of their own doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.740" end="00:32:09.520" style="s2">started to write papers and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:11.830" style="s2">like well now they&#39;re gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.520" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">presenting them and now people that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.830" end="00:32:14.920" style="s2">teaching that you&#39;re there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:18.490" style="s2">thing unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.920" end="00:32:23.010" style="s2">what&#39;s cool about it to me is it it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.490" end="00:32:26.020" style="s2">seems to be grounded in that spark of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.010" end="00:32:29.530" style="s2">they come wanting to bit wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.020" end="00:32:31.240" style="s2">learn something right yeah so the whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.530" end="00:32:34.360" style="s2">thing is like the whole thing is like</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.240" end="00:32:37.860" style="s2">grounded in that expresses that and is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.360" end="00:32:41.920" style="s2">emerging and you&#39;re responding to it um</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.860" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">yeah really I&#39;m just I&#39;m just responding</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.920" end="00:32:49.150" style="s2">to that to which I&#39;ve always responded</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.150" end="00:32:57.730" style="s2">teachers in my life and I&#39;m counting I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.170" end="00:32:59.080" style="s2">not counting the PhD because maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.730" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">because then it would be maybe a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.080" end="00:33:04.210" style="s2">more but this the the most formative</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:05.620" style="s2">years were when I was much younger so</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.110" end="00:42:33.820" style="s2">interview because reverence has so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">to do with an awareness of your own kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.820" end="00:42:37.960" style="s2">of FINA to door your limitation but</p>

<p begin="00:42:52.750" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">that so it&#39;s a way of it&#39;s a way of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.510" end="00:43:02.620" style="s2">not of allowing something beyond the</p>

<p begin="00:43:17.800" end="00:43:23.490" style="s2">I kind of did this at I just started</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.920" end="00:43:27.940" style="s2">reading Heidegger I don&#39;t even know why</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.490" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">but but stumbling through it right with</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.940" end="00:43:32.770" style="s2">my dyslexia and everything like that but</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">I think what it what what tighter er did</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.770" end="00:43:38.650" style="s2">for me anyways in reading philosophy did</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:40.780" style="s2">for me was that I was so clear that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.650" end="00:43:44.440" style="s2">was now understanding what when I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.780" end="00:43:49.960" style="s2">reading but something was disclosed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.440" end="00:43:54.190" style="s2">and and the the whoof like there was</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.960" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">something about the walk that the text</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.190" end="00:44:01.720" style="s2">took me on break it was like the walk</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:03.580" style="s2">that it took me on understanding like in</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.720" end="00:44:06.250" style="s2">the process of understanding and not</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.580" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">understanding that I got closer to this</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.250" end="00:44:10.690" style="s2">thing that was ever disclosed and just</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.000" end="00:44:12.850" style="s2">heightened</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.690" end="00:44:15.550" style="s2">Heidegger never like revealed it in some</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.850" end="00:44:17.800" style="s2">sense that I can possess but that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.550" end="00:44:20.070" style="s2">awakened I mean that just awakened</p>

<p begin="00:45:32.410" end="00:45:36.519" style="s2">knew I would like I would like to do a</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.049" end="00:45:38.140" style="s2">PhD here I wasn&#39;t sure if maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.519" end="00:45:39.220" style="s2">Nietzsche maybe Heidegger maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.140" end="00:45:43.499" style="s2">something as entirely</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.220" end="00:45:48.460" style="s2">I thought I&#39;m an autodidact on Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.499" end="00:45:53.769" style="s2">so I had no formal pause on Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.460" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">until the second term of my PhD when I</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.769" end="00:45:58.630" style="s2">took a course with Miguel to boost eggie</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:46:01.749" style="s2">an introductory course to being in time</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.590" end="00:48:47.330" style="s2">so 2013 it became clear I&#39;d like to work</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.920" end="00:48:59.690" style="s2">is seven years of research now at this</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.840" end="00:49:01.190" style="s2">point I just finished the book on death</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.690" end="00:49:04.100" style="s2">and being and Heidegger because I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.190" end="00:49:06.200" style="s2">that when you look for an answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.100" end="00:49:09.140" style="s2">question of being you have to look to</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.200" end="00:49:13.010" style="s2">death yeah it is in death death comes</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.140" end="00:49:13.460" style="s2">back everywhere death is everywhere all</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.010" end="00:49:15.140" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.460" end="00:49:17.030" style="s2">gay Billick Heidegger wants to</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.140" end="00:49:20.090" style="s2">understand not just as mountain range</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.030" end="00:49:22.820" style="s2">but also as the concentration of all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.090" end="00:49:26.300" style="s2">sheltering harbouring concealment and in</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.820" end="00:49:29.360" style="s2">this sense you stallion which is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.300" end="00:49:31.550" style="s2">concentration of a forceful positing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.360" end="00:49:34.700" style="s2">making available and controllable right</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.550" end="00:49:38.300" style="s2">in this sense gift L is the opponent of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.700" end="00:49:41.210" style="s2">death it must work against death because</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.300" end="00:49:43.850" style="s2">it allows for no sheltered Ness for no</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.850" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">which means being held yeah being held</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">hates and if general wants to eradicate</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.650" end="00:50:00.920" style="s2">this and you see the transhumanists and</p>

<p begin="00:50:00.920" end="00:50:07.370" style="s2">death without death saying you know this</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.940" end="00:50:09.980" style="s2">is too much of the slow but without</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.460" end="00:50:48.910" style="s2">when Heidegger works this out from very</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.530" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">different angles and you know this is</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.340" end="00:52:40.150" style="s2">differentiate the two and already you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.290" end="00:52:41.860" style="s2">already you&#39;re in negation and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:54.040" end="00:52:58.720" style="s2">opposite it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s with the drawing</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.050" end="00:53:02.740" style="s2">and the thought becomes to think</p>

<p begin="00:54:19.120" end="00:54:23.350" style="s2">the earlier hiding here but you know how</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.520" end="00:54:26.500" style="s2">they go it&#39;s about directedness to us is</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.350" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">utmost limit in which we always already</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.500" end="00:54:33.010" style="s2">are so you see the representational</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:36.100" style="s2">account things of limit as something</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.010" end="00:54:38.980" style="s2">that that limits the the border between</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.100" end="00:54:41.740" style="s2">two countries yeah but no the the limit</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.980" end="00:54:45.090" style="s2">is justice speaks in to the limit</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.740" end="00:54:49.900" style="s2">situation is imminently where we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.090" end="00:54:51.790" style="s2">hey death is imminently the moment where</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.900" end="00:54:53.890" style="s2">we are this is what Heidegger says in as</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.790" end="00:54:55.960" style="s2">soon as we are we&#39;re old enough to die</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.890" end="00:54:58.290" style="s2">he goes ask the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.960" end="00:54:59.740" style="s2">Hegel says the very same thing right</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.290" end="00:55:01.589" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.740" end="00:55:03.270" style="s2">it&#39;s we are in Heineken booze</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.589" end="00:55:06.220" style="s2">radicalizes even further</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.270" end="00:55:09.400" style="s2">yes striding through the mountain range</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.220" end="00:55:11.109" style="s2">of being in our life we dwell in death</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.400" end="00:55:15.609" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.109" end="00:55:18.010" style="s2">and hence also the inherent danger it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.609" end="00:55:21.490" style="s2">not just homely I think there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.010" end="00:55:23.800" style="s2">something pretty 3/12 we dwell and Beth</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.490" end="00:55:27.450" style="s2">right so the thing of you know and this</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.800" end="00:55:33.609" style="s2">is I have to say that this one</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.450" end="00:55:35.710" style="s2">what Heidegger&#39;s um revealing and when</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.609" end="00:55:40.290" style="s2">he talks about death for Americans this</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.710" end="00:55:40.290" style="s2">one is almost impossible</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.180" end="00:55:51.609" style="s2">great like the moment you represent it</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:55.960" style="s2">as either as is your demise or an event</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.609" end="00:55:58.510" style="s2">or things you know it&#39;s the world what</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.960" end="00:55:59.710" style="s2">was it the world collapse yeah is he</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.510" end="00:56:01.720" style="s2">were talking about the birth the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.710" end="00:56:06.520" style="s2">Berkeley Heights Berkeley High</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.720" end="00:56:09.430" style="s2">daguerreian professors it&#39;s almost in</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.520" end="00:56:11.320" style="s2">actually in listening to that video that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.430" end="00:56:15.730" style="s2">were you were going over that like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.320" end="00:56:17.740" style="s2">misconceptions of life you the Dreyfus</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.730" end="00:56:21.460" style="s2">kind of people and the misconceptions of</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.740" end="00:56:23.830" style="s2">death where they it was it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.460" end="00:56:26.230" style="s2">they get that they don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.830" end="00:56:28.450" style="s2">in fact you can listen to Dreyfus right</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.230" end="00:56:30.130" style="s2">you can listen to him in his course it</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.450" end="00:56:32.140" style="s2">is it&#39;s actually I really like listening</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.130" end="00:56:35.560" style="s2">to him because he&#39;s he&#39;s getting up</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.140" end="00:56:39.940" style="s2">there and he&#39;s he&#39;s genuinely stumped</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.560" end="00:56:42.369" style="s2">and trying to work it out but there is</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.940" end="00:56:44.530" style="s2">this quality of there is this quality of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.369" end="00:56:46.540" style="s2">this sense of like they get it they</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.530" end="00:56:53.109" style="s2">don&#39;t understand something and so they</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.540" end="00:56:54.460" style="s2">they search for the thing that um you</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.109" end="00:56:57.099" style="s2">could say like that basically represents</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.460" end="00:57:00.099" style="s2">they get it right and once if they can</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.099" end="00:57:02.140" style="s2">get it right then they could stop</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.099" end="00:57:03.609" style="s2">thinking and then they can go on with</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.140" end="00:57:06.550" style="s2">the rest of the thing it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.609" end="00:57:08.920" style="s2">a knit companion yeah there&#39;s a quality</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.550" end="00:57:10.810" style="s2">of like figuring out is this yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.920" end="00:57:14.140" style="s2">think it&#39;s more grounded in curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.810" end="00:57:18.339" style="s2">than it is wonder essentially right</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.140" end="00:57:21.190" style="s2">that where it&#39;s irritating it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.339" end="00:57:22.720" style="s2">struggle but there is a sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.190" end="00:57:24.490" style="s2">there is a sense of like if we can get</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.720" end="00:57:26.769" style="s2">it right we can stop the struggle</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.490" end="00:57:30.819" style="s2">whereas with Heidegger I always get the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.769" end="00:57:33.960" style="s2">sense that no like that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.819" end="00:57:36.910" style="s2">you&#39;re on the right track when when</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.960" end="00:57:39.519" style="s2">something lose everything you lose more</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.910" end="00:57:42.069" style="s2">and more you lose everything you let go</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.519" end="00:57:45.700" style="s2">the thinking of the agnus</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.069" end="00:57:49.000" style="s2">I mean it means is to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.700" end="00:57:51.730" style="s2">everything familiar yeah you really are</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.000" end="00:57:54.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s what representation seems to</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.730" end="00:57:55.480" style="s2">do is that when I go because I know this</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.220" end="00:57:57.369" style="s2">happens a lot when I&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.480" end="00:57:59.950" style="s2">Heidegger right like with people they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.369" end="00:58:02.289" style="s2">go oh that&#39;s like that&#39;s what the dow is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.950" end="00:58:03.460" style="s2">say or that&#39;s what the did it is a or</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.289" end="00:58:05.070" style="s2">something like that and I&#39;m like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.460" end="00:58:08.100" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.070" end="00:58:12.390" style="s2">even if that&#39;s correct it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.100" end="00:58:14.610" style="s2">be true right because because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.390" end="00:58:17.340" style="s2">just gonna bring your basically you just</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.610" end="00:58:19.320" style="s2">stop thinking if you say it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.340" end="00:58:21.630" style="s2">because you just brought it into to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.320" end="00:58:23.670" style="s2">realm of the familiar and what we want</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.630" end="00:58:26.490" style="s2">to do is in understanding it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.670" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">move towards the unfamiliar right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.490" end="00:58:33.870" style="s2">and the watched leg at least completes</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:35.670" style="s2">with my American friends right you start</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.870" end="00:58:38.870" style="s2">saying that stuff and literally they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.670" end="00:58:43.040" style="s2">get they&#39;ll just get pissed and like</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.870" end="00:58:46.320" style="s2">accusation &#39;el and what do you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.040" end="00:58:50.610" style="s2">but i did but the thing is the thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.320" end="00:58:54.240" style="s2">speaking like an American but then again</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.610" end="00:58:57.800" style="s2">you know the word thing is not clear</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.240" end="00:59:01.890" style="s2">what the thing is yeah um and actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.800" end="00:59:05.910" style="s2">the thing has benign as it seems to come</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.890" end="00:59:11.250" style="s2">along at all right that&#39;s the thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.910" end="00:59:12.870" style="s2">quite horrifying them some to things to</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.250" end="00:59:17.280" style="s2">thing to points to issues</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.870" end="00:59:20.610" style="s2">Heidegger wishes to think negativity as</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.280" end="00:59:23.910" style="s2">Hegel does even more radically more</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.610" end="00:59:25.320" style="s2">dangerously and said yes negativity you</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.910" end="00:59:27.780" style="s2">know he doesn&#39;t use this word because</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.320" end="00:59:31.260" style="s2">it&#39;s directed at beings but still he</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.780" end="00:59:34.680" style="s2">says if negativity then ask catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.260" end="00:59:36.540" style="s2">catastrophe English which means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.680" end="00:59:40.650" style="s2">actually something that&#39;s turning around</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.540" end="00:59:43.620" style="s2">here when genuine profound negativity</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.650" end="00:59:47.400" style="s2">it&#39;s then something really is turning</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.620" end="00:59:51.540" style="s2">around and turned as a turning way of</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.400" end="00:59:53.700" style="s2">turning and overturning and he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.540" end="00:59:57.720" style="s2">that this is not really the case with</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.700" end="01:00:00.420" style="s2">Hegel&#39;s negativity and this and so he</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.720" end="01:00:02.730" style="s2">wants to understand is to understand the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.420" end="01:00:06.600" style="s2">negative is closer to the creek tote</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.730" end="01:00:07.950" style="s2">Dane on that which is horrifying that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.600" end="01:00:10.350" style="s2">which is horrible</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.950" end="01:00:14.250" style="s2">ah that which is completely no which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.350" end="01:00:17.800" style="s2">the in the tragic sense the moment when</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.250" end="01:00:19.960" style="s2">all is lost but still the tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.800" end="01:00:22.600" style="s2">continuous rightness the early purse</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.960" end="01:00:26.940" style="s2">continues when it&#39;s already all horrible</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.600" end="01:00:29.890" style="s2">our Antigone is just the entire story is</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.940" end="01:00:31.840" style="s2">pain after pain after pain the pain</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.890" end="01:00:34.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go away and it doesn&#39;t dissolve</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.840" end="01:00:37.060" style="s2">either just there&#39;s no results at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.810" end="01:00:38.530" style="s2">end of it and that&#39;s the Dane on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.060" end="01:00:40.570" style="s2">moment of day known is when it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.530" end="01:00:41.710" style="s2">that this will end and that&#39;s a pain for</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.570" end="01:00:44.830" style="s2">everyone involved</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.710" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">yeah but there&#39;s no resolve there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.830" end="01:00:48.520" style="s2">way around it it&#39;s now just going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:51.100" style="s2">continue</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.520" end="01:00:55.210" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s how he wants to think</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.100" end="01:00:56.800" style="s2">the negative but then you said you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.210" end="01:01:00.340" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult for Americans I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.800" end="01:01:03.850" style="s2">have to point out that very likely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.340" end="01:01:06.670" style="s2">the same over here in Europe and perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.850" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">even especially in Germany there is</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.670" end="01:01:12.940" style="s2">almost no scholarship on Heidegger that</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:16.660" style="s2">would take all these questions seriously</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.940" end="01:01:19.450" style="s2">the question of being yeah well and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.660" end="01:01:21.960" style="s2">nowhere nowhere but almost nowhere I</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.450" end="01:01:26.140" style="s2">mean there are a few people in there um</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.960" end="01:01:30.220" style="s2">but where is you know there is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.140" end="01:01:32.260" style="s2">question of being well I&#39;m so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.220" end="01:01:35.410" style="s2">written a book with the subtitle an</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.260" end="01:01:36.370" style="s2">answer to the question of being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.410" end="01:01:38.950" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.370" end="01:01:42.190" style="s2">our and he says very often for the task</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.950" end="01:01:48.310" style="s2">is to try and articulate a response to</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.190" end="01:01:50.800" style="s2">war yeah and this is not I there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.310" end="01:01:53.050" style="s2">absolute response to it it&#39;s a finite</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.800" end="01:01:56.320" style="s2">attempt at it and there will be better</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.050" end="01:01:58.690" style="s2">ones but that must be the attempt when</p>

<p begin="01:02:15.160" end="01:02:20.650" style="s2">and trust these various ways of</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.050" end="01:02:22.600" style="s2">interpreting being yeah well wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.650" end="01:02:25.150" style="s2">you say that&#39;s that&#39;s just perspectivism</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.600" end="01:02:28.410" style="s2">but this was the main problem of gaddama</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.150" end="01:02:31.180" style="s2">a gaddama was incapable of actually</p>

<p begin="01:02:39.100" end="01:02:44.770" style="s2">just perspectival it&#39;s basically it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:02:44.770" end="01:02:48.520" style="s2">less contingent yeah and when everything</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:50.290" style="s2">is well as contingent well you know one</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.520" end="01:02:52.000" style="s2">has to be careful about what sophistry</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.290" end="01:02:54.220" style="s2">is why people think and sophistry has</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:02:56.440" style="s2">got to do with rhetoric yes but actually</p>

<p begin="01:02:56.440" end="01:03:03.580" style="s2">yeah the Sophists are those who think</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.830" end="01:03:09.430" style="s2">against thinking who put on the pedestal</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.580" end="01:03:11.710" style="s2">who fetishize or tried or argue in terms</p>

<p begin="01:03:11.710" end="01:03:19.630" style="s2">different forms so the mere contingency</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.080" end="01:03:22.180" style="s2">is found when there is no necessity to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.630" end="01:03:25.240" style="s2">so I want to say it again the first</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.180" end="01:03:28.300" style="s2">paragraph is the necessity of repeating</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.240" end="01:03:31.270" style="s2">this question oh that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.300" end="01:03:33.310" style="s2">paragraph of the time then of course we</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.270" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">can we can talk about whether this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.310" end="01:03:39.040" style="s2">the proper approach post hanging etc but</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:43.030" style="s2">then why is this necessity given because</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.040" end="01:03:45.040" style="s2">post can&#39;t have - can&#39;t what does the</p>

<p begin="01:04:16.420" end="01:04:20.920" style="s2">as with John Locke than it ends up in</p>

<p begin="01:04:25.780" end="01:04:31.000" style="s2">etc which is what Berkeley said about</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.090" end="01:04:33.570" style="s2">John Locke but what is what Khan</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.000" end="01:04:36.640" style="s2">realizes here maybe without realizing it</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.570" end="01:04:40.060" style="s2">is that one all of these thinkers do</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.640" end="01:04:42.730" style="s2">especially in all the way back to two</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.060" end="01:04:44.720" style="s2">Parmenides of course but but even more</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.730" end="01:04:47.480" style="s2">so in in</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.720" end="01:04:54.760" style="s2">in what we now call the modern early</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.480" end="01:04:54.760" style="s2">modern period is to simply presuppose</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.240" end="01:05:01.430" style="s2">dogmatically the identity between being</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.099" end="01:05:06.230" style="s2">and thought the critical philosophy was</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.430" end="01:05:10.810" style="s2">on a system right critique asks for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.230" end="01:05:13.250" style="s2">Basques how is this presupposition</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.810" end="01:05:15.619" style="s2">possible which is the identity between</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.250" end="01:05:19.010" style="s2">being and thought right which was just</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.619" end="01:05:21.260" style="s2">assumed before yeah yeah never even</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.010" end="01:05:24.319" style="s2">question so the critical that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.260" end="01:05:26.180" style="s2">sets in but then all all hell breaks</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.319" end="01:05:29.000" style="s2">loose with this yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.180" end="01:05:32.540" style="s2">revolution of thought and now what post</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.000" end="01:05:35.810" style="s2">and all philosophy has to do if it</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.540" end="01:05:38.569" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to be dogmatic right it has</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.810" end="01:05:41.420" style="s2">to become it has to be able to think of</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.569" end="01:05:43.579" style="s2">its presuppositions yeah and we hang</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.420" end="01:05:45.230" style="s2">them in this is what hiding it does or</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.579" end="01:05:49.810" style="s2">tries to do right and this is what</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.230" end="01:05:53.420" style="s2">Heidegger tries to do with the entire</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.810" end="01:05:56.140" style="s2">philosophy up until to him right then we</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.420" end="01:05:59.240" style="s2">get problems of concealment the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.140" end="01:06:02.599" style="s2">attachments yeah but that&#39;s that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.240" end="01:06:05.060" style="s2">another I&#39;m there&#39;s that I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.599" end="01:06:07.609" style="s2">I think what I just really kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.060" end="01:06:11.109" style="s2">gotten what you&#39;re saying is is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.609" end="01:06:13.010" style="s2">what philosophy does is it reveals what</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.109" end="01:06:15.680" style="s2">presupposes what you took is</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.010" end="01:06:18.200" style="s2">self-evident or weren&#39;t even noticing</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.680" end="01:06:23.569" style="s2">that anything was presupposed what makes</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.200" end="01:06:26.750" style="s2">that evident right and obviouly strike</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.569" end="01:06:29.060" style="s2">in my experience years ago it questions</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.750" end="01:06:33.470" style="s2">something that I wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.060" end="01:06:36.650" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t even um I wasn&#39;t even not</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.470" end="01:06:39.319" style="s2">oriented towards but but when at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.650" end="01:06:40.819" style="s2">moment it&#39;s questioned every bill that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.319" end="01:06:43.730" style="s2">was standing on something that was</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.819" end="01:06:46.849" style="s2">giving everything and that&#39;s that like</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.730" end="01:06:49.820" style="s2">shaking up that uncanny nough seems to</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.849" end="01:06:53.030" style="s2">be a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.820" end="01:06:55.070" style="s2">the way I think that probably Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.030" end="01:06:59.320" style="s2">is getting at with with anxiety and</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.070" end="01:07:02.390" style="s2">being in time of it reveals the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.320" end="01:07:05.060" style="s2">uncanny Ness of the ground</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.390" end="01:07:09.710" style="s2">oh that you&#39;re you&#39;re standing on things</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.060" end="01:07:14.180" style="s2">think that make allow things to reveal</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.710" end="01:07:15.890" style="s2">themselves that are at work that you</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.180" end="01:07:17.600" style="s2">could not know about and you could not</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.890" end="01:07:20.210" style="s2">know that you didn&#39;t know about but you</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.600" end="01:07:23.780" style="s2">were given by something about finding</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.210" end="01:07:26.000" style="s2">like kind of coming coming awakened that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.780" end="01:07:28.340" style="s2">seems to be very similar to the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.000" end="01:07:31.070" style="s2">awakening of philosophy itself on some</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.340" end="01:07:32.480" style="s2">level right look what&#39;s important those</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.070" end="01:07:34.010" style="s2">in terms of highly cuz we have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.480" end="01:07:37.400" style="s2">understand who it is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.010" end="01:07:38.900" style="s2">responding to yeah right speaking of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.400" end="01:07:43.310" style="s2">human gene called them Berkeley IDEs</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.900" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">yeah um for them Heidegger apparently</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.310" end="01:07:49.070" style="s2">just talks about me walking around</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:51.770" style="s2">feeling anxious because I&#39;m in the state</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.070" end="01:07:55.820" style="s2">of total world collapse called death</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.770" end="01:07:58.400" style="s2">yeah okay yeah but you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.820" end="01:08:00.380" style="s2">that&#39;s four that&#39;s kitchen psychology as</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.400" end="01:08:02.420" style="s2">we could say in Kentucky</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.380" end="01:08:05.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that psychology for the masses</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.420" end="01:08:07.300" style="s2">yeah and and Heidegger called psychology</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.240" end="01:08:09.680" style="s2">by the way psycho technics which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.300" end="01:08:12.320" style="s2">interesting reference but I think a</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.680" end="01:08:14.690" style="s2">response to the entirety of philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.320" end="01:08:17.509" style="s2">and Heidegger points out for example in</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.690" end="01:08:19.130" style="s2">this in the essay the principle of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.509" end="01:08:25.640" style="s2">identity there&#39;s that state and actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.130" end="01:08:27.230" style="s2">the spring of identity he says that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.640" end="01:08:34.430" style="s2">the thought of</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.230" end="01:08:36.440" style="s2">entity that a can equal a what even what</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.430" end="01:08:38.930" style="s2">kind of presupposition thought must make</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.440" end="01:08:42.410" style="s2">here without going into it too much yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.930" end="01:08:44.980" style="s2">for thinking to find out that it has</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.410" end="01:08:47.180" style="s2">always already made the presupposition</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.980" end="01:08:50.359" style="s2">off the identity between being in</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.180" end="01:08:54.080" style="s2">thought it took thinking two thousand</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.359" end="01:08:57.319" style="s2">years he says this to get to this point</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.080" end="01:09:01.190" style="s2">with cod and then fifty yeah cool be</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.319" end="01:09:03.589" style="s2">shelling and Hegel or Trent try to bring</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.190" end="01:09:07.390" style="s2">it together again especially Hegel yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.589" end="01:09:10.040" style="s2">and and actually this is why Eagle</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.390" end="01:09:13.520" style="s2">philosophizes without presuppositions</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.040" end="01:09:18.920" style="s2">without any horizon the signs of logic</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.520" end="01:09:22.460" style="s2">eagles masterpiece is a logic that moves</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.920" end="01:09:24.250" style="s2">forward by the categories collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.460" end="01:09:27.560" style="s2">necessarily because the understanding</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.250" end="01:09:29.900" style="s2">wants to hold onto them but reason sees</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.560" end="01:09:33.250" style="s2">that you cannot hold on to them yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.900" end="01:09:35.779" style="s2">you know you start with being pure being</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.250" end="01:09:38.239" style="s2">yeah and then the understanding wants to</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.779" end="01:09:40.970" style="s2">say something being pure being but then</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.239" end="01:09:43.910" style="s2">it already shows some activity you know</p>

<p begin="01:09:43.910" end="01:09:52.819" style="s2">the actuality is supreme right with with</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.190" end="01:09:57.500" style="s2">Hegel versus the possibility yeah yeah</p>

<p begin="01:10:04.480" end="01:10:13.280" style="s2">does is he just like Heidegger takes</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.890" end="01:10:15.590" style="s2">into consideration yeah the entirety of</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.280" end="01:10:18.680" style="s2">philosophy because communities stays</p>

<p begin="01:10:28.310" end="01:10:32.420" style="s2">right it&#39;s just like death who</p>

<p begin="01:10:40.829" end="01:10:47.730" style="s2">we&#39;ll be haunted by what by nihilism um</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.079" end="01:10:51.719" style="s2">what Hegel shows though is a deal that</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.730" end="01:10:54.989" style="s2">no category actually remains just a</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.719" end="01:10:57.989" style="s2">state it&#39;s all activity</p>

<p begin="01:11:02.699" end="01:11:08.730" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s mystic Ida to think of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.090" end="01:11:11.820" style="s2">the mind as a racecar racecar chitons a</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.730" end="01:11:15.869" style="s2">thinking thing it&#39;s not a thing</p>

<p begin="01:11:19.710" end="01:11:26.429" style="s2">is what what Heidegger responds to is</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.460" end="01:11:28.559" style="s2">the critical philosophy of Kant and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.429" end="01:11:31.079" style="s2">response to it by a goal and Schelling</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.559" end="01:11:33.690" style="s2">especially and high niggas trying to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.079" end="01:11:36.900" style="s2">show that what all of this is grounded</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.690" end="01:11:42.079" style="s2">in grounded in careful but what all of</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.900" end="01:11:44.940" style="s2">this is grounded is design and is also</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.079" end="01:11:48.949" style="s2">and then we can get into consumer and</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.940" end="01:11:54.739" style="s2">etc - but no but it&#39;s it&#39;s when we take</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.949" end="01:11:58.020" style="s2">Heidegger seriously um that we begin to</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.739" end="01:12:00.360" style="s2">to see that it isn&#39;t arbitrary ready you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.020" end="01:12:03.210" style="s2">you cannot one cannot just take up a</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.360" end="01:12:06.690" style="s2">text and philosophy and read into it</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.210" end="01:12:11.130" style="s2">whatever contingently comes to mind yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.690" end="01:12:13.800" style="s2">um that&#39;s that that&#39;s a really a</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.130" end="01:12:16.679" style="s2">destruction of off the tradition and</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.800" end="01:12:19.139" style="s2">that basically you know when we speak of</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.679" end="01:12:21.389" style="s2">the meaning crisis that that&#39;s what has</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.139" end="01:12:25.139" style="s2">to do with it right as it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.389" end="01:12:27.320" style="s2">arbitrary yeah we cannot just take up a</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.139" end="01:12:30.210" style="s2">text from Parmenides and then say oh but</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.320" end="01:12:31.920" style="s2">we can reinterpret this in this many</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.210" end="01:12:35.369" style="s2">ways and Heinicke doesn&#39;t do it as aina</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.920" end="01:12:37.409" style="s2">haina casis what all of this so he</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.369" end="01:12:39.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say this is what happened here</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.409" end="01:12:42.030" style="s2">and I&#39;m just gonna go over here and do</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.119" end="01:12:44.219" style="s2">this entirely new thing ya know he says</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.030" end="01:12:46.860" style="s2">there&#39;s always been something at the</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.219" end="01:12:49.020" style="s2">heart of it which has been forgotten but</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.860" end="01:12:51.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not a pejorative yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.020" end="01:12:52.789" style="s2">forgotten necessarily yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.690" end="01:12:55.089" style="s2">because of the</p>

<p begin="01:12:55.089" end="01:13:01.099" style="s2">and then it becomes transparent to</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.089" end="01:13:04.519" style="s2">itself just like with card in this</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.099" end="01:13:06.799" style="s2">critical instance Asif he noticed that</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.519" end="01:13:09.339" style="s2">it had always made the presupposition of</p>

<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:36.379" style="s2">think there is this ah this the</p>

<p begin="01:16:05.690" end="01:16:09.740" style="s2">then I can deal with death or then we</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.520" end="01:16:12.950" style="s2">can overcome it I don&#39;t know it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.740" end="01:16:18.230" style="s2">you let it occur yeah and this letting</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.950" end="01:16:20.960" style="s2">lets you in - yeah this other mode of</p>

<p begin="01:16:27.260" end="01:16:33.950" style="s2">just it&#39;s ultimately a form of piety</p>

<p begin="01:16:33.950" end="01:16:37.790" style="s2">there&#39;s also form of humility all right</p>

<p begin="01:17:14.660" end="01:17:19.620" style="s2">and Heidegger and is that there&#39;s a that</p>

<p begin="01:17:47.640" end="01:17:51.720" style="s2">in such a way that like you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.710" end="01:17:54.030" style="s2">I think what if I were to kind of say it</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.720" end="01:17:57.960" style="s2">in my own words like with the glass</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.030" end="01:18:02.040" style="s2">glass and I like the sense of it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.960" end="01:18:05.670" style="s2">allowing it&#39;s a it&#39;s allowing you could</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.040" end="01:18:08.730" style="s2">say the unknown to become present</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.670" end="01:18:11.580" style="s2">without making it known without turning</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.730" end="01:18:14.850" style="s2">it into the known like that sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.580" end="01:18:17.100" style="s2">the negative space or the the to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.850" end="01:18:20.610" style="s2">attuned into that like RH seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.100" end="01:18:23.400" style="s2">precisely the very thing that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.610" end="01:18:26.340" style="s2">even notice that it&#39;s not attuned into</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.400" end="01:18:29.450" style="s2">that right yeah and it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.340" end="01:18:33.000" style="s2">so geese daily is the concentration of</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.450" end="01:18:36.600" style="s2">positing it has nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.000" end="01:18:40.350" style="s2">machines yeah machines are a result of</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.600" end="01:18:44.550" style="s2">this yeah yes off the technical yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.350" end="01:18:46.440" style="s2">you know the goose Dell is not TV I mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.550" end="01:18:48.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a we have to be careful because to</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.990" end="01:19:09.330" style="s2">human about it um what were the</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.270" end="01:19:11.820" style="s2">algorithms do though is they posit they</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.330" end="01:19:14.610" style="s2">posit the world by means of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.820" end="01:19:17.780" style="s2">parameters of time and space now here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.610" end="01:19:20.140" style="s2">what&#39;s eerie about the old cond</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.780" end="01:19:24.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.140" end="01:19:28.590" style="s2">he notices that metaphysics has always</p>

<p begin="01:19:28.590" end="01:19:35.950" style="s2">pre positing literally right yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.190" end="01:19:38.230" style="s2">hi pool this prima thesis this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.950" end="01:19:40.750" style="s2">meaning to posit which is fine because</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.230" end="01:19:42.430" style="s2">we need to posit it something yes you</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.750" end="01:19:45.850" style="s2">have need to posit just to build a house</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.430" end="01:19:49.630" style="s2">but yeah in the thought is rather</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.850" end="01:19:51.580" style="s2">difficult to act to articulate reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.630" end="01:19:53.020" style="s2">or to tackle a being which is not the</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.580" end="01:19:57.900" style="s2">same we have to be careful but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.020" end="01:20:00.700" style="s2">just say for now like this so can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.900" end="01:20:02.740" style="s2">notices this and that&#39;s the earthquake</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.700" end="01:20:06.310" style="s2">that is can&#39;t which we are suffering but</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.740" end="01:20:10.330" style="s2">then how does he respond to it he wants</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.310" end="01:20:12.730" style="s2">to hold on to because ultimately you</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.330" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">always have to find something to hold on</p>

<p begin="01:20:23.770" end="01:20:28.240" style="s2">knowledge it&#39;s in the fits how from a</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.780" end="01:20:34.210" style="s2">Hegelian stance it&#39;s in how we</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.240" end="01:20:39.430" style="s2">articulate ourselves and in life in</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.210" end="01:20:42.210" style="s2">nature on the logical plane then we</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.430" end="01:20:44.620" style="s2">begin to act and be in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.210" end="01:20:46.030" style="s2">what con does is he sees this</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.620" end="01:20:48.460" style="s2">presupposition but then when you read</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.030" end="01:20:51.610" style="s2">the first critique its posits it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.460" end="01:20:54.040" style="s2">positing after another and it&#39;s now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.610" end="01:20:55.930" style="s2">at some point set up in such a way that</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.040" end="01:20:59.350" style="s2">what we no longer have access to with</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.930" end="01:21:01.240" style="s2">God is what things in themselves yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.350" end="01:21:03.400" style="s2">yeah this is for how to erase these</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.240" end="01:21:07.240" style="s2">essays building drilling thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.400" end="01:21:10.030" style="s2">the thing coming back to the thing in</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.240" end="01:21:12.970" style="s2">itself in itself with an essence of</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.030" end="01:21:13.810" style="s2">itself with an Uzi ax of itself because</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.970" end="01:21:19.000" style="s2">here&#39;s the weird thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.810" end="01:21:22.200" style="s2">the Natural Sciences and their laws one</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.000" end="01:21:24.330" style="s2">thing if you like they never look at is</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.200" end="01:21:28.590" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.330" end="01:21:30.330" style="s2">Nature herself is not visible in Natural</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.590" end="01:21:33.680" style="s2">Sciences because of the natural</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.330" end="01:21:39.810" style="s2">scientists look at our abstract laws</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.680" end="01:21:43.040" style="s2">yeah they look at for example very</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.810" end="01:21:46.980" style="s2">simple very almost to Bernard you put it</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.040" end="01:21:50.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a cat and as a stone they weigh</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.980" end="01:21:52.410" style="s2">the same you dropped them both it</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.250" end="01:21:54.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s being dropped in</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.410" end="01:21:58.830" style="s2">what Falls what matters is the mass and</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.630" end="01:22:01.560" style="s2">the volume and the weight we know what</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.830" end="01:22:05.400" style="s2">they look at is an abstract law which is</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.560" end="01:22:09.000" style="s2">not visible it&#39;s metaphysical in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.400" end="01:22:13.380" style="s2">proper sense of the word right nature</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.000" end="01:22:15.300" style="s2">has always already turned away from what</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.380" end="01:22:18.990" style="s2">the operations of gifts tell which just</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.300" end="01:22:22.860" style="s2">posits something yeah yeah about it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.990" end="01:22:26.100" style="s2">which which we call models model by</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.860" end="01:22:29.010" style="s2">which we then access the world yeah or</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.100" end="01:22:31.710" style="s2">the world view yeah the world picture</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.010" end="01:22:35.010" style="s2">yeah which is not really a picture at</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.710" end="01:22:37.080" style="s2">all it&#39;s a mathematical model is that is</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.010" end="01:22:40.020" style="s2">that kind of like it does that link into</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.080" end="01:22:42.630" style="s2">the one of the reasons why the more</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.020" end="01:22:46.200" style="s2">technological devices for example the</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.630" end="01:22:47.900" style="s2">more disappears the more you can&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.200" end="01:22:52.170" style="s2">when the phones really being the phone</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.900" end="01:22:54.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t notice the phone you&#39;re it and</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.170" end="01:22:58.020" style="s2">the moment doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.680" end="01:23:00.750" style="s2">you know like a windmill right a</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.020" end="01:23:03.060" style="s2">windmill it stops working but you leave</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.750" end="01:23:06.300" style="s2">it there it still gathers world it still</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.060" end="01:23:07.740" style="s2">has meeting and it&#39;s old in it right</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.300" end="01:23:10.890" style="s2">where is like something that shines</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.740" end="01:23:15.000" style="s2">through yeah yes and it&#39;s just and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.890" end="01:23:17.910" style="s2">just this mill yeah yes okay I will now</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.000" end="01:23:20.730" style="s2">step down from the the higher you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.910" end="01:23:23.850" style="s2">the abstract what I just talked about is</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.730" end="01:23:27.840" style="s2">the three years ago I traveled through</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.850" end="01:23:30.900" style="s2">the this fine island here and we went</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.840" end="01:23:32.670" style="s2">down I went down with my parents to sand</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.900" end="01:23:36.060" style="s2">ice and tin tetra which is at the very</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.670" end="01:23:38.130" style="s2">far western end of this island</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.060" end="01:23:40.590" style="s2">I think it&#39;s Cornwall so</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.130" end="01:23:43.320" style="s2">one of these faces beautiful down there</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.590" end="01:23:45.440" style="s2">so ten th one is might have been the</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.320" end="01:23:49.260" style="s2">castle of King Arthur</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.440" end="01:23:50.520" style="s2">Tim tension is a touristy place at the</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.260" end="01:23:53.489" style="s2">castle a burger doesn&#39;t really stand</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.520" end="01:24:00.870" style="s2">anymore but then we hike across and</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.489" end="01:24:03.150" style="s2">along the the coastline there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.870" end="01:24:05.820" style="s2">there&#39;s very very English cause it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:24:05.820" end="01:24:12.719" style="s2">quite quite rocky and some kind of dark</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.560" end="01:24:14.429" style="s2">stone I wouldn&#39;t know which one so he</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.719" end="01:24:18.170" style="s2">kept walking there was there was no one</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.429" end="01:24:20.370" style="s2">there we hiked down towards a small aa</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.170" end="01:24:24.270" style="s2">river that here</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.370" end="01:24:27.840" style="s2">I was flowing into the ocean and as he</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.270" end="01:24:30.000" style="s2">walked down we decided to we also had no</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.840" end="01:24:33.570" style="s2">V no phone service nothing work which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.000" end="01:24:39.090" style="s2">you know rarely the case anymore and</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.570" end="01:24:42.870" style="s2">then we hiked up the tiny River and came</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.090" end="01:24:46.560" style="s2">across an old mill wall timber which had</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.870" end="01:24:50.970" style="s2">been abandoned hundreds of years ago who</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.560" end="01:24:54.000" style="s2">knows it was no it was it was ruin</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.970" end="01:24:55.530" style="s2">just the ruin but the sensation very</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.000" end="01:24:58.110" style="s2">much water there is still something</p>

<p begin="01:25:23.220" end="01:25:30.510" style="s2">piece of data and this is how we now</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.630" end="01:25:33.150" style="s2">treat all of so-called history history</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.510" end="01:25:35.850" style="s2">is just a file age system right a filing</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.150" end="01:25:38.510" style="s2">system sorry a pigeon-holed filing</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.850" end="01:25:42.120" style="s2">system menu and the same with you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.510" end="01:25:44.760" style="s2">we can say a bit provocatively there is</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.120" end="01:25:48.690" style="s2">no history of philosophy there is only</p>

<p begin="01:25:53.490" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">you are stuck on the level where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.080" end="01:25:59.130" style="s2">just arbitrary historical observations</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.120" end="01:26:01.410" style="s2">about is it this kind of ism or that</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.130" end="01:26:03.930" style="s2">kind of ISM there is a necessity in</p>

<p begin="01:26:03.930" end="01:26:08.820" style="s2">is a necessity to his thinking and that</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.390" end="01:26:10.550" style="s2">it takes thinking thousands of years at</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.820" end="01:26:15.480" style="s2">the same time he also says something</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.550" end="01:26:19.350" style="s2">which is remarkable an important for us</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.480" end="01:26:23.100" style="s2">thinking only just now begins because</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.350" end="01:26:26.820" style="s2">it&#39;s twisting free to some degree also</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.100" end="01:26:28.650" style="s2">from its own presuppositions in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.820" end="01:26:31.020" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t liberate itself and then</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.650" end="01:26:33.780" style="s2">just grow must really know but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.020" end="01:26:36.420" style="s2">becoming more and more transparent to it</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.780" end="01:26:38.670" style="s2">what had remained concealed and if there</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.420" end="01:26:41.640" style="s2">is always consumed and also at work or</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.670" end="01:26:43.500" style="s2">withdrawal yeah so that is that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.640" end="01:26:45.110" style="s2">what kinda cult Amelie calls another</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.500" end="01:26:48.210" style="s2">beginning and all this talk about</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.110" end="01:26:50.160" style="s2">collapse and the you know hanukkah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.210" end="01:26:51.870" style="s2">very critical of Spengler for example</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.160" end="01:26:53.580" style="s2">the decline of the West because for him</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.870" end="01:26:56.970" style="s2">that&#39;s just a representational account</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.580" end="01:26:59.370" style="s2">Oh history comes in cycles you know it</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.970" end="01:27:02.100" style="s2">goes up and it goes down it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.370" end="01:27:03.979" style="s2">it&#39;s almost silly to say this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.100" end="01:27:07.070" style="s2">lot of talk right now about</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.979" end="01:27:09.889" style="s2">collapse there&#39;s a lot of talk right now</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.070" end="01:27:11.570" style="s2">about at the apocalypse I make the</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.889" end="01:27:14.349" style="s2">distinction by the way between</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.570" end="01:27:17.630" style="s2">apocalyptic thinking an apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.349" end="01:27:20.300" style="s2">representation representation and</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.630" end="01:27:27.940" style="s2">imagination you know it actually gravels</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.300" end="01:27:31.849" style="s2">it drives on these visions of fire</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.940" end="01:27:34.130" style="s2">burning and entire cities collapsing and</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.849" end="01:27:35.749" style="s2">kind of this is almost like you know you</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.130" end="01:27:39.499" style="s2">can see the Sun on the political</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.749" end="01:27:44.229" style="s2">spectrum on all sides people want it</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.499" end="01:27:48.469" style="s2">seems an apocalyptic thinking this is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.229" end="01:27:51.679" style="s2">completely different mode it&#39;s it it it</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.469" end="01:27:54.829" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actively look for but it is open</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.679" end="01:27:57.679" style="s2">for openings in will be usually called</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.829" end="01:28:00.920" style="s2">history which is not just in you know a</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.679" end="01:28:02.719" style="s2">succession of events but is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.920" end="01:28:06.909" style="s2">always a tiding there is always</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.719" end="01:28:12.170" style="s2">something that announces itself which we</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.909" end="01:28:14.179" style="s2">respond always already and it I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.170" end="01:28:15.860" style="s2">that brings about a certain modesty also</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.179" end="01:28:18.499" style="s2">because the other you know the</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.860" end="01:28:22.670" style="s2">apocalyptic collapse fantasies yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.499" end="01:28:25.579" style="s2">they either want everything to collapse</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.670" end="01:28:27.860" style="s2">for everything to burn or they want</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.579" end="01:28:30.650" style="s2">everything to collapse for to have the</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.860" end="01:28:33.289" style="s2">the the perfect utopia coming later on</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.650" end="01:28:36.920" style="s2">and not none all of this to me at least</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.289" end="01:28:40.989" style="s2">forgets death and forgets the other</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.920" end="01:28:44.510" style="s2">right this this this other way of being</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.989" end="01:28:49.010" style="s2">and and also what ultimately it means to</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.510" end="01:28:54.679" style="s2">be human and we can you know I think he</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.010" end="01:28:58.760" style="s2">did its then probably more to be human</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.679" end="01:29:02.150" style="s2">means to to build yes and to to Elias</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.760" end="01:29:06.199" style="s2">but then also to let go yeah and to</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.150" end="01:29:08.690" style="s2">recognize how deeply you already are let</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.199" end="01:29:14.059" style="s2">go right that&#39;s the that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.690" end="01:29:15.530" style="s2">about like I noticed for that seems to</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.059" end="01:29:19.340" style="s2">be at least a</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.530" end="01:29:23.390" style="s2">for me when I feel the most the sense or</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.340" end="01:29:26.449" style="s2">the intimacy of being as has to do often</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.390" end="01:29:30.320" style="s2">and this is this is what happens in in</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.449" end="01:29:33.350" style="s2">philosophy and poetry where you realize</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.320" end="01:29:36.020" style="s2">the thing that you were sensing into</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.350" end="01:29:38.690" style="s2">that was like just beyond your capacity</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.020" end="01:29:41.390" style="s2">to see was that which was just most near</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.690" end="01:29:45.830" style="s2">right and that kind of recognition that</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.390" end="01:29:49.699" style="s2">oh I&#39;m already always the all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.830" end="01:29:53.570" style="s2">that sense of already always finding</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.699" end="01:29:57.020" style="s2">myself already begun underway right this</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.570" end="01:29:58.969" style="s2">kind of quality of how even what no</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.020" end="01:30:02.420" style="s2">matter what I was representing there was</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.969" end="01:30:06.440" style="s2">an intelligibility right that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.420" end="01:30:08.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t need me right to be going on</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.440" end="01:30:11.630" style="s2">right in that when that&#39;s revealed</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.360" end="01:30:15.670" style="s2">there&#39;s something really there&#39;s huh</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.630" end="01:30:15.670" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s humbling but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.269" end="01:30:23.820" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it kind of gets it gets it</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.789" end="01:30:26.719" style="s2">that sense of like both in intimacy like</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.820" end="01:30:29.400" style="s2">a really deep intimacy but also</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.719" end="01:30:34.739" style="s2">transparent to kind of an inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.400" end="01:30:35.639" style="s2">&#39;ti that&#39;s really near yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.739" end="01:30:38.389" style="s2">that&#39;s everything that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.639" end="01:30:43.949" style="s2">about is like on some on some level is</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.389" end="01:30:48.690" style="s2">is is articulating or pointing to what</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.949" end="01:30:50.670" style="s2">is the case right but is concealed like</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.690" end="01:30:53.099" style="s2">on some level is concealed from me</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.670" end="01:30:56.550" style="s2">right the and you can look back on it I</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.099" end="01:30:58.230" style="s2">know people a lot of times you know they</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.550" end="01:31:00.780" style="s2">get this kind of awakening like when</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.230" end="01:31:03.179" style="s2">they read about history right of like</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.780" end="01:31:05.460" style="s2">where they recognize their way of</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.179" end="01:31:07.499" style="s2">thinking about something wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.460" end="01:31:09.329" style="s2">isn&#39;t self-evident like the case that</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.499" end="01:31:10.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a history to it</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.329" end="01:31:14.639" style="s2">but that worse there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.800" end="01:31:17.579" style="s2">were we&#39;re always responding to and it</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.639" end="01:31:21.809" style="s2">does seem like you know it&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.579" end="01:31:23.519" style="s2">about this to about you know how the way</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.809" end="01:31:25.949" style="s2">that Heidegger talks about listening and</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.519" end="01:31:30.599" style="s2">my understanding right you know where he</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.949" end="01:31:32.730" style="s2">says perhaps it&#39;s a good idea there we</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.599" end="01:31:39.570" style="s2">go we can begin to hear things that we</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.730" end="01:31:40.290" style="s2">don&#39;t already think right and and I was</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.570" end="01:31:45.030" style="s2">thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.290" end="01:31:47.910" style="s2">that just in in talking to people or and</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.030" end="01:31:50.280" style="s2">what I do in circling where there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.910" end="01:31:54.480" style="s2">this deeply moving thing that happens</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.280" end="01:31:55.860" style="s2">for people that they they talk about</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.480" end="01:31:59.610" style="s2">this this experience of being deeply</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.860" end="01:32:03.150" style="s2">seeing and that&#39;s that phrase is that</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.610" end="01:32:05.550" style="s2">phrases a little bit paradoxical because</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.150" end="01:32:09.780" style="s2">it seems to conjure up a sense of like</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.550" end="01:32:11.430" style="s2">kind of something to then see but I</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.780" end="01:32:14.130" style="s2">actually think it&#39;s the opposite of that</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.430" end="01:32:17.640" style="s2">people don&#39;t don&#39;t have the experience</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.130" end="01:32:19.920" style="s2">of being deeply seen by when you repeat</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.640" end="01:32:22.110" style="s2">back to them right the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.920" end="01:32:24.990" style="s2">available to be seen it&#39;s more like when</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.110" end="01:32:27.780" style="s2">you can start to hear with them the</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.990" end="01:32:30.950" style="s2">thing that they&#39;re that that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.780" end="01:32:34.350" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been at the deepest level</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.950" end="01:32:36.990" style="s2">caring for and caring about like the the</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.350" end="01:32:40.800" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s beyond the horizon when</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.990" end="01:32:45.120" style="s2">you can go somehow that you gets</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.800" end="01:32:46.170" style="s2">revealed yeah that people the beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.120" end="01:32:48.030" style="s2">thing that they can&#39;t put into words</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.170" end="01:32:51.680" style="s2">that gets revealed is people have this</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.030" end="01:32:54.930" style="s2">oh my god I feel deeply seen right which</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.680" end="01:32:57.360" style="s2">which sounds which I think it&#39;s elicit a</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.930" end="01:33:00.720" style="s2">function of like what like harkening</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.360" end="01:33:04.890" style="s2">listening really seems to be oriented</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.720" end="01:33:06.480" style="s2">around right which would be very</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.890" end="01:33:09.570" style="s2">different than from the other psycho</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.480" end="01:33:13.050" style="s2">techniques right yeah yeah like</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.570" end="01:33:17.190" style="s2">psychoanalysis so-called yeah which is a</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.050" end="01:33:26.310" style="s2">weird term by the way because analysis</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.190" end="01:33:30.410" style="s2">means to take apart right yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.310" end="01:33:34.410" style="s2">pointing them out yeah that you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.410" end="01:33:36.660" style="s2">just said it so let&#39;s see what that does</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.410" end="01:33:38.940" style="s2">with it right right right which</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.660" end="01:33:41.430" style="s2">presupposes there&#39;s already that which</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.940" end="01:33:45.810" style="s2">to take apart and then yeah but just to</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.430" end="01:33:47.460" style="s2">take apart yeah yeah yeah yeah which is</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.810" end="01:33:48.870" style="s2">the opposite of being seem through</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.460" end="01:33:51.660" style="s2">listening yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.870" end="01:33:53.899" style="s2">yes and then then we would have to dwell</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.660" end="01:34:00.229" style="s2">on we could</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.899" end="01:34:03.379" style="s2">um on the importance of hearing in</p>

<p begin="01:39:57.909" end="01:40:03.610" style="s2">often at least get rid of their old</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.039" end="01:40:05.360" style="s2">cemeteries you walk around even a place</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.610" end="01:40:07.610" style="s2">like London Eye</p>

<p begin="01:40:34.910" end="01:40:38.900" style="s2">they turn into parks but then every</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.460" end="01:40:42.890" style="s2">grave is just left to its own devices</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.900" end="01:40:45.830" style="s2">and collapses slowly into itself there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:41:11.750" end="01:41:19.010" style="s2">this being seen is outside the specter</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.670" end="01:41:23.750" style="s2">or the matrix of representation yeah</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.010" end="01:41:25.850" style="s2">exactly right exactly where it perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.750" end="01:41:27.920" style="s2">it also has to do with some to some</p>

<p begin="01:41:27.920" end="01:41:31.670" style="s2">mortality to but it is I think outside</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.570" end="01:41:36.100" style="s2">of representation it&#39;s no longer you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.670" end="01:41:39.020" style="s2">not looked at a case like this yeah well</p>

<p begin="01:42:11.420" end="01:42:17.659" style="s2">are as I con rightly says radically evil</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.080" end="01:42:21.519" style="s2">evil at the root da you</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.659" end="01:42:24.800" style="s2">things that happen right in the world -</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.519" end="01:42:26.780" style="s2">very often unfortunately because people</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.800" end="01:42:30.349" style="s2">thought they were doing good and they</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.780" end="01:42:32.809" style="s2">wanted to do good yeah but but then</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.349" end="01:42:35.090" style="s2">again I I wonder sometimes that perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.809" end="01:42:39.400" style="s2">you know people talk about the the rise</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.090" end="01:42:44.389" style="s2">of people who are depressed yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.400" end="01:42:47.030" style="s2">what is it yeah that is depression yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.389" end="01:42:49.369" style="s2">pointing to what is what it was what is</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.030" end="01:42:53.510" style="s2">what is that what is it no how does</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.369" end="01:42:56.360" style="s2">depression know to respond as depression</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.510" end="01:42:58.610" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s the part like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.360" end="01:43:02.929" style="s2">noticed with and I think it&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.610" end="01:43:07.510" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about is is like the</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.929" end="01:43:10.969" style="s2">listening to someone really happens when</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.510" end="01:43:12.949" style="s2">it&#39;s like one is like if they&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.969" end="01:43:16.610" style="s2">attention to anything there&#39;s a response</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.949" end="01:43:18.739" style="s2">right yeah that that&#39;s like it&#39;s if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.610" end="01:43:20.329" style="s2">it it&#39;s precisely that it&#39;s like what do</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.739" end="01:43:23.150" style="s2">you respond to - that you would be</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.329" end="01:43:26.659" style="s2">talking about this what is it that how</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.150" end="01:43:28.249" style="s2">does how does attention know to attend</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.659" end="01:43:30.860" style="s2">to this what is this</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.249" end="01:43:33.169" style="s2">and what&#39;s that which is worthy of that</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.860" end="01:43:34.820" style="s2">response like a mystery you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.169" end="01:43:38.780" style="s2">interesting is like you start to to</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.820" end="01:43:41.050" style="s2">things it&#39;s like the one is it starts to</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.780" end="01:43:45.489" style="s2">reveal</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.050" end="01:43:47.230" style="s2">a caer an implicit care on on their</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.489" end="01:43:49.090" style="s2">behalf that their respondent that</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.230" end="01:43:52.599" style="s2">they&#39;re responding is so it reveals on</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.090" end="01:43:54.579" style="s2">one level this kind of the horizons the</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.599" end="01:43:56.530" style="s2">backgrounds of what&#39;s going on with them</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.579" end="01:43:59.579" style="s2">which is usually historical on some</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.530" end="01:43:59.579" style="s2">level right</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.320" end="01:44:05.480" style="s2">just there comporting in that way ravit</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.690" end="01:44:08.570" style="s2">also reveals a world in which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.480" end="01:44:10.940" style="s2">attempting to reveal but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.570" end="01:44:13.010" style="s2">the sense of like that it reveals that</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.940" end="01:44:16.369" style="s2">revealing is happening so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.010" end="01:44:18.409" style="s2">quality of just they actually start yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.369" end="01:44:22.310" style="s2">actually I think what it is it may</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.409" end="01:44:26.810" style="s2">actually be where they actually hear</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.310" end="01:44:29.929" style="s2">themselves as as something that is</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.810" end="01:44:33.020" style="s2">beyond their representation right and</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.929" end="01:44:37.610" style="s2">it&#39;s that kind of sense of like oh my</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.020" end="01:44:40.880" style="s2">god like more than I can I am more than</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.610" end="01:44:42.290" style="s2">I can conceive well you know what one</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.880" end="01:44:44.869" style="s2">could say miss Logan I&#39;m gonna have to</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.290" end="01:44:49.099" style="s2">be careful with it&#39;s the being kicks in</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.869" end="01:44:51.800" style="s2">and representation drops this is to</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.099" end="01:44:54.829" style="s2">simply put but it does sound like a</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.800" end="01:44:56.960" style="s2">great t-shirt yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.829" end="01:45:00.820" style="s2">you can have it love it too long for a</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.960" end="01:45:03.860" style="s2">coffee cup ya know but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.820" end="01:45:06.380" style="s2">right one of the things I&#39;ve said as</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.860" end="01:45:08.440" style="s2">well and it&#39;s I&#39;m not sure with it I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.380" end="01:45:12.829" style="s2">been able to because I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.440" end="01:45:15.110" style="s2">made it clear enough um is it what</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.829" end="01:45:18.469" style="s2">perhaps we are witnessing and happen</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.110" end="01:45:22.250" style="s2">it&#39;s only just now you know showing</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.469" end="01:45:27.320" style="s2">itself really really more too horribly</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.250" end="01:45:31.790" style="s2">them before is the apocalypse of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.320" end="01:45:37.340" style="s2">subject its opening up to is its its</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.790" end="01:45:41.260" style="s2">utmost maximum of what it can control</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.340" end="01:45:44.800" style="s2">and wants to control and manage and</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.260" end="01:45:47.960" style="s2">finds itself I think increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.800" end="01:45:52.179" style="s2">incapacitated to do so but this constant</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.960" end="01:45:54.530" style="s2">talk of crisis as a crisis in everything</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.179" end="01:45:55.570" style="s2">however the word has become basically</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.530" end="01:46:00.790" style="s2">meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.570" end="01:46:05.300" style="s2">well it seems to be could be that deep</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.790" end="01:46:08.809" style="s2">the worlds of power has pushed to an</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.300" end="01:46:10.790" style="s2">utmost limit where it finds it it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.809" end="01:46:13.610" style="s2">longer powerful it can no longer will</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.790" end="01:46:15.429" style="s2">control it would have to say</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.610" end="01:46:18.500" style="s2">death let&#39;s just put it like this</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.429" end="01:46:20.060" style="s2">without facing death everything is</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.500" end="01:46:22.730" style="s2">turning to a crisis without ever</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.060" end="01:46:26.060" style="s2">becoming a crisis and a crisis is a</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.730" end="01:46:29.449" style="s2">moment of decision and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.060" end="01:46:32.960" style="s2">describing I can only as a as a as an</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.449" end="01:46:35.480" style="s2">and someone who listens and spectator so</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.960" end="01:46:38.360" style="s2">now a participant in it and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.480" end="01:46:41.690" style="s2">be asked those but what I think is</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.360" end="01:46:44.480" style="s2">perhaps showing there is that what we</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.690" end="01:46:49.429" style="s2">call subjectivity in the philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.480" end="01:46:52.550" style="s2">sense which means an enclosed Ness the</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.429" end="01:46:54.889" style="s2">split from the world and to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.550" end="01:46:57.500" style="s2">now of course in a schizophrenic sense</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.889" end="01:47:00.380" style="s2">of a split from oneself because you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.500" end="01:47:02.300" style="s2">the way people talk is of themselves in</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.380" end="01:47:06.800" style="s2">the representational manner as if there</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.300" end="01:47:08.719" style="s2">is something behind them which which is</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.800" end="01:47:10.670" style="s2">from which point they speak about</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.719" end="01:47:15.170" style="s2">themselves in this reflect constant</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.670" end="01:47:18.969" style="s2">reflective manner um then that drops</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.170" end="01:47:24.080" style="s2">away oh and then this sense of being</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.969" end="01:47:29.449" style="s2">seen shines through which which which</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.080" end="01:47:31.730" style="s2">reveals another way of being human if</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.449" end="01:47:34.699" style="s2">you like right a deeper way which is</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.730" end="01:47:36.530" style="s2">what I think it would call design way</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.699" end="01:47:39.199" style="s2">it&#39;s shown that it&#39;s always already</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.530" end="01:47:41.409" style="s2">being with others right it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.199" end="01:47:46.010" style="s2">already been being in the world yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.409" end="01:47:51.949" style="s2">yeah I hope in it there is that quality</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.010" end="01:47:56.150" style="s2">to of you know it&#39;s like I think your</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.949" end="01:47:58.159" style="s2">own young talks about this it where yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.150" end="01:48:01.340" style="s2">a lot of people read young and then they</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.159" end="01:48:04.610" style="s2">they they kind of like they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.340" end="01:48:07.040" style="s2">realize how much he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.610" end="01:48:08.719" style="s2">especially with the shadow right the</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.040" end="01:48:11.330" style="s2">notion of the shadow which is the first</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.719" end="01:48:13.369" style="s2">thing that you contend with it when you</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.330" end="01:48:15.860" style="s2">do Union analysis and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.369" end="01:48:18.190" style="s2">and people usually think of like you get</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.860" end="01:48:22.730" style="s2">to the shadow by reflecting on yourself</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.190" end="01:48:24.889" style="s2">right and you was like no people forget</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.730" end="01:48:27.530" style="s2">that he&#39;s writing this in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.889" end="01:48:30.170" style="s2">of what he&#39;s discovering in a</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.530" end="01:48:33.860" style="s2">relationship with somebody that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.170" end="01:48:35.690" style="s2">it&#39;s in and I never it just recently I</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.860" end="01:48:41.150" style="s2">started to realize like oh yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.690" end="01:48:45.020" style="s2">ties into how genuine listening and see</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.150" end="01:48:48.110" style="s2">genuinely being with somebody begins is</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.020" end="01:48:50.780" style="s2">precisely when you realize that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.110" end="01:48:53.690" style="s2">it&#39;s that you&#39;re projecting on to the</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.780" end="01:48:57.020" style="s2">other person great and then you start to</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.690" end="01:48:59.929" style="s2">see that in a certain sense oh that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.020" end="01:49:04.040" style="s2">projecting I wasn&#39;t actually listening</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.929" end="01:49:05.630" style="s2">to you right it&#39;s that hearing that you</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.040" end="01:49:09.320" style="s2">weren&#39;t hearing as the moment that</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.630" end="01:49:11.270" style="s2">hearing begins right it&#39;s uh that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.320" end="01:49:13.540" style="s2">thing about listening this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.270" end="01:49:15.560" style="s2">one of the trickiest things of of</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.540" end="01:49:18.230" style="s2">teaching people how to listen</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.560" end="01:49:21.070" style="s2">that&#39;s all you can&#39;t you all you can do</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.230" end="01:49:23.900" style="s2">is to show people that they&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.070" end="01:49:27.409" style="s2">the moment they can hear that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.900" end="01:49:29.750" style="s2">not hearing yes is the moment that that</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.409" end="01:49:34.610" style="s2">that that that something else breaks</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.750" end="01:49:39.199" style="s2">through and no yes but it is similarly</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.610" end="01:49:41.600" style="s2">thinking when our borrow our mo artists</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.199" end="01:49:45.560" style="s2">they say is is a different one it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.600" end="01:49:49.429" style="s2">one of positivism we&#39;re just hearing by</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.560" end="01:49:52.460" style="s2">you know by using our own tech substrate</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.429" end="01:49:55.340" style="s2">here as here as receivers of sound waves</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.460" end="01:49:57.560" style="s2">yeah you know I&#39;m hearing you cuz you</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.340" end="01:50:00.530" style="s2">and I we&#39;re having a conversation of</p>

<p begin="01:52:30.410" end="01:52:35.480" style="s2">be formalized is the negation of the</p>

<p begin="01:52:35.480" end="01:52:42.140" style="s2">negativity and that spirit spirit is</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.700" end="01:52:45.920" style="s2">negativity yeah yeah that roams freely</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.140" end="01:52:50.989" style="s2">in history and it&#39;s upon us to grasp</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.920" end="01:52:53.150" style="s2">this conceptually and then to quarrel</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.989" end="01:52:56.060" style="s2">over and fight over what the meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.150" end="01:52:58.630" style="s2">freedom is freedom is not the given</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.060" end="01:53:02.660" style="s2">you&#39;re not given freedom by some</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.630" end="01:53:04.969" style="s2">Constitution or or here&#39;s your negative</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.660" end="01:53:08.690" style="s2">freedom now you can do whatever you want</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.969" end="01:53:10.700" style="s2">oh it&#39;s yeah freedom is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.690" end="01:53:14.150" style="s2">fought over precisely for this reason</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.700" end="01:53:16.190" style="s2">right is that it&#39;s not a given yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.150" end="01:53:18.219" style="s2">like it&#39;s almost it&#39;s it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.190" end="01:53:21.170" style="s2">reading with Chris</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.219" end="01:53:24.170" style="s2">reading reading this Socratic dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.170" end="01:53:28.310" style="s2">like that it&#39;s it&#39;s it seems like what</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.170" end="01:53:30.620" style="s2">Socrates is doing is easy yes sorry but</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.310" end="01:53:32.390" style="s2">look this is philosophically very</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.620" end="01:53:34.969" style="s2">important they&#39;re people people people</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.390" end="01:53:37.370" style="s2">people with people so I will not say</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.969" end="01:53:40.400" style="s2">people because it&#39;s a bit awful this is</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.370" end="01:53:42.500" style="s2">so apologies in general I think the</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.400" end="01:53:46.520" style="s2">assumption is that there are two worlds</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.500" end="01:53:50.540" style="s2">in Plato there aren&#39;t and Plato&#39;s does</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.520" end="01:53:51.050" style="s2">not say that the tree this tree over</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.540" end="01:53:55.340" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.050" end="01:54:00.350" style="s2">is not is is not really he says it&#39;s men</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.340" end="01:54:04.910" style="s2">on men on it&#39;s not fully being but in</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.350" end="01:54:07.130" style="s2">this not fully being it is yeah it is</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.910" end="01:54:10.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s not fully but it then</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.130" end="01:54:13.280" style="s2">becomes full insofar as the thinking</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.430" end="01:54:17.330" style="s2">being participates in this occurrence</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.280" end="01:54:20.180" style="s2">and must articulate the being of this</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.330" end="01:54:22.520" style="s2">being yes right right yeah this is what</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.180" end="01:54:25.670" style="s2">all of thinking has to do we are</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.520" end="01:54:31.070" style="s2">participants and suffering participants</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.670" end="01:54:34.040" style="s2">of this ongoing occurrence and to state</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.070" end="01:54:36.380" style="s2">with Heinicke being is rare not</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.040" end="01:54:39.290" style="s2">everything that&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.380" end="01:54:42.020" style="s2">Polly is yeah right and this is also why</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.290" end="01:54:46.610" style="s2">I&#39;m in this time that&#39;s accelerating and</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.020" end="01:54:48.770" style="s2">exploding everybody wants to be and then</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.610" end="01:54:51.640" style="s2">it turns out as representational it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.770" end="01:54:55.160" style="s2">like this and it&#39;s like that and</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.640" end="01:54:57.080" style="s2">schematized and I can be easily rehashed</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.160" end="01:55:01.040" style="s2">etc you can make all these points about</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.080" end="01:55:03.590" style="s2">capital than to you can it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.040" end="01:55:04.970" style="s2">becoming a bit of a platonic Kay friend</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.590" end="01:55:06.260" style="s2">we&#39;re sitting in these rooms and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.970" end="01:55:08.420" style="s2">looking at each other&#39;s screens and</p>

<p begin="01:55:08.420" end="01:55:16.490" style="s2">um but at the same time is we when when</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.330" end="01:55:17.630" style="s2">you read these dialogue would you I mean</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.490" end="01:55:20.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I didn&#39;t know what you want</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.630" end="01:55:21.440" style="s2">to say but it&#39;s very important to point</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.000" end="01:55:23.510" style="s2">out that height that Plato does not</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.440" end="01:55:26.120" style="s2">speak of two different worlds right but</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.510" end="01:55:29.960" style="s2">that we always have to think negation</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.120" end="01:55:32.240" style="s2">yeah in order to actually arrive at all</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.960" end="01:55:34.700" style="s2">that will be now called reality yeah</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.240" end="01:55:37.520" style="s2">reality is not just here here&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.700" end="01:55:40.280" style="s2">these things yes yes this reality</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.520" end="01:55:43.880" style="s2">reality arises from out of negation yeah</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.280" end="01:55:45.610" style="s2">out of also ups Tolson right um for</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.880" end="01:55:48.920" style="s2">Eagle it would be up chosen which is</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.610" end="01:55:51.320" style="s2">pushing away yeah pushing away from the</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.920" end="01:55:54.110" style="s2">immediate which is exactly the story of</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.320" end="01:55:55.970" style="s2">the cave by just looking at the shadows</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.110" end="01:55:59.330" style="s2">these people are not ever dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.970" end="01:56:01.940" style="s2">being they&#39;re not ever the the the the</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.330" end="01:56:04.670" style="s2">the the prisoners of the cave as it were</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.940" end="01:56:07.550" style="s2">then I never you even becoming free</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.670" end="01:56:10.040" style="s2">right right but they think they are free</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.550" end="01:56:12.530" style="s2">because they can remember us you know</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.040" end="01:56:14.540" style="s2">the the right order of the shadows pass</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.530" end="01:56:18.350" style="s2">right by right but it&#39;s actually in</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.540" end="01:56:21.230" style="s2">pushing away from it in yeah saying no</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.350" end="01:56:23.360" style="s2">yeah and withdrawal yeah that the</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.230" end="01:56:26.090" style="s2">original concealment begins to</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.360" end="01:56:28.850" style="s2">unconcealed or a while then with</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.090" end="01:56:32.000" style="s2">Heidegger again just coming back into</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.850" end="01:56:35.060" style="s2">the cave appreciating the concealment</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.000" end="01:56:36.560" style="s2">yes yes and that&#39;s kind of what another</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.060" end="01:56:41.830" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve noticed against in these in</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.560" end="01:56:45.050" style="s2">these dialogues as Socrates he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.830" end="01:56:47.330" style="s2">you know basically asking a question and</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.050" end="01:56:49.719" style="s2">then they start talking about it and</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.330" end="01:56:51.940" style="s2">like everything at like</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.719" end="01:56:53.829" style="s2">all of this information gets it gets</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.940" end="01:56:55.539" style="s2">more frustrating and they go around then</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.829" end="01:56:58.150" style="s2">Socrates doesn&#39;t even know what the</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.539" end="01:57:02.110" style="s2">virtue is and and at some point there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.150" end="01:57:05.320" style="s2">this a pot like this aporia where the</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.110" end="01:57:08.440" style="s2">thing that that can&#39;t be said in the</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.320" end="01:57:11.380" style="s2">dialogue becomes present right this kind</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.440" end="01:57:14.070" style="s2">of sense of where we&#39;re and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.380" end="01:57:14.070" style="s2">that sense of</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.310" end="01:57:20.400" style="s2">of all those kind of apparatus questions</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.360" end="01:57:21.660" style="s2">that been bringing you up to the limit</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.400" end="01:57:25.370" style="s2">of your represent eight you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.660" end="01:57:27.930" style="s2">representing right yes yes to the</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.370" end="01:57:30.180" style="s2">represent so I would not stop at the</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.930" end="01:57:31.560" style="s2">aporia right that&#39;s often the mistake</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.180" end="01:57:35.040" style="s2">that&#39;s middle is just all ends in the</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.560" end="01:57:38.700" style="s2">poor you know really does gaming of it</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.040" end="01:57:40.740" style="s2">yes exactly exactly in there it gets it</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.700" end="01:57:42.690" style="s2">gets symbolized right I think it gets</p>

<p begin="01:59:33.570" end="01:59:41.730" style="s2">formula that can be taken from Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.070" end="01:59:44.699" style="s2">and and and even Hegel is even more you</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.730" end="01:59:47.849" style="s2">one can unfortunately an easily attack</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.699" end="01:59:52.800" style="s2">Hegel on these grounds it&#39;s as you know</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.849" end="01:59:55.500" style="s2">some people did very very prominently</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.800" end="01:59:58.829" style="s2">Karl Marx thought that he could use</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.500" end="02:00:01.019" style="s2">Hickam dialectics to see the future but</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.829" end="02:00:04.110" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a perfect example of what</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.019" end="02:00:06.690" style="s2">representation is it assumes it can see</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.110" end="02:00:09.210" style="s2">the future just by the right method for</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.690" end="02:00:12.420" style="s2">example but the utopian wonderful state</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.210" end="02:00:14.610" style="s2">which is inevitably come ah it if all we</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.420" end="02:00:17.550" style="s2">do is get the dialectics right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.610" end="02:00:19.920" style="s2">for presentation yeah and I to get you</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.550" end="02:00:22.500" style="s2">you cannot make him instrumental you you</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.920" end="02:00:24.420" style="s2">it&#39;s completely impossible</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.500" end="02:00:26.639" style="s2">yeah it it&#39;s and in this sense its</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.420" end="02:00:28.980" style="s2">operatic but it&#39;s only a poetic for a</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.639" end="02:00:31.860" style="s2">representation not for thinking thinking</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.980" end="02:00:35.730" style="s2">itself is always on the way Heidegger</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.860" end="02:00:39.409" style="s2">says yeah but it is is it&#39;s coming it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.730" end="02:00:42.150" style="s2">about coming home um and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.409" end="02:00:46.110" style="s2">ultimately about dwelling and dwelling</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.150" end="02:00:48.510" style="s2">means to come home it means to come home</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.110" end="02:00:50.519" style="s2">but going out and then coming home going</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.510" end="02:00:53.849" style="s2">out going out as this negation right</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.519" end="02:00:57.840" style="s2">this moment of saying no leaving the</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.849" end="02:01:00.230" style="s2">cave yeah coming back in right and this</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.840" end="02:01:03.630" style="s2">is I think these are the moments of of</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.230" end="02:01:06.360" style="s2">moments but this is what what finding is</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.630" end="02:01:09.780" style="s2">concealed and guarded and concentrated</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.360" end="02:01:11.579" style="s2">and sheltered in death yeah yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.780" end="02:01:15.690" style="s2">is something about is something I just</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.579" end="02:01:18.809" style="s2">wanted to talk with you about to you</p>

<p begin="02:03:38.260" end="02:03:45.250" style="s2">written in the 40s and this is where</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.620" end="02:03:48.220" style="s2">Heidegger begins to think in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.250" end="02:03:51.880" style="s2">Agnes which I will leave on trans I</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.220" end="02:03:55.360" style="s2">think event is a poor translation but I</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.880" end="02:03:58.030" style="s2">use is well I shouldn&#39;t really say what</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.360" end="02:03:59.070" style="s2">is but he comes he comes into this</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.030" end="02:04:04.840" style="s2">thinking enhanced</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.070" end="02:04:07.180" style="s2">begins to see something where he thinks</p>

<p begin="02:04:07.180" end="02:04:17.680" style="s2">that needs to be thought so it just it</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.020" end="02:04:19.870" style="s2">needs to be thought it thinks in me says</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.680" end="02:04:23.170" style="s2">at some point to his brother that</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.870" end="02:04:28.210" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing he can do about this and</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.170" end="02:04:31.570" style="s2">this is what&#39;s so strange to to modern I</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.210" end="02:04:33.250" style="s2">think human beings because you know you</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.570" end="02:04:34.480" style="s2">have this opinion I have this opinion I</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.250" end="02:04:38.770" style="s2">think it&#39;s this isn&#39;t you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.480" end="02:04:40.780" style="s2">that ISM but it maybe it isn&#39;t maybe it</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.770" end="02:04:43.870" style="s2">is really that some things have to be</p>
<p begin="02:04:40.780" end="02:04:45.340" style="s2">thought and there has to be some</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.870" end="02:04:47.470" style="s2">thoughts have to be thorn and they have</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.340" end="02:04:52.180" style="s2">to be thought thoroughly and this is</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.470" end="02:04:54.490" style="s2">what he does knowing however that</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.180" end="02:04:57.730" style="s2">nothing that is thought and place we had</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.490" end="02:05:01.300" style="s2">exist near this as well can ever be</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.730" end="02:05:05.230" style="s2">fully recorded we should not conflate</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.300" end="02:05:08.080" style="s2">the books someone writes with the</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.230" end="02:05:11.050" style="s2">thought yeah we still have to think when</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.080" end="02:05:12.199" style="s2">we read the books the books are gateways</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.050" end="02:05:14.420" style="s2">they&#39;re necessary</p>
