<p begin="00:00:18.170" end="00:00:21.170" style="s2">at the advent of the Scientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.550" end="00:00:25.490" style="s2">Revolution and we looked at the work of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.170" end="00:00:27.560" style="s2">Copernicus and how the important advent</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.490" end="00:00:31.070" style="s2">of a scientific description of reality</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.560" end="00:00:33.920" style="s2">had with it the consequence that most of</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.070" end="00:00:37.570" style="s2">our experience our sensory experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.920" end="00:00:41.090" style="s2">was questionable as illusory in nature</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.570" end="00:00:45.949" style="s2">galileo also developed that idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.090" end="00:00:48.409" style="s2">math as the language of reality and use</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.949" end="00:00:50.600" style="s2">that with the new experimental method a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.409" end="00:00:54.260" style="s2">method also born out of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.600" end="00:00:56.989" style="s2">most of our cognition is deceptive and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.260" end="00:01:00.320" style="s2">biasing in nature and he used that to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.989" end="00:01:02.150" style="s2">discover inertial motion and that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.320" end="00:01:04.699" style="s2">change the notion of matter into</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.150" end="00:01:07.430" style="s2">something that exists and resists our</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.699" end="00:01:09.890" style="s2">will but that had the effect of killing</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.430" end="00:01:14.270" style="s2">the universe and making it purposeless</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.890" end="00:01:17.570" style="s2">in nature and thus we become odd islands</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.270" end="00:01:20.840" style="s2">of meaning and purpose in a vast ocean</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.570" end="00:01:26.780" style="s2">of meaningless purposeless material</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.840" end="00:01:29.030" style="s2">motion so all of that of course is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.780" end="00:01:31.310" style="s2">have an impact on people&#39;s self</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.890" end="00:01:42.350" style="s2">happening here that Aristotelian idea</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:11.780" style="s2">an individual that takes all of this up</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:13.940" style="s2">and he does more than just think about</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.780" end="00:02:16.280" style="s2">this or speak about it or write about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.940" end="00:02:20.450" style="s2">he&#39;s one of those really Titanic</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.280" end="00:02:23.989" style="s2">individuals who exemplifies the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.450" end="00:02:25.060" style="s2">and the anxiety of his time this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.989" end="00:02:27.620" style="s2">Martin Luther</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.060" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">he&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.620" end="00:02:31.790" style="s2">deeply influenced he&#39;s German he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:34.130" style="s2">deeply influenced by the Rheinland</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.790" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">mystics he&#39;s influenced by that growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.130" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">tradition of the self as radically self</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:45.400" style="s2">negating inner conflict being at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:45.400" style="s2">core of spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.670" end="00:02:52.099" style="s2">he&#39;s an Augustinian monk he&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.530" end="00:02:55.870" style="s2">influenced by Augustine&#39;s ideas of self</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.099" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">depravity and our inability to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.870" end="00:03:01.910" style="s2">mystical union with God unaided and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:05.150" style="s2">through Augustine Luther of course is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.910" end="00:03:09.290" style="s2">deeply immersed in and impressed with</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.150" end="00:03:12.260" style="s2">Paul&#39;s ideas about our inner conflict</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.290" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">and now that parallels a conflict within</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.260" end="00:03:19.280" style="s2">God between God&#39;s love towards us and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:21.769" style="s2">God&#39;s justice driven anger and wrath</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.280" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">towards us and Martin Luther is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.769" end="00:03:29.480" style="s2">terrified of that wrath he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">terrified of it and he has taken that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.480" end="00:03:36.489" style="s2">notion through Tyler of mystical self</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:39.560" style="s2">negation and it has become radicalized</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.489" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">because of the influence of Augustine</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.560" end="00:03:45.799" style="s2">and Paul and his own inner conflict so</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:50.569" style="s2">that the self negation in Luther&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.799" end="00:03:54.530" style="s2">psyche has become self-loathing he</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.569" end="00:03:57.799" style="s2">experiences the self as radically folded</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.530" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">into itself obsessed with itself in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.799" end="00:04:06.500" style="s2">completely immoral self-centered fashion</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:10.780" style="s2">so the self is this radical self feeding</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.500" end="00:04:13.130" style="s2">self negating because as the self is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.780" end="00:04:15.530" style="s2">unfolded and obsessed with itself it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.130" end="00:04:22.190" style="s2">simultaneously being cut off from God</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.530" end="00:04:26.600" style="s2">and cut off from reality so it is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.190" end="00:04:28.870" style="s2">much a self-destructive process and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.600" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">really want you to hear that self</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.870" end="00:04:35.539" style="s2">destructive process that he sees as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:37.849" style="s2">essence of the self so this is Luther&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.539" end="00:04:40.970" style="s2">interpretation of the biblical notion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.849" end="00:04:41.449" style="s2">pride and rebellion against God that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.970" end="00:04:47.289" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.449" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">intrinsically self-obsessed in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.289" end="00:04:55.099" style="s2">self-aggrandizing self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:58.159" style="s2">fashion so try to try to think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.099" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">moments in your life that will give some</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.159" end="00:05:03.909" style="s2">substance to what Luther is saying you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:06.349" style="s2">have discovered a pattern of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.909" end="00:05:08.900" style="s2">self-destructive for example perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.349" end="00:05:11.779" style="s2">keep dating the same kind of person and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.900" end="00:05:14.659" style="s2">you keep going back to this and it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.779" end="00:05:16.159" style="s2">turning out to be wrong for you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.659" end="00:05:18.439" style="s2">perhaps also wrong for the other person</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.159" end="00:05:20.180" style="s2">so you step back and you&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.439" end="00:05:22.550" style="s2">friends and you reflect it and you make</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.180" end="00:05:24.740" style="s2">a deliberate conscious effort oh no no</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.550" end="00:05:26.689" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to date this purse this</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.740" end="00:05:28.039" style="s2">kind of person anymore I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.689" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">date that type of person I&#39;m gonna date</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.039" end="00:05:32.389" style="s2">this type of person and that will change</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:35.270" style="s2">things I&#39;ll break this pattern and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.389" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">go in and you find somebody they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.270" end="00:05:40.870" style="s2">be totally different and you start</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">dating them and then lo and behold</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.870" end="00:05:45.860" style="s2">against your will even though it seems</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.469" style="s2">to be something that you willfully</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:52.419" style="s2">brought about you find yourself caught</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.469" end="00:05:55.580" style="s2">in the same destructive pattern again</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.419" end="00:05:58.360" style="s2">and of course Freud and Jung and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.580" end="00:06:00.819" style="s2">whole psychodynamic tradition very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.360" end="00:06:03.469" style="s2">part of the legacy of Luther by the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.819" end="00:06:06.020" style="s2">are gonna make much of that fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.469" end="00:06:08.930" style="s2">keep repeating even in our conscience</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.020" end="00:06:10.819" style="s2">efforts to change our behavior we keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.930" end="00:06:14.629" style="s2">repeating these self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.819" end="00:06:16.999" style="s2">patterns so although I&#39;m critical of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.629" end="00:06:20.389" style="s2">Luther there&#39;s a deep truth here in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.999" end="00:06:22.449" style="s2">Luther right there is the touching of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.389" end="00:06:25.849" style="s2">the group the way in which our</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.449" end="00:06:29.870" style="s2">unconscious processes or unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.849" end="00:06:31.909" style="s2">cognition can be beset with these we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.870" end="00:06:34.279" style="s2">talked about these parasitic processes</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.909" end="00:06:39.229" style="s2">that have a life of their own and can</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.279" end="00:06:43.550" style="s2">consume us so Luther is convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.229" end="00:06:48.159" style="s2">he cannot do anything to save himself he</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.550" end="00:06:50.719" style="s2">takes Augustine&#39;s notion right that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.159" end="00:06:52.610" style="s2">Neoplatonic mystical ascent is</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.719" end="00:06:54.180" style="s2">insufficient on its own and has to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.610" end="00:06:56.390" style="s2">supplemented with</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.180" end="00:07:00.120" style="s2">you know the love of God through Christ</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.390" end="00:07:02.070" style="s2">he takes that and he radicalizes it in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.120" end="00:07:04.410" style="s2">very powerful way because of his own</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.070" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">personal wretchedness he comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.410" end="00:07:12.990" style="s2">conclusion that there is nothing he can</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:16.340" style="s2">do and that leads into a startling</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.990" end="00:07:18.840" style="s2">interpretation of Paul an interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.340" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">that is going to put him at odds with</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.840" end="00:07:23.220" style="s2">the Catholic Church and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:28.140" style="s2">interpretation that we are saved by</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.220" end="00:07:35.780" style="s2">faith alone where faith becomes nothing</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.140" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">more than a complete acceptance of God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.780" end="00:07:41.370" style="s2">saving grace so let&#39;s unpack this very</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:44.310" style="s2">carefully because it&#39;s become so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.370" end="00:07:50.540" style="s2">immersed in our way of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.310" end="00:07:54.470" style="s2">being the idea here is that faith has is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.540" end="00:07:58.590" style="s2">right it notice what&#39;s happened all that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.470" end="00:08:00.450" style="s2">sense of part participatory knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.590" end="00:08:02.760" style="s2">sense that we&#39;re participating in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.450" end="00:08:04.680" style="s2">process remember the Israelite notion</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.760" end="00:08:06.630" style="s2">that we&#39;re participating in our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.680" end="00:08:08.460" style="s2">history were participating in the</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.570" end="00:09:27.900" style="s2">of this equation it means that God&#39;s act</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.820" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">of saving you is completely arbitrary</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.450" end="00:09:54.760" style="s2">between Lutheran Erasmus Erasmus tried</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.760" end="00:10:00.190" style="s2">the human being and God were working</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.830" end="00:10:15.460" style="s2">completely arbitrary so God has become</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.840" end="00:10:18.370" style="s2">right remember what we talked about an</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.460" end="00:10:19.000" style="s2">ahkam right that God&#39;s will supersedes</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:33.160" style="s2">it is just an arbitrary act of will that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:38.080" style="s2">saves us and we have to radically accept</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.160" end="00:10:43.660" style="s2">that arbitrariness now think about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.080" end="00:10:46.090" style="s2">that means and there&#39;s a weird there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.660" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">an irony here there&#39;s an irony here and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.090" end="00:10:53.590" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s almost a self-referential</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:55.810" style="s2">irony because Luther is trying and I I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.590" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">think he&#39;s he&#39;s very sincere but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.810" end="00:11:03.820" style="s2">trying to rescue us from right the fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2">that we are obsessed with ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.820" end="00:11:09.070" style="s2">an idolatrous fashion and that we that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.670" end="00:11:10.540" style="s2">that obsession is one a source of deep</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.000" end="00:11:24.370" style="s2">cuts us off separates us but the irony</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.360" end="00:11:27.610" style="s2">is in his endeavors to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.370" end="00:11:29.470" style="s2">look at what Luther is teaching what</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.610" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">he&#39;s what is he what is he putting into</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.470" end="00:11:38.440" style="s2">our cultural grammar that we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:41.380" style="s2">inherently worthless and that our inner</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.440" end="00:11:45.310" style="s2">life is one of self-loathing and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.380" end="00:11:53.110" style="s2">only solution to that is arbitrary or</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.310" end="00:11:56.430" style="s2">betray unearned regard this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.110" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">cultural training for narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.430" end="00:12:03.180" style="s2">narcissism is to be trapped to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">self-obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.180" end="00:12:11.950" style="s2">within self-loathing and that what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:16.090" style="s2">want to alleviate is unearned positive</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.950" end="00:12:20.700" style="s2">regard not for any reason not for</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.090" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">anything you&#39;ve done completely amoral</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.700" end="00:12:25.870" style="s2">unearned positive regard that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:30.730" style="s2">narcissism so the one of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.870" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">ironies of Luther&#39;s revolution is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.730" end="00:12:37.060" style="s2">and I think this says something about</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:39.220" style="s2">what&#39;s going on at the time what are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.060" end="00:12:44.440" style="s2">deep ironies is he actually lays the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.220" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">grammar for cultural narcissism we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.440" end="00:12:50.140" style="s2">all being trained to experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.570" end="00:12:53.460" style="s2">ourselves as wretched self-obsessed and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.140" end="00:13:00.940" style="s2">that the only solution is unearned</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.460" end="00:13:04.540" style="s2">positive regard and so we can see we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.940" end="00:13:08.740" style="s2">see the spirit of Luther in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.540" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">obsession with Instagram and our</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.740" end="00:13:19.140" style="s2">obsession with snapchat we constantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">want unearned positive regard now</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.140" end="00:13:26.710" style="s2">there are other consequences of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.760" end="00:13:29.790" style="s2">radical change of course immediate</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.710" end="00:13:34.270" style="s2">consequences Luther comes into conflict</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.790" end="00:13:36.630" style="s2">he protests against the Roman Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.270" end="00:13:39.520" style="s2">Church that&#39;s what Protestant comes from</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.630" end="00:13:41.650" style="s2">because the Catholic Church has a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.520" end="00:13:44.170" style="s2">different doctrine of salvation right</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.650" end="00:13:51.180" style="s2">that it&#39;s one in which the human being</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.170" end="00:13:56.080" style="s2">has still has a participatory role and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.180" end="00:13:58.600" style="s2">because of that the church also thinks</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.080" end="00:14:00.730" style="s2">that its cultural history think of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.600" end="00:14:03.300" style="s2">this is still an Israelite notion the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.730" end="00:14:06.250" style="s2">church still thinks that it&#39;s tradition</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.300" end="00:14:08.590" style="s2">matters for human salvation that</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.060" end="00:14:19.000" style="s2">needed now I&#39;m not advocating for</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.170" end="00:14:21.970" style="s2">Catholicism here over Protestantism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.000" end="00:14:28.360" style="s2">trying to get you to understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.970" end="00:14:30.070" style="s2">two sides were standing for so Luther is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.360" end="00:14:32.050" style="s2">attacking all of that he&#39;s attacking the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.070" end="00:14:34.630" style="s2">authority of the church he&#39;s attacking</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.050" end="00:14:38.710" style="s2">the authority of tradition so history</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.630" end="00:14:44.950" style="s2">and tradition an institution don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.710" end="00:14:47.740" style="s2">matter why because Luther is a child of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.950" end="00:14:52.120" style="s2">his time he is trapped inside his own</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.740" end="00:14:54.390" style="s2">mind he advocates that all that really</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.120" end="00:15:00.520" style="s2">matters in matters of faith are with</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.390" end="00:15:02.590" style="s2">individual conscience and please</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.520" end="00:15:05.320" style="s2">remember what this word means it means</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.590" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">knowing yourself science kansai ins</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.320" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">conscience knowing yourself the one</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:18.580" style="s2">thing you know is yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:22.540" style="s2">and so Luther refuses to recant he</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.580" end="00:15:24.010" style="s2">refuses to change his interpretation to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.540" end="00:15:27.580" style="s2">be in line with the church and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.010" end="00:15:30.790" style="s2">valorizes individual conscience as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.580" end="00:15:33.270" style="s2">final authority over a person&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.270" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">this lays the foundation so do you see</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.830" end="00:15:39.940" style="s2">what&#39;s happened here this withdrawal of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:42.870" style="s2">meaning into the individual mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.940" end="00:15:45.580" style="s2">isolated individual mind is now being</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.870" end="00:15:48.310" style="s2">appropriated as well that must mean that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.580" end="00:15:52.920" style="s2">the mind the individual conscience is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.310" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">the final sole authority of what matters</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.920" end="00:15:58.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a radical idea many other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:16:03.070" style="s2">find this a bizarre idea that we possess</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.750" end="00:16:05.340" style="s2">in the West and so of course there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.070" end="00:16:08.890" style="s2">lot of discussion nowadays about</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.340" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">individual responsibility individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.890" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">authority we have as Adorno talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:17.860" style="s2">it we have a cult of authenticity that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:20.650" style="s2">being true to yourself and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.860" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">Lutheran being true to yourself is the</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.250" end="00:16:35.050" style="s2">what has happened the connection to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.170" end="00:16:39.000" style="s2">reality being true to reality has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.050" end="00:16:43.930" style="s2">superseded by being true to yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.000" end="00:16:45.670" style="s2">it that is also emerging with a cultural</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.680" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">now because of this Luther Luther was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.600" end="00:17:04.829" style="s2">monk and yet he comes to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:07.030" style="s2">that the monasteries should be shut down</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.829" end="00:17:13.510" style="s2">why would he why would he come to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.030" end="00:17:16.270" style="s2">conclusion well right the West for a</p>

<p begin="00:17:30.040" end="00:17:35.460" style="s2">come to understand right as much of</p>

<p begin="00:17:35.460" end="00:17:44.520" style="s2">was paired to a place where right you</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.340" end="00:17:47.170" style="s2">have to go through transformation in</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.520" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">order to acquire wisdom and this is the</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:18:03.040" style="s2">right that here you&#39;re seeking that self</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:05.460" style="s2">transcendence this is this is right this</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.040" end="00:18:08.290" style="s2">is the legacy of the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.460" end="00:18:10.810" style="s2">this of course is a response to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.290" end="00:18:12.850" style="s2">emergence of first Aristotelian science</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.810" end="00:18:18.670" style="s2">and then the new science of people like</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.880" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">find a meaningful life but this</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.190" end="00:18:40.500" style="s2">institution places a huge premium on</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:40.500" style="s2">self transcendence as we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.690" end="00:18:51.510" style="s2">and for Luther this is the grand</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.290" end="00:18:55.650" style="s2">illusion the idea that human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.510" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">capable of self transcendence is</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.650" end="00:19:04.330" style="s2">something he thinks is the greatest lie</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:07.000" style="s2">that our self tells us he sees that as</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.330" end="00:19:12.040" style="s2">the greatest instance of the sin of</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.710" end="00:19:28.200" style="s2">born out of radical acceptance then the</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.200" end="00:19:38.040" style="s2">disappears and so what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.809" end="00:19:40.990" style="s2">these institutions are being shut down</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.040" end="00:19:44.140" style="s2">now that means the university now needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.990" end="00:19:46.419" style="s2">something else in order to take this</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.140" end="00:19:49.059" style="s2">knowledge and give it existential</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.700" end="00:20:21.190" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be linked to politics and</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.299" end="00:20:24.040" style="s2">of course that is going to be supported</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.190" end="00:20:26.130" style="s2">by the new science people like bacon</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.040" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">famously arguing that knowledge is power</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.130" end="00:20:36.100" style="s2">the forerunner of the work of Michel</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:41.080" style="s2">Foucault and others so we get the loss</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:05.429" style="s2">so you know where to go for information</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.450" end="00:22:16.010" style="s2">is really inappropriate if you&#39;re trying</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.260" end="00:22:43.159" style="s2">the fore because of his attack on</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.159" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">advocates what he calls the priesthood</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.049" end="00:22:55.490" style="s2">of all believers there is nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:58.429" style="s2">between there is no mediator between you</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.490" end="00:23:00.830" style="s2">and God there is no church</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.429" end="00:23:01.429" style="s2">there&#39;s no priest right there&#39;s nothing</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.429" end="00:23:09.470" style="s2">there is just a direct personal</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:15.909" style="s2">relationship again this idea of your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.470" end="00:23:19.340" style="s2">personal spirituality has its root here</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.909" end="00:23:21.250" style="s2">now because of this Luther argues that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.340" end="00:23:25.220" style="s2">for the priesthood of all believers</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.250" end="00:23:30.309" style="s2">everybody has an equal spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.220" end="00:23:30.309" style="s2">authority because of course learning</p>

<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:38.690" style="s2">important criteria all that matters is</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.130" end="00:23:41.690" style="s2">the degree to which God has saved</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.690" end="00:23:43.340" style="s2">someone now we&#39;ve talked about some of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.690" end="00:23:45.590" style="s2">the negative consequences of that but a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.340" end="00:23:48.049" style="s2">positive consequence for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.590" end="00:23:52.700" style="s2">Luther argues for a complete form of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.049" end="00:23:54.590" style="s2">democracy within the church everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.700" end="00:23:58.510" style="s2">should be decided democratically because</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.590" end="00:24:00.860" style="s2">there should not be any significant</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.510" end="00:24:03.380" style="s2">Authority or hierarchical structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.860" end="00:24:05.480" style="s2">because Luther is rejecting all of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.380" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">this of course is why the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.480" end="00:24:11.659" style="s2">Church is so like resisting to him like</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:15.770" style="s2">why they are so inimical to him they</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.659" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">just want this idea eradicated because</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.280" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">he only proposes democracy within the</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.400" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">Luther thinks that there shouldn&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:03.260" style="s2">church and when the peasants revolt in</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.669" end="00:27:51.820" style="s2">know if you&#39;re saved because God chooses</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.720" end="00:27:55.720" style="s2">people arbitrarily so this provokes</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.820" end="00:27:57.760" style="s2">terrific anxiety right there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.110" end="00:28:33.970" style="s2">can&#39;t do anything officially but what</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.820" end="00:28:37.690" style="s2">you can do is you can work hard to make</p>

<p begin="00:30:03.549" end="00:30:08.590" style="s2">a real worry and look this is the like</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.590" end="00:30:15.429" style="s2">and what&#39;s amazing is how Luther was</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.639" end="00:30:18.100" style="s2">surprised by this right for a man who</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.429" end="00:30:19.990" style="s2">has in many ways brilliant he translate</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.100" end="00:30:24.580" style="s2">the Bible into German into German by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.990" end="00:30:26.049" style="s2">way he makes the Bible readable for</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.580" end="00:30:27.370" style="s2">everybody because of the priesthood of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.049" end="00:30:29.500" style="s2">all believers and he&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.370" end="00:30:31.059" style="s2">translator many people consider him as</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.500" end="00:30:35.799" style="s2">one of the foundational figures of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.059" end="00:30:38.710" style="s2">modern German but what he doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.799" end="00:30:40.779" style="s2">honestly he honestly thought that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.710" end="00:30:43.509" style="s2">everybody would read the Bible the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.779" end="00:30:45.639" style="s2">way he did so he thought we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.509" end="00:30:48.759" style="s2">rid of the Pope but there would be right</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.639" end="00:30:50.259" style="s2">there would be some a unifying thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.759" end="00:30:52.389" style="s2">that would hold Christianity together</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.259" end="00:30:55.419" style="s2">which is the idea of the Bible so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.389" end="00:30:56.919" style="s2">Bible becomes very holy and many people</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.419" end="00:30:59.409" style="s2">have said that what Protestants have is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.919" end="00:31:01.990" style="s2">a paper Pope the Bible takes the role</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.409" end="00:31:04.509" style="s2">for them that the Pope does for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.990" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">Catholic world and of course we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.509" end="00:31:09.190" style="s2">facing struggles right now in our</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:12.549" style="s2">culture because we don&#39;t quite know what</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.190" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">to do with this terrible and awesome</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.549" end="00:31:23.500" style="s2">book in the Bible what shocked Luther</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:27.250" style="s2">and shouldn&#39;t shock us is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.500" end="00:31:32.470" style="s2">Protestantism quickly fragments because</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.250" end="00:31:33.170" style="s2">when you give people no authority other</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.470" end="00:31:37.520" style="s2">than their own</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.170" end="00:31:39.680" style="s2">individual conscience when you separate</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.520" end="00:31:43.870" style="s2">them from any claims upon them of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.680" end="00:31:46.430" style="s2">tradition any claims upon them of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.870" end="00:31:51.770" style="s2">history or institution and he claims</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.430" end="00:31:54.710" style="s2">upon them of knowledge the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.770" end="00:31:58.460" style="s2">they will all agree is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.710" end="00:32:02.030" style="s2">ridiculous idea and so what happens and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.460" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">continues to happen to this very day is</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.030" end="00:32:09.310" style="s2">the huge and ongoing and accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:11.510" style="s2">fragmentation of Protestantism into</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.510" end="00:32:18.590" style="s2">denomination and you get what has been</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.500" end="00:32:20.330" style="s2">called in in other quarters but can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.590" end="00:32:27.410" style="s2">applied here the narcissism of small</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.330" end="00:32:29.870" style="s2">difference right there&#39;s you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.410" end="00:32:33.050" style="s2">find that piece of evidence that shows</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.870" end="00:32:36.890" style="s2">that you are unique that shows that of</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.890" end="00:32:44.180" style="s2">has elected you your uniqueness your</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.180" end="00:32:49.430" style="s2">specialness has to be guaranteed and if</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.300" end="00:32:52.100" style="s2">the more I&#39;m like these other people the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.430" end="00:32:54.740" style="s2">more that comes into question so not</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.100" end="00:32:56.900" style="s2">only am i driven by my own radicalized</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.740" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">subjectivity in my interpretation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.900" end="00:33:04.160" style="s2">also hungry for a spark of specialness</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:06.950" style="s2">for me that will show that I am saved</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.160" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">and so the narcissism and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.950" end="00:33:13.670" style="s2">fragmentation of Protestantism walk</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:16.660" style="s2">march in lockstep together mutually</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.120" end="00:51:05.960" style="s2">at his time there&#39;s a contemporary of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.430" end="00:51:09.320" style="s2">Descartes who makes it explicit and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.960" end="00:51:13.430" style="s2">radical and then challenges Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.320" end="00:51:15.800" style="s2">with with that radical derivation Hobbes</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.430" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">says well you know all of this what this</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.800" end="00:51:23.390" style="s2">means is that cognition is computation</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:26.180" style="s2">Hobbs says that he uses an older word he</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.390" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">says ratiocination what we would now say</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.180" end="00:51:29.900" style="s2">is cognition by ratiocination I mean</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.950" end="00:52:09.230" style="s2">that&#39;s all we need for this argument but</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:11.750" style="s2">Hobbes says cognition is computation and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.230" end="00:52:14.780" style="s2">then here&#39;s the radical idea he proposes</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.750" end="00:52:17.720" style="s2">he takes a new idea current at the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.780" end="00:52:20.870" style="s2">remember the idea that matter is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.720" end="00:52:23.690" style="s2">substance remember the old Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.870" end="00:52:27.260" style="s2">idea is matter is pure potential but</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.690" end="00:52:30.080" style="s2">with Galileo matter is a reality right</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.260" end="00:52:32.120" style="s2">in the sense of a substance it resists</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.080" end="00:52:33.950" style="s2">and it&#39;s good that it resists because I</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.120" end="00:52:36.650" style="s2">need something that resists my will in</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.950" end="00:52:39.650" style="s2">order to help me with my biases so</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.650" end="00:52:44.090" style="s2">matter is inert it&#39;s resistance it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.650" end="00:52:46.240" style="s2">really there I push on it notice that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.090" end="00:52:52.430" style="s2">again all that&#39;s left of Conformity is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:53:01.880" style="s2">resistance of will Hobbes says well</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.430" end="00:53:05.260" style="s2">matter is real and what if I built a</p>
