<p begin="00:00:01.669" end="00:00:11.550" style="s2">so if you were to imagine ain&#39;t looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.379" end="00:00:15.660" style="s2">across at somebody and you were to look</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.550" end="00:00:18.150" style="s2">into their eyes and you just started to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.660" end="00:00:21.480" style="s2">focus it on one of their eyeballs right</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.150" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">and you just began to tell them and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.480" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">describe to them the intimate details of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:30.449" style="s2">what what you could notice going on in</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:36.540" style="s2">their eyeball scribing the shape and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.449" end="00:00:39.300" style="s2">color the white to the eyes the little</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.540" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">Pink&#39;s in the eyes the purples the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.300" end="00:00:49.020" style="s2">various shades of the retina right and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:55.379" style="s2">just imagine just like looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.020" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">person&#39;s eye and then you could just</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.379" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">imagine looking right at their eyeballs</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">still keeping your your gaze right there</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:12.710" style="s2">and then I could say now switch from</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:12.710" style="s2">looking at their eyeball to seeing them</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.070" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting if I&#39;ve that&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.440" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">of a mystery to me like what is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:36.130" style="s2">like I&#39;m looking at your eyeball when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.090" end="00:01:38.050" style="s2">was looking at your eyeball and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.130" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">describing your eyeball to you what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.050" end="00:01:45.730" style="s2">saw was your eyeball in fact I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:49.120" style="s2">describing to you what I could my scent</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.730" end="00:01:53.950" style="s2">like I was basically looking to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.120" end="00:01:55.600" style="s2">sensation of sight noticing all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.950" end="00:02:00.850" style="s2">colors and everything I could describe</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.600" end="00:02:08.740" style="s2">right and then looking at the very same</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.850" end="00:02:12.700" style="s2">spot shifting your gaze from seeing or</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.740" end="00:02:17.740" style="s2">looking at your eyeball to seeing the</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.740" end="00:02:23.320" style="s2">know you can just imagine that what</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.590" end="00:02:27.400" style="s2">that&#39;s like and I that&#39;s an exercise</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.320" end="00:02:32.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a lot in circling to start to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.400" end="00:02:36.850" style="s2">get at this mystery right what is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.140" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">perception when you see them what</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.850" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">exactly are you perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.840" end="00:02:44.530" style="s2">and what what were you what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.510" end="00:02:46.660" style="s2">difference between what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.530" end="00:02:50.370" style="s2">perceiving with when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.660" end="00:02:50.370" style="s2">the eyeball to seeing them</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.420" end="00:03:03.060" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a little bit starts to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.420" end="00:03:08.180" style="s2">speak towards with what the guy who made</p>
