<p begin="00:00:01.520" end="00:00:05.759" style="s2">all right so I&#39;m sitting here with with</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:08.730" style="s2">dr. Jordan Peterson we were gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:10.559" style="s2">about the weird overlap between our</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.730" end="00:00:12.900" style="s2">books there&#39;s a sort of metafiction</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.559" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">aspect of it because Jordan had written</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.900" end="00:00:17.340" style="s2">the rules for I was a Korra entry</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s 32 rules in Cora that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.340" end="00:00:21.480" style="s2">42 rules got pared down so there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:24.300" style="s2">be like 19 sequels right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.480" end="00:00:26.789" style="s2">rolling him out and and I thought they</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.300" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">were amazing and so I was writing orphan</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.789" end="00:00:32.009" style="s2">acts I was writing the first book in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">series and in orphan Acts my main</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.009" end="00:00:35.309" style="s2">character is an assassin and he has</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:37.079" style="s2">these sort of 10 commandments that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.309" end="00:00:38.719" style="s2">the operational rules for an assassin</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.079" end="00:00:41.940" style="s2">and I wanted something to offset that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.719" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">for a kid who&#39;s in his life who lives</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.940" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">downstairs from him who&#39;s being raised</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:47.190" style="s2">as a good human instead of as an</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">assassin and I wanted to set a rules</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.190" end="00:00:51.469" style="s2">that would kind of counterbalance that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">and at the time I was reading Jordan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.469" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">rules that he listed and so I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">used those as a counterbalance as sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">of positive masculinity to use to use</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">this horrible phrase that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">well-trodden term but to actually show</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">how somebody might be raised properly</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:09.659" style="s2">instead of as an international assassin</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:11.220" style="s2">and at the time you know you were a mere</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.659" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">professor at utoronto I thought what</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.220" end="00:01:16.350" style="s2">could possibly be controversial about</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">this yeah right and so so that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.350" end="00:01:19.229" style="s2">sort of started yeah well it was fun to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">see you know when you create something</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.229" end="00:01:25.229" style="s2">like those rules I wrote them for Cora</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">and I&#39;d written like 50 Cora answers and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.229" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">some of them got disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">popular which is exactly what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:32.820" style="s2">expect because some things get</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:34.650" style="s2">disproportionately popular and and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.820" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">Cora rules attracted a lot of attention</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:39.210" style="s2">by Korres standards or by the standards</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">of what I was reading on Cora and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:42.210" style="s2">you would pit you pick them up and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:43.470" style="s2">thought it&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.210" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">very interesting about doing something</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:47.790" style="s2">creatively is that you sort of launch it</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">like you launch a note in a bottle on</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:51.869" style="s2">the ocean and you have no idea where</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">it&#39;s going to end up and so that was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.869" end="00:01:56.689" style="s2">first interesting manifestation of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:02:00.649" style="s2">rules outside of the Cora</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.689" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">container so to speak and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.649" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">part of our discussion about the rules</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">also led to their encapsulation and 12</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">rules for life and that was much later</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:12.629" style="s2">and it&#39;s been interesting to see how</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:13.710" style="s2">that overlap has developed as well well</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.629" end="00:02:16.380" style="s2">it&#39;s also weird to see what</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.710" end="00:02:18.120" style="s2">connects like it&#39;s so funny with with</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.380" end="00:02:19.860" style="s2">orphan acts when I was first adapting</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">and the big thing with that is that my</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.860" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">character kind of interacts he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">archetypal character like a Jack Reacher</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:27.900" style="s2">Jason Bourne but lives in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">with you and me you know so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.900" end="00:02:31.170" style="s2">he&#39;s not you never see James Bond go</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">home you know just what an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.170" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">character should do right it should</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:36.540" style="s2">exist in abstraction and also be</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:37.830" style="s2">embedded in the real world yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.540" end="00:02:40.170" style="s2">usually you have like the High Plains</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.830" end="00:02:41.880" style="s2">Drifter who&#39;s like off feeding his horse</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.170" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">and like moving on to the next town yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.880" end="00:02:44.490" style="s2">I thought it&#39;d be so fun to have them</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:46.320" style="s2">like interacting with the annoying</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.490" end="00:02:48.750" style="s2">Jewish woman who lives upstairs and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.320" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">having an awkward confrontation with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.750" end="00:02:51.990" style="s2">woman who lives downstairs who his</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:53.580" style="s2">chemistry with so it&#39;s an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.990" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">character wrestled into the real world</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.580" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what the spider-men people did</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.140" end="00:02:58.320" style="s2">really well the Marvel with Daniel and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:00.150" style="s2">spider-man they said extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.320" end="00:03:01.650" style="s2">well where he has to like Reese stitches</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:03.270" style="s2">cost you had no one thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.650" end="00:03:05.850" style="s2">you know and he&#39;s like late for school</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.270" end="00:03:08.660" style="s2">and all those problems exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.850" end="00:03:12.360" style="s2">so that was that was sort of the motif</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.660" end="00:03:15.560" style="s2">well that is also the problem of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.360" end="00:03:17.820" style="s2">more complex psychological problem of of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.560" end="00:03:19.710" style="s2">integrating the archetypal with the real</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.820" end="00:03:21.450" style="s2">world because there&#39;s an element of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.710" end="00:03:23.310" style="s2">everyone&#39;s psyche that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.450" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">transpersonal that&#39;s archetypal right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.310" end="00:03:26.670" style="s2">because to some degree you should</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:29.430" style="s2">manifest the mythological hero in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.670" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">life but the the critical issue there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.430" end="00:03:34.620" style="s2">in your life right because your life is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">like your life is like the bottle that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.620" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">or the lamp that the genie is in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">like the genie is God for all intents</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.450" style="s2">and purposes but it&#39;s in this little</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:43.650" style="s2">tiny container it&#39;s like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.450" end="00:03:45.960" style="s2">what you&#39;re like is you have this</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.650" end="00:03:47.940" style="s2">archetypal element to your personality</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.960" end="00:03:50.510" style="s2">which is your capacity for heroic</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.940" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">endeavor but it&#39;s all constrained by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.510" end="00:03:55.260" style="s2">hypothetical or the trivialities of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:57.060" style="s2">life and you have to you have to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.260" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">between those well and that&#39;s the weird</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.060" end="00:03:59.880" style="s2">thing like you were saying one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:01.410" style="s2">things when you write is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.880" end="00:04:03.180" style="s2">always know what&#39;s gonna connect right</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.410" end="00:04:05.640" style="s2">you never knew that those rules would</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.180" end="00:04:07.020" style="s2">become you know number one best-selling</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:08.820" style="s2">book everywhere in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.020" end="00:04:10.350" style="s2">what was so interesting is there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.820" end="00:04:12.660" style="s2">one scene at the opening of orphan Acts</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.350" end="00:04:14.070" style="s2">where he&#39;s in the elevator and he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.660" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">a cut on his arm we don&#39;t know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.070" end="00:04:17.940" style="s2">from and he has to fake to kind of pass</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.350" style="s2">as a real person among all the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.940" end="00:04:21.810" style="s2">and he&#39;s kind of covering it up but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.350" end="00:04:23.460" style="s2">got suppressors and he used the sock as</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.810" end="00:04:26.040" style="s2">a tourniquet so he&#39;s missing a sock and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:27.340" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of trying to pass his secret</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.040" end="00:04:30.760" style="s2">identity among other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.340" end="00:04:32.290" style="s2">that seemed connected unbelievably with</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.760" end="00:04:33.580" style="s2">readers with and it would it would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.290" end="00:04:35.200" style="s2">like the last scene that I would have</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.580" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">thought and when I did the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.200" end="00:04:38.950" style="s2">initially for Bradley Cooper as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:40.990" style="s2">feature and I remember I was like well</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.950" end="00:04:43.240" style="s2">if I have Bradley Cooper let me open</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.990" end="00:04:46.270" style="s2">with some big action you show off you</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.240" end="00:04:48.010" style="s2">thing and both his production company</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.270" end="00:04:49.330" style="s2">and the head of the studio were like we</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.010" end="00:04:51.820" style="s2">need the elevator saying like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.330" end="00:04:53.169" style="s2">elevator scene became the iconic thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.820" end="00:04:55.000" style="s2">of course because it does what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.169" end="00:05:01.030" style="s2">talk to should be some music playing in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.000" end="00:05:02.530" style="s2">the back like there is something yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.030" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">you get caught between the beard in New</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.530" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">York City right right but it&#39;s weird cuz</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:06.580" style="s2">I never would have thought that would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:08.830" style="s2">the thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.580" end="00:05:10.630" style="s2">so the stuff that you send out I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.830" end="00:05:12.130" style="s2">any idea why that was so attractive to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.630" end="00:05:13.510" style="s2">people well I think it&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.130" end="00:05:16.270" style="s2">thing that we were talking about is like</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.510" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">you don&#39;t see James Bond in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.270" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">circumstance it&#39;s so it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">archetypal guy has a mission is a knife</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:23.979" style="s2">cut that he tourniquets his arm with and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:25.570" style="s2">then he&#39;s in the elevator that you and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.979" end="00:05:27.460" style="s2">have been in and everyone&#39;s nagging him</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.570" end="00:05:28.780" style="s2">that he&#39;s you know missed the HOA</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.460" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">meeting the homeowners association</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.780" end="00:05:33.010" style="s2">meeting where they&#39;re voting on like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:34.300" style="s2">new carpeting in the lobby and he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.010" end="00:05:35.860" style="s2">trying to get out of it and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.300" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">covering so there&#39;s this wish</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.860" end="00:05:40.450" style="s2">fulfillment fantasy aspect to it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:42.310" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like our own lives and like</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.450" end="00:05:44.380" style="s2">everyone knows what it&#39;s like to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.310" end="00:05:46.300" style="s2">dealing with annoyances and logistics</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.380" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">but then he gets to go back to his life</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.300" end="00:05:49.539" style="s2">is like a super secret assassin who</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:51.190" style="s2">helps the helpless well and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.539" end="00:05:54.010" style="s2">another element of it too I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.190" end="00:05:57.700" style="s2">which is that that that that scene and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.010" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">and that that context also suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.700" end="00:06:01.810" style="s2">one of the ways that you one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:04.690" style="s2">things that you have to do in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.810" end="00:06:07.060" style="s2">put up with those mundane daily elements</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.690" end="00:06:09.610" style="s2">of life is also to have your adventure</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.060" end="00:06:10.750" style="s2">along with you yeah yeah so and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.610" end="00:06:13.090" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.750" end="00:06:15.669" style="s2">to my audience is about continually is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.090" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">that you need to have a meaning in your</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.669" end="00:06:21.190" style="s2">life that&#39;s of sufficient grandeur let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:24.100" style="s2">say or sufficient power so that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.190" end="00:06:26.169" style="s2">petty sufferings of life now become not</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.100" end="00:06:28.150" style="s2">only justifiable but acceptable in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.169" end="00:06:30.220" style="s2">broader context and so and sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.150" end="00:06:31.720" style="s2">risk and sufficient risk because all</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.220" end="00:06:33.880" style="s2">that in that and that&#39;s what puts the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.720" end="00:06:36.280" style="s2">adventure into it right it&#39;s like in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.880" end="00:06:38.409" style="s2">elevator scene it&#39;s it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.280" end="00:06:40.630" style="s2">everyone can relate to the mundane it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.409" end="00:06:41.180" style="s2">also that everyone can see that what</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.630" end="00:06:43.610" style="s2">trans</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.180" end="00:06:45.290" style="s2">the mundane is also fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.610" end="00:06:47.210" style="s2">necessary before otherwise you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.290" end="00:06:49.820" style="s2">nothing but a collection of trivialities</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.210" end="00:06:50.840" style="s2">and and life has so much suffering that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.820" end="00:06:52.220" style="s2">if you&#39;re just a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.840" end="00:06:54.140" style="s2">trivialities you&#39;re not going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.220" end="00:06:56.420" style="s2">to bear it so you need your heroic</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.140" end="00:07:00.170" style="s2">adventure which is what&#39;s animating you</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.420" end="00:07:01.910" style="s2">literally anima is the soul right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.170" end="00:07:03.530" style="s2">what Adam Amin&#39;s so that&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.910" end="00:07:04.970" style="s2">animating you well you have to put up</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.530" end="00:07:06.860" style="s2">with being trapped in this little tiny</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.970" end="00:07:08.780" style="s2">conveyor right I thought about this lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.860" end="00:07:11.270" style="s2">when I was writing Batman I wrote Batman</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.780" end="00:07:13.730" style="s2">for tutors for DC and I was fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.270" end="00:07:16.250" style="s2">by this sort of seesaw tilt between</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.730" end="00:07:17.810" style="s2">perfection and intimacy which is so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.250" end="00:07:20.060" style="s2">Batman you know he doesn&#39;t have a magic</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.810" end="00:07:21.500" style="s2">ring he can&#39;t fly he just represents the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.060" end="00:07:23.270" style="s2">pinnacle of human discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.500" end="00:07:25.310" style="s2">achievement it&#39;s cuz his parents died</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.270" end="00:07:27.860" style="s2">when he was young right he&#39;s alone in</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.310" end="00:07:29.420" style="s2">Wayne Manor there&#39;s Robin always dies</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.860" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">there&#39;s always a Robin and he dies he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.420" end="00:07:31.970" style="s2">a playboy he doesn&#39;t have anyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:34.370" style="s2">intimate and if there&#39;s no one in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.970" end="00:07:37.790" style="s2">life you can maintain perfection but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.370" end="00:07:40.490" style="s2">more you inch into intimacy a dog a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.790" end="00:07:42.590" style="s2">spouse a partner children the more that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.490" end="00:07:44.390" style="s2">you get this sort of conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.590" end="00:07:45.950" style="s2">complication that starts to take over</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.390" end="00:07:47.210" style="s2">and detract from that version of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.950" end="00:07:48.920" style="s2">perfection so it&#39;s like you can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.210" end="00:07:50.540" style="s2">perfect without intimacy but then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.920" end="00:07:52.730" style="s2">not perfect because you have no intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.540" end="00:07:53.630" style="s2">and so the more that you integrated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.730" end="00:07:55.820" style="s2">almost like the more that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.630" end="00:07:57.560" style="s2">accepting the realities of life but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.820" end="00:07:59.000" style="s2">I think it&#39;s also one of the things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.560" end="00:08:00.710" style="s2">interesting in the Batman reference</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.000" end="00:08:03.560" style="s2">because one of the things you see in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.710" end="00:08:05.750" style="s2">Batman Joker dynamic especially the one</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.560" end="00:08:07.760" style="s2">with Heath Ledger was the Joker was</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.750" end="00:08:09.980" style="s2">always pushing at Batman because of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.760" end="00:08:11.480" style="s2">evil of his perfections like you&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.980" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">far away from me and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.480" end="00:08:15.380" style="s2">perfectionistic drive there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:17.870" style="s2">totalitarian and single-minded about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.380" end="00:08:20.150" style="s2">right and then it&#39;s the encapsulation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.870" end="00:08:22.580" style="s2">that in intimacy that that humanizes it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.150" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">and perhaps it&#39;s sane right and so so</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.580" end="00:08:27.020" style="s2">that uni-dimensional perfection can go</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.800" end="00:08:28.640" style="s2">very very badly when it goes and to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.020" end="00:08:30.230" style="s2">contextually constrained like that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.640" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">actually like a definition of sanity</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.230" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">it&#39;s something that Jung talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:35.450" style="s2">when he was commenting on Nietzsche and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:37.220" style="s2">and people like Nietzsche said he</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.450" end="00:08:38.840" style="s2">believed that Nietzsche would have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.220" end="00:08:39.320" style="s2">able to maintain his sanity for much</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.840" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.320" end="00:08:44.150" style="s2">assuming no physiological degeneration</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">had he been able to incorporate himself</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.150" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">within a profession and a family who</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:50.870" style="s2">nailed him to the earth right and in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:51.940" style="s2">healthy way stilts down that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.870" end="00:08:53.740" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.940" end="00:08:57.790" style="s2">right so I thought we&#39;d just talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.740" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">briefly about the editing process for 12</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.790" end="00:09:01.690" style="s2">rolls it was a lot of fun because I got</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:04.090" style="s2">to read it all early which was yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.690" end="00:09:05.950" style="s2">was fun so I had it featured in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.090" end="00:09:07.150" style="s2">orphan X books like two years before it</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.950" end="00:09:08.380" style="s2">came out right which is why I always</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.150" end="00:09:09.940" style="s2">like to remind you that I&#39;m mostly</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.380" end="00:09:11.860" style="s2">responsible for yours yes well I do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.940" end="00:09:13.990" style="s2">appreciate that well I sent all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.860" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">chapters to Greg I had an editor at</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.990" end="00:09:18.190" style="s2">penguin Craig Pyatt who was very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:19.960" style="s2">helpful so I had two editors really and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.190" end="00:09:21.730" style="s2">other people commenting on it but I sent</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.960" end="00:09:23.500" style="s2">each chapter to Greg and he would just</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.730" end="00:09:25.690" style="s2">shred them he&#39;s really really good at</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.500" end="00:09:27.790" style="s2">that and and well and very comical and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.690" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">so he just be absolutely brutal with his</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.790" end="00:09:32.830" style="s2">criticisms but it was also a also always</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.810" style="s2">extremely funny it was a fast yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.830" end="00:09:36.940" style="s2">and then I was also absolutely staggered</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.810" end="00:09:38.650" style="s2">by how rapidly you could do that and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.940" end="00:09:40.210" style="s2">point to what was working and to tell me</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.650" end="00:09:41.560" style="s2">what wasn&#39;t working and that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.210" end="00:09:43.720" style="s2">exceptionally helpful and you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.560" end="00:09:45.250" style="s2">very skilled at that so so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.720" end="00:09:47.140" style="s2">compliment you&#39;re gonna get for me now</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.250" end="00:09:48.820" style="s2">it was very others look now the insult</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.140" end="00:09:50.530" style="s2">first you leave you soften me up with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.820" end="00:09:52.450" style="s2">compliment and now you know but I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.530" end="00:09:53.740" style="s2">what was helpful is so I mean I took</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.450" end="00:09:55.210" style="s2">three courses from you as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.740" end="00:09:57.310" style="s2">undergraduate so it&#39;s like we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.210" end="00:09:59.710" style="s2">swimming in the same waters for a long</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.310" end="00:10:03.130" style="s2">time so it was really interesting for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.710" end="00:10:05.470" style="s2">to see you know through the process you</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.130" end="00:10:07.030" style="s2">know I have it I have a sense that goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.470" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">kind of all the way down of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.030" end="00:10:11.740" style="s2">room with going back to before maps of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:13.420" style="s2">meaning going back to the source book</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.740" end="00:10:15.460" style="s2">articles and stuff you lectured amount</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.420" end="00:10:17.830" style="s2">so it was really fun to see them take</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.460" end="00:10:20.740" style="s2">hold and move from the abstract into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.830" end="00:10:22.390" style="s2">ever more accessible and specific yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.740" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">well it was useful too because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.390" end="00:10:28.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve developed this intense skill in</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:30.730" style="s2">in producing commercial widely publicly</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.840" end="00:10:33.610" style="s2">accessible fiction and and you have a</p>
