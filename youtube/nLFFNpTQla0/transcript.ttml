<p begin="00:00:05.509" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">so Jordan you wrote a piece a</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.850" end="00:00:12.510" style="s2">situational assessment in the wake of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">the Trump election that went kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.510" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">viral and that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:19.040" style="s2">kind of recap some of what you&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:22.170" style="s2">about in your latest one the 2019 and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.040" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">see whether the overview that you put</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.170" end="00:00:25.710" style="s2">forward at the time of the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">election that it was gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.710" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">revolutionary or it was already a</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:31.050" style="s2">revolutionary war and that this was</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:34.200" style="s2">about the different phases of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">insurgency versus the existing structure</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.200" end="00:00:38.760" style="s2">what you&#39;ve called the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:40.980" style="s2">if so where are we in that in that frame</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.760" end="00:00:43.230" style="s2">well I think it since I went ahead in</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">2018-2019 ask that question and answer</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.230" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">that question in the affirmative I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">gonna go ahead and stick to my guns and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:50.520" style="s2">say yes taking a look at the prevent I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">would just take the event of the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.520" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">election and endeavouring to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">of what was going on in the context that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">particular event I&#39;m coming out of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:05.219" style="s2">perspective that it&#39;s it&#39;s taking place</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:06.719" style="s2">in a larger context so within that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.219" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">larger context I can take a look at what</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.719" end="00:01:10.530" style="s2">that particular ban say hmm there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:15.139" style="s2">things that I noticed that I would like</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.530" end="00:01:17.369" style="s2">to point attention to and in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.139" end="00:01:18.959" style="s2">pointing attention to identified four</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.369" end="00:01:21.749" style="s2">things that are calling I was gone front</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.959" end="00:01:22.770" style="s2">so I used the metaphor of war and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.749" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">proposition was that in fact it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.770" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">really more than a metaphor that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:30.779" style="s2">we&#39;re actually experiencing something</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:33.959" style="s2">that is a closer to war than say</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.779" end="00:01:38.039" style="s2">politics they have to reference your own</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.959" end="00:01:40.289" style="s2">closets to go deep on that notion so in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.039" end="00:01:44.279" style="s2">the context of there being something</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.289" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">akin to a war going on and what might</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.279" end="00:01:48.149" style="s2">that would look like identified four</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">distinct fronts that if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.149" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">watch those fronts you might get a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:52.679" style="s2">better sense of what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">maybe even a better way of making</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.679" end="00:01:58.679" style="s2">choices of acting and the Front&#39;s had to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:03.419" style="s2">do with one relationship was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.679" end="00:02:06.739" style="s2">relationship between the the media the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.419" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">the mass media and the emergent media</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.739" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">another front had to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">relationship to as I was calling the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">insurgency in the deep state</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">the next front had to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:18.939" style="s2">with globalism and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">between globalism and what next question</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.939" end="00:02:25.030" style="s2">mark and then the last had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:27.549" style="s2">this conflict of the cultural level that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.030" end="00:02:28.780" style="s2">I identified as being between something</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.549" end="00:02:29.709" style="s2">called the blue church and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.780" end="00:02:31.720" style="s2">something that I was naming the red</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.709" end="00:02:35.470" style="s2">religion and if you would call which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.720" end="00:02:38.200" style="s2">sure you do I sort of found those terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.470" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">sitting out on a in Reddit and said</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.200" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">those are really good terms from what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:42.549" style="s2">being described here and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:44.980" style="s2">like the nuance between Church and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.549" end="00:02:47.459" style="s2">religion that many people sort of gloss</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.980" end="00:02:50.200" style="s2">over so if you walk down those fronts</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.459" end="00:02:51.939" style="s2">and they&#39;re obviously related to each</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.200" end="00:02:53.620" style="s2">other cuz it&#39;s a war so they&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.939" end="00:02:56.079" style="s2">a larger complex if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.620" end="00:02:58.989" style="s2">first front from 2016 to two</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.079" end="00:03:04.359" style="s2">contemporary I think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.989" end="00:03:07.030" style="s2">particularly obscure that it&#39;s a front</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.359" end="00:03:08.919" style="s2">that the notion of was the fake news as</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.030" end="00:03:10.780" style="s2">the enemy of the people is now there has</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.919" end="00:03:15.010" style="s2">been an explicit statement which wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.780" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">in 2016 and that evolution has continued</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.010" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">and the notion of there being a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.739" end="00:03:24.370" style="s2">antipathy a natural intrinsic deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:26.349" style="s2">separation and conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.370" end="00:03:28.840" style="s2">something the mainstream media whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.349" end="00:03:31.209" style="s2">we may consider that to be and something</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.840" end="00:03:35.500" style="s2">else this notion of the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.209" end="00:03:37.750" style="s2">whatever may think that is I think is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.500" end="00:03:39.190" style="s2">be perfectly frank quite obvious there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.750" end="00:03:41.979" style="s2">certainly something going on there now</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.190" end="00:03:43.540" style="s2">that by itself may not be in fact fully</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.979" end="00:03:45.669" style="s2">disruptive but the notion that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.540" end="00:03:49.419" style="s2">started now get real salvos being fired</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.669" end="00:03:52.329" style="s2">across this divide and the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.419" end="00:03:54.760" style="s2">which the underlying legitimacy of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.329" end="00:03:56.949" style="s2">mainstream media has now been quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.760" end="00:03:58.840" style="s2">significantly undermined I mean I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.949" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">say that the the amount of legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:05.049" style="s2">that had in say Rush Limbaugh followers</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">in the late 90s I think has moved into</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.049" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">sort of 55% of the population like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:13.030" style="s2">assumed to be biased deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.470" end="00:04:15.220" style="s2">biased with an agenda and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.030" end="00:04:17.139" style="s2">assumed to be biased and incompetent</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.220" end="00:04:20.289" style="s2">it&#39;s not a very solid foundation of how</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.139" end="00:04:21.970" style="s2">much to build something so I also</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.289" end="00:04:25.470" style="s2">predict that this war is more that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.970" end="00:04:28.140" style="s2">going to go this way now</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.470" end="00:04:30.480" style="s2">in the larger context of course the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.140" end="00:04:32.010" style="s2">frame is that there&#39;s many many</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.480" end="00:04:33.540" style="s2">different things that are going on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.010" end="00:04:35.250" style="s2">are deeper than what we&#39;re seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.540" end="00:04:36.600" style="s2">that we if you look at the deeper stock</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.250" end="00:04:38.070" style="s2">to really make sense what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.600" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">and one of the things that I pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.070" end="00:04:43.320" style="s2">in that in that particular series was</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:46.490" style="s2">this notion of media the way the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.320" end="00:04:48.660" style="s2">different media generate different</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.490" end="00:04:50.510" style="s2">landscapes upon which these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.660" end="00:04:52.500" style="s2">conflicts can occur in the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.510" end="00:04:54.120" style="s2">are you fighting in the desert are you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.500" end="00:04:57.450" style="s2">fighting in the jungle and if a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.120" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">medium that produces jungles is replaced</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.450" end="00:05:01.260" style="s2">by a meeting that produces deserts then</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:02.490" style="s2">people who are optimized for jungle</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.260" end="00:05:03.450" style="s2">warfare gonna find themselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.490" end="00:05:05.370" style="s2">desert are gonna be in deep trouble</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.450" end="00:05:07.140" style="s2">right so just watch what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.370" end="00:05:10.680" style="s2">underneath and then see as the battle</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.140" end="00:05:13.350" style="s2">ships and the proposition of course is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.680" end="00:05:15.090" style="s2">that a big piece of what&#39;s happening a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.350" end="00:05:16.350" style="s2">very big piece after that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.090" end="00:05:20.570" style="s2">dominant these but a big piece is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.350" end="00:05:24.600" style="s2">transition between centralized broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.570" end="00:05:29.610" style="s2">linear media most notably television to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.600" end="00:05:34.710" style="s2">decentralized symmetric oftentimes non</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.610" end="00:05:38.760" style="s2">linear or non what is it called not</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.710" end="00:05:39.990" style="s2">temporally continuous media ie what</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.760" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">happens when you see on the internet the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.990" end="00:05:45.210" style="s2">Internet has discontinuous news</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">different better term for a synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.210" end="00:05:50.700" style="s2">asynchronous so when I&#39;m watching a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:52.680" style="s2">television program there&#39;s a flow to it</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.700" end="00:05:57.690" style="s2">that it&#39;s happening moment after moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.680" end="00:05:59.820" style="s2">and my ability think 1977 to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.690" end="00:06:01.020" style="s2">bathroom and come back I&#39;ve missed</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.820" end="00:06:02.640" style="s2">something there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.020" end="00:06:04.230" style="s2">happened is objectively in a flow</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.640" end="00:06:06.360" style="s2">whereas on the Internet of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.230" end="00:06:07.950" style="s2">not the case I just hit pause or even I</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.360" end="00:06:09.450" style="s2">just take clothes come back and hit open</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.950" end="00:06:11.940" style="s2">again right so there&#39;s a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.450" end="00:06:15.200" style="s2">going on there so you&#39;ve got very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.940" end="00:06:17.510" style="s2">very distinct underlying media</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.200" end="00:06:19.650" style="s2">topographies and these give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.510" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">massive shifts in the stuff that happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.650" end="00:06:23.220" style="s2">on top of them that&#39;s the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:24.540" style="s2">deep thesis or at least one of the TP</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.220" end="00:06:26.580" style="s2">theses that are driving this story so if</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.540" end="00:06:29.640" style="s2">you come back up well what is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.580" end="00:06:32.310" style="s2">insurgency in some sense the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.640" end="00:06:35.550" style="s2">is people who have figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.310" end="00:06:38.340" style="s2">use this new medium to accomplish their</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.550" end="00:06:40.170" style="s2">ends that&#39;s just the equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.340" end="00:06:41.820" style="s2">you know the vietcong figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.170" end="00:06:44.430" style="s2">to engage in guerrilla warfare in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.820" end="00:06:47.460" style="s2">jungles of Vietnam to actually fight to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.430" end="00:06:49.560" style="s2">a standstill the world war ii era ish</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.460" end="00:06:51.510" style="s2">american army and that&#39;s that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.560" end="00:06:54.270" style="s2">idea so it&#39;s an insurgency playing this</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.510" end="00:06:55.950" style="s2">new battlefield honed to the new</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.270" end="00:06:58.020" style="s2">characteristics of this new environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.950" end="00:06:58.890" style="s2">playing it&#39;s people who are designed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.020" end="00:07:01.560" style="s2">fight the old war</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.890" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s fait accompli that eventually</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.560" end="00:07:05.940" style="s2">this sides going to lose and as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">watching it happened we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.940" end="00:07:10.440" style="s2">breaks occur and see as the sand keeps</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:12.900" style="s2">getting swept out from underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.440" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">wall how does the wall crumble that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.900" end="00:07:18.180" style="s2">makes sense yeah so then you move to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:21.000" style="s2">next stage the next front this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.180" end="00:07:22.470" style="s2">front where much more of the energy is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.000" end="00:07:23.490" style="s2">actually taking place from my</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.470" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">perspective that has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.490" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">something between the deep state and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:29.070" style="s2">again the insurgency there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:31.830" style="s2">language that used to describe it over</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.070" end="00:07:33.150" style="s2">over time but here when I when I talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.830" end="00:07:36.540" style="s2">about the insurgency I want to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.150" end="00:07:38.430" style="s2">that there&#39;s a broader sense of that so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.540" end="00:07:40.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a concentrated sense the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.430" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">administration but there&#39;s a broader</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.320" end="00:07:44.850" style="s2">sense which includes other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:48.410" style="s2">things like in 2019 I called out the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.850" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">and Qi on our part of that phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.410" end="00:07:54.090" style="s2">you know the the Donald on reddit is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:57.320" style="s2">part of the insurgency and while is</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.090" end="00:07:59.580" style="s2">named after Donald Trump it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.320" end="00:08:00.630" style="s2">causally linked but he doesn&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.580" end="00:08:02.490" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t control him it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.630" end="00:08:04.620" style="s2">happening and I would say it has more</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.490" end="00:08:06.780" style="s2">influence and impact and is more fully</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.620" end="00:08:09.290" style="s2">of the essence of the insurgency than</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.780" end="00:08:11.250" style="s2">the administration itself is for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.290" end="00:08:13.020" style="s2">so the conflict between the deep state</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.250" end="00:08:14.670" style="s2">in the insurgency is of the same sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.020" end="00:08:17.610" style="s2">except in this case the deep state is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.670" end="00:08:21.480" style="s2">deeper it has a lot more going on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.610" end="00:08:23.400" style="s2">more capacity a lot more degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.480" end="00:08:25.230" style="s2">freedom with which to operate and when</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.400" end="00:08:26.850" style="s2">it might even say in many senses the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.230" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">mainstream media that&#39;s happening appear</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.850" end="00:08:30.840" style="s2">is an aspect ever deeply connected</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">they&#39;re not one-to-one but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.840" end="00:08:34.020" style="s2">deeply connected to each other</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:39.060" style="s2">so here we&#39;re talking about a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.020" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">broad category of institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.060" end="00:08:44.250" style="s2">bureaucracies that have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:46.740" style="s2">characteristic of lifers you know people</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.250" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">who work there for 40 years and so they</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.740" end="00:08:50.460" style="s2">tend to know each other and when you add</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:51.390" style="s2">to the the fact that they tend to know</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.460" end="00:08:53.070" style="s2">each other because they&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.390" end="00:08:54.870" style="s2">been living and working the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.070" end="00:08:56.610" style="s2">place for a long time and had a certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.870" end="00:08:58.980" style="s2">affiliation with the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.610" end="00:09:02.910" style="s2">structure they&#39;re attached to say for</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.980" end="00:09:04.410" style="s2">example more than a broader context you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.910" end="00:09:07.650" style="s2">add to that the notion that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.410" end="00:09:09.780" style="s2">actually have over the past 70 or 80</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.650" end="00:09:11.730" style="s2">years begin to develop personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.780" end="00:09:13.350" style="s2">relationships they marry each other or</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.730" end="00:09:15.860" style="s2">they mirror each other siblings and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.350" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a meshing as that happens among</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.860" end="00:09:20.760" style="s2">the context of this this cluster of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:23.340" style="s2">things I&#39;m talking about a place like</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.760" end="00:09:27.570" style="s2">Harvard and the relationship between say</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.340" end="00:09:29.100" style="s2">Harvard and the State Department there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.570" end="00:09:30.870" style="s2">a lot of cross-fertilization people</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.100" end="00:09:32.340" style="s2">moving back and forth and there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.870" end="00:09:34.950" style="s2">situations where a person happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.340" end="00:09:36.090" style="s2">the head of some particular division of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.950" end="00:09:37.140" style="s2">Harvard might be married so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.090" end="00:09:38.550" style="s2">head of a certain division at State</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.140" end="00:09:40.350" style="s2">Department this is perfectly normal or</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.550" end="00:09:43.110" style="s2">they just travel in similar circles and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.350" end="00:09:45.090" style="s2">have lots of bonds it&#39;s a and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.110" end="00:09:46.890" style="s2">consequence this thing the deep state</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.090" end="00:09:48.750" style="s2">which has a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.890" end="00:09:50.100" style="s2">institutions bureaucracies people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.750" end="00:09:53.580" style="s2">have long term relationships with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.100" end="00:09:55.860" style="s2">and binding has a consistency to it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.580" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">it acts in the world as an agent there</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.860" end="00:10:04.500" style="s2">was kind of agenda clip and I proposed</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:05.790" style="s2">less obviously that the deep stayed in</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.500" end="00:10:08.130" style="s2">the insurgence you&#39;re also in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.790" end="00:10:09.450" style="s2">that was another major proposition and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.130" end="00:10:10.620" style="s2">would say that we&#39;ve seen that and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.450" end="00:10:12.570" style="s2">seen in the in the contact of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.620" end="00:10:14.310" style="s2">Mueller investigation in the penumbra</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.570" end="00:10:17.910" style="s2">around it it&#39;s gonna be another term</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.310" end="00:10:19.080" style="s2">that describes the Russia gate problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.910" end="00:10:21.210" style="s2">with the terms of disused I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.080" end="00:10:22.500" style="s2">but I&#39;m semantically assuming the word</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.210" end="00:10:25.380" style="s2">gate will be attached to it in Russia at</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.500" end="00:10:28.890" style="s2">the beginning I believe that the FBI</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.380" end="00:10:30.390" style="s2">putting together some notion of what was</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.890" end="00:10:32.670" style="s2">it called an insurance policy like this</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.390" end="00:10:35.280" style="s2">is just a peek into it&#39;s obviously mecca</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.670" end="00:10:36.810" style="s2">nations of the sort that will always be</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.280" end="00:10:38.010" style="s2">happening it&#39;s inevitable people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.810" end="00:10:40.500" style="s2">doing things they will do things within</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.010" end="00:10:42.330" style="s2">the scope of their agency but we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.500" end="00:10:44.820" style="s2">watching that play out over a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.330" end="00:10:46.470" style="s2">years and if you have a sense of the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.820" end="00:10:51.510" style="s2">that these kinds of things tend to play</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.470" end="00:10:53.310" style="s2">out historically from my perspective has</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.510" end="00:10:54.810" style="s2">kind of been on script thank you you see</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.310" end="00:10:57.420" style="s2">the kind of thing happened that you saw</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.810" end="00:11:02.790" style="s2">with Russia games and you see with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.420" end="00:11:03.300" style="s2">music poor emerge and what you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.790" end="00:11:05.899" style="s2">normally</p>

<p begin="00:11:05.899" end="00:11:10.589" style="s2">continued to kind of just Bob above the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.580" end="00:11:13.080" style="s2">surface when there&#39;s clearly something</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.589" end="00:11:15.959" style="s2">about Trump himself as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.080" end="00:11:22.050" style="s2">that has very you know he makes Slick</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.959" end="00:11:25.500" style="s2">Willy look like velcro there&#39;s a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.050" end="00:11:28.019" style="s2">friction in him which is notable but</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.500" end="00:11:29.910" style="s2">also I point out the concept that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.019" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">insurgency because its operating in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.910" end="00:11:36.329" style="s2">context of this decentralized medium in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:38.070" style="s2">a full a very flat graph has what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.329" end="00:11:39.870" style="s2">called an udder loop that&#39;s very rapid</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.070" end="00:11:42.390" style="s2">and that means is this is a concept from</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.870" end="00:11:45.870" style="s2">military theory or strategy observe</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.329" end="00:11:51.870" style="s2">and then you observe again to see what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.890" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">happened and the proposition is is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.870" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">broadly speaking the more bandwidth your</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">utter loop has which is say the more</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:03.170" style="s2">through the other loop faster both</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.570" end="00:12:15.209" style="s2">bandwidth in the proposition is that the</p>

<p begin="00:12:29.100" end="00:12:31.980" style="s2">well we&#39;re gonna go to the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.660" end="00:12:34.140" style="s2">next and the right now I&#39;m just</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.250" end="00:12:45.450" style="s2">deep today so we might think of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.010" end="00:12:47.130" style="s2">state is running 1950s era server farms</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.450" end="00:12:48.540" style="s2">like you&#39;ve ever seen with this look</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.130" end="00:12:50.190" style="s2">like just big rooms full of ENIAC</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.540" end="00:12:52.350" style="s2">machines with tape drives and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.190" end="00:12:53.850" style="s2">big rooms and lots of them do them for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.350" end="00:12:58.760" style="s2">long time and they&#39;re controlling all</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.850" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">kinds of like big lumbering robots and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.760" end="00:13:03.420" style="s2">the dinosaur metaphor is quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:05.640" style="s2">appropriate and then the insurgency is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.420" end="00:13:08.010" style="s2">connected to a bunch of fortunately own</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.640" end="00:13:09.329" style="s2">kids on cell phones on fortunate that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.010" end="00:13:11.820" style="s2">quite literally and now we have the</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.820" end="00:13:16.980" style="s2">focused capacity to deliver significant</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.520" end="00:13:19.350" style="s2">directed energy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.980" end="00:13:21.630" style="s2">stir and is extremely responsive so as</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.350" end="00:13:24.269" style="s2">the deep state sort of winds up and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.630" end="00:13:26.699" style="s2">fires off its its agenda so for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.269" end="00:13:28.949" style="s2">the concept of fake news if you wind</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.699" end="00:13:32.100" style="s2">back the clock actually emerged from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.949" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">deep state before it was co-opted by the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.100" end="00:13:36.329" style="s2">insurgency it&#39;s a very specific moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:38.370" style="s2">we saw it come out through sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.329" end="00:13:40.889" style="s2">ordinary channels and then what happened</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:43.350" style="s2">was that the the insurgency co-op&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.889" end="00:13:44.430" style="s2">and converts it and begins mutating and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.350" end="00:13:46.290" style="s2">so wrapped with it they could just sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.430" end="00:13:47.130" style="s2">of see the deep state so do i back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.290" end="00:13:49.529" style="s2">it seals wondering what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.130" end="00:13:51.480" style="s2">happened and the conflict has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.529" end="00:13:53.880" style="s2">locked since then and of course in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.480" end="00:13:55.500" style="s2">meantime over the past several years the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.880" end="00:13:56.790" style="s2">deef states been mutating has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.500" end="00:13:58.290" style="s2">involved in those strategies that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.790" end="00:14:00.389" style="s2">work or being dropped is trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.290" end="00:14:02.279" style="s2">new ones and different groups are coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.389" end="00:14:03.779" style="s2">in to try to form something happening on</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.279" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">this side but it&#39;s all still more or</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.779" end="00:14:09.959" style="s2">less running the basic code of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:11.480" style="s2">state we should just say running the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.959" end="00:14:13.829" style="s2">blue church alright so we&#39;ll get there</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.480" end="00:14:15.810" style="s2">and then on the insurgency and of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.829" end="00:14:19.709" style="s2">has also been evolving in mutating and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.810" end="00:14:22.040" style="s2">gathering and so the IDW emerges and q</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.709" end="00:14:25.399" style="s2">and on emerge and from my perspective as</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.040" end="00:14:27.540" style="s2">examples of something happening more in</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.399" end="00:14:29.190" style="s2">alignment with the essence or more in</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.540" end="00:14:31.889" style="s2">line with the grassroots characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.190" end="00:14:33.930" style="s2">of the generator function that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.889" end="00:14:37.319" style="s2">up that&#39;s the Trump insurgency from my</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.930" end="00:14:40.380" style="s2">perspective is a phenomenon kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.319" end="00:14:42.269" style="s2">a cork floating on a wave and the wave</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.380" end="00:14:43.860" style="s2">came and it&#39;s been radial to right or</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.269" end="00:14:45.240" style="s2">actually a surfer riding in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.860" end="00:14:46.740" style="s2">even better metaphor they&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.240" end="00:14:48.690" style="s2">to figure out how to ride that wave and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.740" end="00:14:49.980" style="s2">surf it and show up his head in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.690" end="00:14:54.660" style="s2">directionality an agency on their own</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.980" end="00:14:55.949" style="s2">but it&#39;s the wave that matters in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.660" end="00:14:57.899" style="s2">sense we can kind of skip the globalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.949" end="00:14:59.910" style="s2">pieces to happen that fast I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.899" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">remember way back in the day when things</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.910" end="00:15:07.079" style="s2">like the trans-pacific partnership had a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:08.910" style="s2">characteristic of really seriously scary</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.079" end="00:15:10.560" style="s2">how the hell are we gonna stop this</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.910" end="00:15:12.180" style="s2">fight this kind of a thing and they just</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.560" end="00:15:16.740" style="s2">woke up one day and was completely gone</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.180" end="00:15:18.680" style="s2">and of course we&#39;ve seen the a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.740" end="00:15:20.910" style="s2">the machinery of globalism has just been</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.680" end="00:15:23.010" style="s2">but I think nafta&#39;s gotten is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.910" end="00:15:24.060" style="s2">amazing the rapidity with which that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.010" end="00:15:26.130" style="s2">been evaporated and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.060" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">largely because it never really</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.130" end="00:15:31.059" style="s2">established a strong position</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:34.220" style="s2">in tozzoli so the globalism was</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.059" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">fundamentally still a American to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.220" end="00:15:41.689" style="s2">lesser extent EU functioning so as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:43.790" style="s2">forces of decentralization have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.689" end="00:15:48.249" style="s2">happening at this level this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.790" end="00:15:51.069" style="s2">have a whole lot of its own coherency in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.249" end="00:15:54.499" style="s2">so I continue to believe that that will</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.069" end="00:15:56.809" style="s2">continue to evolve and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.499" end="00:16:00.430" style="s2">an area that has anyone who understands</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.809" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">the history and political theory is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.430" end="00:16:07.160" style="s2">reasonably concerned because any shift</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:10.730" style="s2">from a hegemony to a multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.160" end="00:16:12.620" style="s2">structure generally goes badly doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.730" end="00:16:13.819" style="s2">always but generally goes badly but</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.620" end="00:16:14.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that multipolar structures</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.819" end="00:16:17.660" style="s2">aren&#39;t themselves able to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.930" end="00:16:19.610" style="s2">stability over periods of time but what</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.660" end="00:16:22.309" style="s2">it does mean is that the shift is tricky</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.610" end="00:16:24.439" style="s2">so to the degree to which we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.309" end="00:16:27.889" style="s2">watching something where the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.439" end="00:16:29.509" style="s2">an American hegemony which was in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.889" end="00:16:32.689" style="s2">sense showing up as globalism the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.509" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">neoliberal globalist insist is breaking</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.689" end="00:16:36.559" style="s2">down and there&#39;s a move towards</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:37.999" style="s2">multipolar nationalism or something else</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.559" end="00:16:43.100" style="s2">by the way and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.999" end="00:16:44.779" style="s2">stable we&#39;re in a moment of significant</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.100" end="00:16:46.429" style="s2">potential risk in small movements if</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.779" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">anybody decides they want to reach for</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.429" end="00:16:55.879" style="s2">the brass ring then it creates a cascade</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:58.189" style="s2">of conflict so then we have the last</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.879" end="00:17:00.019" style="s2">front which is the culture front the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.189" end="00:17:03.649" style="s2">culture of war and here I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.019" end="00:17:05.449" style="s2">the blue church in its specificity and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.649" end="00:17:08.029" style="s2">my proposition is the blue church is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.449" end="00:17:10.159" style="s2">deeper than these other ones so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.029" end="00:17:12.500" style="s2">it&#39;s closer to the center of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.159" end="00:17:14.380" style="s2">happening and on the other side now I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.500" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">talked about the red religion which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.380" end="00:17:18.140" style="s2">deeper than the insurgency it&#39;s closer</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:19.309" style="s2">to the essence of what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.140" end="00:17:22.130" style="s2">both of these are happening at the level</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.309" end="00:17:23.870" style="s2">of culture so here we have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.130" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">think about how culture manifests itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.870" end="00:17:29.179" style="s2">up into causation but maybe we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:31.399" style="s2">there in a second so just for clarity</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.179" end="00:17:33.230" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the blue church what</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.399" end="00:17:38.300" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about or what I proposed</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.230" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">that means is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.300" end="00:17:50.780" style="s2">way that culture is able to be and do in</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:52.430" style="s2">a context so the blue church is a given</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.780" end="00:17:54.710" style="s2">very specific instantiation of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.430" end="00:17:56.120" style="s2">of thing in the essay I wrote about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.710" end="00:17:59.240" style="s2">blue church in particular I called out</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.120" end="00:18:01.580" style="s2">for example the Victorian consensus the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.240" end="00:18:04.340" style="s2">Victorian synthesis as something of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.580" end="00:18:06.920" style="s2">same kind some kind of organism a</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.340" end="00:18:09.950" style="s2">cultural organism if you&#39;d like and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.920" end="00:18:11.990" style="s2">over the period between World War one</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.950" end="00:18:14.360" style="s2">through the end of World War two that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.990" end="00:18:15.650" style="s2">collapsed and a new one formed and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.360" end="00:18:17.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of things that go</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.650" end="00:18:21.850" style="s2">inside that box but broadly speaking you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.270" end="00:18:25.160" style="s2">have things like how media technologies</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.850" end="00:18:27.470" style="s2">enable groups large groups of people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.160" end="00:18:28.940" style="s2">be able to make sense together make</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.470" end="00:18:30.890" style="s2">choices to get there an act effectively</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.940" end="00:18:35.150" style="s2">together right so basically forming a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.890" end="00:18:36.410" style="s2">noodle loop as a group and the blue</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.150" end="00:18:38.060" style="s2">church was that sort of thing and its</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.410" end="00:18:40.220" style="s2">characteristic had to do with this sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.060" end="00:18:43.670" style="s2">of broadcast a sense of whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.220" end="00:18:46.130" style="s2">talking about in school there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.670" end="00:18:48.020" style="s2">student so there&#39;s a teacher and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.130" end="00:18:50.570" style="s2">a bunch of students so asymmetry and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.020" end="00:18:52.970" style="s2">passivity one you know directionality so</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.570" end="00:18:56.060" style="s2">agency lives in the center in the</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.190" end="00:19:05.990" style="s2">you see that basic topology show up over</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.990" end="00:19:10.460" style="s2">of the second half of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.150" end="00:19:13.010" style="s2">and the blue church is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.460" end="00:19:14.330" style="s2">built around that or uses that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.010" end="00:19:15.920" style="s2">primary components mean it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.330" end="00:19:22.370" style="s2">skeleton the muscles of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.920" end="00:19:25.300" style="s2">are that and we&#39;ve talked about the who</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.370" end="00:19:28.870" style="s2">like who are who are characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.300" end="00:19:31.940" style="s2">representatives of blue church or are</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.870" end="00:19:34.010" style="s2">become Archbishop&#39;s in the church and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.940" end="00:19:35.210" style="s2">again somebody like Harvard an entity</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.010" end="00:19:36.470" style="s2">like Harvard would be an example the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.210" end="00:19:38.750" style="s2">State Department would be an example</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.470" end="00:19:40.370" style="s2">particularly like Kennedy&#39;s State</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.750" end="00:19:42.140" style="s2">Department would be an example you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.370" end="00:19:45.470" style="s2">see like how much those things connect a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.140" end="00:19:47.150" style="s2">sense of meritocratic verticality NASA</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.470" end="00:19:50.120" style="s2">is an example of a blue church</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.150" end="00:19:50.800" style="s2">organization meritocratic verticality</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.120" end="00:19:57.010" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.800" end="00:19:59.230" style="s2">then GE like Six Sigma highly efficient</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.010" end="00:20:02.500" style="s2">effective bureaucratic actuation down</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.230" end="00:20:04.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s that kind of a structure GE</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.500" end="00:20:06.820" style="s2">be a classic example so notice that a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.390" end="00:20:08.140" style="s2">lot of these examples are 1970s right</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.820" end="00:20:10.060" style="s2">the blue church was at its highest and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.140" end="00:20:11.970" style="s2">is most clear pristine in the late</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.060" end="00:20:16.110" style="s2">seventies and has been in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.970" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">decline since then decline both because</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.110" end="00:20:24.940" style="s2">these kinds of systems have a built in</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">like a rust or atherosclerosis they</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.940" end="00:20:30.630" style="s2">become burdensome in enough himself and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:32.950" style="s2">become less efficient just on their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.630" end="00:20:34.480" style="s2">they&#39;re also subject to various forms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.950" end="00:20:37.390" style="s2">corruption the longer they&#39;re around and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.480" end="00:20:40.570" style="s2">in this case the underlying basis the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.390" end="00:20:43.030" style="s2">the source of a lot of the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.570" end="00:20:44.680" style="s2">the blue church a broadcast media has</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.030" end="00:20:46.090" style="s2">shifted and so the blue church is</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.680" end="00:20:48.490" style="s2">suffering for three distinct maladies</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.090" end="00:20:50.200" style="s2">simultaneously and it&#39;s shifted to this</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.490" end="00:20:54.360" style="s2">new place right so we have something</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.200" end="00:20:56.410" style="s2">where we have an old mature strong</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.360" end="00:20:58.230" style="s2">well-functioning I&#39;m not well</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.410" end="00:21:01.030" style="s2">functioning but long functioning</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.230" end="00:21:02.200" style="s2">structure the blue church which actuates</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.030" end="00:21:04.300" style="s2">for example through the deep state</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.200" end="00:21:06.850" style="s2">through the mainstream media that is in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.300" end="00:21:09.130" style="s2">the state of decline and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.850" end="00:21:11.350" style="s2">this new emergent thing the red religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.130" end="00:21:13.680" style="s2">which is in the state of Ascension</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.350" end="00:21:17.350" style="s2">trying to figure out how to do stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.680" end="00:21:19.780" style="s2">I think the developmental metaphor of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.350" end="00:21:21.790" style="s2">biological organism is quite good if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.780" end="00:21:24.670" style="s2">take a look at the age you might say</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.790" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">that the blue church is saying in their</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.670" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">mid 80s and they&#39;ve been smoking and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:32.860" style="s2">drinking a bit much so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:37.480" style="s2">healthy eighties and then the red</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.860" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">religion is maybe 14 so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.480" end="00:21:41.950" style="s2">that&#39;s a good sense of the shape of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:43.330" style="s2">maybe nothing&#39;s maybe they&#39;re in there</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.950" end="00:21:45.310" style="s2">even their late 60s but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.330" end="00:21:48.370" style="s2">healthy sixties there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.310" end="00:21:52.570" style="s2">that and so so what is the red religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.370" end="00:21:54.790" style="s2">the red religion is first of all red and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.570" end="00:21:56.590" style="s2">I need to kind of dial in on why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.790" end="00:21:58.390" style="s2">red and what that means for long-term</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.590" end="00:21:59.710" style="s2">evolution so before we get there and</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.390" end="00:22:01.210" style="s2">just talk about religion versus church</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.710" end="00:22:02.390" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll talk about blue versus</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.210" end="00:22:04.850" style="s2">red</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.390" end="00:22:06.769" style="s2">the church leanness of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.850" end="00:22:09.500" style="s2">was most of what i was talking about its</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.769" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">form the way it shows up the balloonist</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.500" end="00:22:14.360" style="s2">the content is as far as they can tell a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:16.669" style="s2">little bit of just an accident that over</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.360" end="00:22:18.169" style="s2">the period of the 20th century when</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.669" end="00:22:21.409" style="s2">Beaulieu which in the u.s. kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.169" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">represents the political left and read</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.409" end="00:22:26.659" style="s2">the political right ran into each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:32.330" style="s2">and conflicted blue one the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.659" end="00:22:33.409" style="s2">so by the mid eighties blue had won and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.330" end="00:22:35.210" style="s2">it was in the process of them</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.409" end="00:22:37.880" style="s2">propagating itself out into the social</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.210" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">field so most of the engines of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.880" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">church are running blue code we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:46.250" style="s2">loving running blue content they tell do</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:48.860" style="s2">the stores they have values it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.250" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">actually more to the point and while</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.860" end="00:22:53.960" style="s2">there was in the 50s for example a red</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:57.409" style="s2">church that was running red that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.960" end="00:22:59.059" style="s2">that&#39;s gone and so so now I switch</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.409" end="00:23:02.630" style="s2">quickly to the mission of a red religion</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.059" end="00:23:04.460" style="s2">religion then come back to redness so</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.630" end="00:23:07.820" style="s2">the idea of religion is this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.460" end="00:23:09.080" style="s2">there is less formal structure it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.820" end="00:23:10.580" style="s2">the Protestants versus the Catholics</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.080" end="00:23:13.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a much more of a peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.580" end="00:23:15.559" style="s2">Bottoms Up grassroots spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.370" end="00:23:16.970" style="s2">formation building up something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.559" end="00:23:19.399" style="s2">maybe looks like structure but is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.970" end="00:23:21.080" style="s2">actually made of of sand that can fade</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.399" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">right back and go back out into the into</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.080" end="00:23:26.750" style="s2">the dust and this of course is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:28.399" style="s2">natural way that organization will</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.750" end="00:23:31.960" style="s2">happen in something like the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.399" end="00:23:35.960" style="s2">and something like a asynchronous</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.960" end="00:23:38.539" style="s2">symmetric decentralized and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.960" end="00:23:43.490" style="s2">digital communications medium and so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.539" end="00:23:45.950" style="s2">see the mean wars our great example I</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.490" end="00:23:48.470" style="s2">mean wars in the blue church look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.950" end="00:23:50.600" style="s2">Madison Avenue and they look like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.470" end="00:23:52.760" style="s2">small number of potentially quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.600" end="00:23:55.220" style="s2">talented individuals trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.760" end="00:23:57.380" style="s2">out what will sell and maybe using focus</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.220" end="00:23:59.240" style="s2">groups to home their message and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.380" end="00:24:00.760" style="s2">firing it out with a lot of intensity</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.240" end="00:24:04.130" style="s2">through all channels</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.760" end="00:24:08.750" style="s2">whereas what the meme Wars look like so</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.130" end="00:24:11.659" style="s2">the red religion is self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.750" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">self-assembling essentially everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.659" end="00:24:15.289" style="s2">participating and they kind of bubble up</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:16.130" style="s2">and certain one certain means that kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.289" end="00:24:17.300" style="s2">of vaguely go</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.130" end="00:24:19.310" style="s2">the right direction get picked up</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.300" end="00:24:21.050" style="s2">mutated replicated disseminated picked</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.310" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">up a new peanut replicated and submitted</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.050" end="00:24:26.180" style="s2">and what works is sort of naturally</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:29.390" style="s2">grasped and felt and evolved in</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.180" end="00:24:31.400" style="s2">real-time and by the way in the process</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.390" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">of evolving in real-time Orient&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.400" end="00:24:37.190" style="s2">tension in the organism towards those</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:38.990" style="s2">streams that evolve those that one so a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.190" end="00:24:41.330" style="s2">good example would be the NPC meme maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.990" end="00:24:43.340" style="s2">from a good NPC name is fantastic I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.330" end="00:24:44.780" style="s2">think about it if you watch it and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.340" end="00:24:46.130" style="s2">can we can we we live in a digital world</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.780" end="00:24:47.900" style="s2">you can literally just zoom back the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.130" end="00:24:50.780" style="s2">clock and see it emerge right there was</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.900" end="00:24:53.240" style="s2">a tweet from a gamer using the NPC</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.780" end="00:24:54.410" style="s2">metaphor don&#39;t be an NPC which to gamers</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.240" end="00:24:56.800" style="s2">mean something very obvious and simple</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.410" end="00:24:59.720" style="s2">and don&#39;t be something that is driven by</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.800" end="00:25:01.010" style="s2">non-agency that it has by the way sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.720" end="00:25:01.820" style="s2">of characteristic stupidity and</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.820" end="00:25:06.290" style="s2">they&#39;re just run scripts but the because</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:07.850" style="s2">a lot of people in the read religion</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.290" end="00:25:10.310" style="s2">were the way of gamers I think it landed</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.850" end="00:25:12.200" style="s2">and then it got picked up and hit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.310" end="00:25:14.540" style="s2">stung there was something about it that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.200" end="00:25:16.820" style="s2">generated an effect so it was both on</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.540" end="00:25:19.310" style="s2">this side and the red side it was felt</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.820" end="00:25:21.260" style="s2">as yep that makes sense that that lands</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.310" end="00:25:23.540" style="s2">I get it I kind of croc the essence of</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.540" end="00:25:27.890" style="s2">very much a press press the attack and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.670" end="00:25:30.650" style="s2">so it was a spontaneous formation and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.890" end="00:25:32.780" style="s2">then it spread huge amount of energy was</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.650" end="00:25:35.210" style="s2">pointed to figuring out how to modify it</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.780" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">and and and move it into deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.210" end="00:25:39.020" style="s2">deeper levels of effectiveness and by</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:40.940" style="s2">the way effectiveness in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.020" end="00:25:42.110" style="s2">like being cool figuring out how to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.940" end="00:25:44.330" style="s2">the one who innovates the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.110" end="00:25:45.830" style="s2">everybody else picks up oftentimes by</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.330" end="00:25:48.980" style="s2">the way anonymously so it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.830" end="00:25:52.940" style="s2">cool and becoming in a centralized point</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.980" end="00:25:57.320" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know being cool like just</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.940" end="00:26:00.770" style="s2">ended in the moment and then also what</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.320" end="00:26:02.030" style="s2">is up taken what sticks and does it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.770" end="00:26:04.160" style="s2">of course as we watch it over a period</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.030" end="00:26:06.350" style="s2">of very briefly like two weeks it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.160" end="00:26:08.360" style="s2">dominated dominated the entirety of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.350" end="00:26:10.630" style="s2">social media environment to the point</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.360" end="00:26:14.200" style="s2">that centralized structures like Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.630" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">had to modify their basic rule structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.200" end="00:26:19.160" style="s2">and roll out entirely new approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:21.170" style="s2">try to combat that thing and of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.160" end="00:26:23.660" style="s2">this is a classic example of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.170" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">squat you know a hundred million flies</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.660" end="00:26:28.990" style="s2">now whack-a-mole whack-a-mole well like</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.950" end="00:26:36.760" style="s2">who cares by the time</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.300" end="00:26:37.960" style="s2">Twitter had moved to swipe it the red</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.760" end="00:26:40.420" style="s2">religion already moved on to something</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.960" end="00:26:43.210" style="s2">else and and the damage was done because</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.420" end="00:26:45.460" style="s2">now you remember Junius oranges point</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.210" end="00:26:49.000" style="s2">way back in the day when wiki leaks came</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.460" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">out the bureaucracies are already dead</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.000" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">because to the degree to which they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:56.980" style="s2">subject to negative risk from leaks they</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:59.080" style="s2">basically have two choices</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.980" end="00:27:01.059" style="s2">well three they can either just take it</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.080" end="00:27:02.290" style="s2">on the chin and then ultimately lose</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.059" end="00:27:05.620" style="s2">because they&#39;re subject to negative risk</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.290" end="00:27:08.500" style="s2">they can endeavor to constrain leaks</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.620" end="00:27:10.990" style="s2">which means significally increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.500" end="00:27:12.730" style="s2">internal policing or they can radically</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.990" end="00:27:14.980" style="s2">reduce the amount of communication they</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.730" end="00:27:17.860" style="s2">engage in and in any one of those three</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.980" end="00:27:20.050" style="s2">cases they&#39;re shrinking their sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.860" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">operations dramatically same basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.050" end="00:27:24.070" style="s2">here right the idea is that the loop of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:26.710" style="s2">the insurgency is moving so rapidly that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.070" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">when something like Twitter moves it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.710" end="00:27:30.370" style="s2">actually hurting itself more than it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:33.190" style="s2">hurting the insurgency and basically the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.370" end="00:27:35.410" style="s2">insurgency is using its capacities to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.190" end="00:27:38.020" style="s2">cause the blue church to punch yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.410" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">in the face over and over again question</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.020" end="00:27:42.850" style="s2">that comes up like the insurgency in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:45.730" style="s2">red religion are they synonymous and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.850" end="00:27:48.730" style="s2">also and also because you you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.730" end="00:27:51.850" style="s2">the IDW like would you identify that as</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.730" end="00:27:53.250" style="s2">part of the insurgency great yeah so if</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.850" end="00:27:55.809" style="s2">I think about it as like layer cake</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.250" end="00:27:58.510" style="s2">layers up the red religion is more basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.809" end="00:28:01.410" style="s2">than the insurgency the red religion is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.510" end="00:28:05.559" style="s2">at the level of values and the level of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.410" end="00:28:07.780" style="s2">strategy the insurgency is more at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.559" end="00:28:12.100" style="s2">level of purpose at the level of goals</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.780" end="00:28:13.090" style="s2">its endeavoring to do something you may</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.100" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">even say the interest is level of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.090" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">aesthetic sensibility and so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:21.910" style="s2">insurgency is a manifestation of the red</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:23.950" style="s2">religion which is itself a manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.910" end="00:28:28.090" style="s2">of just religiousness which I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.950" end="00:28:29.950" style="s2">to describe and in that sense the IDW is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.090" end="00:28:31.750" style="s2">also a manifestation of the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.950" end="00:28:35.170" style="s2">thing which is to say it&#39;s showing up as</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.750" end="00:28:37.720" style="s2">a bottoms-up self-organizing structure</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.170" end="00:28:40.630" style="s2">that is powered by the wave by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.720" end="00:28:42.570" style="s2">energy of this new kind of medium with</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.630" end="00:28:45.719" style="s2">this new medium makes available</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.570" end="00:28:47.629" style="s2">and as such it is a natural ally so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.719" end="00:28:49.799" style="s2">could say that as part of the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.629" end="00:28:50.849" style="s2">unconsciously but remember I&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.799" end="00:28:52.889" style="s2">distinction between the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.849" end="00:28:54.779" style="s2">administration and this thing down here</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.889" end="00:28:57.149" style="s2">which is by definition decentralized all</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.779" end="00:28:59.309" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not a there&#39;s no point on</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.149" end="00:29:00.749" style="s2">which you could say that&#39;s in charge so</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.309" end="00:29:02.729" style="s2">to the degree to which the identity was</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.749" end="00:29:04.859" style="s2">doing this kind of thing functionally</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.729" end="00:29:08.190" style="s2">and effectively visiter the mass media</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.859" end="00:29:10.289" style="s2">then it is acting as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.190" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">insurgency and it&#39;s an expression of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.289" end="00:29:15.539" style="s2">religion and now here&#39;s where&#39;s get it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.159" end="00:29:17.369" style="s2">gets interesting so this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.539" end="00:29:18.809" style="s2">really nice point so remember I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.369" end="00:29:20.190" style="s2">to focus on the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.809" end="00:29:23.339" style="s2">redness and the religionist</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.190" end="00:29:26.339" style="s2">piece so the redness is again kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.339" end="00:29:29.519" style="s2">historical artifact red was the loser of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.339" end="00:29:31.319" style="s2">the last war so they weren&#39;t distracted</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.519" end="00:29:32.489" style="s2">by trying to run old machinery they</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.319" end="00:29:34.319" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any old machinery to run</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.489" end="00:29:35.489" style="s2">they were given the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.319" end="00:29:38.819" style="s2">opportunity to have to learn new things</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.489" end="00:29:41.819" style="s2">and so the value structures the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.819" end="00:29:45.089" style="s2">sensibility the even the dispositional</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.819" end="00:29:47.819" style="s2">types who were disempowered by the loss</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.089" end="00:29:52.049" style="s2">of the culture war of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.819" end="00:29:53.759" style="s2">found themselves in a evolutionary under</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.049" end="00:29:55.739" style="s2">evolutionary pressure and so they</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.759" end="00:29:57.419" style="s2">therefore more rapidly figured out how</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.739" end="00:30:00.599" style="s2">to begin playing the game in this new</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.419" end="00:30:02.309" style="s2">space they playing the religion game as</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.599" end="00:30:04.949" style="s2">opposed to the church game playing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.309" end="00:30:07.049" style="s2">network game as opposed to the broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.949" end="00:30:11.309" style="s2">game and I should mention by the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.049" end="00:30:14.789" style="s2">they also evolved mimetic defense</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.309" end="00:30:16.589" style="s2">mechanisms they the same tools that had</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.789" end="00:30:18.419" style="s2">been used in the cultural wars the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.589" end="00:30:22.289" style="s2">century calling someone a racist for</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.419" end="00:30:24.629" style="s2">example which still kind of decimates</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.289" end="00:30:25.829" style="s2">people who are from the 20th century has</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.629" end="00:30:27.239" style="s2">very little impact on people who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.829" end="00:30:28.769" style="s2">truly coming from the grass like 4chan</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.239" end="00:30:30.929" style="s2">doesn&#39;t care at all like it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.769" end="00:30:32.369" style="s2">any impact at all so that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.929" end="00:30:37.799" style="s2">distinct things like one has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.369" end="00:30:39.209" style="s2">the semantic emotional language games</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.799" end="00:30:42.059" style="s2">that happen and the other one has to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.209" end="00:30:44.819" style="s2">with the OODA loop organizing collective</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.059" end="00:30:46.649" style="s2">intelligence piece and the redness of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.819" end="00:30:48.959" style="s2">the red religion has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.649" end="00:30:51.450" style="s2">artifact of a particular dispositional</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.959" end="00:30:53.399" style="s2">group kinds of people with backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.450" end="00:30:55.560" style="s2">and values found themselves having to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.399" end="00:30:56.850" style="s2">figure out how to new use new tools</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.560" end="00:30:58.710" style="s2">they figured out how to use those new</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.850" end="00:30:59.940" style="s2">tools and then began to have some</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.710" end="00:31:01.860" style="s2">success initially and by the way in</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.940" end="00:31:03.150" style="s2">gamergate as far as I can tell there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.860" end="00:31:05.310" style="s2">obviously than earlier examples that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.150" end="00:31:07.830" style="s2">the first time that I think we really</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.310" end="00:31:11.790" style="s2">saw the red religion had a certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.830" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">self-consciousness or a win a win a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.790" end="00:31:16.160" style="s2">fight it&#39;s probably better put and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:20.490" style="s2">notice that they want to fight</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.160" end="00:31:23.070" style="s2">surprisingly so this makes the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.490" end="00:31:24.540" style="s2">of could it be a blue religion and of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.070" end="00:31:26.280" style="s2">course does even need to be red or blue</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.540" end="00:31:29.150" style="s2">because many senses the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.280" end="00:31:31.320" style="s2">written blue is itself an artifact of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.150" end="00:31:33.870" style="s2">kind of the landscape of the past</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.320" end="00:31:35.430" style="s2">century the last two centuries something</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.870" end="00:31:37.320" style="s2">like that means if you go back far</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.430" end="00:31:40.350" style="s2">enough that ideas that make a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.320" end="00:31:41.850" style="s2">of sense maybe for 50,000 years but at</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.350" end="00:31:46.770" style="s2">some point it dissolves back into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.850" end="00:31:48.780" style="s2">the basics of humaneness so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.770" end="00:31:52.050" style="s2">there could be a blue religion it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.780" end="00:31:54.270" style="s2">of a question and then 2019 I pointed</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.050" end="00:31:55.560" style="s2">out the fact that perhaps with AOC we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.270" end="00:31:58.170" style="s2">beginning to see the emergence of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.560" end="00:32:00.870" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a blue content blue</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.170" end="00:32:02.700" style="s2">narrative blue story blue values showing</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.870" end="00:32:03.870" style="s2">up expressing themselves but now</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.700" end="00:32:06.780" style="s2">expressing them solving away which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.870" end="00:32:09.930" style="s2">very very I was a obviously different</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.780" end="00:32:12.750" style="s2">than the blue church and so AOC and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.930" end="00:32:17.000" style="s2">Nancy&#39;s an insurgent in the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.750" end="00:32:23.270" style="s2">and yeah in blue she&#39;s a blue insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.000" end="00:32:26.540" style="s2">and operating in the same sensibility as</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.270" end="00:32:30.110" style="s2">the red but because of the different</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.540" end="00:32:32.790" style="s2">valence of the typology of blue the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.110" end="00:32:34.920" style="s2">dispositions the values the aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.790" end="00:32:36.030" style="s2">and in the relationships in the position</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.920" end="00:32:37.500" style="s2">where the action happened actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.030" end="00:32:39.510" style="s2">happened to be it shows up differently</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.500" end="00:32:40.860" style="s2">and will continue to evolve different</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.510" end="00:32:42.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind of organism in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.860" end="00:32:45.660" style="s2">this environment so sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.540" end="00:32:48.180" style="s2">difference between I don&#39;t know a Jaguar</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.660" end="00:32:49.710" style="s2">and a crocodile both are predators both</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.180" end="00:32:50.820" style="s2">happen to live in the rainforest they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.710" end="00:32:53.070" style="s2">quite different cuz they have different</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.820" end="00:32:54.390" style="s2">origin stories and neither will do well</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.070" end="00:32:55.740" style="s2">in the desert and both are very</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.390" end="00:32:59.160" style="s2">effective in their particular sub niche</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.740" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">of the broader ecosystem ok so then we</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.160" end="00:33:02.370" style="s2">can kind of move to the last piece when</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:04.350" style="s2">I wrote was writing those pieces I</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.370" end="00:33:07.020" style="s2">actually brought it for fronts and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.350" end="00:33:07.890" style="s2">line and then here&#39;s the deeper story so</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.020" end="00:33:09.990" style="s2">now we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.890" end="00:33:12.990" style="s2">deeper story then of course the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.990" end="00:33:15.030" style="s2">story is all of the superstructure that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.990" end="00:33:17.370" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about even culture with</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.030" end="00:33:19.110" style="s2">certainly media and bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.370" end="00:33:21.270" style="s2">institutions and globalism and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.110" end="00:33:24.660" style="s2">particular political parties and</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.490" end="00:33:33.210" style="s2">of the bigger movements that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.540" end="00:33:34.350" style="s2">happening underneath and me and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.210" end="00:33:36.150" style="s2">historically we&#39;ve seen this happen many</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.350" end="00:33:42.120" style="s2">times I think a nice one happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.150" end="00:33:43.740" style="s2">the kind of 15th 16th century transition</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.120" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">around the Gutenberg Bible if you want</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.740" end="00:33:48.870" style="s2">to just use media as one line right the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:51.240" style="s2">shift of the the church in the classic</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.630" end="00:33:59.670" style="s2">the line that happened there you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.870" end="00:34:00.840" style="s2">all the hot stuff changed your feudalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.670" end="00:34:03.450" style="s2">shifted to a completely different</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.450" end="00:34:11.190" style="s2">structure your religion shifted from</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.580" end="00:34:12.810" style="s2">Catholic meaning truly universal to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.190" end="00:34:14.640" style="s2">meaning one among many competing</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.640" end="00:34:20.130" style="s2">and etc and even underlying human</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.030" end="00:34:21.659" style="s2">concepts of the nature of lived reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.130" end="00:34:25.740" style="s2">you know the Copernican revolution</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.659" end="00:34:27.179" style="s2">happened in that context the Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.740" end="00:34:29.100" style="s2">revolution happened in that contact I</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.179" end="00:34:31.770" style="s2">suppose massive shifts are happening and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.100" end="00:34:34.860" style="s2">we&#39;re in a circumstance that is at least</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.770" end="00:34:37.320" style="s2">as if not more significant in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.860" end="00:34:40.050" style="s2">the magnitude of the shift from this</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.320" end="00:34:43.080" style="s2">broadcast style to this decentralizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.050" end="00:34:44.700" style="s2">style media and therefore the culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.080" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">that will emerge on top of it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.700" end="00:34:48.419" style="s2">therefore the institutional structures</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:50.640" style="s2">economics political structures that will</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.419" end="00:34:52.050" style="s2">emerge on top of that is going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.640" end="00:34:54.090" style="s2">undergo at least as much of a shift</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.050" end="00:34:55.590" style="s2">alright so looking at a massive change</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.090" end="00:34:59.100" style="s2">and the changes they were seeing up here</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.590" end="00:35:01.140" style="s2">are just kind of evidence of it yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.100" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">you&#39;re pulling some sort of boat through</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.140" end="00:35:04.770" style="s2">the water and all you can see the boats</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.510" end="00:35:07.560" style="s2">invisible so all you can see is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.770" end="00:35:09.270" style="s2">waves we&#39;re seeing those are the waves</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.560" end="00:35:10.740" style="s2">and then even the bow waves and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.270" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">looking at okay here&#39;s the boat that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.740" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">making them and so for example in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.400" end="00:35:21.120" style="s2">kind of context red and blue begin to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:21.910" style="s2">become very problematic you start to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.120" end="00:35:25.390" style="s2">a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.910" end="00:35:26.559" style="s2">ability of smaller chunks and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.390" end="00:35:28.630" style="s2">already seeing that like we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.559" end="00:35:30.369" style="s2">for example the the balkanization of</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.630" end="00:35:32.200" style="s2">blue which is sort of naturally going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.369" end="00:35:34.869" style="s2">balkanize anyway but showing up as</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.200" end="00:35:37.990" style="s2">having lots and lots of little sub</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.869" end="00:35:39.700" style="s2">communities that are perhaps looking to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.990" end="00:35:41.020" style="s2">find coherence in and of themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.700" end="00:35:44.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a really nice essay that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.020" end="00:35:47.079" style="s2">written culture war two dot oh I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.230" end="00:35:48.940" style="s2">so Peter Lindbergh where he just</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.079" end="00:35:50.440" style="s2">enumerated a list of like 13 or 15 of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.940" end="00:35:52.660" style="s2">them and how they showed up and some</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.440" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">scenes mimetic tribes a city called them</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.660" end="00:35:56.980" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a very nice term which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:58.359" style="s2">hilarious of course because it begs the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.980" end="00:36:00.700" style="s2">question of what does me anything mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.359" end="00:36:02.530" style="s2">to you and what mimetic tribe you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.700" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">will in some sense answer that question</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.530" end="00:36:05.410" style="s2">so we start getting some very</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:07.900" style="s2">interesting self referentiality of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.410" end="00:36:10.359" style="s2">course that&#39;s where we are the you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.900" end="00:36:13.780" style="s2">the postmodern condition all the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.359" end="00:36:15.789" style="s2">down and in so my proposition and in</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.780" end="00:36:17.049" style="s2">fact my prediction is is that the story</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.789" end="00:36:18.520" style="s2">that we&#39;re watching is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.049" end="00:36:22.089" style="s2">story that continues to see an</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.520" end="00:36:26.380" style="s2">increasing movement into balkanization</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.089" end="00:36:29.020" style="s2">and fractionating but fractionating at</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.380" end="00:36:31.059" style="s2">the level below culture freshening at</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.020" end="00:36:33.160" style="s2">the level of how we make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.059" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">reality at all infractions the level of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.160" end="00:36:37.869" style="s2">how we collaborate and come together as</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:40.359" style="s2">groups of people at all and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.869" end="00:36:42.730" style="s2">fractioning in these you know massive</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.359" end="00:36:44.170" style="s2">proliferation of agency many many many</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.730" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">different ways to actually shift and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.170" end="00:36:50.579" style="s2">change reality there will be mutating</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:52.900" style="s2">evolving at a accelerating pace because</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.579" end="00:36:55.470" style="s2">to the degree to which we have one shift</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.900" end="00:36:58.089" style="s2">the shift from broadcast to decentralize</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.470" end="00:37:00.190" style="s2">notice also the shift to decentralize</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.089" end="00:37:03.220" style="s2">carries with it is both a product of and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.190" end="00:37:05.289" style="s2">an accelerant of technological</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.220" end="00:37:06.730" style="s2">innovation collective intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.289" end="00:37:09.430" style="s2">has the capacity to change its own</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.730" end="00:37:11.980" style="s2">environment so this move is not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.430" end="00:37:16.839" style="s2">sort of a move from A to B it&#39;s a move</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.980" end="00:37:19.930" style="s2">from A to B miss where B is actually a</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.930" end="00:37:24.670" style="s2">accelerating and so it&#39;s moving was kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.029" end="00:37:27.609" style="s2">of like static to accelerating and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.670" end="00:37:30.069" style="s2">a very different gig or to say velocity</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.609" end="00:37:32.500" style="s2">to accelerating feudalism to velocity to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.069" end="00:37:34.089" style="s2">acceleration the things is actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.500" end="00:37:35.540" style="s2">group call acceleration ist&#39;s who I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.089" end="00:37:36.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know very well but I measured</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.540" end="00:37:43.730" style="s2">just recapitulated certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.980" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">they believe and so well I mean once you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.730" end="00:37:47.770" style="s2">kind of settle there and say well where</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:50.030" style="s2">does that imply it implies a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.770" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">okay we can kind of go for that if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.030" end="00:37:54.020" style="s2">like but that&#39;s the end of that story</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:57.980" style="s2">that situational assessment ends there</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.020" end="00:38:01.610" style="s2">and going back to sort of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.980" end="00:38:03.380" style="s2">church and there&#39;s a sort of sense in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.610" end="00:38:05.210" style="s2">the article it&#39;s breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.380" end="00:38:07.820" style="s2">increasingly quickly I mean the</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.820" end="00:38:10.790" style="s2">moment where I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.320" end="00:38:13.400" style="s2">sort of looked at the media and thought</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.790" end="00:38:15.620" style="s2">wow it&#39;s the picture that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.400" end="00:38:19.190" style="s2">painted by the media is so off and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.620" end="00:38:20.900" style="s2">clearly dysfunctional but you date it a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.190" end="00:38:24.860" style="s2">little bit further back you dated to the</p>

<p begin="00:38:24.860" end="00:38:35.390" style="s2">was that was kind of the the last ride</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.410" end="00:38:38.030" style="s2">of the blue church an effort to bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.390" end="00:38:39.770" style="s2">full churchly power to bear on a thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.030" end="00:38:42.890" style="s2">that is this topic and subject of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.770" end="00:38:44.780" style="s2">churchly capacity Supreme Court justice</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.890" end="00:38:47.690" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s very few objects that are</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.690" end="00:38:50.750" style="s2">know we&#39;re talking about a if the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:52.730" style="s2">metaphor is the blue church has the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.750" end="00:38:56.090" style="s2">feeling of like a big heavyweight boxer</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.730" end="00:38:57.140" style="s2">who can punch hard this is somebody</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.140" end="00:39:04.760" style="s2">punch and what happened they had to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.050" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">actually shift their agency into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.760" end="00:39:13.190" style="s2">blue insurgency so at that moment the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:14.900" style="s2">blue church did the thing that happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.190" end="00:39:17.060" style="s2">all the time if you look at politically</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.900" end="00:39:18.980" style="s2">they brought in the mercenaries they</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.060" end="00:39:20.440" style="s2">brought in the the folks who are not</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.980" end="00:39:23.960" style="s2">part of their church see structure</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.440" end="00:39:26.750" style="s2">intrinsically as allies but if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.960" end="00:39:28.970" style="s2">what happening Cavanagh all hell broke</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.750" end="00:39:30.650" style="s2">loose at the church something was not in</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.970" end="00:39:31.760" style="s2">charge they did not control the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.650" end="00:39:35.900" style="s2">narrative which is kind of their thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:38.750" style="s2">and and they lost but the losing wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.900" end="00:39:40.970" style="s2">what matter what mattered was they had</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.750" end="00:39:44.360" style="s2">to give power they had to actually give</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.970" end="00:39:47.960" style="s2">the game to a different kind of force</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.360" end="00:39:49.160" style="s2">begin to explain us what was the force</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.960" end="00:39:53.930" style="s2">um see that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.160" end="00:39:56.500" style="s2">the hashtag resists hashtag me too which</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.930" end="00:39:58.819" style="s2">are much more of the blue insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.500" end="00:40:00.859" style="s2">John Robert stack has sped quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.819" end="00:40:05.170" style="s2">specifically from his point of view you</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.859" end="00:40:07.700" style="s2">have the insurgency and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.170" end="00:40:10.849" style="s2">hashtag resist right and these are two</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.700" end="00:40:14.329" style="s2">blue red and they&#39;re coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.849" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">same source in energy and in my point of</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.329" end="00:40:17.690" style="s2">view happens to be that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:20.030" style="s2">threads going on but I wouldn&#39;t disagree</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.690" end="00:40:24.500" style="s2">and so what ended up happening was they</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.030" end="00:40:28.700" style="s2">they move this from the declarant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.500" end="00:40:31.339" style="s2">Thomas situation that dynamic to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.700" end="00:40:34.010" style="s2">dynamic that suddenly was happening in</p>

<p begin="00:40:34.010" end="00:40:39.799" style="s2">was being not just fueled but then</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.069" end="00:40:43.069" style="s2">driven by the energy of the grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.799" end="00:40:44.930" style="s2">coming up just like me more fair that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.069" end="00:40:47.390" style="s2">described before the stories that were</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.930" end="00:40:49.490" style="s2">emerging were happening from the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.390" end="00:40:51.500" style="s2">up and they were being upregulated in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.490" end="00:40:52.940" style="s2">decentralized fashion and to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.500" end="00:40:56.869" style="s2">and somewhat clumsily</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.940" end="00:41:01.160" style="s2">and awkwardly the the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.869" end="00:41:05.420" style="s2">church you know Nancy Pelosi and mister</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.160" end="00:41:06.950" style="s2">lady from California so obsolete that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.420" end="00:41:09.020" style="s2">can&#39;t I don&#39;t even bother to store her</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.950" end="00:41:11.710" style="s2">name anymore she was recently in another</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.020" end="00:41:14.150" style="s2">mean where she told a bunch of kids</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.710" end="00:41:16.460" style="s2">Dianne Feinstein yeah Dianne Feinstein</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.150" end="00:41:17.779" style="s2">like very clumsily trying to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.460" end="00:41:19.250" style="s2">that they were steering this ship but</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.779" end="00:41:20.599" style="s2">obviously not at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.250" end="00:41:23.299" style="s2">they were on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.599" end="00:41:24.500" style="s2">waterfall riding the turbulence and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.299" end="00:41:28.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t take them where they wanted it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.500" end="00:41:30.710" style="s2">go do you have a sense that the the blue</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.220" end="00:41:33.079" style="s2">church broke decisively during Kavanagh</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.710" end="00:41:35.240" style="s2">and then covington for example was was</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.079" end="00:41:39.260" style="s2">the flailing around of a broken sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.240" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">making system yes was to be sure i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.260" end="00:41:43.700" style="s2">the metaphor is over nietzsche actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:46.390" style="s2">had this really great quote where he</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.700" end="00:41:48.950" style="s2">talked about the idea that you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.390" end="00:41:51.260" style="s2">buddha died and they should have shadow</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.950" end="00:41:54.049" style="s2">for a hundred years something along</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.260" end="00:41:55.279" style="s2">those lines the the or the idea that i</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.049" end="00:41:57.710" style="s2">remember as a kid hearing this story</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.279" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">that like a dinosaur would die but</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.710" end="00:42:00.410" style="s2">because its brain was so small and far</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:01.210" style="s2">away from the body that it wouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.410" end="00:42:02.740" style="s2">know it was dead</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.210" end="00:42:05.140" style="s2">for like some meaningful amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.740" end="00:42:07.600" style="s2">something like that the blue church the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.140" end="00:42:10.510" style="s2">back is broken it is no longer a vital</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.600" end="00:42:13.300" style="s2">living homeostatic organism but it still</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.510" end="00:42:14.680" style="s2">has a lot of energy right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.300" end="00:42:17.940" style="s2">flailing is a good term</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.680" end="00:42:21.400" style="s2">it&#39;s actuated in capacity it&#39;s ooodle</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.940" end="00:42:22.870" style="s2">ooodle and so it&#39;s going to increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.400" end="00:42:25.600" style="s2">actually a really good example here</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.870" end="00:42:28.600" style="s2">would be a drunken fighter yeah so at</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.600" end="00:42:30.520" style="s2">Cavan I reach that threshold point where</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.600" end="00:42:31.810" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a drunkard at a bar before</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.520" end="00:42:33.700" style="s2">where the reason keeps drinking where</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.810" end="00:42:36.610" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer actually in control of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.700" end="00:42:38.320" style="s2">its actions it suddenly unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.610" end="00:42:40.060" style="s2">reacting to the environment and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.320" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">decides it&#39;s a really good idea to try</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.060" end="00:42:47.380" style="s2">to punch the bouncer and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:49.630" style="s2">Cavanaugh and then and then it drinks</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.380" end="00:42:52.120" style="s2">some more it&#39;s now bleary-eyed and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.630" end="00:42:54.990" style="s2">swinging wildly and as events are coming</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.120" end="00:42:58.120" style="s2">at it its responses are increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.990" end="00:42:59.820" style="s2">obviously what they are and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.120" end="00:43:01.510" style="s2">blue church&#39;s power lives in fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.820" end="00:43:03.570" style="s2">remember television has this</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.510" end="00:43:06.580" style="s2">characteristic of creating a fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.570" end="00:43:08.470" style="s2">Sensibility we project ourselves into a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.580" end="00:43:10.510" style="s2">world that is not actually the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.470" end="00:43:12.490" style="s2">that we&#39;re in right for me to believe</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.510" end="00:43:14.620" style="s2">that I am watching what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.490" end="00:43:17.020" style="s2">the video has a feeling of it being</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.620" end="00:43:18.130" style="s2">present but you reach for and you touch</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.020" end="00:43:20.380" style="s2">the screen you don&#39;t touch the face of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.130" end="00:43:22.540" style="s2">the person that&#39;s not 3d in reality and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.380" end="00:43:24.130" style="s2">of course even more characteristically</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.540" end="00:43:26.790" style="s2">I&#39;m watching The Avengers which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.130" end="00:43:29.080" style="s2">really really not reality and yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.790" end="00:43:30.820" style="s2">particularly from contemporary humans</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.080" end="00:43:32.710" style="s2">weaned on that from childhood</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.820" end="00:43:34.390" style="s2">it maybe feels more real than the real</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.710" end="00:43:37.120" style="s2">reality I said the blue church a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.390" end="00:43:40.420" style="s2">it is based upon that ability to invoke</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.120" end="00:43:42.160" style="s2">an instinct and a habit of fantasy to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.420" end="00:43:43.600" style="s2">tell a story to everybody orient their</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:47.590" style="s2">attention and choice-making based upon a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.600" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">really well told story and it&#39;s kind of</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.140" end="00:44:45.800" style="s2">really looked like kind of like that so</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.180" end="00:44:48.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the shift it&#39;s the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.800" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">of that being the case and the instincts</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.380" end="00:44:54.740" style="s2">that habit of okay every single time I</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:57.530" style="s2">encounter anything vaguely churchly I</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.740" end="00:45:00.650" style="s2">have to assume that it&#39;s an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.530" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">deliberate intent to manipulate and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.650" end="00:45:04.220" style="s2">probably coordinated in some fashion</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:07.990" style="s2">you can obviously come up here so Eric</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.220" end="00:45:09.980" style="s2">Weinstein called kayfabe yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.990" end="00:45:11.150" style="s2">although it&#39;s not clear to me that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.980" end="00:45:12.020" style="s2">kayfabe in the sense then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.150" end="00:45:12.650" style="s2">quitting me the blue church knows</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.020" end="00:45:14.930" style="s2">they&#39;re faking</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.650" end="00:45:16.490" style="s2">they may have you know they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.930" end="00:45:17.960" style="s2">drinking their own kool-aid they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.490" end="00:45:19.910" style="s2">believe a lot of their own stories which</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.960" end="00:45:23.000" style="s2">is weird because they&#39;re also clearly</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.910" end="00:45:24.650" style="s2">you know making things up so hard to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.000" end="00:45:29.140" style="s2">but somebody somewhere is playing</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.650" end="00:45:29.140" style="s2">kayfabe on that side of the story so</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.070" end="00:45:33.770" style="s2">then when you get to something like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.850" end="00:45:35.150" style="s2">and on all right so what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.770" end="00:45:38.690" style="s2">cue and on is that if you come at it</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.150" end="00:45:40.369" style="s2">with a perspective particularly come up</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.690" end="00:45:42.560" style="s2">with a blue church perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.369" end="00:45:44.359" style="s2">either gonna look like so just to just</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">to someone who maybe doesn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.359" end="00:45:48.550" style="s2">cue and on is can we just recap exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:51.350" style="s2">what it is it&#39;s an alternative narrative</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.550" end="00:45:52.940" style="s2">about so it&#39;s kind of a either a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.350" end="00:45:55.100" style="s2">conspiracy theory or an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.940" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">narrative about what&#39;s going on that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.100" end="00:45:58.940" style="s2">being sort of generated by either</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:03.470" style="s2">someone or some group of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.940" end="00:46:05.960" style="s2">Internet yeah mr. Farrow circulation the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.470" end="00:46:08.450" style="s2">way I would say it is there&#39;s a place on</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.960" end="00:46:10.580" style="s2">the internet called 4chan and it has a</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.450" end="00:46:12.859" style="s2">characteristic of being both ephemeral</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.580" end="00:46:17.810" style="s2">and anonymous meaning that posts are</p>

<p begin="00:46:17.810" end="00:46:21.500" style="s2">to have truly anonymous identity there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:46:21.500" end="00:46:24.950" style="s2">is and there&#39;s an ethos of having I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:46:33.630" end="00:46:37.289" style="s2">a whole new board has to be created so</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.009" end="00:46:39.029" style="s2">there&#39;s a ephemeral and anonymous</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.219" end="00:47:02.009" style="s2">but some post showed up that claimed to</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.769" end="00:47:08.489" style="s2">was quite confusing to a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.999" end="00:47:10.049" style="s2">and had a an aesthetic of asking</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.489" end="00:47:11.430" style="s2">questions provocative questions as</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.049" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">opposed to giving answers and telling</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.140" end="00:47:25.859" style="s2">kind of worked some attention was paid</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.759" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">some people seem to think that was cool</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.859" end="00:47:29.069" style="s2">and it got disseminated and then some</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:30.420" style="s2">more post showed up now of course you</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.069" end="00:47:31.529" style="s2">can&#39;t ever prove that there&#39;s actually</p>

<p begin="00:47:31.529" end="00:47:35.279" style="s2">that&#39;s whole point synonymous but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.660" end="00:47:37.529" style="s2">same aesthetic was used and so some</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.279" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">attention was paid to it and then it got</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.529" end="00:47:42.029" style="s2">bigger and bigger and then it got kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:43.410" style="s2">of big in that very small well in that</p>

<p begin="00:47:47.309" end="00:47:52.469" style="s2">and it began to percolate out more broad</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.680" end="00:47:53.670" style="s2">they started getting called cue anon is</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.350" end="00:50:17.590" style="s2">was in fact also meaningful signal like</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.970" end="00:50:29.619" style="s2">happened now the proposition that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:53:09.170" end="00:53:20.330" style="s2">actually make sense together piece the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.940" end="00:53:23.900" style="s2">most important part is going to be some</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.330" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">level of epistemological maturity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.900" end="00:53:36.280" style="s2">going to be the decisive factor and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:41.990" style="s2">I mean by that is being aware of how</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.280" end="00:53:45.470" style="s2">since making happens being conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.990" end="00:53:47.660" style="s2">how your own sense making has happened</p>

<p begin="00:53:47.660" end="00:53:54.320" style="s2">making and then being mindful and</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.520" end="00:54:04.370" style="s2">fashion that has a good epistemology</p>

<p begin="00:54:04.370" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the decisive factor so</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:11.690" style="s2">while there may be some it&#39;s quite funny</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:13.970" style="s2">actually if you used the blockchain as</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.690" end="00:54:16.270" style="s2">an example remember you had Bitcoin they</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.970" end="00:54:19.490" style="s2">had this kind of cascade of light coins</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.270" end="00:54:21.020" style="s2">alt coins there were more less Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.490" end="00:54:22.460" style="s2">jr. variations on the theme but they</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.020" end="00:54:24.560" style="s2">weren&#39;t that interesting if they had a</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.460" end="00:54:26.930" style="s2">theorem which was actually a very like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.560" end="00:54:28.820" style="s2">whole new kind of idea so there may be</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.930" end="00:54:31.370" style="s2">kind of alt coins in the queue and on</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.820" end="00:54:33.380" style="s2">space but the next thing the next real</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.370" end="00:54:34.670" style="s2">decisive innovation that space is going</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.380" end="00:54:39.470" style="s2">to be something of this sort something</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.670" end="00:54:42.080" style="s2">that has a self-awareness to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.470" end="00:54:44.270" style="s2">epistemological capacity and is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.080" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">that into its design and do you think</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.270" end="00:54:51.110" style="s2">that would emerge from the trans from</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:53.720" style="s2">the same place that came from that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.110" end="00:54:55.460" style="s2">very good question it is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.720" end="00:54:57.920" style="s2">particularly likely but it is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.460" end="00:55:02.600" style="s2">impossible this is because the Chan&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.020" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">naturally be attracted in this direction</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.830" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">but if it does gain traction it can grow</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.650" end="01:04:17.930" style="s2">us so figuring out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.920" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">is particularly challenging when the</p>

<p begin="01:04:58.970" end="01:05:01.730" style="s2">ground to get a whole new system because</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.470" end="01:05:04.099" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite clear whether you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.730" end="01:05:05.329" style="s2">malware in a particular sub component so</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.099" end="01:05:07.549" style="s2">you just have to be very careful just</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.329" end="01:05:08.839" style="s2">takes things step back buy back now we</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.549" end="01:05:11.809" style="s2">actually have a really nice opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.839" end="01:05:13.630" style="s2">so we have a necessity to go through</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.809" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">this reboot process because they all</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.630" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">aforementioned hacking of our limbic</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:19.249" style="s2">systems and the co-evolutionary game</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:20.930" style="s2">theoretic dynamic that means that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.249" end="01:05:25.579" style="s2">hacking is not going to stop on its own</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.930" end="01:05:26.839" style="s2">either the pusher addict is a dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.579" end="01:05:28.190" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have its own like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.839" end="01:05:29.480" style="s2">pushers never going to be in position as</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.190" end="01:05:31.759" style="s2">soon as they give up is another pressure</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.480" end="01:05:34.519" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s got its own logic</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.759" end="01:05:35.900" style="s2">to it so we&#39;ve got that we have an</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.519" end="01:05:37.609" style="s2">assessment and this is we have to get</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.900" end="01:05:39.499" style="s2">off that train but then we have an</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.609" end="01:05:40.940" style="s2">opportunity which is because the whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.499" end="01:05:42.499" style="s2"> world is shifting from one</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.940" end="01:05:45.559" style="s2">fundamental way of going about doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.499" end="01:05:47.269" style="s2">collective intelligence to another it</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.559" end="01:05:50.509" style="s2">turns out the entire structure that has</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.269" end="01:05:52.569" style="s2">been hacked is obsolete anyhow so we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.509" end="01:05:55.519" style="s2">move to the new one and the new one is</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.569" end="01:05:57.380" style="s2">what the very least is different so a</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.519" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">lot of the old hacks aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.380" end="01:06:01.029" style="s2">work and this dudes in this new domain</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">so if you actually allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.029" end="01:06:07.269" style="s2">really free your mind and settle into a</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:09.289" style="s2">very what I call the bottom of the you</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.269" end="01:06:10.789" style="s2">which for example Buddhist meditation</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.289" end="01:06:11.710" style="s2">gets you into that level of just</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.789" end="01:06:13.950" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.710" end="01:06:18.220" style="s2">and then from that place begin to</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.950" end="01:06:20.380" style="s2">recreate some new way of making sense in</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.220" end="01:06:23.950" style="s2">yourself and then making sense together</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.380" end="01:06:25.720" style="s2">with other people you have the advantage</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.950" end="01:06:27.700" style="s2">that you are also almost completely</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.720" end="01:06:30.099" style="s2">immune to most of the techniques that</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.700" end="01:06:31.599" style="s2">come from this previous location it has</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.099" end="01:06:33.670" style="s2">a sort of a downside which you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.599" end="01:06:36.280" style="s2">watch TV anymore but I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.670" end="01:06:37.240" style="s2">where it is but there&#39;s no point in</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.280" end="01:06:39.720" style="s2">watching it anyway if it&#39;s all getting</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.240" end="01:06:42.460" style="s2">played out and in ever decreasing loops</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.720" end="01:06:43.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s true I mean it&#39;s sad it&#39;s kind</p>
