<p begin="00:01:25.180" end="00:01:36.200" style="s2">alright so that being said I&#39;ll head</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.890" end="00:01:39.590" style="s2">over to RIA just this to say my name is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.200" end="00:01:44.450" style="s2">Lea means Maria I&#39;m going to skip M&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.590" end="00:01:48.229" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s my first name</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.450" end="00:01:49.460" style="s2">officially Maria on my passport but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.229" end="00:01:54.830" style="s2">probably one of the reasons why I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.460" end="00:01:56.030" style="s2">Richard to host it&#39;s well I could</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.830" end="00:01:57.229" style="s2">probably ask more interesting questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.030" end="00:02:00.500" style="s2">even then what is your name and how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.229" end="00:02:02.930" style="s2">we pronounce it the first one that comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.500" end="00:02:05.690" style="s2">to mind having some familiarity with</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.930" end="00:02:08.390" style="s2">your work but I still feel like I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.690" end="00:02:11.480" style="s2">novice is you&#39;ve written this book</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.390" end="00:02:13.430" style="s2">called collective prison sing and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.480" end="00:02:15.500" style="s2">you would be useful to talk before we</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.430" end="00:02:17.870" style="s2">get to the collective part about what</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.500" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">what is presence what is it for how do</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.870" end="00:02:23.629" style="s2">we get there why do you like it what do</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:30.099" style="s2">you know about prisons can we visit</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.629" end="00:02:30.099" style="s2">there well what is presence</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.550" end="00:02:39.709" style="s2">for me presence has to do a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.410" end="00:02:43.819" style="s2">being embodied being in your body aware</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.709" end="00:02:54.739" style="s2">of your body and being feeling grounded</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.819" end="00:02:57.230" style="s2">and centered and open it&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.739" end="00:03:03.110" style="s2">thing about collective prancing is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.230" end="00:03:06.050" style="s2">can we use the stance of that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.110" end="00:03:12.290" style="s2">cultivate let&#39;s say in meditation or in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.050" end="00:03:15.500" style="s2">any practice basically can we cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.290" end="00:03:19.299" style="s2">that stance while being in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.500" end="00:03:24.260" style="s2">conversation with each other and dance</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.299" end="00:03:27.049" style="s2">that was the driving question I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.260" end="00:03:32.390" style="s2">which maybe not articulated at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.049" end="00:03:35.239" style="s2">beginning of the process but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.390" end="00:03:36.970" style="s2">made us move into this whole project</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.239" end="00:03:39.980" style="s2">let&#39;s say that bro</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.970" end="00:03:46.370" style="s2">eventually brought this whole model and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.980" end="00:03:54.620" style="s2">practice out so does yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.370" end="00:03:58.970" style="s2">the practices do you okay yeah do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.620" end="00:04:03.079" style="s2">realize do I realize when I&#39;m more or</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.970" end="00:04:07.670" style="s2">less in presence or am i taken up in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.079" end="00:04:10.700" style="s2">ideas or am i more in emotions or and if</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.670" end="00:04:12.950" style="s2">I notice I&#39;m not really present do I</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.700" end="00:04:15.560" style="s2">know what how I can come come back</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.950" end="00:04:19.760" style="s2">that&#39;s how I see how it can come back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.560" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">presence and openness being in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.760" end="00:04:31.890" style="s2">engagement with the world if</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2">you say that you you know you&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.890" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">stumbled into this research question of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:37.200" style="s2">how do we cultivate a stance of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:40.230" style="s2">meditation while we&#39;re in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.200" end="00:04:42.120" style="s2">and conversation if that question wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.230" end="00:04:47.010" style="s2">clear when you started what was guiding</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.120" end="00:04:53.370" style="s2">him how did you know what to do that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.010" end="00:04:55.890" style="s2">very interesting it&#39;s at that point in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.370" end="00:05:02.520" style="s2">time which is like I know them years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.890" end="00:05:05.460" style="s2">um and some what we call circle practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.520" end="00:05:10.860" style="s2">in the conversation in the dialogue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.460" end="00:05:14.130" style="s2">sung in some Co conversations you feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.860" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">like something&#39;s happening you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.130" end="00:05:20.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain quality in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:24.900" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s let&#39;s say beyond a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.460" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">normal conversation and at that point we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.900" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">were so intrigued to be called it the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:32.370" style="s2">magic in the middle because there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.090" end="00:05:35.190" style="s2">something about when you just attend to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.370" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">the middle and not really speak to each</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.190" end="00:05:41.100" style="s2">other or not really like yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:44.040" style="s2">with you but kind of being aware of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.100" end="00:05:48.140" style="s2">was going on through the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.040" end="00:05:50.640" style="s2">through the dialogue this was some</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.140" end="00:05:53.250" style="s2">something that happened that we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.640" end="00:05:55.470" style="s2">fascinated about or at least some of us</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.250" end="00:05:59.490" style="s2">and we call it the magic in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.470" end="00:06:02.490" style="s2">and so we were kind of hoping that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.490" end="00:06:06.450" style="s2">would happen yeah I&#39;m not knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.490" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">it actually was or or how to get there</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.450" end="00:06:15.770" style="s2">or the first ever gathering we did we</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:21.030" style="s2">had a I think a three day gathering</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.770" end="00:06:23.250" style="s2">where finally as facilitation team we</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.030" end="00:06:26.370" style="s2">said like we don&#39;t have any program we</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.250" end="00:06:30.450" style="s2">don&#39;t have any proposals we just drop it</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.370" end="00:06:33.030" style="s2">all and then in that afternoon and some</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.450" end="00:06:38.030" style="s2">people went walking and some people did</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.030" end="00:06:38.030" style="s2">whatever and somehow magically</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:45.139" style="s2">almost everybody converged into a circle</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.910" end="00:06:48.870" style="s2">at some point and we had like to our</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.139" end="00:06:55.130" style="s2">dialogue which was like with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.870" end="00:06:58.500" style="s2">quality and uh yeah that sets me off on</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.130" end="00:07:03.090" style="s2">finding more finding out more about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.500" end="00:07:06.830" style="s2">mmm so if if you found the way to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.090" end="00:07:08.790" style="s2">magic by giving up on your role as host</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.830" end="00:07:11.490" style="s2">there could be a way of experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.790" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">that as a disappointment like it could</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.490" end="00:07:15.810" style="s2">be an impossible riddle how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:17.760" style="s2">back there and so I&#39;m curious what</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.810" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve learned in the in the subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.760" end="00:07:23.300" style="s2">years have they had to what&#39;s the what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">the pathway back to the magic like if</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.300" end="00:07:27.389" style="s2">what you were doing didn&#39;t work and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:29.300" style="s2">was only your surrender and release they</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.389" end="00:07:32.220" style="s2">caught you there is there something more</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.300" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">active and intentional that you know how</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.220" end="00:07:41.060" style="s2">to do now as a host of this process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:41.060" style="s2">still you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.380" end="00:07:55.400" style="s2">not much control or influence but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.500" end="00:07:59.720" style="s2">how you are present in the group itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.400" end="00:08:03.470" style="s2">and what are the questions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.720" end="00:08:10.520" style="s2">bringing what how is your presence in</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.470" end="00:08:15.770" style="s2">the group can you invite people to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.520" end="00:08:18.440" style="s2">a deeper sense of presence but if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.770" end="00:08:22.790" style="s2">really need to let go of any attachment</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.440" end="00:08:27.170" style="s2">because what I noticed because we use a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.790" end="00:08:29.420" style="s2">practice not to meditate or to have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.170" end="00:08:34.610" style="s2">nice dialogue we use a practice to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.420" end="00:08:37.970" style="s2">actually get to some new insights around</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.610" end="00:08:42.110" style="s2">a question that really matters so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.970" end="00:08:44.979" style="s2">not just for the sake of doing it we</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.110" end="00:08:44.979" style="s2">actually want</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.520" end="00:08:51.880" style="s2">some real insights and if the question</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.210" end="00:08:57.940" style="s2">matters to us then you get a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.880" end="00:09:02.260" style="s2">of attachments let&#39;s say on all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.940" end="00:09:06.220" style="s2">things so you first need to work that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.260" end="00:09:08.340" style="s2">true like things need to be spoken needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.220" end="00:09:13.870" style="s2">to be checked out with each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.340" end="00:09:19.030" style="s2">dropped maybe there&#39;s some tension and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.870" end="00:09:22.860" style="s2">can we still again again go back to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.030" end="00:09:28.450" style="s2">presence and it&#39;s not easy especially</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.860" end="00:09:32.590" style="s2">when you have a stake in the in in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.450" end="00:09:34.870" style="s2">question in the topic well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.590" end="00:09:36.520" style="s2">another puzzle yeah I wonder if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.870" end="00:09:37.930" style="s2">gonna keep throwing paradoxes at us so</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.520" end="00:09:39.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a question that really</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.930" end="00:09:42.460" style="s2">matters but then you&#39;re not attached to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.400" end="00:09:44.200" style="s2">the outcome how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.460" end="00:09:48.760" style="s2">discover a question that matters where</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.200" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">do they come from and that&#39;s indeed a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.760" end="00:09:57.400" style="s2">whole art in itself I come from from</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:59.410" style="s2">let&#39;s say lineage it&#39;s called art of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.400" end="00:10:06.190" style="s2">hosting hosting conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.410" end="00:10:10.030" style="s2">matter and there it is one of the real</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.190" end="00:10:12.430" style="s2">crucial capacities you need to train</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.030" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">yourself in or as a team you&#39;ve trained</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.430" end="00:10:19.960" style="s2">there something like if people want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:22.690" style="s2">have a conversation that matters many</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.960" end="00:10:23.230" style="s2">times when you ask them like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.690" end="00:10:27.190" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.230" end="00:10:29.890" style="s2">they stayed a question but many times</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.190" end="00:10:33.430" style="s2">the question is kind of on a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.890" end="00:10:38.110" style="s2">level so you need to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.430" end="00:10:40.690" style="s2">about but what is it actually and my I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.110" end="00:10:43.810" style="s2">trained and worked at subsonic therapist</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.690" end="00:10:46.330" style="s2">and the coach for long so I know what</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.810" end="00:10:49.570" style="s2">people bring on a level like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.330" end="00:10:52.120" style="s2">problem many times what is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.570" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">is something that&#39;s on a lower level so</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.120" end="00:10:59.020" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of used to look for a level and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:03.160" style="s2">when we</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.020" end="00:11:06.940" style="s2">organize a retreat or a workshop or with</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.160" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">collective prancing we do that work</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.940" end="00:11:13.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say up front with with the team</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:15.310" style="s2">that is hosting the event like what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.240" end="00:11:18.760" style="s2">the question that we&#39;re really careful</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.310" end="00:11:22.870" style="s2">and yeah but that word is not right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.760" end="00:11:25.330" style="s2">we really take time to to craft that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.870" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">question really well until we are also</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.330" end="00:11:32.649" style="s2">like yeah that&#39;s the question do you in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:36.790" style="s2">your everyday life like today right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.649" end="00:11:38.380" style="s2">do you have a stable of questions and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.790" end="00:11:39.730" style="s2">development like do you do you wake up</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.380" end="00:11:41.140" style="s2">in the morning and you&#39;ve got the sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.730" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">of this you&#39;re kind of farming these</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.140" end="00:11:44.860" style="s2">these big questions that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.690" style="s2">hovering around and your sleep and your</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.860" end="00:11:49.230" style="s2">you&#39;re really gonna like do you have one</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.690" end="00:11:54.339" style="s2">that you&#39;re you&#39;re presently now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.230" end="00:12:02.529" style="s2">taking your attention it&#39;s not that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.339" end="00:12:06.820" style="s2">wake up with them but yeah I&#39;m sitting</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.529" end="00:12:10.660" style="s2">with this question these days so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.820" end="00:12:15.190" style="s2">very at ease with all these circles and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.660" end="00:12:17.140" style="s2">dialogues and conversations and but what</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.190" end="00:12:21.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t know is how to build the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.140" end="00:12:24.550" style="s2">business that&#39;s like really foreign to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.250" end="00:12:26.529" style="s2">me that&#39;s like I I really feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.550" end="00:12:29.740" style="s2">four year old and I don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.529" end="00:12:32.140" style="s2">about it and I have a huge intuition but</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.740" end="00:12:36.010" style="s2">on that in that topic</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.140" end="00:12:38.829" style="s2">it feels like my intuition is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.010" end="00:12:43.300" style="s2">working please guide me take me by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.829" end="00:12:45.670" style="s2">hand and so we were talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.300" end="00:12:48.990" style="s2">my partner with other people who in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.670" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">collective fencing world let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.990" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">we came to this question recently like</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.050" end="00:13:04.450" style="s2">could we find a collective practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.570" end="00:13:08.529" style="s2">where we actually built that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.450" end="00:13:12.410" style="s2">entrepreneurial spirit together like we</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.529" end="00:13:15.230" style="s2">know we have built consent</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.410" end="00:13:17.079" style="s2">relatives decision-making processes that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.230" end="00:13:19.790" style="s2">we can describe and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.079" end="00:13:24.860" style="s2">disseminate and everybody can learn it</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.790" end="00:13:27.829" style="s2">but can we do so can we develop can we</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.860" end="00:13:31.779" style="s2">find a collective practice where this</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.829" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">entrepreneurial spirit is actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.779" end="00:13:38.509" style="s2">helped supported by in all of us by all</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:42.680" style="s2">of us and doesn&#39;t mean we need to be in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.509" end="00:13:47.720" style="s2">the same company at all because many of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.680" end="00:13:51.230" style="s2">us have like very at their own company</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.720" end="00:13:54.980" style="s2">or with two or three or I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.230" end="00:13:58.910" style="s2">lots of people here just have their own</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.980" end="00:14:01.399" style="s2">private business I guess so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.910" end="00:14:04.970" style="s2">something that&#39;s on my mind and that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.399" end="00:14:12.110" style="s2">can feel that it&#39;s like and that works</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.970" end="00:14:14.089" style="s2">in me you know taking your own advice</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.110" end="00:14:15.399" style="s2">that this you arrive with a question and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.089" end="00:14:20.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a question underneath there</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.399" end="00:14:22.430" style="s2">could be what I mean what I know if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.660" end="00:14:24.470" style="s2">work you&#39;re an author and a teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.430" end="00:14:26.449" style="s2">a facilitator and a therapist and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.470" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">got tons of different competencies and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.449" end="00:14:30.829" style="s2">skills and in this for some reason even</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.079" style="s2">though there&#39;s some billions of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.829" end="00:14:36.519" style="s2">businesses out there you&#39;re finding an</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.079" end="00:14:38.660" style="s2">obstacle to you making your own business</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.519" end="00:14:40.519" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of puzzling to me when</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.660" end="00:14:43.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve got such other you know plenty</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.519" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">about the competencies is there yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.730" end="00:14:47.949" style="s2">there&#39;s some obstacle it&#39;s it&#39;s between</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:53.720" style="s2">you and their entrepreneurial spirit</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.949" end="00:14:56.589" style="s2">good well be and it&#39;s pretty unknown</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.720" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">territory for me I mean I am</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.589" end="00:15:05.709" style="s2">self-employed as they call it since the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">90s has always gone well I&#39;ve never done</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.709" end="00:15:14.839" style="s2">marketing or PR or anything and a couple</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:18.529" style="s2">of years ago we started with I started</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.839" end="00:15:25.410" style="s2">with three others to fund a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.529" end="00:15:29.220" style="s2">because how can I be real and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.410" end="00:15:31.350" style="s2">have integrity to advise others on</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.220" end="00:15:34.580" style="s2">collective presence on collective</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.350" end="00:15:36.990" style="s2">practices on decision-making or</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.580" end="00:15:42.839" style="s2">conversations not matter if I&#39;m not in</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.990" end="00:15:45.000" style="s2">the business myself yeah so we have this</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.839" end="00:15:47.220" style="s2">company you would try lots of things out</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.000" end="00:15:51.959" style="s2">but this doesn&#39;t mean that my income</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.220" end="00:15:56.420" style="s2">goes up or at all and especially not now</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.959" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">because people cancel all kind of events</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.420" end="00:16:04.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s something and I can see some</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:06.990" style="s2">people have eat something that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.200" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">have and I wonder can we spread it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.990" end="00:16:13.050" style="s2">because there&#39;s I see so many people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:16.170" style="s2">want to build a better world don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.050" end="00:16:21.209" style="s2">to go to business as usual and are in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.170" end="00:16:23.910" style="s2">this spread like yeah but I need to feed</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.209" end="00:16:26.579" style="s2">my kids and I need to pay my rent and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.910" end="00:16:29.430" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough income coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.579" end="00:16:32.250" style="s2">we are like in between two worlds like</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.430" end="00:16:37.380" style="s2">what is the collective practice that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.250" end="00:16:40.709" style="s2">could help each other but I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.380" end="00:16:43.470" style="s2">I can only all the question more helpful</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.709" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">the question I can feel I can feel that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.470" end="00:16:48.600" style="s2">I question matters right like it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:51.510" style="s2">some yeah it&#39;s measuring to me as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.600" end="00:16:53.520" style="s2">uhm so with that question that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.510" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">starting point then if you were applying</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.520" end="00:16:57.779" style="s2">your own methodology to yourself there I</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:59.520" style="s2">say what would be the next step once</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.779" end="00:17:03.029" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this question how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.520" end="00:17:05.550" style="s2">you do collective presencing about it we</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.029" end="00:17:08.850" style="s2">actually started with our little let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.550" end="00:17:11.780" style="s2">say core team of of collective prancing</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.850" end="00:17:11.780" style="s2">and a few friends</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.750" end="00:17:22.829" style="s2">I can say we didn&#39;t come out with what</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.839" end="00:17:28.569" style="s2">clarity yet it&#39;s an ongoing process and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.829" end="00:17:32.470" style="s2">that makes me wonder like what are</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.569" end="00:17:36.460" style="s2">assumptions that we may be holding that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.470" end="00:17:41.100" style="s2">we haven&#39;t uncovered because for me a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.460" end="00:17:44.290" style="s2">dialogue and collective prancing is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.100" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">connective dialogue and let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.290" end="00:17:52.420" style="s2">words a photo charmer</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:56.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like many times s in therapy many</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.420" end="00:18:01.030" style="s2">times it&#39;s like when you can uncover an</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.530" end="00:18:04.630" style="s2">assumption suddenly like aha</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.990" end="00:18:20.110" style="s2">my question so yes it feels as if we</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.510" end="00:18:21.730" style="s2">haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t uncovered some of</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.730" end="00:18:31.560" style="s2">holding us back from new insights</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.770" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">that&#39;s jump in so rich was warming up</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.560" end="00:18:35.740" style="s2">the room right now some because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.940" end="00:18:38.920" style="s2">really tight questioning at the knife&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.740" end="00:18:40.120" style="s2">edge which I appreciate and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.920" end="00:18:43.120" style="s2">have any questions it&#39;s right in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.120" end="00:18:46.570" style="s2">chat box and then I&#39;ll unmute you and</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.490" end="00:19:01.750" style="s2">enjoying this dialogue and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.460" end="00:19:04.920" style="s2">interested in the magic in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.750" end="00:19:08.770" style="s2">and I really enjoyed being in that space</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.920" end="00:19:12.580" style="s2">curious what you do to create a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.770" end="00:19:16.120" style="s2">container or a shared intention or</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.580" end="00:19:18.250" style="s2">context or dial on like language to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.120" end="00:19:20.890" style="s2">invite people into engaging that unknown</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.250" end="00:19:23.080" style="s2">in the middle rather than maybe speaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.890" end="00:19:24.520" style="s2">from like what they already know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.080" end="00:19:26.800" style="s2">the temptation like if a question comes</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.520" end="00:19:27.790" style="s2">up the temptation to give advice and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.800" end="00:19:30.610" style="s2">solve it</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.790" end="00:19:32.530" style="s2">rather than like really am being merged</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.610" end="00:19:35.050" style="s2">in the question so I&#39;m just curious if</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.530" end="00:19:37.660" style="s2">you have like agreements or what type of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.050" end="00:19:43.060" style="s2">things you do to create that space yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.660" end="00:19:46.270" style="s2">I mean you can offer some guidelines or</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.060" end="00:19:50.230" style="s2">some principles but it&#39;s really hard for</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.270" end="00:19:54.600" style="s2">people especially when the conversing or</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.230" end="00:19:54.600" style="s2">the topic the question matters to them</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.870" end="00:20:04.510" style="s2">first of all we we work with the talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.050" end="00:20:07.150" style="s2">piece like whenever somebody holds the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.510" end="00:20:11.380" style="s2">piece even if that&#39;s a pen or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.150" end="00:20:16.750" style="s2">it is that means this person speaks and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.380" end="00:20:20.110" style="s2">the other ones listen and you can move</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.750" end="00:20:22.540" style="s2">the piece from one to one but to slow</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.110" end="00:20:24.900" style="s2">the conversation even more down you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.540" end="00:20:28.530" style="s2">put the talking piece in the middle in</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.900" end="00:20:33.460" style="s2">the middle of the circle and then say</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.530" end="00:20:38.620" style="s2">you can sense whenever you need to speak</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.460" end="00:20:43.570" style="s2">and I always explain it doesn&#39;t we try</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.620" end="00:20:45.310" style="s2">to speak from a place where that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.570" end="00:20:46.410" style="s2">haven&#39;t been thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.310" end="00:20:55.330" style="s2">beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.410" end="00:20:58.090" style="s2">so it&#39;s not an idea I already had before</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.330" end="00:20:58.500" style="s2">I entered the room that&#39;s where I wanna</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.090" end="00:21:02.550" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.500" end="00:21:07.660" style="s2">can I speak something I haven&#39;t spoken</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.550" end="00:21:09.570" style="s2">anywhere yet and that&#39;s pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.660" end="00:21:14.230" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.570" end="00:21:16.690" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean you cannot tell a story</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.230" end="00:21:21.040" style="s2">or something that comes up because</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.690" end="00:21:23.620" style="s2">sometimes a story comes up that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.040" end="00:21:27.100" style="s2">might not even understand why it comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.620" end="00:21:30.160" style="s2">up yeah and sometimes you have to check</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.100" end="00:21:33.190" style="s2">yourself like I don&#39;t know why but it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.160" end="00:21:37.260" style="s2">seems like I need to tell this right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.190" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">here and then you will notice that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.260" end="00:21:41.560" style="s2">somebody else picks up a meaning from</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:45.910" style="s2">that story and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.560" end="00:21:50.440" style="s2">reveals why it was meaningful in that in</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.910" end="00:21:53.560" style="s2">that guiding question and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.440" end="00:21:57.040" style="s2">really important that you inhabit that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.560" end="00:22:00.790" style="s2">space yourself or the ones who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.040" end="00:22:05.560" style="s2">holding the space that you can convey</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.790" end="00:22:09.850" style="s2">that with how you speak if you say we do</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.560" end="00:22:13.930" style="s2">it like this and does this yeah it&#39;s can</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.850" end="00:22:17.860" style="s2">you speak yourself and have you worked</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.930" end="00:22:23.710" style="s2">with your team the one or the two or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.860" end="00:22:26.440" style="s2">three others that hold it with you to to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.710" end="00:22:28.270" style="s2">be in that space together have you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.440" end="00:22:32.410" style="s2">trained yourself actually have you</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.270" end="00:22:41.380" style="s2">practiced yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.410" end="00:22:42.940" style="s2">that&#39;s short so if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.380" end="00:22:45.010" style="s2">questions and maybe you can practice it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.940" end="00:22:46.270" style="s2">to just go you know like lean into what</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.010" end="00:22:48.970" style="s2">questions emerge and just write it down</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.270" end="00:22:50.850" style="s2">and when I was leaning into that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.970" end="00:22:52.800" style="s2">question number is right away</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.850" end="00:22:59.740" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.800" end="00:23:02.020" style="s2">can can you measure wisdom and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.740" end="00:23:03.220" style="s2">asked that is a lot of people are giving</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.020" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">me advice these days like I should get</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.220" end="00:23:06.220" style="s2">more sleep through this through that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:09.850" style="s2">then the question that keeps coming up</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.220" end="00:23:12.190" style="s2">can you measure wisdom and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.850" end="00:23:14.560" style="s2">you can and if a question or that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.190" end="00:23:17.140" style="s2">question is the foundation of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.560" end="00:23:19.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t really measure the accuracy of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.140" end="00:23:23.410" style="s2">what question to pick so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.000" end="00:23:28.200" style="s2">rely on a different source so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.410" end="00:23:31.630" style="s2">curious what what comes alive so I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.200" end="00:23:35.890" style="s2">measurement comes from an ordered system</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.630" end="00:23:38.440" style="s2">if I can use that model well you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.890" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">measure more or less wisdom I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.440" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">think belongs in that</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:15.660" style="s2">this is only if you&#39;ve taken it to</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:19.540" style="s2">various different locations and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.660" end="00:27:20.860" style="s2">expanded to organizations because it</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.540" end="00:27:23.380" style="s2">seems like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.860" end="00:27:25.690" style="s2">prerequisite to have done that personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.380" end="00:27:30.930" style="s2">work and be willing to look deep in in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.690" end="00:27:37.690" style="s2">order to participate or or maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.930" end="00:27:39.880" style="s2">yeah we do have roads let&#39;s see what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.690" end="00:27:43.330" style="s2">called art of hosting which is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.880" end="00:27:45.700" style="s2">community and a practice and we&#39;ll field</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.330" end="00:27:49.420" style="s2">of practice it&#39;s about conversations</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.700" end="00:27:51.400" style="s2">that matter and it goes always which</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.420" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">starts always with the three-day</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.400" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">training and we it has been brought in</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:58.930" style="s2">like until the European Commission</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.980" end="00:28:03.160" style="s2">although it&#39;s called participatory</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.930" end="00:28:07.620" style="s2">leadership didn&#39;t like all the first was</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.160" end="00:28:10.800" style="s2">a bit too fluffy or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.620" end="00:28:14.730" style="s2">it&#39;s practices about conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.800" end="00:28:18.800" style="s2">about dialogues in all kinds of ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.730" end="00:28:21.300" style="s2">sweet big groups small groups</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.800" end="00:28:24.600" style="s2">conferences stakeholder gatherings but</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.300" end="00:28:27.660" style="s2">what I want to point to is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.600" end="00:28:29.490" style="s2">have like let&#39;s say the biggest thing we</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.660" end="00:28:34.500" style="s2">ever did was probably a two-day</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.490" end="00:28:41.179" style="s2">conference with 800 people you do have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.500" end="00:28:46.350" style="s2">team then of 6 7 8 10 people and what we</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.179" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">tried in these themes is to come to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.350" end="00:28:51.809" style="s2">level of co-creation like what only</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:54.630" style="s2">sensing what is the client saying what</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.809" end="00:28:59.010" style="s2">other people what is the actual question</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.630" end="00:29:02.760" style="s2">like and from that sensing capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.010" end="00:29:07.590" style="s2">this core team that&#39;s from where we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.760" end="00:29:09.990" style="s2">the work yeah and now after 10 years you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.590" end="00:29:13.860" style="s2">can see how this practice is spreading</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.990" end="00:29:16.710" style="s2">because some peach is having which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.860" end="00:29:21.030" style="s2">like ministries within the European</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.710" end="00:29:25.980" style="s2">Commission have adapted his approach in</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.030" end="00:29:28.710" style="s2">him as their way of working so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.980" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">saying that collective prancing itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.710" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">is like known anywhere but like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:40.760" style="s2">leading up to it like can we actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:43.910" style="s2">start to listen in meetings instead of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.760" end="00:29:48.570" style="s2">wanting to fight or wanting to win</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.910" end="00:29:53.550" style="s2">that&#39;s getting some ground even in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.570" end="00:29:55.290" style="s2">European Commission so yeah so it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.550" end="00:29:58.260" style="s2">like the participants don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.290" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">have to have this sensing capability to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.260" end="00:30:08.910" style="s2">begin with actually everybody has it but</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:12.990" style="s2">we just not used to use it yeah but if</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.910" end="00:30:16.830" style="s2">you are at ease with inviting people</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.990" end="00:30:19.620" style="s2">into that space and in naming it in</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.830" end="00:30:20.970" style="s2">whatever words you can give it then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.620" end="00:30:24.860" style="s2">think they can kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.970" end="00:30:29.640" style="s2">relate to you if you feel comfortable to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.860" end="00:30:32.039" style="s2">invite them into that space most of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.640" end="00:30:34.049" style="s2">times people come with you and are</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.039" end="00:30:40.830" style="s2">actually happy that they can finally</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.049" end="00:30:44.070" style="s2">talk like no not debate but have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.830" end="00:30:45.900" style="s2">conversation many sometimes you need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.070" end="00:30:49.350" style="s2">like in the Commission you need to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.900" end="00:30:51.809" style="s2">like hey people you&#39;re not representing</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.350" end="00:30:56.780" style="s2">your company or you&#39;re not representing</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.809" end="00:30:59.789" style="s2">your country you&#39;re here as a person</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.780" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">with your expertise of course but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.789" end="00:31:08.780" style="s2">here as a person and can we speak from</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:08.780" style="s2">that level it&#39;s of course it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:15.299" style="s2">yeah I have another follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.620" end="00:31:16.590" style="s2">if that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.299" end="00:31:19.350" style="s2">in the book you talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.590" end="00:31:22.470" style="s2">following aliveness and follow what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.350" end="00:31:24.270" style="s2">alive and it could be something that if</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.470" end="00:31:26.970" style="s2">I just don&#39;t feel alive to do it now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.270" end="00:31:29.669" style="s2">just not going to do it I kind of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.970" end="00:31:31.409" style="s2">how that plays out because something</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.669" end="00:31:33.720" style="s2">else that&#39;s in my mind is like focus and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.409" end="00:31:35.900" style="s2">discipline and that I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.720" end="00:31:38.010" style="s2">that you can really blend together</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.900" end="00:31:39.419" style="s2">because it seems like I&#39;m just following</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.010" end="00:31:41.490" style="s2">my feelings if I&#39;m just following those</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.419" end="00:31:43.470" style="s2">alive or maybe it&#39;s kind of a fellow</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.490" end="00:31:49.100" style="s2">sense like the somatic piece so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.470" end="00:31:49.100" style="s2">you can dive into that a little bit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">what is I would say howdy discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.470" end="00:32:05.880" style="s2">what is feeding yourself up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:08.700" style="s2">what is doing even stuff like for me</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.880" end="00:32:11.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like doing my accounts needs to</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.700" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">happen now and then I really don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.159" end="00:32:18.830" style="s2">it although I I can do it well but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:18.830" style="s2">don&#39;t like doing it</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.700" end="00:32:30.890" style="s2">from psychology is if you put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.110" end="00:32:33.890" style="s2">under stress like I need to do this now</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.890" end="00:32:37.730" style="s2">and when the discipline is that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.890" end="00:32:41.900" style="s2">stuff that kind of energy it will always</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.730" end="00:32:45.950" style="s2">trigger the opposite that will say</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.900" end="00:32:49.490" style="s2">it I don&#39;t know because there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.950" end="00:32:54.280" style="s2">pressure then something comes to balance</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.490" end="00:32:58.040" style="s2">it but if the discipline is like lost</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.280" end="00:33:04.400" style="s2">yesterday at the conversation with with</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.040" end="00:33:07.640" style="s2">my partner that one not well I had to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.400" end="00:33:11.690" style="s2">discipline to go sit on the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.640" end="00:33:15.140" style="s2">question because I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.690" end="00:33:18.440" style="s2">step out of the emotional charge and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.140" end="00:33:22.790" style="s2">want to come back to balance that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.440" end="00:33:29.380" style="s2">discipline not because I still need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.790" end="00:33:33.800" style="s2">but because I choose to do them not easy</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.380" end="00:33:37.880" style="s2">that&#39;s also discipline but it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.800" end="00:33:39.260" style="s2">it comes from a different place well if</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.880" end="00:33:41.060" style="s2">you&#39;re like a writer and you&#39;re like I</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.260" end="00:33:43.010" style="s2">have a writer&#39;s box but then like</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.060" end="00:33:45.320" style="s2">actually having the discipline to write</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.010" end="00:33:48.620" style="s2">out things help me push to the next step</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.320" end="00:33:52.220" style="s2">what about in that scenario I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.620" end="00:33:58.040" style="s2">because you want to and you know that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.220" end="00:34:01.670" style="s2">helps to start writing anyway it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.040" end="00:34:04.130" style="s2">because of authority that says now you</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.670" end="00:34:06.560" style="s2">have to work even if it&#39;s an inner</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.130" end="00:34:09.470" style="s2">Authority it&#39;s more like I choose to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.560" end="00:34:12.310" style="s2">this because I know it has if you look</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.470" end="00:34:12.310" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.030" end="00:34:18.230" style="s2">Thanks</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.180" end="00:34:23.300" style="s2">and I&#39;m always impressed to hear that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.230" end="00:34:27.650" style="s2">people read my work with this some good</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.300" end="00:34:30.610" style="s2">stuff so Zack can you put yourself from</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.650" end="00:34:30.610" style="s2">you mash your question</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.050" end="00:34:42.920" style="s2">mr. sack I&#39;m going on I don&#39;t see his</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.620" end="00:34:42.920" style="s2">face okay he just jumped on oh there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.230" end="00:34:52.140" style="s2">John some other questions come up in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.700" end="00:34:53.220" style="s2">midst as well but unless Peter says</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.140" end="00:34:54.600" style="s2">otherwise I&#39;m going to follow the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.220" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">directive announced a question that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.600" end="00:35:02.550" style="s2">posted initially yeah RIA when you were</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:04.710" style="s2">when you were speaking closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.550" end="00:35:08.210" style="s2">beginning you were talking about like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.710" end="00:35:10.740" style="s2">workshop or like retreat context I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.210" end="00:35:12.030" style="s2">we&#39;re on I think you&#39;ve said something</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.740" end="00:35:14.100" style="s2">to the effect of like on the front end</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.030" end="00:35:17.010" style="s2">of that there&#39;s a lot of work for like</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.100" end="00:35:22.110" style="s2">refine the question where people want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.010" end="00:35:24.270" style="s2">circle around and from what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.110" end="00:35:26.820" style="s2">remembering like there was some</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.270" end="00:35:29.700" style="s2">suggestion that there to me that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.820" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">is like a point at which there&#39;s like at</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.700" end="00:35:33.870" style="s2">least relative group consensus around</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:37.220" style="s2">like what the like what the question</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.870" end="00:35:40.070" style="s2">really is that people want to dig in on</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.220" end="00:35:43.910" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering like in your experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.070" end="00:35:47.100" style="s2">you know is reaching that consensus</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.910" end="00:35:50.790" style="s2">typical on these kinds of settings how</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.100" end="00:35:52.890" style="s2">necessary is it and you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.790" end="00:35:54.990" style="s2">don&#39;t reach it how does that change the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.890" end="00:35:56.670" style="s2">experience like can you speak to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.990" end="00:35:59.100" style="s2">relationship between like finding that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.670" end="00:36:04.680" style="s2">group consensus and like the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.100" end="00:36:08.060" style="s2">the circle maybe okay I first want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.680" end="00:36:13.410" style="s2">speak about that word consensus because</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:16.010" style="s2">consensus many times mean like oh we</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.410" end="00:36:22.670" style="s2">need to talk and talk and talk until</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.010" end="00:36:24.930" style="s2">everybody can agree with it and from</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.670" end="00:36:30.780" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.930" end="00:36:33.450" style="s2">is not about agreement in these themes</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.780" end="00:36:37.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say hosting claims facilitation</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.450" end="00:36:40.350" style="s2">teams when we try to come up with what</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.080" end="00:36:47.070" style="s2">is our guiding question for the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.350" end="00:36:50.100" style="s2">retreat indeed is more like is our</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.070" end="00:36:51.990" style="s2">felt sense of everyone is it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.100" end="00:36:55.530" style="s2">alignment with each other that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.990" end="00:37:00.120" style="s2">different than agreeing it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.530" end="00:37:03.450" style="s2">it feels real it feels right it feels</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.120" end="00:37:07.170" style="s2">the right question it&#39;s not like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.450" end="00:37:07.560" style="s2">I can agree you know okay let&#39;s go with</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.170" end="00:37:11.870" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.560" end="00:37:18.920" style="s2">it needs to be alive in each of us and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.870" end="00:37:24.300" style="s2">many times when PD groups useful sensors</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.920" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">it&#39;s more like in the area of we first</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.300" end="00:37:33.840" style="s2">had a conflict and now we need to come</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:38.280" style="s2">to consensus and there is most of us who</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.840" end="00:37:40.620" style="s2">have been there I&#39;ve done that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.280" end="00:37:43.950" style="s2">want to go to consensus but then there</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.620" end="00:37:46.170" style="s2">is the consent decision-making but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.950" end="00:37:50.820" style="s2">won&#39;t go into that but for collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.170" end="00:37:54.690" style="s2">presencing and how we in teams that</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.820" end="00:37:57.780" style="s2">hosts conversations for others it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.690" end="00:38:03.450" style="s2">that kind of consensus where we agree</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.780" end="00:38:07.770" style="s2">it&#39;s more an alignment of sensing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.450" end="00:38:11.100" style="s2">this is the question that is at its most</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.770" end="00:38:18.270" style="s2">meaningful I&#39;m not sure if I can explain</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.100" end="00:38:20.970" style="s2">it for one it&#39;s very sometimes I find</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.270" end="00:38:25.170" style="s2">subtle subtle new ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.970" end="00:38:33.900" style="s2">yeah do you have a follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.170" end="00:38:38.750" style="s2">Zack because what if your question was</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.900" end="00:38:38.750" style="s2">to be these circles the most generative</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.470" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">the question of course you need to speak</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.540" end="00:38:49.110" style="s2">to people who are joining the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:52.350" style="s2">conversation or the dialogue but to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.110" end="00:38:56.870" style="s2">a generative conversation or a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.350" end="00:39:01.340" style="s2">generative dialogue in that regard it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.870" end="00:39:05.370" style="s2">really informative to to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.340" end="00:39:07.770" style="s2">understand or learn about the four</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.370" end="00:39:11.670" style="s2">levels of listening and conversation at</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.770" end="00:39:15.660" style="s2">auto genre users and to really</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.670" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">understand what generative means what</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.660" end="00:39:24.630" style="s2">how it is different than agreeing or</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.720" end="00:39:27.930" style="s2">being even understanding each other on</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.630" end="00:39:31.950" style="s2">an emphatic way but it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.930" end="00:39:36.080" style="s2">indeed like with heavy names like please</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.950" end="00:39:39.750" style="s2">does this bring more life into our</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.080" end="00:39:46.260" style="s2">organization or our circle or does it</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.750" end="00:39:48.510" style="s2">generate energy so um since there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.260" end="00:39:51.060" style="s2">questions in the chatbox I think people</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.510" end="00:39:55.260" style="s2">a little bit for some reason maybe me</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.060" end="00:39:58.380" style="s2">and rich can start plumb about sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.260" end="00:39:58.890" style="s2">the question that feels most alive can</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.380" end="00:40:01.740" style="s2">you hear me</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.890" end="00:40:04.830" style="s2">I just changing Mike Mike okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.740" end="00:40:12.150" style="s2">question that&#39;s coming up is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.830" end="00:40:16.500" style="s2">make a love to the unknown see them</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.150" end="00:40:18.780" style="s2">again how to make them maybe I&#39;ll reward</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.500" end="00:40:29.100" style="s2">it they&#39;re like how do we make love to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.780" end="00:40:31.410" style="s2">the unknown yeah in the beginning when</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.100" end="00:40:40.410" style="s2">we were in this process of uncovering</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.410" end="00:40:45.210" style="s2">visual um we talked a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.410" end="00:40:53.630" style="s2">future and Auto Shermer also talks about</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.210" end="00:40:53.630" style="s2">the Futurists already here somehow I see</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.590" end="00:41:01.950" style="s2">myself and others like yeah we we look</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.620" end="00:41:04.890" style="s2">at this it&#39;s now in the future and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.950" end="00:41:08.820" style="s2">like linear and I wanted to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.890" end="00:41:12.840" style="s2">that linear idea and that&#39;s how I came</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.820" end="00:41:14.430" style="s2">up with like a potential there is always</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.840" end="00:41:17.579" style="s2">potentially</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.430" end="00:41:20.280" style="s2">and relationships any groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.579" end="00:41:25.410" style="s2">and organizations there&#39;s more potential</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.280" end="00:41:33.210" style="s2">than what is already present but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.410" end="00:41:37.559" style="s2">you actually need to get kind of love</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.210" end="00:41:41.130" style="s2">that that thing that is not very yet now</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.559" end="00:41:43.859" style="s2">that unknown potential of yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.130" end="00:41:52.260" style="s2">from your organization or your</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.859" end="00:41:55.050" style="s2">perpetrator and I the best thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.260" end="00:41:59.130" style="s2">to relate with it it&#39;s like when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.050" end="00:42:01.500" style="s2">have children you don&#39;t know when</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.130" end="00:42:05.099" style="s2">they&#39;re eight they want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.500" end="00:42:11.550" style="s2">footballer or a teacher or a pianist or</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.099" end="00:42:14.309" style="s2">but you you you hold them and you you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.550" end="00:42:18.599" style="s2">hold that potential that can look that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.309" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">way or that way or okay and it&#39;s unknown</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.599" end="00:42:26.030" style="s2">you don&#39;t know where they end up ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:31.109" style="s2">years later and even twenty years later</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.030" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">and still mean you are in love with that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.109" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">what&#39;s in them even you haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:39.809" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s also for us I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:42.599" style="s2">especially in this time like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.809" end="00:42:45.799" style="s2">something unknown that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.599" end="00:42:49.079" style="s2">there&#39;s some unknown potential that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.799" end="00:42:54.809" style="s2">might come into manifestation it might</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.079" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">not but it might and can we just cannot</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.809" end="00:43:03.660" style="s2">be enough with can we instead of like or</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:05.940" style="s2">it&#39;s oh it should be more of this or</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.660" end="00:43:08.630" style="s2">more of that unless of that that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.940" end="00:43:14.910" style="s2">already know what if it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.630" end="00:43:19.890" style="s2">really different and that&#39;s what I got</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.910" end="00:43:24.390" style="s2">from through Bonita Roy who has red cap</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.890" end="00:43:25.980" style="s2">sir you can follow me when it talks that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.390" end="00:43:28.210" style="s2">about ever-present</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.980" end="00:43:31.150" style="s2">origin like</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.210" end="00:43:35.109" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we just evolved in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.150" end="00:43:38.859" style="s2">linear way or with most of time we we</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.109" end="00:43:42.430" style="s2">throw it like this goes up actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.859" end="00:43:46.809" style="s2">every minute everything that exists is</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.430" end="00:43:50.200" style="s2">there and we drop into particles origin</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.809" end="00:43:54.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s possible to come with something</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.200" end="00:43:59.220" style="s2">new with all that was already before so</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.550" end="00:44:04.420" style="s2">there is there is a possibility every</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.220" end="00:44:08.500" style="s2">moment to change and just not linear it</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.420" end="00:44:09.849" style="s2">can be like a phase transition like some</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.500" end="00:44:14.050" style="s2">people have you might have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.849" end="00:44:15.220" style="s2">experience from like summary yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.050" end="00:44:19.210" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.220" end="00:44:22.150" style="s2">suddenly I realized or and you become a</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.210" end="00:44:28.300" style="s2">different person at least in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.150" end="00:44:33.700" style="s2">and so I think in in our society we</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.300" end="00:44:43.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have that I can only live in love</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.700" end="00:44:46.390" style="s2">for life actually like somebody I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.480" end="00:44:48.670" style="s2">to say we don&#39;t have that yet and now</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.390" end="00:44:53.349" style="s2">Raya is going to bring her sunshine and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.670" end="00:44:56.049" style="s2">ask a question yeah I am wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.349" end="00:44:59.020" style="s2">there is a way to measure collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.049" end="00:45:02.049" style="s2">presence and how do you know like when a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.020" end="00:45:03.670" style="s2">group has achieved it and if everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.049" end="00:45:09.250" style="s2">the group can sense it like is it just</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.670" end="00:45:09.910" style="s2">like a unknowing I wouldn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.250" end="00:45:17.740" style="s2">measure it</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.910" end="00:45:20.079" style="s2">uh-huh but if I one of the chapters in</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.740" end="00:45:25.000" style="s2">the book or pieces in the book is about</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.079" end="00:45:30.160" style="s2">the one next elegant minimal stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.000" end="00:45:37.150" style="s2">we&#39;re in such complex domain we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.160" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">know where it leads us so if we through</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.150" end="00:45:42.090" style="s2">a conversation to a dialogue we come to</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:45.960" style="s2">an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.090" end="00:45:49.060" style="s2">that&#39;s indeed the next up we can take</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:53.140" style="s2">not something very difficult but</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.060" end="00:45:56.140" style="s2">something we feel like that&#39;s the that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.140" end="00:45:58.210" style="s2">follows naturally from where we are from</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.140" end="00:46:03.580" style="s2">what we have discovered from what we</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.210" end="00:46:05.830" style="s2">have been talking about and then you do</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.580" end="00:46:08.500" style="s2">that stuff whatever that stuff is and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.830" end="00:46:11.530" style="s2">might be like oh we need to talk some</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.500" end="00:46:15.790" style="s2">overhead sometimes but sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.530" end="00:46:22.840" style="s2">some action and I hope we get better and</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.790" end="00:46:26.050" style="s2">better at something like this is a snap</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.840" end="00:46:29.950" style="s2">we are going to take and that&#39;s in maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.050" end="00:46:32.320" style="s2">a small action but that for me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.950" end="00:46:36.040" style="s2">the ultimate purpose of this whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.320" end="00:46:38.430" style="s2">practice to actually come to actions in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.040" end="00:46:41.560" style="s2">the world and not for the purpose of oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.430" end="00:46:46.080" style="s2">let&#39;s have another good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.560" end="00:46:49.270" style="s2">that actually doesn&#39;t bring us much</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.080" end="00:46:51.850" style="s2">that&#39;s but but you have to practice a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.270" end="00:46:55.870" style="s2">lot of practice conversations to become</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.850" end="00:46:58.590" style="s2">good that&#39;s the other path all right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.870" end="00:47:01.870" style="s2">we have one more question</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.590" end="00:47:05.460" style="s2">Tanya&#39;s feeling into something you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.870" end="00:47:09.940" style="s2">a question that&#39;s a Georgian Tonya</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.460" end="00:47:13.350" style="s2">yeah well I&#39;m I&#39;m connecting a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.940" end="00:47:18.510" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying miss Nikki means like</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.350" end="00:47:21.970" style="s2">gee I think and then thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.510" end="00:47:24.520" style="s2">experience that I&#39;ve had recently with</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.970" end="00:47:26.760" style="s2">a housemate and we&#39;re part of a learning</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.520" end="00:47:32.680" style="s2">community a larger learning community</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.760" end="00:47:36.040" style="s2">and we communicate through slack and she</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.680" end="00:47:38.230" style="s2">was encouraging me to just write into</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.040" end="00:47:39.730" style="s2">the slack without knowing like what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.230" end="00:47:45.730" style="s2">gonna say and it&#39;s similar to what you</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.730" end="00:47:49.630" style="s2">were pointing at and I feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.730" end="00:47:51.670" style="s2">both that encouraging people to just</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.630" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">like what you just did Peter used to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.670" end="00:47:55.180" style="s2">invited me to just and I was like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.690" style="s2">just gonna write I have something</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.180" end="00:48:01.630" style="s2">region 2 I don&#39;t know what it is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.690" end="00:48:05.800" style="s2">yeah thanks Tyson um</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.630" end="00:48:07.270" style="s2">yak there&#39;s a question too around how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.800" end="00:48:08.460" style="s2">we do this on zoom which is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.270" end="00:48:13.870" style="s2">other thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.460" end="00:48:15.730" style="s2">um and feel each other but I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.870" end="00:48:19.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something around the like</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.730" end="00:48:22.630" style="s2">holding each other in a creative tension</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.240" end="00:48:24.940" style="s2">of our learning process</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.630" end="00:48:27.490" style="s2">I really felt her doing that with me and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.940" end="00:48:29.530" style="s2">I and I&#39;ve been doing that with her or</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.490" end="00:48:34.060" style="s2">like she&#39;s had patterns that come up</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.530" end="00:48:37.750" style="s2">they get in her way and I know I do in</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.060" end="00:48:39.730" style="s2">groups too that where I like talk and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.750" end="00:48:44.620" style="s2">I&#39;m talking from what we might call ego</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.730" end="00:48:49.330" style="s2">or old patterns and attachment I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.620" end="00:48:53.020" style="s2">you&#39;re using that but if we have this a</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.330" end="00:48:54.670" style="s2">sort of agreement that we&#39;re like she</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.020" end="00:48:57.940" style="s2">knows that I don&#39;t really want to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.670" end="00:49:01.060" style="s2">that and I know she just she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.940" end="00:49:02.890" style="s2">want to go into her old patterns it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.060" end="00:49:04.870" style="s2">like we&#39;re we&#39;re hold</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.890" end="00:49:10.180" style="s2">we&#39;re holding each other and it&#39;s we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.870" end="00:49:14.920" style="s2">made that vivid and clear it changes the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.180" end="00:49:18.970" style="s2">whole field I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.920" end="00:49:21.430" style="s2">question is there&#39;s just this advice</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.970" end="00:49:23.470" style="s2">hearing you connected to sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.430" end="00:49:25.690" style="s2">individual process and then I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.470" end="00:49:31.150" style="s2">feeling it in my experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.690" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">collective that&#39;s happening god I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.150" end="00:49:38.040" style="s2">it&#39;s really helpful if you make that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:41.170" style="s2">explicit amongst yourself this is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.040" end="00:49:46.690" style="s2">learning or a way of learning or a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.170" end="00:49:51.030" style="s2">of getting other ways of learning and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.690" end="00:49:55.630" style="s2">knowing into the space since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.030" end="00:49:59.980" style="s2">Western mind trained it&#39;s most of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.630" end="00:50:03.370" style="s2">very conceptual very mental maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.980" end="00:50:06.480" style="s2">groups and circles it&#39;s emotional but</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.370" end="00:50:09.480" style="s2">there&#39;s also that energetic knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:14.010" style="s2">intuition that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.480" end="00:50:17.340" style="s2">other ways of Illinoisan I think we</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.010" end="00:50:21.000" style="s2">desperately need to be in balance with</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.340" end="00:50:23.790" style="s2">all the rest and if you say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.000" end="00:50:26.430" style="s2">something I want to cultivate there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.790" end="00:50:30.660" style="s2">something that I want to Train or let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.430" end="00:50:33.600" style="s2">all train it or make it access it</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.660" end="00:50:38.340" style="s2">between you and then you have the space</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.600" end="00:50:42.710" style="s2">to experiment and come back to it like</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.340" end="00:50:42.710" style="s2">after three month or one month seem like</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.450" end="00:50:55.800" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna end it here and I&#39;m I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.270" end="00:50:59.070" style="s2">gonna send an invitation to Iria so how</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.800" end="00:51:00.750" style="s2">how this emerged is that Richard put you</p>
