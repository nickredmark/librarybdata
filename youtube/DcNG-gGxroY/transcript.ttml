<p begin="00:01:34.170" end="00:01:40.380" style="s2">worked on and thought about during that</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.060" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">this episode we talked about how given</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.970" end="00:04:31.990" style="s2">that we are physically embodied</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.710" end="00:04:34.630" style="s2">everything that we do is mediated</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.990" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2">through our biology and therefore we</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.330" end="00:04:46.509" style="s2">work out do things that help us connect</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.220" end="00:04:48.490" style="s2">with other people and the world around</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.509" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">us but most of us we don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.490" end="00:04:52.719" style="s2">how our body works and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">practices and thought processes which</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.719" end="00:04:55.960" style="s2">help us to do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">Daniel unpacks things down at the level</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.960" end="00:05:01.560" style="s2">of the the key pillars the foundations</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:04.060" style="s2">that we need to put in place in order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.560" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">be able to be the versions of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.060" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">that we most want to be so we dig into</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:11.050" style="s2">those foundations there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:12.759" style="s2">practical advice in this on how to alter</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.050" end="00:05:15.129" style="s2">your life and effectively upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.759" end="00:05:16.900" style="s2">yourself but we also reflect on how</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.129" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">difficult this is to do and to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.900" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">that resistance in a world or at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">in our Western societies in which the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:26.830" style="s2">medical system is essentially set up to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:29.409" style="s2">treat acute problems without really</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.830" end="00:05:32.229" style="s2">getting down to what&#39;s causing them</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.409" end="00:05:34.840" style="s2">which can be as simple as a nutrient or</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.229" end="00:05:36.069" style="s2">mineral imbalance he breaks that down in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.840" end="00:05:38.469" style="s2">language that&#39;s so much easier to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.069" end="00:05:40.389" style="s2">understand than the kind of deep science</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.469" end="00:05:42.689" style="s2">that he&#39;s actually drawing on and has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.389" end="00:05:45.400" style="s2">significant amount of command over</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.689" end="00:05:47.620" style="s2">talking about Daniel is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.400" end="00:05:49.090" style="s2">could do at enormous length and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.620" end="00:05:51.940" style="s2">going to cut it short here and let him</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.090" end="00:05:55.029" style="s2">speak for himself this is an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.940" end="00:05:56.590" style="s2">episode and from a very wise man that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.029" end="00:05:58.569" style="s2">was a real privilege for me to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.590" end="00:06:00.339" style="s2">I know you&#39;re gonna love it</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.569" end="00:06:01.779" style="s2">and if you have questions he invites it</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.339" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">at the end that he&#39;s happy to come back</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.779" end="00:06:07.060" style="s2">on the show and answer questions</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.020" end="00:06:46.150" style="s2">took a really macro view of where we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.750" end="00:06:49.960" style="s2">as humanity and where we may be going</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.150" end="00:06:52.149" style="s2">next and in this part we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.960" end="00:06:54.699" style="s2">dive more into the personal development</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.149" end="00:06:56.740" style="s2">the bio hacking the neuro hacking and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.699" end="00:06:59.229" style="s2">how we can develop our cell</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.229" end="00:07:18.550" style="s2">pretty pretty tricky to sum up Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.300" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">though I guess is pretty tricky to sum</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.550" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">up anyone in a in a fair and rounded way</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:26.020" style="s2">and we had a really great conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:29.470" style="s2">so welcome back and looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.020" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">this second part thanks for having me</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.470" end="00:07:35.349" style="s2">it&#39;s good to be back I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:37.479" style="s2">our last conversation so to begin in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.349" end="00:07:38.979" style="s2">giving we&#39;ve already got I guess if</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.479" end="00:07:40.690" style="s2">there were any soft questions in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.979" end="00:07:43.900" style="s2">first one we had them in the first one</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.690" end="00:07:45.639" style="s2">so we can dive right into the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.900" end="00:07:48.250" style="s2">picture here we&#39;ll talk about qualia</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.639" end="00:07:49.870" style="s2">which is the nootropic that have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.250" end="00:07:52.300" style="s2">that&#39;s been developed by the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.870" end="00:07:53.889" style="s2">hacker collective which is having</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.300" end="00:07:57.159" style="s2">incredible results for many people</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.889" end="00:07:58.900" style="s2">Martin who joined this last time was</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.159" end="00:08:01.210" style="s2">sharing some of his own experiences</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.900" end="00:08:03.479" style="s2">which were very positively found it very</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.210" end="00:08:07.240" style="s2">powerful and so we&#39;ll get into that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.479" end="00:08:10.360" style="s2">first at the more general level the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.240" end="00:08:11.770" style="s2">personal level there&#39;s a theme in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.360" end="00:08:14.199" style="s2">work and it&#39;s something that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.770" end="00:08:16.690" style="s2">people who read how existence really</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.199" end="00:08:20.259" style="s2">resonate with it&#39;s the idea of taking</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.690" end="00:08:21.909" style="s2">responsibility for ourselves before we</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.259" end="00:08:26.130" style="s2">can do anything for others</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.909" end="00:08:29.889" style="s2">what does responsibility mean to you and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.130" end="00:08:31.810" style="s2">what do you think are the first steps</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.889" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">that anyone needs to take in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.810" end="00:08:36.370" style="s2">personal responsibility and how perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:39.070" style="s2">it&#39;s the first step is admitting that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.370" end="00:08:41.409" style="s2">haven&#39;t been doing so how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:45.850" style="s2">that first the first step to to find</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.409" end="00:08:48.730" style="s2">that truth mmm-hmm well in this context</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.850" end="00:08:51.399" style="s2">more talk about our own physical and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.730" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">mental and psychological and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.399" end="00:09:00.610" style="s2">health and well-being ultimately if a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:03.700" style="s2">doctor does a good job or messes up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.610" end="00:09:06.070" style="s2">a procedure or with a drug</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.700" end="00:09:07.779" style="s2">recommendation or whatever with our</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.070" end="00:09:09.370" style="s2">health we&#39;re going to be the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.779" end="00:09:13.830" style="s2">benefit or suffer from it</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.370" end="00:09:16.900" style="s2">and so we&#39;re more invested in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.830" end="00:09:18.430" style="s2">medical care and the psychological care</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.900" end="00:09:22.230" style="s2">and the health that we get than anyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.430" end="00:09:25.800" style="s2">else&#39;s and so it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.230" end="00:09:29.110" style="s2">responsibility we want to take to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:30.250" style="s2">understand our system well enough that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.110" end="00:09:31.960" style="s2">even to the degree we&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.250" end="00:09:33.070" style="s2">with professionals that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.960" end="00:09:34.300" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.070" end="00:09:37.900" style="s2">alternatives we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.300" end="00:09:44.260" style="s2">consequences we understand that you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.900" end="00:09:46.840" style="s2">risks and upside ratios and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.260" end="00:09:50.140" style="s2">and we just kind of trust an authority</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.840" end="00:09:52.570" style="s2">to know everything about a topic and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.140" end="00:09:54.580" style="s2">always make good decisions for us and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.570" end="00:09:57.070" style="s2">then just be mad at them when they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.580" end="00:09:59.580" style="s2">it&#39;s just not a very empowered approach</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.070" end="00:10:01.780" style="s2">and you know as soon as you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.580" end="00:10:04.840" style="s2">we&#39;re already in an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.780" end="00:10:07.330" style="s2">information ecology where you&#39;ve got so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.840" end="00:10:09.790" style="s2">many journal articles coming out on any</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.330" end="00:10:11.110" style="s2">new topic and a clinician is a busy</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.790" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">person that&#39;s having to mostly see</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.110" end="00:10:16.180" style="s2">people they can&#39;t stay up-to-date with</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:18.610" style="s2">what is new and relevant and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.180" end="00:10:21.160" style="s2">many kind of key breakthroughs I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.610" end="00:10:22.600" style="s2">know in the different European countries</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.160" end="00:10:24.100" style="s2">that your listeners are in what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.600" end="00:10:27.340" style="s2">stats are but in the United States right</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.100" end="00:10:29.080" style="s2">not iatrogenic disease meaning disease</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.340" end="00:10:32.530" style="s2">that is caused by the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.080" end="00:10:35.010" style="s2">medicine so interactions from drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.530" end="00:10:38.040" style="s2">complications complications from surgery</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.010" end="00:10:40.980" style="s2">infections about in the hospitals etc is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.040" end="00:10:44.140" style="s2">depending upon what you include in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.980" end="00:10:48.390" style="s2">is either the first leading cause of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.140" end="00:10:51.100" style="s2">death in the US or the third and so Wow</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.390" end="00:10:52.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a big deal for people to realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.100" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">that and even the people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.860" end="00:10:58.900" style="s2">dying are mostly you know they are</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:01.540" style="s2">experiencing side effects from other</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.900" end="00:11:03.400" style="s2">meds or treatments they&#39;re on or they</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.540" end="00:11:05.230" style="s2">just have sub-optimal quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.400" end="00:11:07.840" style="s2">because the medical system is mostly not</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.230" end="00:11:09.810" style="s2">oriented towards optimizing human</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.840" end="00:11:14.450" style="s2">flourishing its oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.810" end="00:11:18.650" style="s2">treating acute illness and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.450" end="00:11:21.560" style="s2">so if we want to have a really richly</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.650" end="00:11:24.920" style="s2">flourishing life in all dimensions there</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.560" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">are causal dynamics that are associated</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.920" end="00:11:28.490" style="s2">with health that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:31.190" style="s2">progressively understand better and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.490" end="00:11:32.930" style="s2">there are choices that we can take they</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.190" end="00:11:36.500" style="s2">make a huge difference from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.930" end="00:11:41.240" style="s2">foundations of how we sleep and eat and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.500" end="00:11:44.300" style="s2">move and process stress and information</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.240" end="00:11:47.410" style="s2">to what we actually engage in in terms</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.300" end="00:11:50.120" style="s2">of life extension integrative medicine</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.410" end="00:11:54.470" style="s2">you know personalized medicine factoring</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.120" end="00:11:57.410" style="s2">or genomics etc yeah I think if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.470" end="00:11:59.840" style="s2">has had more than just a common cold and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.410" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">they&#39;ve they&#39;ve been to their doctor</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.840" end="00:12:04.790" style="s2">it&#39;s it can be kind of shocking I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:07.100" style="s2">it a few times where you rapidly realize</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.790" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">that you&#39;ve the limits of current</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.100" end="00:12:11.210" style="s2">medical knowledge at least in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:13.160" style="s2">when you go to a doctor you brush up</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.210" end="00:12:16.550" style="s2">against them surprisingly quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.160" end="00:12:18.130" style="s2">the a lot of I guess it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.550" end="00:12:20.030" style="s2">convenience of seeing so many people</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.130" end="00:12:20.780" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to push you into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.030" end="00:12:23.990" style="s2">flowchart</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.780" end="00:12:25.430" style="s2">of expected situations and going okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.990" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">well you&#39;ve mentioned this symptom so</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.430" end="00:12:28.370" style="s2">I&#39;m going to need to prescribe you this</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:32.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of the end of the story</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.370" end="00:12:35.060" style="s2">here I had a a junior doctor friend of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.750" end="00:12:37.460" style="s2">mine who gave me some cause for hope who</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.060" end="00:12:39.290" style="s2">said that here being taught the patients</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.460" end="00:12:41.870" style="s2">know their condition better than you do</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.290" end="00:12:43.340" style="s2">and you should listen to them because</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.870" end="00:12:43.850" style="s2">they also know the history better than</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.340" end="00:12:45.800" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.850" end="00:12:48.980" style="s2">and can tell you how how things have</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.800" end="00:12:51.650" style="s2">gone but even with that more open mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.980" end="00:12:54.200" style="s2">you&#39;re suggesting we need to do some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.650" end="00:12:56.810" style="s2">the work ourselves and go looking but</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.200" end="00:12:59.180" style="s2">there&#39;s you know if you type almost any</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.810" end="00:13:02.570" style="s2">set of symptoms into Google you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.180" end="00:13:04.760" style="s2">see a fairly scary and bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.570" end="00:13:07.730" style="s2">misinformation mostly how can we try and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.760" end="00:13:09.860" style="s2">understand and what is the thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.730" end="00:13:11.980" style="s2">should be trusting when we go looking</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.860" end="00:13:15.080" style="s2">for it ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.980" end="00:13:16.490" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s understand the problem space</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.080" end="00:13:18.280" style="s2">a little bit better and then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.490" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">understand how people can approach</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.280" end="00:13:24.200" style="s2">empowered responsibilities well so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:25.610" style="s2">said there are limits of knowledge let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.200" end="00:13:27.010" style="s2">not even get to the limits of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.610" end="00:13:31.780" style="s2">first let&#39;s just look at the limits of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.010" end="00:13:35.140" style="s2">time so then way that modern medical</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.780" end="00:13:36.820" style="s2">system in most developed nations the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.140" end="00:13:39.220" style="s2">the financial structure of it works</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.820" end="00:13:41.170" style="s2">doctors just can&#39;t afford to spend much</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.220" end="00:13:43.330" style="s2">time with people unless it&#39;s a concierge</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.170" end="00:13:44.620" style="s2">in practice where people are paying a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.330" end="00:13:46.990" style="s2">huge amount of out-of-pocket money</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.620" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">because that doctor racked up a</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.990" end="00:13:51.670" style="s2">tremendous amount of student loans in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:54.630" style="s2">the process of learning medicine that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.670" end="00:13:58.690" style="s2">they have to pay back and etc right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.630" end="00:14:02.290" style="s2">they if it if a doctor&#39;s seen you for</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.690" end="00:14:05.140" style="s2">five minutes or 15 minutes and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.290" end="00:14:07.690" style="s2">two minutes for a health issue and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.140" end="00:14:09.190" style="s2">sometimes a complex health issue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.690" end="00:14:10.660" style="s2">not even the limits of knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.190" end="00:14:12.730" style="s2">are gonna be bumped up it&#39;s the limits</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.660" end="00:14:16.660" style="s2">of time to be able to get enough data I</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.730" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">have a I have a doctor friend here I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.660" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">actually think is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.450" style="s2">knowledgeable integrative</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:24.760" style="s2">rheumatologists in the world and really</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.450" end="00:14:27.190" style="s2">has a profound understanding of causes</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.760" end="00:14:29.110" style="s2">of autoimmune disease but as a result</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.190" end="00:14:31.090" style="s2">his clinic got so inundated with</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.110" end="00:14:32.380" style="s2">incurable cases that came that he</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.090" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">started having shorter and shorter</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.380" end="00:14:37.150" style="s2">sessions and then I started watching him</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">actually practice really poor medicine</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.150" end="00:14:40.120" style="s2">because he only had a minute with each</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:41.620" style="s2">person and so we didn&#39;t even get to ask</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.120" end="00:14:45.010" style="s2">the questions that would give him a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.620" end="00:14:46.420" style="s2">holistic picture again so the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.010" end="00:14:48.700" style="s2">thing you can be pretty sure of is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.420" end="00:14:50.980" style="s2">if your doctor isn&#39;t getting a really</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.700" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">good sense of your whole medical history</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.980" end="00:14:55.840" style="s2">and your symptom ology and when your</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">symptoms started and how that correspond</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.840" end="00:15:00.700" style="s2">to different exposures and events that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:04.090" style="s2">might have happened and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.700" end="00:15:05.530" style="s2">really you know good laboratory data and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.090" end="00:15:08.620" style="s2">corresponding and seeing that it makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.530" end="00:15:11.830" style="s2">sense they just couldn&#39;t possibly have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.620" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">decent picture of what to do yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.830" end="00:15:17.830" style="s2">think my doc did I try and hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">even as I move around the place what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.830" end="00:15:21.220" style="s2">like about him as he&#39;s always running</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.300" end="00:15:23.050" style="s2">late and he&#39;s running late because he</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.220" end="00:15:24.550" style="s2">tries to give people the time that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.050" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">need but obviously there&#39;s knock-on</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.550" end="00:15:32.280" style="s2">consequences for him all right so then</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:32.280" style="s2">let&#39;s explore this a little further</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.220" end="00:15:38.900" style="s2">conventional medicine modern Western</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.500" end="00:15:40.970" style="s2">allopathic medicine has done a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.900" end="00:15:42.890" style="s2">job of saving a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.970" end="00:15:46.280" style="s2">lives from things that we used to die</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.890" end="00:15:48.890" style="s2">from that are mostly acute onset illness</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.280" end="00:15:51.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s really an exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.890" end="00:15:53.320" style="s2">system of medicine for acute cause</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.040" end="00:15:56.960" style="s2">suffering so if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.320" end="00:15:58.850" style="s2">injury it&#39;s not that we can&#39;t do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.960" end="00:16:01.460" style="s2">better in the future and we will but</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.850" end="00:16:03.320" style="s2">anybody who gets in a car accident or</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.460" end="00:16:07.790" style="s2">gunshot would much rather go to the ER</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.320" end="00:16:10.910" style="s2">than any other healing system and if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.790" end="00:16:12.740" style="s2">have acute poisoning so dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.910" end="00:16:15.860" style="s2">toxicity that is acute high level</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.740" end="00:16:17.570" style="s2">toxicity or acute infection it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.860" end="00:16:19.970" style="s2">good at dealing with all that if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.570" end="00:16:22.520" style="s2">have chronic complex illness that did</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.970" end="00:16:24.230" style="s2">not come on from one acute cause so</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.520" end="00:16:25.490" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at cancer we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.230" end="00:16:27.200" style="s2">autoimmune disease we look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.490" end="00:16:30.260" style="s2">neurodegenerative diseases we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.200" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">at psychiatric disorders it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.260" end="00:16:36.130" style="s2">interesting to know that there&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:41.840" style="s2">much no actual cures for any of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.130" end="00:16:43.790" style="s2">there are symptom treatments and of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.840" end="00:16:46.400" style="s2">course if someone&#39;s body is running a</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.790" end="00:16:49.160" style="s2">cancer we can cut it out we can radiate</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.400" end="00:16:51.110" style="s2">it out we can poison it out and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.160" end="00:16:53.720" style="s2">chance of coming back depending upon the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.110" end="00:16:56.590" style="s2">kind of cancer is fairly high because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.720" end="00:16:59.800" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually understand why the body</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.590" end="00:17:02.900" style="s2">is growing cancers there in terms of why</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.800" end="00:17:04.250" style="s2">are cancer cells proliferating more than</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.900" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">normal and why did the body&#39;s immune</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.250" end="00:17:07.910" style="s2">response not know how to deal with them</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:10.670" style="s2">effectively it&#39;s actually only in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.910" end="00:17:13.069" style="s2">last year or two with the proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.670" end="00:17:15.290" style="s2">of immunotherapy is that cancers</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.069" end="00:17:16.939" style="s2">actually starting to be looked at in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.290" end="00:17:19.220" style="s2">causal way at all chemotherapeutics</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.939" end="00:17:21.589" style="s2">radiation and surgery the only things</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.220" end="00:17:23.810" style="s2">that have been approved are exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.589" end="00:17:26.750" style="s2">symptomatic without addressing why the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.810" end="00:17:29.480" style="s2">body&#39;s doing this same is true with all</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.750" end="00:17:32.210" style="s2">of those all those disorders and so one</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.480" end="00:17:35.420" style="s2">of the reasons is that we we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.210" end="00:17:37.190" style="s2">a good type of science for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.420" end="00:17:41.540" style="s2">in a very complex system like the human</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.190" end="00:17:43.730" style="s2">physiology how dis regulation works it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.540" end="00:17:45.230" style="s2">not acute if it&#39;s acute it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.730" end="00:17:46.670" style="s2">easy to tell they got exposed to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.230" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">poison</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.670" end="00:17:52.340" style="s2">and they got sick instantly they got it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:54.920" style="s2">they you know ate this sushi and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.340" end="00:17:58.910" style="s2">got food poisoning another sick that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.920" end="00:18:00.020" style="s2">kind of straightforward but in there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.910" end="00:18:02.410" style="s2">some things where we have pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.020" end="00:18:05.900" style="s2">correlation like someone has you know /</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.410" end="00:18:08.210" style="s2">eats way too much carbohydrate and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.900" end="00:18:09.350" style="s2">see type 2 diabetes come on there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.210" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">still a pretty straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.350" end="00:18:12.620" style="s2">correlation but with the other diseases</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:17.960" style="s2">that I mentioned they&#39;re more complex in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.620" end="00:18:20.570" style="s2">origin it&#39;s because one the cause and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.960" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">effect are very separate in time we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.570" end="00:18:26.450" style="s2">time dilation which makes it very tricky</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:27.680" style="s2">to you have many different causes that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.450" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">are contributing to the disease</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.680" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">oftentimes so it&#39;s not actually that</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:34.580" style="s2">there is one thing that was wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:36.260" style="s2">might have been some nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.580" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">deficiencies and it&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.260" end="00:18:39.560" style="s2">important to talk about this for a</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.340" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">minute when we think of nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.560" end="00:18:45.140" style="s2">deficiencies in modern nutritional</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:48.050" style="s2">Theory related to modern medical theory</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.140" end="00:18:51.260" style="s2">we think of again an acute level of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.050" end="00:18:53.270" style="s2">deficiency such or a level of deficiency</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.260" end="00:18:55.250" style="s2">such that it causes that a acute disease</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.270" end="00:18:58.190" style="s2">so if item NC being so low that you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.250" end="00:19:00.680" style="s2">scurvy or vitamin b1 being so low you</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.190" end="00:19:03.940" style="s2">get berry berry well if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.680" end="00:19:06.500" style="s2">where an optimal level of that vitamin s</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.940" end="00:19:08.210" style="s2">versus where the level is at which you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.500" end="00:19:11.300" style="s2">get an acute disease is a pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.210" end="00:19:14.030" style="s2">range in between there of suboptimal</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.300" end="00:19:15.950" style="s2">levels right it&#39;s not low enough yet to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.030" end="00:19:17.390" style="s2">be a disease state but it&#39;s pretty far</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.950" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">from where an optimally healthy person</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.390" end="00:19:24.650" style="s2">is yeah this is ICU in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:27.410" style="s2">diagnosis right and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.650" end="00:19:29.930" style="s2">subclinical deficiency that doesn&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.410" end="00:19:31.880" style="s2">up as deficiency because in a disease</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.930" end="00:19:33.320" style="s2">model it&#39;s not yet causing an acute</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.730" end="00:20:06.600" style="s2">sick you can look at what the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:08.010" style="s2">level is which is there&#39;s no mercury at</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.600" end="00:20:13.409" style="s2">all there&#39;s a pretty big layer in</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.010" end="00:20:16.860" style="s2">between which is a much higher amount of</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.220" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">effects so now you look at a world where</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.860" end="00:21:42.570" style="s2">or agriculture depletes the topsoil of</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.519" end="00:21:49.980" style="s2">main minerals right we put NPK back in</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.740" end="00:21:52.230" style="s2">but we remove all of the 70 to give or</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.980" end="00:21:54.899" style="s2">take trace minerals so then we get trace</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.290" end="00:23:45.060" style="s2">think now most people are probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.880" end="00:23:48.170" style="s2">pretty familiar that there are a huge</p>

<p begin="00:24:05.400" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">particular and so the microbiome and the</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.929" end="00:25:11.100" style="s2">like like the the over focus on hygiene</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.419" end="00:25:13.559" style="s2">that potentially leads us to not having</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.100" end="00:25:15.960" style="s2">the kind of immune responses we need or</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.409" end="00:25:23.730" style="s2">mother and so on but the what the main</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.110" end="00:25:26.669" style="s2">thing clanging in my head right now is</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.730" end="00:25:30.059" style="s2">this is this is kind of scary there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.669" end="00:25:33.990" style="s2">the general genuinely scary and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.059" end="00:25:36.750" style="s2">circle back to the question that I asked</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.990" end="00:25:39.389" style="s2">just a couple of minutes ago is how can</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.750" end="00:25:41.669" style="s2">we find the trustworthy information to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.389" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">be able to make inform steps because it</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.669" end="00:25:46.019" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s a full-time job to try</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:48.600" style="s2">and be on top of it and there&#39;s so and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.019" end="00:25:50.340" style="s2">when it&#39;s at the the below the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.600" end="00:25:53.330" style="s2">where it&#39;s a condition that people can</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.340" end="00:25:55.590" style="s2">clearly say oh you you&#39;ve got this issue</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.330" end="00:25:57.899" style="s2">isn&#39;t there a big danger that we just</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.590" end="00:25:59.370" style="s2">run around imagining that we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.899" end="00:26:01.379" style="s2">deficiency this deficiency this</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.370" end="00:26:04.279" style="s2">deficiency and we&#39;re just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.379" end="00:26:08.330" style="s2">guessing and we don&#39;t really know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.279" end="00:26:10.769" style="s2">so the just in kind of wrapping the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.330" end="00:26:12.840" style="s2">major point I was trying to bring there</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.769" end="00:26:16.700" style="s2">is that when it comes to disease that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.840" end="00:26:19.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have an acute cause oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.700" end="00:26:22.679" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have one cause at all it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.470" end="00:26:26.970" style="s2">might be the dysregulation of regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.679" end="00:26:29.639" style="s2">systems from exposure to toxins exposure</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.970" end="00:26:31.850" style="s2">to pathogens dysbiosis in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.639" end="00:26:33.710" style="s2">chronic stress</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.850" end="00:26:37.460" style="s2">postural issues lack of movement</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.710" end="00:26:39.410" style="s2">efficiency and you have one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.460" end="00:26:41.450" style="s2">is suboptimal that makes the system</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.410" end="00:26:43.280" style="s2">regulate slightly less well that makes</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.450" end="00:26:44.990" style="s2">it more susceptible to other things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.280" end="00:26:46.429" style="s2">are suboptimal you get a vicious cycle</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.990" end="00:26:48.620" style="s2">and eventually there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.429" end="00:26:51.020" style="s2">dysregulation that you actually start to</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.620" end="00:26:52.730" style="s2">get damaged in certain tissues or</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.020" end="00:26:54.169" style="s2">certain systems and those cluster</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.730" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">together and we call it a disease we</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.169" end="00:26:57.980" style="s2">call it MS or rheumatoid arthritis or</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:27:01.010" style="s2">whatever but the reason that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.980" end="00:27:03.169" style="s2">had good cures is because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.010" end="00:27:04.309" style="s2">gonna find a single cause for we find a</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.169" end="00:27:06.169" style="s2">number of different things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.309" end="00:27:07.850" style="s2">statistically correlate but none of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.169" end="00:27:09.830" style="s2">statistically correlated enough that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.850" end="00:27:11.330" style="s2">treating that one statistical</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.830" end="00:27:13.159" style="s2">correlation always cures it because</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.330" end="00:27:14.600" style="s2">that&#39;s one of a set of a number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.159" end="00:27:16.940" style="s2">things that can be involved in it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.600" end="00:27:18.140" style="s2">even the same set in everyone so this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.940" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">a key thing in terms of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.140" end="00:27:22.580" style="s2">why we have to take a more complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.740" style="s2">approach to understanding something as</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.580" end="00:27:28.070" style="s2">complex as a human body when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.740" end="00:27:31.490" style="s2">trying to understand issues like aging</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.070" end="00:27:33.909" style="s2">and issues like chronic disease and on</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.490" end="00:27:37.789" style="s2">the other side human flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.909" end="00:27:39.590" style="s2">variable isolation right what is the one</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.789" end="00:27:41.289" style="s2">thing that is wrong when one drug that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.590" end="00:27:44.570" style="s2">will treat it it&#39;s just not gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.289" end="00:27:48.860" style="s2">so that&#39;s it that&#39;s important just kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.570" end="00:27:52.370" style="s2">of from an approach point of view so how</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.860" end="00:27:54.919" style="s2">do we find good resources and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.370" end="00:27:57.350" style="s2">approach this well couple things like</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.919" end="00:27:59.419" style="s2">all areas there&#39;s a pretty good Pareto</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.350" end="00:28:05.570" style="s2">principle at 80/20 kind of principle</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.419" end="00:28:08.270" style="s2">here where if people do a good job with</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.570" end="00:28:09.740" style="s2">the foundations of well-being they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.270" end="00:28:11.210" style="s2">going to have a lot less disease in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.740" end="00:28:12.500" style="s2">their life and the foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.210" end="00:28:17.809" style="s2">well-being are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.500" end="00:28:21.980" style="s2">straightforward so in order</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.809" end="00:28:23.690" style="s2">sleep enough and sleep well that&#39;s a all</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.980" end="00:28:25.820" style="s2">the regeneration that happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.690" end="00:28:30.010" style="s2">physiology any nutrients that you take</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.820" end="00:28:35.030" style="s2">in their ability to actually support the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.010" end="00:28:36.830" style="s2">genesis of new tissues etc any exercise</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.030" end="00:28:38.360" style="s2">you do the ability for those tissues to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.830" end="00:28:41.720" style="s2">regenerate all of that&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.360" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">during sleep mostly during Delta sleep</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.720" end="00:28:47.420" style="s2">so sleeping enough and sick and well</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:49.490" style="s2">foundational eating just as a side note</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.420" end="00:28:51.170" style="s2">before we get to the the next the next</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.490" end="00:28:54.230" style="s2">part there there&#39;s such a cult these</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.170" end="00:28:56.750" style="s2">days I think about the highest</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.230" end="00:29:02.120" style="s2">achievement achievers in the world go on</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.750" end="00:29:04.070" style="s2">for hours sleep and is yeah I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.120" end="00:29:07.160" style="s2">about that like how are they managing to</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.070" end="00:29:10.400" style="s2">continue to function and or do some</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.160" end="00:29:13.940" style="s2">people only need four hours sleep yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.400" end="00:29:16.700" style="s2">know a lot of world-class high achievers</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.940" end="00:29:17.990" style="s2">and almost none of them have four hours</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.700" end="00:29:20.990" style="s2">sleep most of them actually do a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.990" end="00:29:23.900" style="s2">good job of self-care there are people</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.990" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">who will push very hard for a period and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.900" end="00:29:28.760" style="s2">then burn out and then they&#39;re either</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:30.520" style="s2">done with their creative time period or</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.760" end="00:29:33.140" style="s2">they have to learn a new way of being</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.520" end="00:29:35.210" style="s2">there are people genetically who need</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.140" end="00:29:37.460" style="s2">less sleep there&#39;s a few genes that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.210" end="00:29:39.860" style="s2">actually code for more efficient sleep</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.460" end="00:29:42.710" style="s2">but this is actually a tiny percentage</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.860" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">of the population that can that will end</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.710" end="00:29:44.810" style="s2">up needing in the vicinity of five hours</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:50.050" style="s2">sleep</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.810" end="00:29:52.370" style="s2">most people genetically do best on</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.050" end="00:29:55.430" style="s2">something in the vicinity of eight hours</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.370" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">sleep there&#39;s a whole lawn it sleeps a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.430" end="00:30:01.550" style="s2">very complex topic in general how do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:05.320" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve slept enough and slept</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.550" end="00:30:07.940" style="s2">well that you would wake on your own</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.320" end="00:30:09.610" style="s2">feeling well-rested and energized and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.940" end="00:30:12.440" style="s2">you have good energy throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.610" end="00:30:13.490" style="s2">now obviously that&#39;s oversimplified</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.440" end="00:30:15.110" style="s2">because your energy throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.490" end="00:30:17.570" style="s2">is gonna suck even if you slept well if</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.110" end="00:30:19.910" style="s2">your blood sugar is unstable or if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.570" end="00:30:23.660" style="s2">are not exercising which is a key to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.910" end="00:30:26.510" style="s2">circulation and generating androgens and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.660" end="00:30:27.680" style="s2">things that are necessary but if you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.510" end="00:30:29.570" style="s2">waking tired</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.680" end="00:30:34.400" style="s2">then there&#39;s then sleep is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.570" end="00:30:37.610" style="s2">sufficient yet right so it&#39;s deep topic</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.400" end="00:30:39.140" style="s2">we could do a whole thing on sleep over</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.610" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">at our site neural hacker we have up we</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.140" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">have a couple whole podcast just on</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:45.470" style="s2">sleep with you know world-class sleep</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.280" end="00:30:46.910" style="s2">researchers and there&#39;s a lot of sleep</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.470" end="00:30:48.620" style="s2">tech that&#39;s coming out we&#39;re in the</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.620" end="00:30:52.909" style="s2">sleep optimization but that&#39;s one of the</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.249" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">most people have not studied them well</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.979" end="00:31:05.179" style="s2">enough to know how to optimize them like</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:08.779" style="s2">sleep making sure that you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.179" end="00:31:11.749" style="s2">exposing yourself to blue light and</p>

<p begin="00:33:39.940" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">there are plants that are poisonous</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.610" end="00:33:46.510" style="s2">obviously you can have a protein powder</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:47.340" style="s2">that is processed that&#39;s actually good</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.510" end="00:33:51.940" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.340" end="00:33:53.710" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of good books on</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.940" end="00:33:55.450" style="s2">nutrition where you can dive deeper but</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.710" end="00:33:59.650" style="s2">if you just start by thinking okay well</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.450" end="00:34:01.150" style="s2">we evolved to have a diet that had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.650" end="00:34:03.340" style="s2">of plants but not a lot of the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.150" end="00:34:05.740" style="s2">plant right we would have had different</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.340" end="00:34:06.580" style="s2">plants and different seasons and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.740" end="00:34:08.470" style="s2">would have been a hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.580" end="00:34:10.360" style="s2">environment been just little bits of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.470" end="00:34:11.770" style="s2">lots of different types all that have</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.360" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">different nutrients so can I do a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.770" end="00:34:16.600" style="s2">variety of different kinds of plants and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:18.540" style="s2">animal products and they should should</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.600" end="00:34:21.129" style="s2">be organic it should not be covered in</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.540" end="00:34:22.990" style="s2">pesticides meaning that if you spray a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.129" end="00:34:24.820" style="s2">chemical toxic enough to kill things</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.990" end="00:34:28.450" style="s2">like ants and cockroaches on your food</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.820" end="00:34:31.840" style="s2">and then eat it that&#39;s kind of silly and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.450" end="00:34:34.179" style="s2">should come from as well and maintain</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.840" end="00:34:35.500" style="s2">soil as possible so if you can get even</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.179" end="00:34:37.570" style="s2">better than organic if you can find</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.500" end="00:34:40.149" style="s2">local farmers that do biodynamic farming</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.570" end="00:34:41.980" style="s2">permaculture farming even better and as</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.149" end="00:34:43.450" style="s2">much as it sounds like that&#39;s fancy all</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.980" end="00:34:46.629" style="s2">it is is trying to get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.450" end="00:34:50.440" style="s2">closer to what all food was before the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.629" end="00:34:52.990" style="s2">Industrial Revolution it is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.440" end="00:34:55.419" style="s2">fancy exactly that it can be expensive</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.990" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">like I remember I live for a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.419" end="00:35:00.790" style="s2">while in the US and I found it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:03.130" style="s2">really expensive to try and buy things</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.790" end="00:35:06.190" style="s2">that seem to be labeled organic or to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.130" end="00:35:08.890" style="s2">shop in Whole Foods I am I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.190" end="00:35:11.020" style="s2">maybe a bit easier in some countries in</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.890" end="00:35:14.740" style="s2">Europe and unless the labeling system is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.020" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">misleading but there is is there kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.740" end="00:35:20.380" style="s2">a barrier of entry that&#39;s based on money</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:22.060" style="s2">for a lot of people here No</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.380" end="00:35:24.100" style="s2">yes going to Whole Foods can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.060" end="00:35:27.490" style="s2">expensive there&#39;s a couple ways to look</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.100" end="00:35:28.870" style="s2">at this one if you find your local</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.490" end="00:35:31.060" style="s2">farmers markets because they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.870" end="00:35:33.900" style="s2">having to pay to have a big-box store</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.060" end="00:35:35.860" style="s2">with lots of I mean they&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.900" end="00:35:38.590" style="s2">disintermediating the grocery store part</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.860" end="00:35:42.370" style="s2">you can get even fresher better quality</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.590" end="00:35:43.300" style="s2">food cheaper and cheaper than what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.370" end="00:35:45.250" style="s2">would pay for the conventional</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.300" end="00:35:47.980" style="s2">agriculture at a normal store the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.250" end="00:35:52.330" style="s2">conventional produce so the cost really</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.980" end="00:35:53.980" style="s2">can be dealt with the produce is usually</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.330" end="00:35:55.420" style="s2">not that expensive the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.980" end="00:35:59.250" style="s2">expensive in places like Whole Foods</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.420" end="00:36:02.440" style="s2">usually are the healthy packaged foods</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.250" end="00:36:04.090" style="s2">and pre-made foods the produce is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.440" end="00:36:08.260" style="s2">little bit more expensive but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.090" end="00:36:09.730" style="s2">like not super expensive and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.260" end="00:36:11.410" style="s2">whole bunch of reasons why farmers</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.730" end="00:36:14.230" style="s2">markets and coops are like really</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.410" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">valuable things to explore so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.230" end="00:36:19.480" style="s2">topic on cost yeah it also sounds fun to</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:22.780" style="s2">be able to to go there rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.480" end="00:36:24.190" style="s2">be in another supermarket it is fun</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.780" end="00:36:25.840" style="s2">you&#39;re supporting local farmers to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.190" end="00:36:28.210" style="s2">actually get paid better than they get</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.840" end="00:36:29.500" style="s2">paid other places which and especially</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.210" end="00:36:31.020" style="s2">the ones that are doing organic and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.500" end="00:36:33.100" style="s2">permaculture which supports</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.020" end="00:36:35.740" style="s2">environmentalism in agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.100" end="00:36:37.470" style="s2">climate change dynamics and micro</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.740" end="00:36:40.210" style="s2">economies and it&#39;s like this is just</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.470" end="00:36:41.890" style="s2">every reason that&#39;s a good thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.210" end="00:36:44.020" style="s2">and yes you can start to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.890" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">friends in the community there and have</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.020" end="00:36:49.390" style="s2">this fun experience of what you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:54.100" style="s2">markets have been for a lot of human</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.390" end="00:36:56.410" style="s2">history so that&#39;s a way that cost is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.100" end="00:37:00.070" style="s2">a barrier of entry the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.410" end="00:37:02.740" style="s2">though is you know when we say solar is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.070" end="00:37:05.860" style="s2">more expensive than coal energy wise and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.740" end="00:37:07.480" style="s2">that solar still needs to get cheaper to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.860" end="00:37:10.380" style="s2">be at grid parity with coal in some</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.480" end="00:37:17.530" style="s2">areas it&#39;s just complete nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.380" end="00:37:20.620" style="s2">because 99% of the cost of coal energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.530" end="00:37:22.090" style="s2">is just the coal company doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.620" end="00:37:23.890" style="s2">pay for it so they don&#39;t internalize it</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.090" end="00:37:27.360" style="s2">into the cost of coal it&#39;s externalized</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.890" end="00:37:31.180" style="s2">to the Commons in the form of co2 and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.360" end="00:37:32.849" style="s2">mercury mercury vapor and nitrous oxide</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.180" end="00:37:34.589" style="s2">and zinc oxide and the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.849" end="00:37:38.099" style="s2">removal mining that it took to get it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.589" end="00:37:40.920" style="s2">and the like it there is a massive cost</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.099" end="00:37:43.170" style="s2">to all people to the environment to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.920" end="00:37:45.180" style="s2">future generations to whatever that if</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.170" end="00:37:48.749" style="s2">you had to say hey burn coal but just</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.180" end="00:37:50.609" style="s2">don&#39;t leave the environments worse as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.749" end="00:37:53.640" style="s2">result so whatever it takes to clean up</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.609" end="00:37:54.989" style="s2">the effects in real time do that and if</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.640" end="00:37:56.910" style="s2">it costs some money to do that you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.989" end="00:37:59.220" style="s2">to include that in the cost of coal coal</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.910" end="00:38:01.470" style="s2">would go up by the price of coal would</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.220" end="00:38:05.220" style="s2">go up by hundreds or thousands of times</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.470" end="00:38:07.470" style="s2">and solar would have been that grid</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.220" end="00:38:08.729" style="s2">parity the moment it existed so and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.470" end="00:38:12.989" style="s2">same is true in health care</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.729" end="00:38:16.319" style="s2">I can eat shittier foods that are cheap</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.989" end="00:38:18.180" style="s2">but there&#39;s a cost and it&#39;s a cost</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.319" end="00:38:21.539" style="s2">that&#39;s being externalized to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.180" end="00:38:23.279" style="s2">decreased health of my future and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.539" end="00:38:26.819" style="s2">then I&#39;m gonna have to pay the medical</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.279" end="00:38:30.150" style="s2">and or just have a shorter or shittier</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.819" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">life and so it becomes important to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.150" end="00:38:37.670" style="s2">think about what does cost really mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:37.670" style="s2">and what is actually worth investing in</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.910" end="00:38:43.349" style="s2">right yeah so cost we can think of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.249" end="00:38:46.710" style="s2">not just a financial cost but there can</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.349" end="00:38:48.900" style="s2">be the other and until I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.710" end="00:38:51.539" style="s2">it&#39;s a funny human thing that we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.900" end="00:38:54.180" style="s2">ignore that sort of personal cost until</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.539" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">it actually hits us even though we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.180" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">all the evidence to see if you see</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:38:59.670" style="s2">someone who smoked their whole lives and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:01.979" style="s2">didn&#39;t think about it then the cost</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.670" end="00:39:03.930" style="s2">becomes evident later we say over and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.979" end="00:39:07.739" style="s2">over again but seem to have trouble when</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.930" end="00:39:10.319" style="s2">it comes to ourselves humans suck at</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.739" end="00:39:13.229" style="s2">this topic everywhere and it&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.319" end="00:39:17.339" style="s2">are so close to self-induced extinction</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.229" end="00:39:21.539" style="s2">as a species which is short term gain</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.339" end="00:39:25.259" style="s2">and long term expense and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.539" end="00:39:27.180" style="s2">reasons why we suck at it is in and have</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.259" end="00:39:29.249" style="s2">in our evolutionary environment pre</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.180" end="00:39:30.869" style="s2">advanced technological capabilities we</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.249" end="00:39:34.309" style="s2">just didn&#39;t have the ability to affect</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.869" end="00:39:34.309" style="s2">our own feature negatively that much</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.339" end="00:39:37.410" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.579" end="00:39:39.299" style="s2">this is actually an important thing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.410" end="00:39:42.119" style="s2">understand in our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.299" end="00:39:44.249" style="s2">environment 250,000 years of being</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.119" end="00:39:46.859" style="s2">homeless and something like 8 million</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.249" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">years of hominid history before the plow</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.859" end="00:39:53.219" style="s2">and you know grains refined</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.200" end="00:39:58.229" style="s2">carbohydrates etc for that whole time</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.219" end="00:40:01.799" style="s2">period there was not an easy way to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.229" end="00:40:03.269" style="s2">sugar fat or salt right sugar every once</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.799" end="00:40:05.160" style="s2">while you&#39;d find some berries but the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.269" end="00:40:07.739" style="s2">berries that we see today are radically</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.160" end="00:40:10.170" style="s2">hybridized from the heirloom berries</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.739" end="00:40:11.849" style="s2">back then that were like a few on a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.170" end="00:40:13.109" style="s2">thorny bush for a very small amount of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.849" end="00:40:17.999" style="s2">time and you&#39;re in competition with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.109" end="00:40:20.039" style="s2">birds right and and honey is a super</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.999" end="00:40:22.440" style="s2">hard thing to actually deal with the</p>

<p begin="00:46:59.430" end="00:47:04.110" style="s2">thinking about it hearing it can be</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.170" end="00:47:06.330" style="s2">useful yeah I think that that personal</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.110" end="00:47:08.570" style="s2">confrontation sounds really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.330" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">and I&#39;m I&#39;m finding just in myself</p>

<p begin="00:47:17.910" end="00:47:23.250" style="s2">just kind of despair and accept that as</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.970" end="00:47:25.530" style="s2">I think I know a lot of older people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.250" end="00:47:27.150" style="s2">just go well you know that&#39;s how it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.530" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">you get older and everything hurts more</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.150" end="00:47:31.980" style="s2">and things don&#39;t work so well but we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:34.110" style="s2">actually make some differences we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.980" end="00:47:37.140" style="s2">make some changes which can actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.110" end="00:47:40.740" style="s2">affect us positively and I guess one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.140" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">the the main ones is that the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.740" end="00:47:45.000" style="s2">input of better things into our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:48.780" style="s2">in the way that you describe just in</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.000" end="00:47:51.810" style="s2">terms of food but when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.780" end="00:47:55.460" style="s2">world of biohacking which is ever more</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.810" end="00:47:57.840" style="s2">widespread it seems to me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.460" end="00:47:59.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to talk about by hacking</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.840" end="00:48:01.530" style="s2">I&#39;m like trying to formulate three</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.910" end="00:48:04.620" style="s2">questions at once I guess it&#39;d be better</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.530" end="00:48:07.110" style="s2">to start by saying ask for like your two</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.620" end="00:48:10.340" style="s2">minute description of what qualia is and</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.110" end="00:48:12.930" style="s2">then we can really dig deeper into it</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.340" end="00:48:15.720" style="s2">yeah so quality is a nootropic which</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.930" end="00:48:17.370" style="s2">means some chemistry that enhances</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.720" end="00:48:20.190" style="s2">cognitive function different aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.370" end="00:48:23.730" style="s2">cognitive function beyond one&#39;s previous</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.190" end="00:48:26.340" style="s2">baseline without causing negative side</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.730" end="00:48:26.900" style="s2">effect that&#39;s the general best accepted</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.340" end="00:48:29.180" style="s2">definite</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.900" end="00:48:30.859" style="s2">nootropic there&#39;s different classes of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.180" end="00:48:33.799" style="s2">chemicals that are the primary classes</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.859" end="00:48:37.069" style="s2">of nootropics that you know are</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.799" end="00:48:38.930" style="s2">generally well studied and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.069" end="00:48:42.740" style="s2">what a nootropic stack meaning a blend</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.930" end="00:48:44.420" style="s2">of different chemical supplements that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.740" end="00:48:46.970" style="s2">affect different neurotransmitters</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.420" end="00:48:49.369" style="s2">different pathways different aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.970" end="00:48:53.809" style="s2">neuro chemistry and biochemistry to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.369" end="00:48:55.250" style="s2">enhance the underlying physical</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.809" end="00:48:59.420" style="s2">substrate that supports cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.250" end="00:49:02.119" style="s2">process and so why did we create it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.420" end="00:49:05.240" style="s2">the first of a bunch of products that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.119" end="00:49:06.920" style="s2">all have the same design philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.240" end="00:49:14.270" style="s2">methodology the next ones will be</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.920" end="00:49:15.890" style="s2">launching early this next year but when</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.270" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">we started this we saw this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.890" end="00:49:23.750" style="s2">meteoric exponential rise of the use of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:26.210" style="s2">smart drugs and specifically even</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.750" end="00:49:29.329" style="s2">illegal off-label smart drugs we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.210" end="00:49:31.940" style="s2">talking about adderall modafinil riddlin</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.329" end="00:49:34.099" style="s2">vyvanse wellbutrin and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.940" end="00:49:37.460" style="s2">dopaminergic but some some other</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.099" end="00:49:39.140" style="s2">categories and we saw Averell do an</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.460" end="00:49:43.670" style="s2">estimated five billion dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.140" end="00:49:46.430" style="s2">illegal sales in the US per year when we</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.670" end="00:49:48.789" style="s2">started smart drugs as a whole - about</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.430" end="00:49:50.869" style="s2">15 billion dollars that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.789" end="00:49:55.809" style="s2">domestically right so internationally a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.869" end="00:49:59.390" style="s2">lot more and this is because people were</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.809" end="00:50:01.849" style="s2">had such strong pressure to perform and</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.390" end="00:50:05.270" style="s2">produce and really wanted to while</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.849" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">simultaneously having so much that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.270" end="00:50:10.700" style="s2">damaging their ability to focus from all</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:14.450" style="s2">of the social media kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.700" end="00:50:17.270" style="s2">distractions to gut brain access being</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.450" end="00:50:19.760" style="s2">out like we talked about where 50%</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.270" end="00:50:22.730" style="s2">dopamine is produced and the nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.760" end="00:50:26.150" style="s2">and deficiencies in toxicities and etc</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.730" end="00:50:29.390" style="s2">and you know then other than people</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.150" end="00:50:32.690" style="s2">going to off-label smart drugs we also</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.390" end="00:50:34.970" style="s2">saw you know energy drinks where people</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.690" end="00:50:37.630" style="s2">were doing 300 and 400 milligrams of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.970" end="00:50:37.630" style="s2">caffeine and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.530" end="00:50:43.460" style="s2">you know caffeine is a cool molecule</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.349" end="00:50:45.710" style="s2">qualy has a very small amount of</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.460" end="00:50:46.970" style="s2">caffeine and a unique form in it because</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.710" end="00:50:50.050" style="s2">it&#39;s a really neat central nervous</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.970" end="00:50:52.550" style="s2">system stimulant if we have caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.050" end="00:50:53.930" style="s2">bound to an antioxidant from blueberry</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.550" end="00:50:56.750" style="s2">skin called taro still being that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.930" end="00:50:58.849" style="s2">affects the pharmacokinetics of it so it</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.750" end="00:51:01.190" style="s2">releases much slower so you don&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.849" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">jolt and then a drop you get a very slow</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.190" end="00:51:06.440" style="s2">central nervous system release over a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:08.270" style="s2">longer period of time but that is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.440" end="00:51:10.970" style="s2">also helps the uptake of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.270" end="00:51:14.990" style="s2">other more specifically active neural</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.970" end="00:51:17.540" style="s2">chemistry but at those kinds of doses</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.990" end="00:51:20.750" style="s2">this is really not a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.540" end="00:51:22.910" style="s2">relationship with caffeine and you start</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.750" end="00:51:24.650" style="s2">getting you know you&#39;d get increased</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.910" end="00:51:27.050" style="s2">focus and attention and alertness to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.650" end="00:51:29.390" style="s2">certain point and then the jitteriness</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.050" end="00:51:31.730" style="s2">and inability to focus starts getting a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.390" end="00:51:33.740" style="s2">negative response curve and a central</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.730" end="00:51:36.890" style="s2">nervous system stimulant like caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.740" end="00:51:39.140" style="s2">or a dopamine enhancer like adderall</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.890" end="00:51:41.510" style="s2">are really only affecting a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.140" end="00:51:43.190" style="s2">range of the total aspects of chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.510" end="00:51:45.859" style="s2">that are important for cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.190" end="00:51:48.200" style="s2">enhancement and so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.859" end="00:51:53.570" style="s2">that you find is when people are going</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.200" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">to those kinds of solutions is that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.570" end="00:51:57.470" style="s2">they work right like people are taking</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:51:59.690" style="s2">them for their midterms or their finals</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.470" end="00:52:01.820" style="s2">or their tech startup or for their</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.690" end="00:52:05.690" style="s2">gaming or whatever because they actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.820" end="00:52:09.080" style="s2">can focus better longer concentrate and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.690" end="00:52:11.240" style="s2">they have more motivation but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.080" end="00:52:13.369" style="s2">things very interesting is some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.240" end="00:52:15.020" style="s2">other cognitive capabilities that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.369" end="00:52:16.220" style="s2">would want online at the same time there</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.020" end="00:52:18.170" style="s2">are studies that actually show they go</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.220" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">down so different aspects of memory like</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.170" end="00:52:24.440" style="s2">total working memory goes down on that</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:26.450" style="s2">role and creativity goes down and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.440" end="00:52:30.500" style="s2">ability for fluid intelligence and task</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.450" end="00:52:33.020" style="s2">switching goes down and it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.500" end="00:52:35.030" style="s2">that empathy goes down for most people</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.020" end="00:52:39.080" style="s2">and irritability anxiousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.030" end="00:52:41.030" style="s2">depersonalization go up and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.080" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">one problem is that it&#39;s a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.030" end="00:52:46.700" style="s2">set of positive effects the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:48.109" style="s2">problem is that your body regulates</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.700" end="00:52:49.849" style="s2">dopamine right your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.109" end="00:52:50.360" style="s2">regulates dopamine in a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.849" end="00:52:52.220" style="s2">Kampala</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.360" end="00:52:54.650" style="s2">this way and you don&#39;t want fixed high</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.220" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">dopamine levels all the time you do want</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.650" end="00:52:57.980" style="s2">your body to be able to up regulate its</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.600" style="s2">dopamine when you&#39;re doing and dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.980" end="00:53:00.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of task like working on a</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.600" end="00:53:02.930" style="s2">project and then you want it to be able</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.950" end="00:53:04.280" style="s2">to chill when you want to go play with</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.930" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">your kids or cuddle or something else</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.280" end="00:53:13.130" style="s2">and so rather than take a chemical that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:16.370" style="s2">externally exogenously overrides an</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.130" end="00:53:18.410" style="s2">endogenous regulatory process and then</p>

<p begin="00:53:18.410" end="00:53:24.470" style="s2">creates dependence and addiction which</p>

<p begin="00:53:32.050" end="00:53:37.220" style="s2">providing chemistry that supported the</p>

<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:48.710" style="s2">talking about disease earlier we can</p>

<p begin="00:53:55.250" end="00:53:59.060" style="s2">dynamics and the system can actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.660" end="00:54:02.870" style="s2">respond to it and so we wanted to work</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.060" end="00:54:04.430" style="s2">on increasing the regulatory capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.870" end="00:54:06.200" style="s2">the system so that rather than causing</p>

<p begin="00:54:06.200" end="00:54:09.260" style="s2">for a while they get off and that were</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.340" end="00:54:11.150" style="s2">screwed we wanted it to be that if</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.260" end="00:54:13.700" style="s2">someone was on any product we made for a</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.150" end="00:54:17.330" style="s2">while then they got off that they would</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.700" end="00:54:19.970" style="s2">actually have lasting benefit in terms</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.330" end="00:54:22.040" style="s2">of elevation of some positive functions</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.970" end="00:54:24.260" style="s2">from the baseline before they started</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.040" end="00:54:25.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s true for koala industry for</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.260" end="00:54:29.150" style="s2">although other products that were making</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.640" end="00:54:31.280" style="s2">its the design methodology and so with</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.150" end="00:54:33.500" style="s2">quality the way we started was we said</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.280" end="00:54:34.910" style="s2">okay when people are seeking cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.500" end="00:54:36.710" style="s2">enhancement what are they really seeking</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.910" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not just cognitive it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.710" end="00:54:40.490" style="s2">emotional cognitive psychologic</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:43.670" style="s2">energetic together right there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.490" end="00:54:47.390" style="s2">seeking focus and concentration and</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.670" end="00:54:49.250" style="s2">attention those dynamics and memory the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.390" end="00:54:50.720" style="s2">ability for working memory to hold more</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.250" end="00:54:53.840" style="s2">in their memory and their speed of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.720" end="00:54:56.060" style="s2">recall verbal fluency you know etc and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.840" end="00:54:58.370" style="s2">they want increased analytic</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.060" end="00:55:00.650" style="s2">capabilities and synthesis capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.370" end="00:55:02.460" style="s2">and creativity they also want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.650" end="00:55:05.670" style="s2">increase motivation and dry</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.460" end="00:55:07.609" style="s2">and emotional resilience and they also</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.670" end="00:55:10.410" style="s2">want some complex things that are like</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.609" end="00:55:12.119" style="s2">the dialectic of pretty opposite things</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.410" end="00:55:14.819" style="s2">which is I want the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.119" end="00:55:16.829" style="s2">concentrate really hard on one topic and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.819" end="00:55:19.290" style="s2">not get distracted while simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.829" end="00:55:20.550" style="s2">having the ability to task switch from</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.290" end="00:55:23.730" style="s2">one thing to another thing what I need</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.550" end="00:55:27.329" style="s2">to do that it&#39;s like we&#39;re asking for a</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.730" end="00:55:28.619" style="s2">magic pill to fix everything here well</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.329" end="00:55:31.619" style="s2">has nothing to do the magic pill it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.619" end="00:55:34.559" style="s2">that a well regulated system is good at</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.619" end="00:55:37.829" style="s2">shifting modes right like that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.559" end="00:55:40.710" style="s2">adaptiveness is and an adaptive creature</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.829" end="00:55:43.579" style="s2">can go from sleeping to waking can go</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.710" end="00:55:45.900" style="s2">from very different kinds of states and</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.579" end="00:55:47.940" style="s2">the quicker that one can go between</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.900" end="00:55:49.829" style="s2">different modes and the better they can</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.940" end="00:55:54.329" style="s2">be in those modes as the adaptiveness of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.829" end="00:55:56.609" style="s2">the creature and so what we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.329" end="00:55:59.400" style="s2">support was the overall adaptiveness so</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.609" end="00:56:01.829" style="s2">if we were just driving the chemistry of</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.400" end="00:56:04.230" style="s2">focus and concentration</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.829" end="00:56:06.480" style="s2">it would make task-switching worse we</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.230" end="00:56:08.549" style="s2">could drive things that would support</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.480" end="00:56:11.670" style="s2">task switching may focus worse to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.549" end="00:56:13.049" style="s2">both better you have to not be exogenous</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.670" end="00:56:14.579" style="s2">lis driving the chemistry in one</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.049" end="00:56:17.130" style="s2">direction or the other but supporting</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.579" end="00:56:20.130" style="s2">the regulatory processes and so this was</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.130" end="00:56:23.309" style="s2">you know this is kind of at a high level</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.130" end="00:56:26.309" style="s2">but this is our design philosophy for</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.309" end="00:56:31.410" style="s2">how we wanted to approach anything in</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.309" end="00:56:33.510" style="s2">the health and well-being space is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.410" end="00:56:34.980" style="s2">make sure that we are well and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.510" end="00:56:37.140" style="s2">specifically in the enhancement space</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.980" end="00:56:38.819" style="s2">biohacking so often isn&#39;t looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.140" end="00:56:42.390" style="s2">disease model but the enhancement side</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.819" end="00:56:43.770" style="s2">and again modern medicine that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.390" end="00:56:46.170" style="s2">the other differences is that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.770" end="00:56:52.470" style="s2">disease model process so it&#39;s really not</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.170" end="00:56:54.869" style="s2">looking at optimization so why we mapped</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.470" end="00:56:56.579" style="s2">all those things to start was to say you</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.869" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">know people really don&#39;t just want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.579" end="00:57:02.490" style="s2">increase focus well being more irritable</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:04.680" style="s2">and less creative and with less code</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.490" end="00:57:08.369" style="s2">Emery they want this whole suite of</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.680" end="00:57:11.160" style="s2">things together that means that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.369" end="00:57:12.700" style="s2">have increased creative productive</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.160" end="00:57:17.079" style="s2">capacity and flow</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.700" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">and so then we said all right well what</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.079" end="00:57:24.039" style="s2">do we know in any of the various</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:27.240" style="s2">Biosciences human Biosciences about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.039" end="00:57:32.019" style="s2">physiologic processes that mediate those</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.240" end="00:57:34.150" style="s2">cognitive and subjective dynamics what</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.019" end="00:57:37.470" style="s2">do we know about the neural chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.150" end="00:57:39.329" style="s2">that mediates focus that mediates</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.470" end="00:57:43.150" style="s2">task-switching</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.329" end="00:57:45.039" style="s2">memory i/o etc and so we started to map</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.150" end="00:57:47.170" style="s2">those processing some are acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.039" end="00:57:50.289" style="s2">mediated right some have to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.170" end="00:57:52.059" style="s2">nmda complex some have to do with how</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.289" end="00:57:54.250" style="s2">catecholamines process some have to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.059" end="00:57:55.839" style="s2">with sodium ion dynamic so we were</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.250" end="00:57:57.609" style="s2">mapping these and saying how does the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.839" end="00:58:00.269" style="s2">body regulate those on its own can we</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.609" end="00:58:02.980" style="s2">draw the regulatory processes and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.269" end="00:58:04.990" style="s2">why does the body get less good at</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.980" end="00:58:08.109" style="s2">regulating because of course kids</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.990" end="00:58:09.819" style="s2">actually have this ability to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.109" end="00:58:12.609" style="s2">something they&#39;re interested in and also</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.819" end="00:58:15.279" style="s2">tasks which and fall asleep pretty</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.609" end="00:58:18.250" style="s2">quickly and then be energetic right like</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.279" end="00:58:22.750" style="s2">that&#39;s adaptiveness so starting to look</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.250" end="00:58:24.940" style="s2">at why does why does a system have</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.750" end="00:58:26.710" style="s2">decreased capacity to do those things</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.940" end="00:58:29.230" style="s2">what are the rate limiting factors in</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.710" end="00:58:31.480" style="s2">the system and what can we offer to</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.230" end="00:58:33.940" style="s2">support the system&#39;s capacity to do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.480" end="00:58:36.339" style="s2">better so like just as a for instance if</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.940" end="00:58:38.049" style="s2">your listeners are interested in example</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.339" end="00:58:40.059" style="s2">let&#39;s just say we take dopamine that</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.049" end="00:58:43.869" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about earlier rather than</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.059" end="00:58:47.230" style="s2">give you know something like an N feta</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.869" end="00:58:51.309" style="s2">mean right at 11:00 p.m. feta mean it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.230" end="00:58:54.390" style="s2">a enchained dopamine agonist where you</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.309" end="00:58:57.009" style="s2">get a big rush of dopamine but it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.390" end="00:58:59.019" style="s2">decoupled from changing acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.009" end="00:59:00.460" style="s2">levels or glutamate or looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.019" end="00:59:01.990" style="s2">the other catecholamines you&#39;re focused</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.460" end="00:59:04.180" style="s2">or the neuro inhibitory chemicals or</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.990" end="00:59:05.740" style="s2">anything else and it doesn&#39;t look at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.180" end="00:59:08.200" style="s2">whole process of how the body normally</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.740" end="00:59:10.450" style="s2">regulates dopamine so you do get down</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.200" end="00:59:11.980" style="s2">regulation addiction we said well how</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.450" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">does the body normally do dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.980" end="00:59:15.400" style="s2">creation and there&#39;s this whole complex</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:18.519" style="s2">process of how protein is broken down</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.400" end="00:59:20.799" style="s2">into amino acids and phenyl alanine is</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.519" end="00:59:22.779" style="s2">converted and the tyrosine is converted</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.799" end="00:59:24.460" style="s2">into an acetyl tyrosine is converted</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.779" end="00:59:25.620" style="s2">into l-dopa crosses the blood-brain</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.460" end="00:59:27.650" style="s2">barrier is kin</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.620" end="00:59:30.030" style="s2">the dopamine travels down an axon</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.650" end="00:59:31.980" style="s2">crosses the synapse has to cross a whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.030" end="00:59:33.930" style="s2">bunch of different kinds of enzymes to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.980" end="00:59:35.910" style="s2">break it down into synapse and then goes</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.930" end="00:59:37.230" style="s2">into one of multiple dopamine receptors</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.910" end="00:59:40.350" style="s2">that affect how it&#39;s processed you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.230" end="00:59:42.750" style="s2">to have the right dynamics happening in</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.350" end="00:59:44.940" style="s2">the cell the Krebs cycle process is to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.750" end="00:59:46.200" style="s2">have enough energy to process that some</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.940" end="00:59:48.360" style="s2">of it will hydroxylase into</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.200" end="00:59:50.550" style="s2">norepinephrine you map this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.360" end="00:59:53.460" style="s2">out and then say how can we support each</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.550" end="00:59:55.290" style="s2">step in that process and so then we have</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.460" end="00:59:57.990" style="s2">you know what are the vitamins what are</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.290" end="01:00:00.540" style="s2">the amino acids what of minerals were</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.990" end="01:00:02.340" style="s2">the different dynamics convert one step</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.540" end="01:00:04.290" style="s2">to the other step it can be at</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.340" end="01:00:08.070" style="s2">suboptimal levels that lead to rate</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.290" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">limiting in those processes and so we</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.070" end="01:00:14.370" style="s2">made a database of like 500 chemicals</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:16.650" style="s2">that were associated with the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.370" end="01:00:19.560" style="s2">physiology of all of those subjective</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.650" end="01:00:21.150" style="s2">states and capabilities and then we</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.560" end="01:00:25.890" style="s2">started paring it down in terms of which</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.150" end="01:00:27.690" style="s2">ones are you know well tolerated and</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.890" end="01:00:29.490" style="s2">have positive synergies with other ones</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.690" end="01:00:30.900" style="s2">and don&#39;t have negative synergies and</p>

<p begin="01:00:30.900" end="01:00:34.530" style="s2">pathways and you know that led to an</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.030" end="01:00:36.990" style="s2">initial hypothesis of how to make</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.530" end="01:00:40.830" style="s2">something with things that we wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.990" end="01:00:43.680" style="s2">test do we need more or less choline</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.830" end="01:00:45.750" style="s2">donor in this more or less dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.680" end="01:00:48.810" style="s2">agonist in here etc and that led to</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.750" end="01:00:52.550" style="s2">about a hundred iterations with testing</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.810" end="01:00:54.360" style="s2">and we gave qualia and we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.550" end="01:00:58.020" style="s2">preclinical tests where in clinical</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.360" end="01:00:59.550" style="s2">trials now but we did preclinical is</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.020" end="01:01:02.910" style="s2">preparing for the clinicals where we did</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.550" end="01:01:05.670" style="s2">people&#39;s cue EEG brain scans as well as</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.910" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">a bunch of biometrics like HRV and</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.670" end="01:01:13.500" style="s2">ethnography and etc and psychometrics</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:17.310" style="s2">and cognitive metrics before people took</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.500" end="01:01:20.190" style="s2">it and then once they did quality of</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.310" end="01:01:23.550" style="s2">just once and then once they were on it</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.190" end="01:01:25.260" style="s2">for a month and we saw really awesome</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.550" end="01:01:27.990" style="s2">results the data set was too small we</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.260" end="01:01:29.490" style="s2">only had that single blinded so I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.990" end="01:01:31.850" style="s2">speak to the numbers yet we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.490" end="01:01:34.020" style="s2">speak to him once the the full</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.850" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">double-blind did large larger scale</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.020" end="01:01:39.110" style="s2">clinical trial comes out but you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:41.690" style="s2">and we would of course have</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.110" end="01:01:43.910" style="s2">dunh larger trials earlier on except</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.690" end="01:01:46.400" style="s2">they&#39;re expensive and yeah trying to pay</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.910" end="01:01:47.870" style="s2">for all of it is a tricky thing and this</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.400" end="01:01:50.360" style="s2">is worth like we could have taken more</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.870" end="01:01:54.980" style="s2">venture capital money earlier but then</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.360" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">we would have been more beholden to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.980" end="01:01:58.460" style="s2">to maximize profits as per their goals</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:01.790" style="s2">and we really wanted to do something</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.460" end="01:02:03.560" style="s2">that we could really control with what</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.790" end="01:02:05.000" style="s2">our own capacity to fund was so that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.560" end="01:02:08.150" style="s2">could keep making the highest quality</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.000" end="01:02:11.000" style="s2">things so like for instance our cost of</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.150" end="01:02:12.920" style="s2">goods just the raw material costs for us</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.000" end="01:02:16.670" style="s2">on this is more expensive than the</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.920" end="01:02:22.150" style="s2">retail price of most metrics and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.670" end="01:02:24.590" style="s2">because being like you know we have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.150" end="01:02:26.900" style="s2">versions of each ingredient like benefit</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.590" end="01:02:28.700" style="s2">I mean version of be one for the effect</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.900" end="01:02:31.430" style="s2">on peripheral neurons that we wanted is</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.700" end="01:02:34.940" style="s2">something like a hundred times more cost</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.430" end="01:02:36.230" style="s2">per kilo than if I mean that is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.940" end="01:02:38.750" style="s2">normal form would be one that you could</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.230" end="01:02:39.710" style="s2">put but we have those kind of expensive</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.750" end="01:02:41.510" style="s2">forms because it was the one - that</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.710" end="01:02:42.770" style="s2">should do what we wanted now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.510" end="01:02:46.040" style="s2">trying to get the cost down through</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.770" end="01:02:48.320" style="s2">economies of scale but that was longer</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.040" end="01:02:50.360" style="s2">than two minutes what we were trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.320" end="01:02:54.020" style="s2">do with quality and what it really is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.360" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">clearly a super complex I mean even</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.020" end="01:02:58.280" style="s2">beyond the super complexity of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:03:01.310" style="s2">ingredients in there it&#39;s a very complex</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.280" end="01:03:04.640" style="s2">and deep thinking approach that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.310" end="01:03:07.640" style="s2">taken so it kind of already sidesteps a</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.640" end="01:03:09.650" style="s2">lot of the the reservations that people</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.640" end="01:03:12.310" style="s2">have about biohacking and nootropics</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.650" end="01:03:15.380" style="s2">where there tends to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.310" end="01:03:17.660" style="s2">downside some kind of burnout element</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.380" end="01:03:19.310" style="s2">which you&#39;ve already said this is you</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.660" end="01:03:21.950" style="s2">know from the foundation up is not what</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.310" end="01:03:24.800" style="s2">qualia is about well I also wonder when</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.950" end="01:03:27.500" style="s2">when I think and people I know who try</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.800" end="01:03:30.170" style="s2">to take supplements to enhance their</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.500" end="01:03:32.330" style="s2">performance one way or another it does</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.170" end="01:03:35.180" style="s2">seem to still matter what it is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.330" end="01:03:37.940" style="s2">they want to do when they take it so I</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.180" end="01:03:40.730" style="s2">mean accrue a crude example can be you</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.940" end="01:03:42.320" style="s2">could take modafinil fired a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.730" end="01:03:47.000" style="s2">unhealthy relationship with modafinil</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.320" end="01:03:50.090" style="s2">for much of a year a few a few years in</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.000" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">the past and after a time I realized but</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.090" end="01:03:52.910" style="s2">I still kept doing it that I would take</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.160" end="01:03:56.450" style="s2">it because I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.910" end="01:03:58.280" style="s2">feel like I was on and I felt like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.450" end="01:04:00.080" style="s2">great I&#39;m doing great stuff I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.280" end="01:04:01.220" style="s2">focused but if I really broke it down</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.080" end="01:04:03.380" style="s2">and looked at it</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.220" end="01:04:05.840" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t achieving anything you can take</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.380" end="01:04:09.530" style="s2">it to get the sensation of being on it</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.840" end="01:04:11.690" style="s2">but then do nothing so yeah it&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.530" end="01:04:13.790" style="s2">there does this still play a factor in</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.690" end="01:04:16.190" style="s2">in taking qualia because if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.790" end="01:04:19.000" style="s2">you&#39;re just taking it but without any</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.190" end="01:04:24.260" style="s2">sort of purpose in mind is that enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.000" end="01:04:26.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a tool right and there is right use</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.260" end="01:04:30.260" style="s2">of tools somebody can use a hammer wrong</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.840" end="01:04:35.480" style="s2">and break their thumb or they can use a</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.260" end="01:04:36.770" style="s2">hammer ray in buildings and so and to</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.480" end="01:04:39.860" style="s2">the other point somebody can build</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.770" end="01:04:44.840" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t worth building so</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.860" end="01:04:47.060" style="s2">those modafinil towers that I built I</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.840" end="01:04:50.330" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a classic thing where somebody</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.060" end="01:04:52.190" style="s2">is using meth and there&#39;s just cleaning</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.330" end="01:04:53.810" style="s2">their grout with a toothbrush because</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.190" end="01:04:55.100" style="s2">they have a tremendous amount of energy</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.810" end="01:04:56.810" style="s2">that needs to do something but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.100" end="01:05:02.330" style="s2">not really clear on whether the super</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.810" end="01:05:05.330" style="s2">useful thing to do would be so if</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.330" end="01:05:07.160" style="s2">someone already is sleeping well is</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.330" end="01:05:10.370" style="s2">exercising well as meditating as dealing</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.160" end="01:05:12.320" style="s2">with stress well has a empowering</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.370" end="01:05:15.200" style="s2">outlook on life is clear on what they</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.320" end="01:05:17.630" style="s2">want to create and then they add qualia</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.200" end="01:05:22.850" style="s2">to that it&#39;s gonna be a much different</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.630" end="01:05:24.980" style="s2">experience than if someone is thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.850" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">in ways and living in ways that have</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.980" end="01:05:28.730" style="s2">them aggressive and scattered and etc</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:30.500" style="s2">and they take quality like that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.730" end="01:05:32.000" style="s2">not going to instantly just know what to</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.500" end="01:05:35.600" style="s2">do with their lives because they have</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.000" end="01:05:37.310" style="s2">some neurochemical support so in general</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.600" end="01:05:39.080" style="s2">I would encourage people to do the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.310" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">foundational things before I would have</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.080" end="01:05:42.830" style="s2">them do any kind of more advanced</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:44.600" style="s2">biohacking that said there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.830" end="01:05:50.330" style="s2">exception to that that I&#39;ve seen which</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.600" end="01:05:54.620" style="s2">is there are a lot of people who just</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.330" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">can&#39;t do the things they know will make</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.620" end="01:05:58.460" style="s2">a difference for them there the habit</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:05:59.990" style="s2">patterns the addiction patterns have</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.460" end="01:06:01.670" style="s2">just been too strong they beat</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.990" end="01:06:02.850" style="s2">themselves up for not exercising but</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.670" end="01:06:05.550" style="s2">they just you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.850" end="01:06:06.270" style="s2">many years of wanting to and it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.550" end="01:06:08.040" style="s2">not happening</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.270" end="01:06:10.110" style="s2">and we&#39;ve had a lot of people and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.040" end="01:06:12.110" style="s2">can&#39;t make any claims about this but</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.110" end="01:06:15.180" style="s2">we&#39;ve had many people tell us that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.110" end="01:06:17.010" style="s2">took qualia and then after years of</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.180" end="01:06:18.390" style="s2">wanting to exercise and not they started</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.010" end="01:06:20.460" style="s2">exercising or they started eating well</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.390" end="01:06:21.900" style="s2">or they started doing things that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.460" end="01:06:23.790" style="s2">actually felt that they had increased</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.900" end="01:06:26.460" style="s2">energy and motivation and capacity to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.790" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">that they they were just overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.460" end="01:06:33.360" style="s2">and daunting previously and so yeah my</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:34.530" style="s2">general recommendation we do the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.360" end="01:06:36.660" style="s2">foundational things first</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.530" end="01:06:38.130" style="s2">unless there&#39;s difficulty with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.660" end="01:06:39.270" style="s2">foundational things and you want to see</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.130" end="01:06:42.060" style="s2">if this is an experiment that can</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.270" end="01:06:44.850" style="s2">increase your capacity to do it yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.060" end="01:06:48.140" style="s2">sounds a bit like some of the effects of</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.850" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">a regular meditation practice where you</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.140" end="01:06:52.950" style="s2">certainly in my experience I end up</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:55.710" style="s2">finding that there&#39;s more sort of space</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.950" end="01:06:58.290" style="s2">and energy and capacity in myself to set</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.710" end="01:07:01.200" style="s2">about doing things that I want to do but</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.290" end="01:07:03.810" style="s2">usually provoke a kind of it feels like</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.200" end="01:07:08.700" style="s2">fear I think quite often the onerous</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.810" end="01:07:11.280" style="s2">task or it&#39;s like the kind of paradox of</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.700" end="01:07:13.740" style="s2">procrastination in a way the thing the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.280" end="01:07:15.540" style="s2">is causing you so much stress and grief</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.740" end="01:07:17.760" style="s2">you keep looking in the other direction</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.540" end="01:07:19.560" style="s2">because it causes stress and grief and</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.760" end="01:07:21.780" style="s2">yet the only way to change that is to go</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.560" end="01:07:25.530" style="s2">and do the task it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.780" end="01:07:27.420" style="s2">obviously later instinct is this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.530" end="01:07:31.880" style="s2">related to that topic we&#39;re mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.420" end="01:07:31.880" style="s2">earlier about delayed gratification so</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:40.380" style="s2">there&#39;s the other side of that is facing</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.040" end="01:07:44.190" style="s2">difficult things now and in general the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.380" end="01:07:46.520" style="s2">degree to which we can put off ease full</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.190" end="01:07:50.100" style="s2">and pleasurable things till later and</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.520" end="01:07:52.710" style="s2">face more difficult things now we will</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.100" end="01:07:54.780" style="s2">have a more meaningful higher quality</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.710" end="01:07:56.220" style="s2">and actually more pleasurable life this</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.780" end="01:08:00.040" style="s2">is actually an important point let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.220" end="01:08:02.440" style="s2">let&#39;s touch on this one little show</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.040" end="01:08:06.730" style="s2">okay so I take the chocolate cake in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.440" end="01:08:09.250" style="s2">moment and I&#39;m getting a flood of</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.730" end="01:08:11.590" style="s2">dopamine Erick responds to take this oh</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.250" end="01:08:15.790" style="s2">good it feels awesome and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.590" end="01:08:19.720" style="s2">actually feeling myself increased</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.790" end="01:08:21.310" style="s2">inflammation or store body fat or have</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.720" end="01:08:22.450" style="s2">dysregulated blood sugar or whatever in</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.310" end="01:08:27.190" style="s2">the moment I&#39;m just feeling awesome</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.450" end="01:08:28.690" style="s2">right tasting this and so in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.190" end="01:08:32.080" style="s2">the chocolate cake is absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.690" end="01:08:34.000" style="s2">increasing my pleasure but it is doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.080" end="01:08:37.509" style="s2">those other things that I said and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.000" end="01:08:40.779" style="s2">it&#39;s going to if I&#39;m eating the</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.509" end="01:08:42.339" style="s2">chocolate cakes more often I will have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.779" end="01:08:45.100" style="s2">life with more inflammation more</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.339" end="01:08:48.160" style="s2">unstable blood sugar which means lower</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.100" end="01:08:50.200" style="s2">energy and mood issues and etc all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.160" end="01:08:51.759" style="s2">which will lead to a life that has less</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.200" end="01:08:54.910" style="s2">pleasure when you factor the entire</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.759" end="01:08:57.910" style="s2">cause and effect set right right and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.910" end="01:09:00.100" style="s2">because having shitty energy and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.910" end="01:09:02.500" style="s2">unstable mood and inflammation is less</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.100" end="01:09:05.970" style="s2">pleasure but then when your pleasure is</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.500" end="01:09:08.560" style="s2">low you and you&#39;re feeling really shitty</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.970" end="01:09:10.299" style="s2">then you crave anything that will make</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.560" end="01:09:12.130" style="s2">you feel better again in the moment so</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.299" end="01:09:17.200" style="s2">that that that&#39;s the addiction cycle</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.130" end="01:09:18.790" style="s2">right and so in blood sugar is a classic</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.200" end="01:09:20.470" style="s2">example you take something that spikes</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.790" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">your blood sugar you feel really good</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.470" end="01:09:23.740" style="s2">but then it also crashes your blood</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:26.200" style="s2">sugar then once your blood Sugar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.740" end="01:09:28.150" style="s2">crashed you&#39;re kind of desperate and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.200" end="01:09:30.220" style="s2">you will go for sugary things it will</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.150" end="01:09:32.410" style="s2">raise it again when have you eaten</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.220" end="01:09:33.549" style="s2">something that wasn&#39;t sugary earlier you</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.410" end="01:09:35.830" style="s2">would have never had your blood sugar</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.549" end="01:09:39.180" style="s2">crash in the first place and been stable</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.830" end="01:09:42.310" style="s2">so the addiction cycle is a cycle of</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.180" end="01:09:44.500" style="s2">hyper stimulus the dis regulates</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.310" end="01:09:49.120" style="s2">baseline that leads to more desire for</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.500" end="01:09:51.160" style="s2">hyper stimulus right yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.120" end="01:09:53.020" style="s2">possible to have some of that attitude</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.160" end="01:09:55.270" style="s2">towards exercise if you get on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.020" end="01:09:57.970" style="s2">exercise wagon but then that also can</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.270" end="01:09:59.980" style="s2">lead to an addiction the over exercise</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.970" end="01:10:03.090" style="s2">because you&#39;re getting your kick but</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.980" end="01:10:05.740" style="s2">probably still avoiding something</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.090" end="01:10:07.540" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ll get to that in a minute but</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.740" end="01:10:09.280" style="s2">let me tell the other part of this food</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.540" end="01:10:11.469" style="s2">analogy because then we&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.280" end="01:10:13.330" style="s2">relate it so</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.469" end="01:10:16.180" style="s2">let&#39;s say instead of the chocolate cake</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.330" end="01:10:18.070" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at eating a salad the salad</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.180" end="01:10:19.480" style="s2">is not gonna give me the same dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.070" end="01:10:23.410" style="s2">flood in the moment the chocolate cake</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.480" end="01:10:25.540" style="s2">did even if it&#39;s a good salad right for</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.410" end="01:10:31.080" style="s2">the fat sugar salt reasons we mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.540" end="01:10:35.680" style="s2">earlier and that said as I&#39;m doing the</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.080" end="01:10:37.960" style="s2">salads regularly I will have a body that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.680" end="01:10:40.090" style="s2">is more mobile that has more energy that</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.960" end="01:10:42.699" style="s2">has less fatigue that has less blood</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.090" end="01:10:45.010" style="s2">sugar crashes it has less excessive</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.699" end="01:10:48.580" style="s2">weight and that all translates to a body</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.010" end="01:10:52.210" style="s2">whose baseline pleasure is higher right</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.580" end="01:10:54.580" style="s2">and so the opposite of the addiction</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.210" end="01:10:56.830" style="s2">cycle is something that does not spike</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.580" end="01:11:00.340" style="s2">your pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.830" end="01:11:02.440" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t destabilize and</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.340" end="01:11:05.560" style="s2">decrease your baseline and that leads to</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.440" end="01:11:08.949" style="s2">slowly up regulating baseline and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.560" end="01:11:12.280" style="s2">here&#39;s the the difference addictive</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.949" end="01:11:13.960" style="s2">things spike your pleasure and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.280" end="01:11:17.110" style="s2">crash it and then it spikes then it</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.960" end="01:11:18.850" style="s2">crashes but the baseline lowers two</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.110" end="01:11:21.280" style="s2">things you both get more highs and lows</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.850" end="01:11:23.500" style="s2">and progressively more lows in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.280" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">addiction cycle in the healthy cycle</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.500" end="01:11:30.300" style="s2">with anything you get less extreme highs</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:33.070" style="s2">and lows and progressively more highs</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.300" end="01:11:34.960" style="s2">right that&#39;s a kind of difference in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.070" end="01:11:37.270" style="s2">relationship and so what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.960" end="01:11:38.920" style="s2">is while the addict is controlled by</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.270" end="01:11:42.370" style="s2">pleasure they actually have much less</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.920" end="01:11:46.590" style="s2">pleasure in their life right because the</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.370" end="01:11:51.580" style="s2">baseline is is very different right and</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.590" end="01:11:53.230" style="s2">so when we&#39;re talking about what is</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.580" end="01:11:54.610" style="s2">healthy we&#39;re actually also talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.230" end="01:12:00.160" style="s2">about what is more pleasurable</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.610" end="01:12:02.050" style="s2">now you mentioned exercise and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.160" end="01:12:06.910" style="s2">mentioned it as a addiction and also has</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.050" end="01:12:09.190" style="s2">an avoidance can someone exercise</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.910" end="01:12:10.630" style="s2">because they hate their body and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.190" end="01:12:12.460" style="s2">fat and disgusting and they need to</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.630" end="01:12:16.000" style="s2">exercise as almost like a form of</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.460" end="01:12:17.469" style="s2">bulimia right yeah totally I can eat and</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.000" end="01:12:21.340" style="s2">throw up or I can eat and then go</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.469" end="01:12:24.480" style="s2">exercise body hatred now</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.340" end="01:12:28.360" style="s2">is is that radically different than</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.480" end="01:12:30.070" style="s2">being grateful to be alive and get to</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.360" end="01:12:32.290" style="s2">create and have experience and that all</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.070" end="01:12:33.640" style="s2">of that only gets to happen because I</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.290" end="01:12:35.050" style="s2">have a body and so I want to take good</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.640" end="01:12:36.490" style="s2">care of this vessel that I&#39;m in yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.050" end="01:12:40.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a totally different motivation</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.490" end="01:12:42.250" style="s2">right and one of them happens after</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.170" end="01:12:44.170" style="s2">binging and one of them happens just</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.250" end="01:12:46.660" style="s2">because it&#39;s a good thing to do and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.170" end="01:12:48.370" style="s2">know and one might happen so that I can</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.660" end="01:12:50.850" style="s2">avoid feeling certain things and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.370" end="01:12:53.740" style="s2">other one is happening just to support</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.850" end="01:12:56.530" style="s2">feeling good in my body so the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.740" end="01:12:59.290" style="s2">motivation and how one relates to</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.530" end="01:13:01.750" style="s2">anything can determine sex can be</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.290" end="01:13:04.810" style="s2">addictive or it can be healthy and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.750" end="01:13:06.580" style="s2">healing meditation can be actually a way</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.810" end="01:13:09.970" style="s2">to avoid dealing with real in one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.580" end="01:13:13.120" style="s2">life yeah some people just get that and</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.970" end="01:13:16.120" style="s2">float tanks as well it can they can be</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.120" end="01:13:18.550" style="s2">incredibly powerful tools again tools or</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.120" end="01:13:20.830" style="s2">if you spend like 10 hours a day and a</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.550" end="01:13:24.760" style="s2">float tank what what exactly are you</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.830" end="01:13:31.710" style="s2">doing that for well I see so many people</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.760" end="01:13:34.630" style="s2">who will pray for world peace and not do</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.710" end="01:13:40.690" style="s2">anything that actually tangibly makes</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.630" end="01:13:45.940" style="s2">the world better and you know in a way</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.690" end="01:13:49.750" style="s2">that is worse than not doing because it</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.940" end="01:13:51.130" style="s2">if they didn&#39;t do it the pain of not</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.750" end="01:13:53.130" style="s2">contributing to what they cared about</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.130" end="01:13:57.490" style="s2">might make them find something actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.130" end="01:13:59.020" style="s2">you know tangible they could do but the</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.490" end="01:14:00.160" style="s2">reason they do that is because they</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.020" end="01:14:02.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the to do about</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.160" end="01:14:04.300" style="s2">climate change or about species</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.380" end="01:14:06.160" style="s2">extinction it&#39;s too painful and they</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.300" end="01:14:08.800" style="s2">can&#39;t do nothing and so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.160" end="01:14:14.100" style="s2">they feel like they can do but it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.800" end="01:14:18.120" style="s2">then importantly kind of a avoidance of</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.100" end="01:14:22.000" style="s2">something rain the bypass of something</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.120" end="01:14:24.100" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah there&#39;s I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.000" end="01:14:27.000" style="s2">when so individual motivation is</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.100" end="01:14:31.030" style="s2">important too but then we also have</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.000" end="01:14:33.480" style="s2">individual biology and I wondered even</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.030" end="01:14:35.139" style="s2">if you&#39;ve tried to create the most</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.480" end="01:14:37.949" style="s2">rounded</p>

<p begin="01:15:03.100" end="01:15:09.790" style="s2">when I end up in like the the late night</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.190" end="01:15:11.260" style="s2">is that something that can just an</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.330" end="01:15:20.530" style="s2">level all right that was a few different</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.530" end="01:15:23.080" style="s2">questions that I heard one is an is</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.530" end="01:15:25.000" style="s2">qualia appropriate for everyone or do we</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.080" end="01:15:27.580" style="s2">need personalized chemistry and then are</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.000" end="01:15:30.550" style="s2">there things that we can&#39;t change with</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.580" end="01:15:32.800" style="s2">our physiology and that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.550" end="01:15:34.270" style="s2">personalized so on the topic of</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.800" end="01:15:36.010" style="s2">personalization first with word equality</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.270" end="01:15:38.170" style="s2">its quality of the right chemistry for</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.010" end="01:15:40.239" style="s2">everyone totally not it was the best</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.170" end="01:15:42.880" style="s2">that we could do at making something</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.239" end="01:15:45.400" style="s2">that worked for worked well for the most</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.880" end="01:15:46.840" style="s2">people interested in that thing and it</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.400" end="01:15:49.690" style="s2">was actually much better than I thought</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.840" end="01:15:52.150" style="s2">we&#39;d be able to do because you know my</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.690" end="01:15:54.360" style="s2">background and starting to explore it</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.150" end="01:15:59.409" style="s2">was based on full personalization so</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.360" end="01:16:02.800" style="s2">working in integrative medical clinics</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.409" end="01:16:06.090" style="s2">with you know different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.800" end="01:16:07.330" style="s2">innovative doctors helping design</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.090" end="01:16:08.889" style="s2">customized</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.330" end="01:16:11.949" style="s2">chemistry and neural chemistry support</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.889" end="01:16:15.070" style="s2">but we got to actually see people&#39;s labs</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.949" end="01:16:17.380" style="s2">see their qejy have the medical history</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.070" end="01:16:19.480" style="s2">and and so I got to see how much we</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.380" end="01:16:21.369" style="s2">could actually help people feel</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.480" end="01:16:22.900" style="s2">radically better not just in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.369" end="01:16:26.290" style="s2">cognitive enhancement but in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.900" end="01:16:30.820" style="s2">their psychological being and yeah all</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.290" end="01:16:35.590" style="s2">that I wasn&#39;t sure what we would be able</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.820" end="01:16:36.670" style="s2">to do without personalization and I was</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.590" end="01:16:37.600" style="s2">really curious because if there were</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.670" end="01:16:39.489" style="s2">things that we could do that were</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.600" end="01:16:40.719" style="s2">meaningful to wide audiences that</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.489" end="01:16:43.360" style="s2">obviously would allow us to bring</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.719" end="01:16:45.010" style="s2">support to a lot more people and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.360" end="01:16:46.260" style="s2">cost of the personalization work was so</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.010" end="01:16:47.369" style="s2">prohibitive</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.260" end="01:16:51.929" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.369" end="01:16:56.219" style="s2">so we were able to find that with there</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.929" end="01:16:58.679" style="s2">are certain axes that are so sensitive</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.219" end="01:17:01.920" style="s2">one person to the next or a different</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.679" end="01:17:04.560" style="s2">kind of genetic clusters different</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.920" end="01:17:05.880" style="s2">phenotypes that I just don&#39;t include</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.560" end="01:17:06.929" style="s2">them in quality of won&#39;t use them in any</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.880" end="01:17:09.420" style="s2">of our products so like for instance</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.929" end="01:17:12.719" style="s2">you&#39;ll see we don&#39;t have folic acid</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.420" end="01:17:14.969" style="s2">because whether you use folic acid or</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.719" end="01:17:18.780" style="s2">you use some version of methylated folic</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.969" end="01:17:20.520" style="s2">acid is there are so many people in each</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.780" end="01:17:23.909" style="s2">of the groups and it makes such a big</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.520" end="01:17:26.040" style="s2">difference whether they are over or</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.909" end="01:17:27.330" style="s2">under methylating on that particular</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.040" end="01:17:30.110" style="s2">axis that is just something without</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.330" end="01:17:32.909" style="s2">personalization I don&#39;t mess with</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.110" end="01:17:36.349" style="s2">because I because I couldn&#39;t actually do</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.909" end="01:17:39.119" style="s2">it for a wide audience effectively and</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.349" end="01:17:41.310" style="s2">so we work with axes that are pretty</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.119" end="01:17:42.810" style="s2">commonly supported by the same things</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.310" end="01:17:45.030" style="s2">for everybody the right krebs cycle</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.810" end="01:17:46.590" style="s2">intermediaries that up greg you late ATP</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.030" end="01:17:48.510" style="s2">production in that being pretty great</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.590" end="01:17:51.090" style="s2">for everybody and for the people that</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.510" end="01:17:52.530" style="s2">are seeking cognitive enhancement</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.090" end="01:17:54.119" style="s2">supporting their acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.530" end="01:17:56.580" style="s2">processing and supporting their</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.119" end="01:17:58.440" style="s2">dopaminergic processing and then also</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.580" end="01:18:00.869" style="s2">supporting neurogenesis and</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.440" end="01:18:04.800" style="s2">synaptogenesis ends up being pretty</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.869" end="01:18:06.599" style="s2">effective across the board and so those</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.800" end="01:18:09.179" style="s2">are the ones that we work with now there</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.599" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">are still you know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.179" end="01:18:15.710" style="s2">like 80% of the people that have tried</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:17.940" style="s2">quality of it had a good response and</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.710" end="01:18:20.400" style="s2">felt that it was meaningful for them and</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.940" end="01:18:23.820" style="s2">something like half of those that it was</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.400" end="01:18:26.659" style="s2">like life-changing the positive for and</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.820" end="01:18:31.199" style="s2">other ones it was just you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.659" end="01:18:32.790" style="s2">enhancing and then of the 20% that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.199" end="01:18:34.139" style="s2">have great experiences they&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.790" end="01:18:37.110" style="s2">knoll experience they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.139" end="01:18:38.969" style="s2">experience much of it yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.110" end="01:18:40.770" style="s2">usually either because they have sleep</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.969" end="01:18:42.900" style="s2">issues or digestive issues that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.770" end="01:18:43.739" style="s2">found in the tens of thousands of people</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.900" end="01:18:47.099" style="s2">that have used it and given those</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.739" end="01:18:49.469" style="s2">feedback so far and there are a few</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.099" end="01:18:52.679" style="s2">people that don&#39;t and neither of those</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.469" end="01:18:56.650" style="s2">are true and just not chemistry they</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.679" end="01:18:59.050" style="s2">need so</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.650" end="01:19:01.840" style="s2">where the person personalization is</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.050" end="01:19:05.170" style="s2">right for everybody no but a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.840" end="01:19:06.970" style="s2">people that&#39;s why we offer up you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.170" end="01:19:11.230" style="s2">people can try it if it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.970" end="01:19:12.940" style="s2">get your money back kind of thing now we</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.230" end="01:19:15.640" style="s2">are working on rolling out a doctor</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.940" end="01:19:17.140" style="s2">program right now where for people who</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.640" end="01:19:20.740" style="s2">either do have real medical issues that</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.140" end="01:19:22.090" style="s2">they want to address or real psychiatric</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.740" end="01:19:24.040" style="s2">issues because we&#39;re not treating we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.090" end="01:19:26.350" style="s2">not doing medicine we&#39;re just you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.040" end="01:19:27.820" style="s2">providing enhancement tools or they want</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.350" end="01:19:30.400" style="s2">to do enhancement that is customized</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.820" end="01:19:32.140" style="s2">that we have doctors trained in</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.400" end="01:19:35.500" style="s2">integrative medicine and the integrative</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.140" end="01:19:38.170" style="s2">neuropsych and we&#39;re bringing additional</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.500" end="01:19:40.930" style="s2">protocols to them that can actually help</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.170" end="01:19:43.030" style="s2">test people and do really good work so</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.930" end="01:19:45.280" style="s2">when you really good personalized work</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.030" end="01:19:47.530" style="s2">so when you&#39;re asking how do you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.280" end="01:19:50.890" style="s2">what good resources are we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.530" end="01:19:52.750" style="s2">curating doctors that really can do a</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.890" end="01:19:56.230" style="s2">good job of psychiatry and</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.750" end="01:19:58.120" style="s2">psychopharmacology both you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.230" end="01:20:02.890" style="s2">not just what we think of as psychiatry</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.120" end="01:20:04.300" style="s2">but neurochemical optimization and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.890" end="01:20:08.820" style="s2">would be cool in the meantime I would</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.300" end="01:20:12.670" style="s2">say if people are interested the</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.820" end="01:20:14.140" style="s2">integrative doctors it&#39;s it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.670" end="01:20:16.810" style="s2">because some of them are awesome and</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.140" end="01:20:18.520" style="s2">some of them are terrible but at least</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.810" end="01:20:21.370" style="s2">the integrative doctors are working on</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.520" end="01:20:25.810" style="s2">understanding personalization and root</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.370" end="01:20:29.080" style="s2">cause in a deeper way than just what med</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.810" end="01:20:31.570" style="s2">is going to be given for this symptom in</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.080" end="01:20:34.510" style="s2">general the Institute for functional</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.570" end="01:20:38.110" style="s2">medicine doctors seem to be getting</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.510" end="01:20:40.270" style="s2">pretty well trained but finding finding</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.110" end="01:20:42.550" style="s2">someone you actually like and resonate</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.270" end="01:20:46.620" style="s2">with who&#39;ll spend time and it seems</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.550" end="01:20:49.780" style="s2">knowledgeable is a is a valuable tool</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.620" end="01:20:51.340" style="s2">yeah next part I&#39;m sorry hon you gonna</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.780" end="01:20:52.390" style="s2">do you want to respond to that or do you</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.340" end="01:20:54.460" style="s2">want me to go on to the circadian</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.390" end="01:20:58.530" style="s2">rhythms partner oh I&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.460" end="01:20:58.530" style="s2">interested in this Acadian rhythms yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.610" end="01:21:05.250" style="s2">where people start Katie</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.420" end="01:21:09.480" style="s2">rhythms fixed or are they changeable</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.250" end="01:21:13.920" style="s2">different opinions on this there is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.480" end="01:21:13.920" style="s2">hypothesis that circadian rhythms are</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.370" end="01:21:24.130" style="s2">have a strong genetic component and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.440" end="01:21:26.080" style="s2">there are the morning larks the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.130" end="01:21:28.480" style="s2">normal people and the night owls and</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.080" end="01:21:31.360" style="s2">that you have give or take 70% of people</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.480" end="01:21:34.600" style="s2">who have a normal circadian rhythm that</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.360" end="01:21:38.140" style="s2">basically you know wakes in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.600" end="01:21:39.910" style="s2">morning of light and about 15% of the</p>

<p begin="01:21:41.320" end="01:21:45.090" style="s2">evolution and biology story is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.060" end="01:21:48.219" style="s2">there always had to be some people awake</p>

<p begin="01:21:56.290" end="01:22:01.590" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how solid that is I know</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.929" end="01:22:04.239" style="s2">there are some genes that are correlated</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.590" end="01:22:05.820" style="s2">but we all obviously also know people</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.239" end="01:22:08.199" style="s2">who were night I was when they were</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.820" end="01:22:09.550" style="s2">teenagers or in college and now they</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.199" end="01:22:14.350" style="s2">work a job where they wake up at 5:00</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.550" end="01:22:16.390" style="s2">a.m. every day most people can adapt</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.350" end="01:22:19.420" style="s2">their schedule fairly well most people</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.390" end="01:22:22.020" style="s2">also if they control artificial lighting</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.420" end="01:22:24.850" style="s2">and stimulants and exercise like that</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.020" end="01:22:29.290" style="s2">most people do better on earlier</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.850" end="01:22:31.510" style="s2">schedule than a later schedule no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.290" end="01:22:33.790" style="s2">saying that at 1:00 a.m. my time yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.510" end="01:22:37.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like ass to me when I hop off here</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.790" end="01:22:40.480" style="s2">I&#39;m hopping on to another meeting the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.480" end="01:22:43.030" style="s2">rules of thumb like that are really good</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.480" end="01:22:46.480" style="s2">starting places and then personal</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.030" end="01:22:48.160" style="s2">exploration is important because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.480" end="01:22:49.480" style="s2">had very early schedules and later</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.160" end="01:22:54.640" style="s2">schedules and I actually do better on</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.480" end="01:22:58.630" style="s2">later schedule and so it is valuable for</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.640" end="01:23:00.400" style="s2">people to explore what works best for</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.630" end="01:23:02.920" style="s2">them well part of the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.400" end="01:23:05.620" style="s2">question there is like it so it can be</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.920" end="01:23:08.380" style="s2">changed potentially maybe maybe not but</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.620" end="01:23:10.929" style="s2">also why why do we want to change it and</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.380" end="01:23:12.489" style="s2">I think that can be down to the the</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.929" end="01:23:14.590" style="s2">personal needs so if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.489" end="01:23:16.360" style="s2">relationship with someone</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.590" end="01:23:18.430" style="s2">I experienced this in the past y-you</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.360" end="01:23:22.270" style="s2">seem to be on the opposite timetables</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.430" end="01:23:24.790" style="s2">that can be remarkably destructive and</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.270" end="01:23:27.460" style="s2">can also seem to be a case that somebody</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.790" end="01:23:29.920" style="s2">has to compromise for somebody else so</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.460" end="01:23:32.380" style="s2">it can be much more personal as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.920" end="01:23:36.090" style="s2">to simply you know put the practical</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.380" end="01:23:42.070" style="s2">case of I need this kind of job</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.090" end="01:23:46.960" style="s2">ya can be that mmm it can be someone</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.070" end="01:23:50.100" style="s2">starts a spiritual practice where they</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.960" end="01:23:52.450" style="s2">are in a meditation group at 4 a.m. I</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.100" end="01:23:55.540" style="s2">think almost everybody when they have</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.450" end="01:23:59.110" style="s2">kids gets a different sort ad and rhythm</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.540" end="01:24:00.310" style="s2">than they had before because they are</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.110" end="01:24:04.810" style="s2">gonna wake up whatever time their kids</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.310" end="01:24:07.120" style="s2">come in so lots of lots of reasons there</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.810" end="01:24:12.190" style="s2">but I will say getting enough sleep is</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.120" end="01:24:14.370" style="s2">critical and in general also getting</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.190" end="01:24:19.090" style="s2">enough light during the day is critical</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.370" end="01:24:23.710" style="s2">and most people like I said do better if</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.090" end="01:24:27.430" style="s2">they&#39;re waking up with with sunlight so</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.710" end="01:24:29.020" style="s2">waking up in the dawn vicinity and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.430" end="01:24:30.850" style="s2">getting an earlier bed and a regular</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.020" end="01:24:33.070" style="s2">bedtime those are the general starting</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.850" end="01:24:37.240" style="s2">recommendations that any sleep expert</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.070" end="01:24:40.150" style="s2">will give you and and then like I said</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.240" end="01:24:42.850" style="s2">some percentage of the people will find</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.150" end="01:24:45.910" style="s2">that they do better or have personal</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.850" end="01:24:47.710" style="s2">reasons like you said to do otherwise so</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.910" end="01:24:49.450" style="s2">again we&#39;re back to the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.710" end="01:24:52.750" style="s2">sleep in and of itself and we also</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.450" end="01:24:56.320" style="s2">talked about how to get better nutrition</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.750" end="01:24:58.300" style="s2">into our bodies when it comes to the the</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.320" end="01:25:00.040" style="s2">other element that can make the</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.300" end="01:25:02.290" style="s2">difference to absorbing these things</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.040" end="01:25:04.930" style="s2">that was the the GI piece that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.290" end="01:25:08.740" style="s2">mentioned and for those possibly</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.930" end="01:25:10.960" style="s2">including me what are there some basic</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.740" end="01:25:13.420" style="s2">steps to get a sense of if there is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.960" end="01:25:16.630" style="s2">problem in the microbiome and what can</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.420" end="01:25:18.850" style="s2">be done short of going into a specialist</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.630" end="01:25:21.340" style="s2">lab which I think in most cases is not</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.850" end="01:25:24.900" style="s2">immediately available or affordable are</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.340" end="01:25:24.900" style="s2">there some steps that we can take</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.179" end="01:25:34.699" style="s2">yeah so for most people there are</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.340" end="01:25:37.290" style="s2">dietary things they can do that will</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.699" end="01:25:40.050" style="s2">help their gut if they notice that they</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.290" end="01:25:42.060" style="s2">are having GI symptoms they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.050" end="01:25:44.270" style="s2">gas or bloating or tenderness in their</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.060" end="01:25:49.290" style="s2">abdomen or constipation or diarrhea or</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.270" end="01:25:52.350" style="s2">upper GI issues acidity etc it gets</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.290" end="01:25:56.010" style="s2">complex and the you know the allopathic</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.350" end="01:25:58.650" style="s2">answer is to say you have IBD and which</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.010" end="01:26:01.620" style="s2">can&#39;t you so many things not that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.650" end="01:26:03.870" style="s2">not that descriptive or useful right be</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.620" end="01:26:05.820" style="s2">integrative approaches to the function</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.870" end="01:26:07.560" style="s2">medicine approaches to try and figure</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.820" end="01:26:10.610" style="s2">out what&#39;s going on and is it a food</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.560" end="01:26:14.340" style="s2">allergy is it dysbiosis as it actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.610" end="01:26:16.140" style="s2">pathogens bacteria parasite etcetera</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.340" end="01:26:18.210" style="s2">many of which even when they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.140" end="01:26:19.710" style="s2">that the tests have a lot of false</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.210" end="01:26:22.130" style="s2">negatives so it&#39;s kind of tricky to</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.710" end="01:26:22.130" style="s2">figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.429" end="01:26:29.270" style="s2">so the foundational things one can do</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.659" end="01:26:31.530" style="s2">someone can do an elimination diet and</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.270" end="01:26:34.469" style="s2">you can read online at how to do an</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.530" end="01:26:36.750" style="s2">elimination diet where you eliminate the</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.469" end="01:26:39.960" style="s2">foods that people commonly react to so</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.750" end="01:26:47.489" style="s2">you eliminate the gluten grains the</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.960" end="01:26:49.050" style="s2">dairy the soy corn and sugar and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.489" end="01:26:50.300" style="s2">know but different people react to</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.050" end="01:26:51.989" style="s2">different things so when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.300" end="01:26:54.690" style="s2">elimination diets there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.989" end="01:26:56.760" style="s2">things you can eliminate and then after</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.690" end="01:26:58.620" style="s2">you know some period of time off of them</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.760" end="01:27:00.449" style="s2">see do their symptoms get better if so</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.620" end="01:27:02.429" style="s2">then reintroduce the foods one at a time</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.449" end="01:27:04.050" style="s2">see which one kicks the symptoms on and</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.429" end="01:27:06.600" style="s2">you start to get some insight this is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.050" end="01:27:09.600" style="s2">way people can experiment on their own</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.600" end="01:27:10.890" style="s2">with what foods your bothersome the ones</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.600" end="01:27:13.290" style="s2">I mentioned are ones that are</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.890" end="01:27:17.730" style="s2">classically bothersome for a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.290" end="01:27:20.400" style="s2">people and there are people who have bad</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.730" end="01:27:25.260" style="s2">GI reactions to plants to have leptin</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.400" end="01:27:30.190" style="s2">sensitivities but you know the gluten</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.260" end="01:27:33.910" style="s2">thing is obviously a very heated</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.190" end="01:27:37.750" style="s2">controversial difficult topic for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.910" end="01:27:40.719" style="s2">most part the gluten sensitivity the</p>

<p begin="01:27:40.719" end="01:27:47.830" style="s2">marketing ploy and/or like a some weird</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.940" end="01:27:52.690" style="s2">fad it is largely the result of Ubiquiti</p>

<p begin="01:27:54.520" end="01:27:59.680" style="s2">associated dynamic there&#39;s a law we</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.940" end="01:28:02.440" style="s2">could get into there and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.680" end="01:28:04.449" style="s2">of books that are critiquing grains and</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.440" end="01:28:06.719" style="s2">why there are problems with grains the</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.449" end="01:28:10.540" style="s2">paleo world is pretty big into this</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.719" end="01:28:13.120" style="s2">where people can study further but there</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.540" end="01:28:14.860" style="s2">are also a lot of people who leave the</p>

<p begin="01:28:14.860" end="01:28:18.370" style="s2">eat bread and pasta when they&#39;re in many</p>

<p begin="01:28:40.390" end="01:28:45.640" style="s2">is not overeating it&#39;s kind of a major</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.449" end="01:28:46.989" style="s2">step people are gonna have GI issues if</p>

<p begin="01:30:30.909" end="01:30:35.850" style="s2">in particular it&#39;s usually quite helpful</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.860" end="01:30:38.350" style="s2">and you can take it with a probiotic and</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.850" end="01:30:39.940" style="s2">probiotics are tricky this is also one</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.350" end="01:30:42.429" style="s2">that you can personalize you can do an</p>

<p begin="01:30:51.010" end="01:30:59.230" style="s2">which be super useful so I won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.330" end="01:31:02.110" style="s2">into specific brands of probiotics but</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.230" end="01:31:06.639" style="s2">there there are ones that can be quite</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.110" end="01:31:08.050" style="s2">meaningful yeah there&#39;s a kind of taking</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.639" end="01:31:09.760" style="s2">a lot of mental notes there and took a</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.050" end="01:31:12.670" style="s2">swig of water whilst you were talking as</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.760" end="01:31:15.840" style="s2">well has a lot of things to think about</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.670" end="01:31:18.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s I guess something to emphasize</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.840" end="01:31:21.520" style="s2">people listening that it&#39;s not just I</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.880" end="01:31:25.119" style="s2">think a lot of nootropics are sort of in</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.520" end="01:31:27.850" style="s2">terms of being for the mind and yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.119" end="01:31:29.739" style="s2">really this connection this intimate</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.850" end="01:31:31.750" style="s2">relationship between the mind and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.739" end="01:31:34.570" style="s2">body and more and more it seems that</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.750" end="01:31:38.469" style="s2">mental health issues such as depression</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.570" end="01:31:39.820" style="s2">can be caused or exacerbated by the</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.469" end="01:31:42.429" style="s2">things that are happening in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.820" end="01:31:44.110" style="s2">microbiome and in the physical body I</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.429" end="01:31:45.460" style="s2">guess we know at the superficial level</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.110" end="01:31:47.800" style="s2">if you go and do some exercise you</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.460" end="01:31:50.590" style="s2">probably feel better mentally and</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.800" end="01:31:53.349" style="s2">emotionally but when we talk about diets</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.590" end="01:31:56.170" style="s2">and so on I think not everyone is making</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.349" end="01:31:59.560" style="s2">the the connection that there is a can</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.170" end="01:32:00.790" style="s2">in between these things okay right</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.560" end="01:32:01.840" style="s2">before we have done I was talking to a</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.790" end="01:32:06.880" style="s2">friend who&#39;s just starting her first</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.840" end="01:32:09.040" style="s2">business and she was asking me if I</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.880" end="01:32:10.300" style="s2">would tell her just exactly what to do a</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.040" end="01:32:13.330" style="s2">checklist for how to sort of business</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.300" end="01:32:15.310" style="s2">and I said this is not the mindset</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.330" end="01:32:17.170" style="s2">there&#39;s not the appropriate mindset to</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.310" end="01:32:18.370" style="s2">sort of business is that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.170" end="01:32:20.500" style="s2">appropriate mindset to be an employee</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.370" end="01:32:22.450" style="s2">which you&#39;ve always been which is will</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.500" end="01:32:24.640" style="s2">someone else tell me what to do and all</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.450" end="01:32:27.340" style="s2">and I&#39;ll just do it right which is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.640" end="01:32:30.160" style="s2">mindset that our parents and school and</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.340" end="01:32:31.450" style="s2">religion trained us well to do but if</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.160" end="01:32:33.190" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna run your own business then</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.450" end="01:32:33.820" style="s2">you actually have to figure out what the</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.190" end="01:32:35.350" style="s2"> to do</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.820" end="01:32:38.200" style="s2">you have to figure out what is relevant</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.350" end="01:32:41.130" style="s2">what&#39;s needed does it make sense and</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.200" end="01:32:43.630" style="s2">ultimately you&#39;re responsible for what</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.130" end="01:32:46.090" style="s2">if your business fails because of</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.630" end="01:32:47.890" style="s2">something your employees did it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.090" end="01:32:49.240" style="s2">your business that failed you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.890" end="01:32:52.390" style="s2">the one that hired those employees that</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.240" end="01:32:56.920" style="s2">train them and manage them that you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.390" end="01:32:58.660" style="s2">whatever it was and so and if your</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.920" end="01:33:01.300" style="s2">business succeeds it&#39;s ultimately yours</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.660" end="01:33:04.570" style="s2">right so the that the responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.300" end="01:33:09.790" style="s2">well even more so when it comes to your</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.570" end="01:33:11.020" style="s2">own health and when you if you coming</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.790" end="01:33:12.490" style="s2">back to the beginning when you we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.020" end="01:33:17.680" style="s2">talking about empowered responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.490" end="01:33:19.840" style="s2">in health every single experience that</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.680" end="01:33:22.060" style="s2">we are going to have in this life is</p>

<p begin="01:33:27.970" end="01:33:35.530" style="s2">people and making love and staring a</p>

<p begin="01:33:35.530" end="01:33:38.830" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to do is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.820" end="01:33:41.350" style="s2">mediated through our physiology and how</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.830" end="01:33:44.650" style="s2">long it lasts and how vital it is and</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.350" end="01:33:50.200" style="s2">how cognitively clear we are how</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.650" end="01:33:53.860" style="s2">emotionally clear we are is it is all</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.200" end="01:33:57.220" style="s2">related to the bio hardware that our</p>

<p begin="01:34:07.599" end="01:34:11.949" style="s2">like of all the things that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.099" end="01:34:14.020" style="s2">should become an expert in learning how</p>

<p begin="01:34:23.530" end="01:34:27.310" style="s2">I guess because we all have one we take</p>

<p begin="01:38:47.469" end="01:38:51.040" style="s2">what I like the what you&#39;re emphasizing</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.940" end="01:38:53.800" style="s2">which is that if we begin from the</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.040" end="01:38:55.389" style="s2">premise of how can we find the best</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.800" end="01:38:57.340" style="s2">thing that includes all of these</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.389" end="01:38:59.409" style="s2">elements rather than thinking I just</p>
