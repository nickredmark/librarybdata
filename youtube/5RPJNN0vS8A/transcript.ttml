<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">claremont review of books which</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">is published by my grad school thesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">advisor charles kessler</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">or publishes edited by i should say and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">with whom i have been writing in its</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">entire</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">run print run and i never had an article</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">rejected</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">and i said i want to write the piece</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">saying trump should be the nominee this</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">is before votes are cast</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">you know the the case for trump he</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">should be the nominee</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">and charles said uh interesting send it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">in so i wrote it it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">as long as like a typical crb article</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">from me 5000 words like that i sent it</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">and unusually it took about a month</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">for him to get back to me and then and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">then said we&#39;re not gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">and i thought hmm that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">disappointing so another guy i knew had</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">had a similar experience where he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">written for a magazine</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">not a not a pro-trump piece but just an</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">explanation of trump</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">but but because it wasn&#39;t anti-trump it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">sounded pro-trump right</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">he published that he followed up with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">really serious analysis of trump through</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">the lens of managerialism which is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">idea from james burnham&#39;s book from 1946</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">the managerial revolution which is on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">shelf back there somewhere i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">um and the same magazine rejected that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">so he and i happened to be at a dinner</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">one night</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">complaining saying these conservative</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">magazines are lame</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">they won&#39;t take any you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">the usual nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">and he the next day founds a blog called</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:51.199" style="s2">the journal of american greatness</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">and the anchor pieces of jag were my</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.199" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">rejected piece from crb and his rejected</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">piece from the weekly standard</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">and from there we blogged for about four</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">months we picked up a couple you know we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">had some other people in on it and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">was a small group of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">and it got so big so fast that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">we all had a day job and most of us if</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">not all of us had day jobs whom</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">if they knew we were pseudonymously</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">blogging in favor of trump would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">been displeased</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">and so once peggy noonan wrote about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">in the wall street journal</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">the group consensus was take it down so</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">he took it down</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">and then wait what did she say that made</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">you guys she wrote about it no it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">favorable but it just</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">it shot the traffic on the thing up so</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:35.919" style="s2">and it was you know it was sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">power line and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.919" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">it&#39;s climbing and it&#39;s climbing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">climbing then it gets in the wall street</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">journal and it just goes right up</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">gotcha and that&#39;s when everybody went</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:04.319" style="s2">invited to a dinner</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">a book dinner for someone who wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.319" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">basically a kind of a pro-trump book on</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">your zoning this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">it&#39;s frank buckley he&#39;s a professor at</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">the scalia law school here in northern</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">and it seemed like a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">around the table it&#39;s like 15 people at</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:19.759" style="s2">this dinner</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">a lot of people around the table they</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.759" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">knew what jag was and they knew that i</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">was one of the guys behind it but there</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">was just a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">agreement not to mention it right</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">because i was supposed to be hidden</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">and i appreciate it and i talked to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">frank and he said you know i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">work on the transition and you have this</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">and then i&#39;m kind of quietly involved in</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">the transition</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">you know leave aside the flight 93</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.400" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">and then there was and then trump</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">surprisingly wins the election</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">all this work on the transition over the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">summer</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">and then going into the fall campaign</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">like i got they made some changes and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">got frozen out</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">and i thought oh oh well whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">then right after</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">trump wins they came in and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">immediately fired all the guys that had</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">replaced the people i knew and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">put pence at the head of the transition</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">and a bunch of people i didn&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">all of a sudden i was back in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">right poof i&#39;m in the transition again</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">start helping them do work on things and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">ended up getting that job i mean even</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">that was in a way a fluke</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">i didn&#39;t expect it to happen but i got</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">it and so i went in</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">with the administration at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">mike flynn hired me</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">and uh i was with mike flynn for what 24</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">days until he got</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:53.120" style="s2">shamefully railroaded out of there by</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">that corrupt process that&#39;s still going</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.120" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">on and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">and unjustly torturing him yeah let&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:07:59.120" style="s2">couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">we drill down on that for a second what</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.120" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">is your take on the real reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">that flynn got ousted</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">i think the best take is i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">two things</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">so my reason and i believe both these</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">reasons i&#39;m just going to state them</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">one doesn&#39;t want my original reason the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">other one is andy mccarthy&#39;s reason but</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">i think andy&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">my reason is part of it it was revenge</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">from the deep state for all the ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.280" end="00:08:22.879" style="s2">that flynn had tortured them</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">especially in the obama administration</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.879" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">told them things that they didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">to hear</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">was on the right side of things when</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">they weren&#39;t and made them look bad when</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">he was proved right and they just were</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">they hate i mean remember barack obama</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">said one of the few things he said to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">in the oval office at that famous</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">meeting after the election</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">a few days after the election is you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">can&#39;t trust mike flynn he&#39;s he named</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:44.959" style="s2">mike flynn to the to the president-elect</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">and said you shouldn&#39;t hire that guy</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.959" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">the president of course didn&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">and what were those things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">what were those things that he was right</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">on that they were wrong about i have</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">some ideas but i&#39;m interested to hear</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">your take</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">it was mainly the iran deal stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">was a big part of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:02.959" style="s2">um you know flynn was saying they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">lying about this they&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.959" end="00:09:06.000" style="s2">you&#39;re giving them credit for</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">you know having refrained from x and y</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.000" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">and z and it&#39;s all it&#39;s all a sham and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to put this over on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">american people</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">and some of it&#39;s just threat assessments</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">of stuff going on in the middle east</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">and and you know and some of it had to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">do with</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">i used to remember this more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">because i remember one of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">things that got me the job with flynn</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:25.839" style="s2">as i went into that job interview the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">most prepared i&#39;d ever been in my life</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">and so if you want to hear this like i</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.920" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">worked out this kind of role</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">over you know a couple of weeks that i</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">was going to do and then the person who</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">had accepted the job that i was</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">had angled for had to withdraw and then</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">putting you in that box</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">consider just get back to your earlier</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">question the other reason i want to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">rid of him which is important</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">mccarthy is the one who fleshed this</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">theory out i think he&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">is they realized they were only going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">get away with the russia hoax</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">they had to get rid of flynn because he</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">understood how the intelligence process</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">worked how the dia worked out all this</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:48.079" style="s2">stuff worked</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">and if he was there he would have caught</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">them he would have warned the president</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">i think that&#39;s reasonable i i also think</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s reasonable that uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">flynn might have been one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:01.519" style="s2">perfectly suited people to work with</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">trump would you consider</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">uh flynn to be our kind of woke</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">much your listeners will care about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">and they&#39;ll probably call me a neocon</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">for it which is fine i&#39;ve been called</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:37.040" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">um the one thing that i got done that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.040" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">would not have gotten done otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">is the obama you know when the when the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">raid on bin laden&#39;s compound happened</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.920" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">um they gathered up a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.519" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">intelligence all of which was analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">very little of which by the time the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">obama administration was over very very</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">little of that was put out</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">even though everything exploitable about</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">it you know had been</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">and so they just decided they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">going to put it out and the reason they</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to put it out is because it</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">showed that they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">they were basically lying about a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.079" style="s2">stuff and i got in there and i had some</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">i&#39;d known the issues and i was like i</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">want to make it a priority to get this</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">and i started talking early on to people</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">and finally i just went up to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">pompeo in the sit room one day you know</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">like there&#39;s no reason not to put this</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">out if there&#39;s something in there that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:26.959" style="s2">you have to redact redact it that&#39;s fine</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">only reason the obama people didn&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">it out is because</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">it showed how disingenuous they were</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">and finally you know we shook that loose</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that would have happened</p>

<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">overall the relationship kind of got off</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">to a rocky start and it never became</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">what trump had with flynn</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">forged over the course of the campaign</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:46.399" style="s2">you know he called mcmaster at one point</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">and mcmaster was around for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">after that and in the meetings and doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">his job</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">and the president was very gracious</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">toward him uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">during all that time and i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">decided i was gonna leave and several</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:02.079" style="s2">people in the white house</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">a decent chance that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">i won&#39;t be able to so um</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">basically i found out the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">day before</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">that i was just gonna get summarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">fired</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">in the morning by john bolton who i you</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">know looked me in the eye the friday</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">before and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">let&#39;s just say at least misled me and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">misled sarah when she asked him if he</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">was going to make changes and he said no</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">and she said in particular i need</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">michael anton and he said i only have</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">this small</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">front office staff that i&#39;m bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m not going to be making any other</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">changes and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">and at this point you know i was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">of agnostic to slightly favorable on</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">john bolton</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:02.160" style="s2">i thought i think he&#39;s too hawkish for</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">the president but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">a very um staunch defender of american</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:08.320" style="s2">sovereignty against creeping</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">internationalism</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">uh you know unilateralism these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of places where</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">they clearly align and there are places</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:16.240" style="s2">where they don&#39;t align</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">but he&#39;s also a master bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.240" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">infighter whom i saw</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">in the bush administration and i saw how</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">he knows how to work the levers of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">bureaucratic power</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">and that was a talent that the trump</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">administration at that time and i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">still to this day</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:30.720" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t entirely lack but it it lacks</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:31.679" style="s2">relative to other republican</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.720" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">administrations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.679" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">very hard to get something done in</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">washington especially as a republican</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know how to play that grand</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">pipe organ that is the federal</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">bureaucracy and he knew how</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">he knows how so i thought you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">i certainly had no personal animus</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">for him i do now</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">but that&#39;s his fault and he he sought</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">that and he got he got what he asked for</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">so i resigned to the president that</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">cook on the line at the state dinner and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">he looked at me like i was crazy i just</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">got this look any five minutes like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:15.919" style="s2">and i kind of tell him the story and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">he&#39;s still looking at me and he goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.919" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">yeah i mean okay fine come in and cook</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">like what it just took him a while to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">process the weirdness of the request</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:25.600" style="s2">yeah that is that&#39;s a good anecdote i</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">like that but</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">all in all it just sort of seems like</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">what could have been uh with flynn</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">and you in the white house doing work</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">for at least one term uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">what could have been in that regard it</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:39.039" style="s2">might have been yeah and i got a</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">statement shout out to kt mcfarland who</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.039" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">was a really good deputy</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">and brandon ran a tight dc and also</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:48.320" style="s2">really got trump in a way i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">another regret that i have is a number</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.320" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">tried to persuade mcmaster to keep kt</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:56.960" style="s2">because we thought first of all she was</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">good and second of all</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.960" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">she had the kind of relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">trump that he didn&#39;t have and probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">was never gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">and said you know she&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">in in many ways but in one one of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">ways will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">as a kind of medium between you and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">president and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">he just had this thought that like no no</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">you know he&#39;s i&#39;m an officer i got to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">pick my own exo and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">so i i think you know he</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">who knows mcmaster might have survived</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">longer had he had he kept kt around</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">never know fascinating well we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">to see how that all</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">plays out when we look back in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">history books but let&#39;s move on a little</p>

<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">professor so he wasn&#39;t actively teaching</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">but</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">almost every day for three years and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">charles kessler who&#39;s still on the</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">and i&#39;ve always been affiliated with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">since then well</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">i had the pleasure of speaking with ryan</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">williams for a while we did a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">uh several months ago and in talking to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">him and just sort of observing things</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">um and in reading your book it does seem</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s been sort of a transition</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">or there&#39;s one in the works at claremont</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">uh is that something you can speak to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">like yeah i get this a lot i actually i</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">had this conversation with somebody the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:45.200" style="s2">other day</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">and just again today where</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.200" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">you know people say you guys have</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">changed or you pre anton have changed</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">where the institute has changed</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">and i said no i don&#39;t maybe maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">terms of emphasis tone</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">tactics right but i can build my</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">entire case for whatever it is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">talking about for trump</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">for this new book within the four walls</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.880" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">that i learned from harry java i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">consider myself to have departed from</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">jaffa&#39;s teaching or claremont orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">whatever that is one iota</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">now joppa himself could be imprudent in</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">um in the moment political judgment so</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">for instance in 1994 my first year in</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">claremont there was a ballot initiative</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">in california called proposition 187</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">the simple made a simple point that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">are not going to give welfare benefits</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">to illegal aliens emergency room care</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">you know but like public assistance</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:35.919" style="s2">welfare no</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">and this was a ballot initiative it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.919" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">passed 60 40. so it&#39;s overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">positively received of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:43.679" style="s2">immediately invalidated by a federal</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">even weirder for them</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:42.320" style="s2">yeah i had bronze age pervert on the</p>

<p begin="00:28:42.320" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">review so we had plenty to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">talk about that uh and i i would say</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">maybe it is for you i think i find a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">of bronze age perverts writing echoed</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">i mean not specific not directly but i</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">see similarities in some of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">that you raised especially you know this</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">strong focus on the elites and his bug</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">and and near the end of the book you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">start talking about the need for</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">uh sort of an updated masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">carving out space for</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">for for boys to be rough and to fight</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">and learn trades and shoot and study the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">great works which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">basically the exact same prescription</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:23.039" style="s2">uh at the end of bronze age pervert as</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">well but</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.039" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">i think it&#39;s just uh kudos to you for</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">taking that on kudos to claremont for</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">publishing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">uh kicking off that dialogue that went</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">around with yarvin and you and others as</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">well i thought that was fantastic and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">and that to me is sort of the angle on</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">the the claremont evolution that i</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">that i was looking at yeah i mean at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">end this is what i said in my review</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">at the end of the day i&#39;m still a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">claremont guy which means i&#39;m still with</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">the founders</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">and and i found it impossible</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">that i mean he only responded to me one</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">time and i found it impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">pin back down on this question of</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">equality right so is</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">equality has come to be a swear word</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">on the right or at least for certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">people on the right who think it just</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:12.159" style="s2">leads to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:12.720" style="s2">leveling it just leads to the neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.159" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.720" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">and you know drugging everybody out and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">seeing them on the cow all of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:21.279" style="s2">and you know the way i was taught it uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">by jaffa by tom west by charles kessler</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.279" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">and by the founders themselves by</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">reading their books</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">you know it equality properly understood</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">by the american founders leaves all</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">kinds of room for human excellence</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:35.840" style="s2">and flourishing and also requires</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">certain virtues that they absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.840" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">admit are not evenly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">throughout the human population</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">is everybody courageous is everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">equally courageous for instance</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:46.399" style="s2">obviously not you but you cannot fight</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">and win an american revolution without</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.399" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">courageous men and courageous men are</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">sort of in this baptian</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">spirit in a certain way but i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">find any</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">you know i i didn&#39;t pin back down on</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">this question and i don&#39;t know what his</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:58.399" style="s2">ultimate answer is but i think his</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">ultimate answer at the end of the day is</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.399" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">that all men are not created equal</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">right whereas my my ultimate answer at</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">the end of the day is in the decisive</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">sense in which the founders meant it all</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.200" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">men are still created equal</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">and that is that&#39;s a philosophic gap</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">that i don&#39;t think he and i will ever be</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">able to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">honestly i feel like you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">talking past each other on that subject</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">as a matter of fact i think you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">see things the same way</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">just sort of discussing uh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">debating the intent of the text</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">at the time yeah and and rather</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">than uh this notion of are people</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">different no he strongly</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">he strongly believes that as well you</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">know i tried to get that across in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">review that i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">um a lot of him a lot of his deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">outrages are just sort of two-by-fours</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">to the to the cranium</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">rhetoric like you know i i teach i i</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">teach machiavelli and i&#39;ve studied my</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">valley more than i&#39;ve studied any other</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">political philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">and he really smacks you with a lead</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">pipe frequently with</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">outrageous things that if he meant them</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">completely seriously you&#39;d have to just</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:56.480" style="s2">conclude this is an evil man</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:57.919" style="s2">right maybe he means it kind of in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.480" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">certain way and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.919" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">gave a playful interpret i thought it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">was a playful interpretation of baptist</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">endorsement of piracy</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.799" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">seeing how he would respond to that um</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know he seems to me from</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">what i</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">have seen of his writings elsewhere to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">be sort of all in on piracy</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">and my response to that is i really got</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">kicked in the teeth by a lot of his fans</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">when i said this in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">response to his response like like</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">piracy like really</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:25.760" style="s2">because eventually it you know we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:26.640" style="s2">get to this this is a theme of my book</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.760" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">right which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">yeah whatever you want to call it the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">neoliberal order the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">international order the current</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">arrangement you know uh woke capital all</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">of these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">i call it neoliberalism just because</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of a word everybody</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">become a common usage if the if the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">oligarchs who run it can&#39;t keep it going</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">then and then it crashes what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:48.880" style="s2">and i have some ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">what may come next and perhaps some</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.880" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">ideas about what ought to come next</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:55.039" style="s2">and you know pirates in fortresses on</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">the edge of the world doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">seems to me to be kind of comic book-y</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">and also not the basis for a sound</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">political order going forward which</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:04.399" style="s2">means you know either that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:05.120" style="s2">joking about that for a rhetorical</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.399" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">effect or he</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.120" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">and i just don&#39;t sort of see the future</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.720" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">the same way i don&#39;t i don&#39;t honestly</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think he answered it because i</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">don&#39;t think he wanted to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">probably i see parallels in that with</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">your discussion at the city state which</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get to uh that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:22.640" style="s2">the possible outcomes there but um</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">that was a good time i appreciate you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">doing that really sincerely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">i think it&#39;s good for i think it was</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">and the newer guard who may not see</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">things exactly the same way</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">but clearly i see the problems that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">the main point of reviewing the book was</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">to say look</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">we used to be able to reach 25 year old</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">21 year olds and 25 year olds with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:51.679" style="s2">certain message in say 1980 or 19</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">even up to 1995 that hits with a thud</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.679" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">it hit and you know those of us in our</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">50s and 60s who</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">are still preaching the old-time</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">conservative religion we could be right</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">in every particular but at a minimum we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">have to admit that our rhetorical</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">is failing and come up with something</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">else and i wasn&#39;t saying copy this guy i</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">would say you need to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">that this is a hit it&#39;s the same way</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">like if you&#39;re trying to produce movies</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:13.839" style="s2">or records and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">popular in your target audience right</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">you&#39;re going to fail right it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.399" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">what&#39;s going to work uh it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">matter it doesn&#39;t even matter if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">not the specific thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.679" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">trying to copy you at least need to know</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">what it says and have some sense of why</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s popular</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know that you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">get anywhere that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">fundamentally why i wrote the review it</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:37.119" style="s2">wasn&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">you know it was it was for my generation</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.119" end="00:34:40.320" style="s2">and older</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">right it was for me the people it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.320" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">from my generation and for the people</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.000" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">who taught us</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">i was trying to bring them news that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have had</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">noble i&#39;m trying to do the same here i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">not sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">half of my audience may be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">your work but they will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">moving forward one last question about</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">claremont</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.079" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">and rhetoric uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">strauss leo strauss has written about uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">how the philosopher must write in order</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">politicians um is what influence did</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">that have on you in writing this book</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">how between the eyes are you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">it refers to i mean it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:22.079" style="s2">strauss&#39;s great themes but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">the book in which he treats this</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.079" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">thematically at the greatest length is</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">called persecution and the art of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">writing</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">and this theory is known as esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">writing and it&#39;s the thing for which</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">strauss was</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:36.800" style="s2">the most ridiculed in his lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:38.400" style="s2">uh and still straussians are ridiculed</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.800" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">for it and his basic point is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.400" end="00:35:41.440" style="s2">he uses the metaphor of reading reading</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">between the lines</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:46.960" style="s2">right um sorry turned this off that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">lamb line for you kids out there</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">i know i know i know um it&#39;s come it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">been it&#39;s been a godsend in the past</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">couple of days because uh i&#39;ve done so</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">much radio and it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">way better on the landline all um right</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">fundamentally you write for two audi an</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">esoteric writer writes for two audiences</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a surface which everybody reads</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a depth which only the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">few</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">can tease out um and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">so your question to me is to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">do i do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">um i mean it&#39;s self-defeat if i let me</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">if i did it it&#39;s it defeats the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">of esotericism to admit that you did</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">in some cases there are examples of</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">esoteric books that say at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:27.280" style="s2">this is an esoteric book but then they</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">don&#39;t tell you how</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">so maimonides guide of the perplexed</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">the book is sealed with seven seals</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">montesquieu at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">spirit of the laws says it may look like</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">this has no</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">design or order but there&#39;s a design and</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">a structure there and if you find that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">you will find</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">the intent of the author but then he</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tell you what it is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">find it right</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">and there are other types of esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">books that just</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">seem to be complete like my</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">maybe my favorite apart from machiavelli</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:56.640" style="s2">is xenophon who</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">also writes in greek i was a student of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:00.000" style="s2">socrates and a contemporary of plato</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">interestingly apparently they hated each</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">um plato thought that xenophon was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">dumb brute</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">kind of a big dumb jock and xenophon</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">thought plato was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">wordy snob this is according to diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">lyricist uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.839" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">both of them probably had a point um but</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">xenophon writes in this very simple kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">c-spot run greek you know just like so</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">simple that for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">people thought this can&#39;t possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">profound because</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just too spare and too basic but</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">strauss sort of revived the study of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">xenophon by showing ah no you if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:35.920" style="s2">read it super carefully you&#39;ll realize</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">they&#39;re all these hidden debts so i</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.920" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">guess you could say there&#39;s two ways to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">do esotericism you know one is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:41.040" style="s2">announce upfront that you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">but then leave to the reader to figure</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.040" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">out how you did it</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">and another is just to pretend you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t do it at all</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">all right we will leave it at that uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.079" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">let&#39;s get into the book guys the book</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">so there&#39;s so many things wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">the whole first chapter</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:15.359" style="s2">i call it um there&#39;s a famous anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">about oliver cromwell you know the man</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:17.920" style="s2">who cut off</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">think it was 14 years</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.400" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">um is it to his official painter he said</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">paint me warts and all and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">we get the phrase warts and all right</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">give me the full accurate portrait well</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">my portrait of california in chapter one</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">of the book is definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">an emphasis on the warts i admit that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:40.640" style="s2">the good stuff exists you know yosemite</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">valley</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.640" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">and san francisco bay and disneyland and</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">mostly now living in california is warts</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">i think if you actually have to live</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">work and pay taxes there and deal with</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">the commuting</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">and the infrastructure and the services</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">that first chapter and it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">wonder just</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">all of this wokeness coming</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.000" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">and deliberate dividing of people and</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">we should be surprised it&#39;s happening</p>

<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">don&#39;t think people have really</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">quite thought this through i think their</p>

<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">um they just try to find people who they</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">say adhere to it and therefore those are</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">the bad guys</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.440" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">stuff has to be thought through</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">and i&#39;d rather provoke a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">to write back at me that i was wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">was terrible but it forced them to start</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">then just leave these questions out</p>

<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">more unsavory people in the coalition</p>

<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:58.720" style="s2">zeroed down and been able to succinctly</p>

<p begin="00:59:00.559" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">would say that i suffer from false</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.920" end="00:59:05.119" style="s2">consciousness or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:06.720" style="s2">right oh you can&#39;t claim that but you i</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.119" end="00:59:08.559" style="s2">can claim garibaldi</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:10.079" style="s2">even though i wasn&#39;t born in italy i</p>

<p begin="00:59:10.079" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">teach myself to read italian so that i</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:15.440" style="s2">could learn machiavelli</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">and i love visiting italy it&#39;s great</p>

<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">now if if you know my life went sideways</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:27.200" style="s2">in some way and i had to flee</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:28.799" style="s2">right but you only there were places you</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.200" end="00:59:30.839" style="s2">could end up um</p>

<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things like the wine</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.200" end="00:59:35.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things i like about it</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.200" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">like that that kind of persistent</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">and the other the other point too that i</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.640" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">would make so again</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">i i feel only loyal to america i feel</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.839" end="00:59:57.760" style="s2">i guess yes there&#39;s something um</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.079" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">irrational about that in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.760" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">but i&#39;d have to say why like</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">just because somebody was born in italy</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">you know does that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.559" end="01:00:09.839" style="s2">legitimize being say proud of</p>

<p begin="01:00:12.960" end="01:00:18.880" style="s2">because my dna doesn&#39;t trace to 1776</p>

<p begin="01:00:18.880" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of weird argument</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:24.799" style="s2">that i i don&#39;t get that i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:26.240" style="s2">adds up i don&#39;t think i&#39;m stating this</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.799" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">precisely but what they want to say is</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.240" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">well you&#39;re you&#39;re an alien well</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">i guess then everybody isn&#39;t i mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.920" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">if you go in that direction you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:36.079" style="s2">feeding into the left wing line of</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:37.599" style="s2">thought which is that america is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:39.040" style="s2">illegitimate right so if we all have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:41.599" style="s2">be ethno-nationalists</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.040" end="01:00:42.960" style="s2">well then um what&#39;s so magical about</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.599" end="01:00:43.680" style="s2">getting you know getting on a boat from</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.960" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">you&#39;re coming to</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.680" end="01:00:47.200" style="s2">america but those people are okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:48.319" style="s2">because they&#39;re with the american well</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.200" end="01:00:49.040" style="s2">why did you leave it why aren&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.319" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">english</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.040" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">right well i&#39;m i&#39;m mayflower stock so i</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">can be american but you can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">you your ancestors came later</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:00:57.760" style="s2">right well why you then that means</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.240" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">you&#39;re english you should be loyal to</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.760" end="01:01:00.799" style="s2">that not to this</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:02.880" style="s2">there only is america because a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">people came here and made america</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.880" end="01:01:06.880" style="s2">okay and we the reason why this confuses</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.880" end="01:01:13.119" style="s2">is because you know we saw it happen</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:15.040" style="s2">in in in in the modern age when</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.119" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">there were much more complete records</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.040" end="01:01:18.000" style="s2">and so on i could ask the same question</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">about so what makes a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.000" end="01:01:20.799" style="s2">when does an english person become an</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.200" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">english person right there&#39;s britons on</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.799" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">the british isle</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">then the romans come then they</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:27.200" style="s2">intermarry are we are we english yet</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">why does it why are why are the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:30.960" style="s2">anglo-saxons called anglo-saxons saxony</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:32.079" style="s2">is in germany it&#39;s because a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.960" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">people from northern europe come over</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.079" end="01:01:34.960" style="s2">and struggle</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">are they english then you get the norman</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.960" end="01:01:39.280" style="s2">conquest in 1066.</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:40.480" style="s2">are we have we gotten there yet now from</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.280" end="01:01:42.960" style="s2">that point on</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.480" end="01:01:44.960" style="s2">until the mass migrations following</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.960" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">world war ii the english population was</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.960" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">very very stable</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s basically the same there was no</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">almost zero net immigration</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">and you know a little bit here and there</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">but very very very stable</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.640" end="01:01:59.359" style="s2">but but englishness somehow is banged</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.599" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">together over the course of</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.359" end="01:02:04.960" style="s2">a thousand years um without</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.200" end="01:02:06.960" style="s2">an obvious migratory movement that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.960" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">get from northern europe to the united</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.960" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">you know to the north american continent</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">the founding in the united states and of</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">without a signing ceremony this is what</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:16.160" style="s2">confuses people so they think like</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">um well that&#39;s the natural way to do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.160" end="01:02:19.280" style="s2">well if that&#39;s the natural way to do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:20.400" style="s2">and the only way to do it in this way is</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.280" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">illegitimate then you&#39;ve sort of bought</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.400" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">the left-wing argument that no that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.680" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">there shouldn&#39;t be an american no one</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2">from europe should ever come to america</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:27.680" style="s2">right if if your ethnic status is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:30.240" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.680" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">then then both the puritans and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.240" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">cavaliers they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:34.160" style="s2">they&#39;re just english and they should</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">never have left right and the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.160" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">thing that bothers me that i find</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:39.520" style="s2">inc consistent about this argument is</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:42.559" style="s2">people say no no</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.520" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">um the tradition is the only thing we</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.559" end="01:02:46.640" style="s2">have to get back to tradition</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:48.079" style="s2">all right fair enough i&#39;m not against</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.640" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">tradition i&#39;m actually pro tradition</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.079" end="01:02:51.200" style="s2">in a lot of ways if it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.200" end="01:02:53.520" style="s2">but then that gets you into the whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:54.720" style="s2">philosophical question of how do you</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.520" end="01:02:56.480" style="s2">evaluate tradition you have to have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.720" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">philosophical framework right</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.480" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">plato and aristotle would say because</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:01.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea of the good and i can</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.200" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">evaluate anything in the light of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.440" end="01:03:05.039" style="s2">just because it&#39;s old doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">good necessarily but all right</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.039" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">or bad or bad mystery yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:13.200" style="s2">um uh well we have to get back to</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:15.680" style="s2">tradition okay well the american</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.200" end="01:03:17.280" style="s2">tradition is fighting the revolution</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.680" end="01:03:18.640" style="s2">the american tradition is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.280" end="01:03:20.000" style="s2">declaration of independence the american</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.640" end="01:03:21.280" style="s2">tradition is the constitution and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.000" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">northwest ordinance and the bill of</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.280" end="01:03:23.520" style="s2">rights</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">and all of these things so in the name</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.520" end="01:03:25.920" style="s2">of tradition are we supposed to reject</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.119" end="01:03:27.839" style="s2">our tradition</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.920" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">we&#39;re americans we&#39;re for tradition but</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.839" end="01:03:31.039" style="s2">my god we really do hate the revolution</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">which gave birth to this country</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.039" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">and we really do hate the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">charters of our liberties which are too</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:36.799" style="s2">abstract and enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:38.079" style="s2">you know we&#39;re supposed to so what</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">tradition are we supposed to go back to</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.079" end="01:03:42.720" style="s2">some medieval tradition</p>

<p begin="01:08:43.920" end="01:08:47.120" style="s2">uh it has a veneer of democracy because</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.600" end="01:08:48.480" style="s2">we hold elections every four years for</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.120" end="01:08:50.400" style="s2">president every six percent</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.480" end="01:08:51.679" style="s2">but the the elections fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.400" end="01:08:53.440" style="s2">don&#39;t change things</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.679" end="01:08:54.880" style="s2">trump&#39;s election changed more than any</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.440" end="01:08:56.480" style="s2">election in the past</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:08:58.159" style="s2">probably two generations at least one</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.480" end="01:09:00.640" style="s2">generation but</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.159" end="01:09:02.400" style="s2">it&#39;s also demonstrated the uh difficult</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.640" end="01:09:04.080" style="s2">extent to which</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:05.679" style="s2">or the extent which is very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.080" end="01:09:06.799" style="s2">for someone from outside the system who</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.679" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">ran against the system and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.799" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">fighting the system to change it from</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">the inside</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:14.000" style="s2">um the power that the bureaucracy and</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:15.440" style="s2">all these other power centers have is</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.000" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">just so overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.440" end="01:09:18.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s really hard to get them to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:19.679" style="s2">what you wanted to do as i sort of made</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.880" end="01:09:21.040" style="s2">this point about</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.679" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">when i was talking about bolton earlier</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.040" end="01:09:26.080" style="s2">you know he was good at getting the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:26.640" style="s2">the national security bureaucracy to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.080" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.640" end="01:09:30.799" style="s2">he wanted it to do um you know whether</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:32.080" style="s2">whether what he wanted in a given moment</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.799" end="01:09:32.960" style="s2">is something we should all desire is</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.080" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">another question</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.960" end="01:09:39.120" style="s2">uh so</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:41.440" style="s2">it&#39;s we&#39;re moving toward a kind of just</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.120" end="01:09:43.839" style="s2">managerial</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.440" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">state where people don&#39;t have much of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.839" end="01:09:47.600" style="s2">say it would be one thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:48.880" style="s2">you know liberty is uncommon throughout</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.600" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">human history and it would be one thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.880" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">not to have liberty but to have a state</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:52.960" style="s2">that was ruling for the mostly for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:55.040" style="s2">common good</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.960" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">and that left you alone or that actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.040" end="01:09:58.000" style="s2">helped you but</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.320" end="01:10:00.480" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve increasingly have a state</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.000" end="01:10:01.840" style="s2">that and i i just got to be completely</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:03.360" style="s2">clear that i&#39;m not blaming any of this</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.840" end="01:10:04.960" style="s2">on donald trump</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.360" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">no this is the regime donald trump</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.960" end="01:10:07.840" style="s2">inherited when he became president and</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">that he&#39;s been pushing back against and</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.840" end="01:10:12.239" style="s2">continues to push back against</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:13.920" style="s2">but that it&#39;s that you know as one man</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.239" end="01:10:14.960" style="s2">with a limited number of allies in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.920" end="01:10:17.120" style="s2">federal government</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.960" end="01:10:18.480" style="s2">on a bureaucracy and it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.120" end="01:10:19.199" style="s2">government he has to face the entire</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.480" end="01:10:20.880" style="s2">federal government</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.199" end="01:10:22.880" style="s2">and every other power center in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.880" end="01:10:24.800" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.880" end="01:10:26.080" style="s2">it increasingly doesn&#39;t rule and have</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.800" end="01:10:27.520" style="s2">for a long time hasn&#39;t ruled for the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.080" end="01:10:28.400" style="s2">common good it rules for the private</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.520" end="01:10:30.640" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.400" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">of a handful of people and institutions</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.640" end="01:10:35.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s also increasingly vindictive</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">and getting more so 2020 has</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.280" end="01:10:38.400" style="s2">demonstrated that and</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:40.080" style="s2">i really worry the direction the</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.400" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">democratic party and the left has taken</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.080" end="01:10:42.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:44.400" style="s2">if and when they retake power they will</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.880" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">be even</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.400" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">more vindictive um</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.880" end="01:10:52.560" style="s2">the rhetoric and the actions that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.040" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">seen out of a lot of these people this</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.560" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">year they&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">as i wrote the book you know i i wrote</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:10:58.800" style="s2">several passages about left-wing</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">vindictiveness</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:01.920" style="s2">in this book and in my last book this</p>

<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:10.840" style="s2">kind of crisis if you want to understand</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.000" end="01:11:15.040" style="s2">claremontism in one lesson by that</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.840" end="01:11:16.320" style="s2">um i as i wrote i thought i understood</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.040" end="01:11:17.600" style="s2">the motivations of the left but as i</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.320" end="01:11:18.000" style="s2">tried to explain it i thought wow this</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.600" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">sounds</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.000" end="01:11:21.120" style="s2">really harsh no one&#39;s going to believe</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:23.679" style="s2">that they&#39;re this bad</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.120" end="01:11:24.239" style="s2">in a way 2020 kind of uh helped me out</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.679" end="01:11:25.520" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.239" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">they just came out and ripped the mask</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:29.600" style="s2">and said we&#39;re this bad</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:30.719" style="s2">if anything anton didn&#39;t go far enough</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.600" end="01:11:32.640" style="s2">in describing how</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.719" end="01:11:34.960" style="s2">fundamentally malevolent and hateful we</p>

<p begin="01:12:06.800" end="01:12:11.679" style="s2">they&#39;ve just had the self-discipline and</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.520" end="01:12:14.320" style="s2">maybe the self-knowledge to know</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.679" end="01:12:15.920" style="s2">that you know we can&#39;t we can&#39;t show our</p>

<p begin="01:12:19.360" end="01:12:23.760" style="s2">once the dam broke in 2020 they</p>

<p begin="01:12:26.800" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">keep it under control or base barely</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.280" end="01:12:31.760" style="s2">under control because if they scream you</p>

<p begin="01:12:31.760" end="01:12:35.280" style="s2">and then finally they just snap one day</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.520" end="01:12:37.840" style="s2">and then they let it all out i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.280" end="01:12:40.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened to 2020.</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.840" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">do you do you think that uh there well</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.880" end="01:12:44.159" style="s2">we didn&#39;t get we didn&#39;t get through all</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.239" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">the various elements of america&#39;s regime</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.159" end="01:12:48.320" style="s2">today but</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:49.360" style="s2">there is a revolutionary feel of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.320" end="01:12:51.120" style="s2">happening right now an</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.360" end="01:12:52.719" style="s2">insurgency right like a weird</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.120" end="01:12:54.640" style="s2">revolutionary feel though because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.719" end="01:12:57.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a friend of mine said this i</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.640" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">think he&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.280" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">others have compared it to the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:04.239" style="s2">revolution now it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:06.560" style="s2">66 to 76. um</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.239" end="01:13:08.000" style="s2">but that is more precise than most</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.560" end="01:13:10.159" style="s2">people who say it realized because what</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.000" end="01:13:13.600" style="s2">the cultural revolution was it wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.159" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">anti-regime revolution it regime</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.600" end="01:13:20.000" style="s2">using its worst and most</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:22.080" style="s2">psychopathic elements to punish those</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.000" end="01:13:24.239" style="s2">elements of the society that hadn&#39;t gone</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.080" end="01:13:25.760" style="s2">along enough with the program so we are</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:27.440" style="s2">going through a kind of revolution but</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.760" end="01:13:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the french revolution</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.440" end="01:13:30.960" style="s2">where the old order above is toppled</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.000" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">from below</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.960" end="01:13:35.280" style="s2">this is the top using the bottom to</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.280" end="01:13:39.360" style="s2">attack the middle which it finds its</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:41.760" style="s2">continued existence uh and a front</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.360" end="01:13:42.400" style="s2">so the revolution is against the middle</p>

<p begin="01:15:46.800" end="01:15:52.560" style="s2">so to me it is the state using its own</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:55.199" style="s2">power to try to beat us into submission</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.560" end="01:15:56.960" style="s2">and uh you know trump has been fighting</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.199" end="01:15:59.199" style="s2">uh an insurgency</p>

<p begin="01:15:59.199" end="01:16:02.239" style="s2">within the government itself which</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.640" end="01:16:03.440" style="s2">existed within the bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.239" end="01:16:05.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s hard enough to get anything</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.440" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">done when you&#39;re a noob anyway but when</p>

<p begin="01:16:09.040" end="01:16:13.280" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the lens in which i see</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.719" end="01:16:15.920" style="s2">the revolution which is ironic</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.280" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">given that you know we&#39;re people that</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.920" end="01:16:18.640" style="s2">support the founding and the founding</p>

<p begin="01:16:18.640" end="01:16:23.360" style="s2">all the values laid out there how are</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.199" end="01:16:25.040" style="s2">how are we the insurgents</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.360" end="01:16:26.719" style="s2">you know uh how how are we the</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.040" end="01:16:28.320" style="s2">insurgents in this scenario when we</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.719" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">actually are the ones carrying the</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.320" end="01:16:32.719" style="s2">flag of the nation the regime has been</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:36.000" style="s2">effectively replaced</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.719" end="01:16:37.760" style="s2">yeah you know the it was a</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.000" end="01:16:40.400" style="s2">it was a slow process i guess you could</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.760" end="01:16:40.400" style="s2">say i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.040" end="01:16:44.560" style="s2">was it 50 years was it 30 years but the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.960" end="01:16:46.239" style="s2">regime was effectively replaced i would</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.560" end="01:16:48.719" style="s2">urge your readers all to also to check</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.239" end="01:16:50.800" style="s2">out chris caldwell&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.719" end="01:16:52.239" style="s2">the age of entitlement it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.800" end="01:16:53.600" style="s2">bad title because it doesn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.239" end="01:16:57.600" style="s2">reveal what&#39;s inside the book</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.600" end="01:17:00.080" style="s2">but his main thesis is that um</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.600" end="01:17:01.520" style="s2">the 1964 civil rights act and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.080" end="01:17:03.360" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.520" end="01:17:04.800" style="s2">and all the enabling legislation and all</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.360" end="01:17:05.679" style="s2">the stuff and the decrees and things</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.800" end="01:17:07.440" style="s2">that came over</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.679" end="01:17:09.760" style="s2">are a de facto second constitution</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.440" end="01:17:12.480" style="s2">that&#39;s replaced the first constitution</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.760" end="01:17:15.120" style="s2">and that all of the elites hue to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.480" end="01:17:17.120" style="s2">second and ignore or despise the first</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:18.960" style="s2">and so the insurgency is being fought by</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.120" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">people on behalf of the fir in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.960" end="01:17:23.280" style="s2">on behalf of the first constitution</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.880" end="01:17:26.080" style="s2">but from a position of of weakness of</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.280" end="01:17:26.080" style="s2">relative weakness</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.400" end="01:17:30.400" style="s2">indeed and in fact you know as reading</p>

<p begin="01:17:30.400" end="01:17:33.760" style="s2">and just seeing it&#39;s established</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.840" end="01:17:35.120" style="s2">competing systems of justice right and</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.760" end="01:17:37.600" style="s2">this is this is like one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.120" end="01:17:40.719" style="s2">fundamental schisms that we have is</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.600" end="01:17:41.280" style="s2">you know competing notions of justice is</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.719" end="01:17:43.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.280" end="01:17:45.199" style="s2">a theme that you you know support and</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.760" end="01:17:46.320" style="s2">carry on i mean you did reference called</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.199" end="01:17:49.360" style="s2">well quite a bit in the book</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.320" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">i i i i definitely</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.360" end="01:17:53.600" style="s2">um push that notion competing notions of</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">justice but i put it a little</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.600" end="01:17:56.480" style="s2">differently i just say look this is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:17:58.159" style="s2">design of the american government</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.480" end="01:17:59.520" style="s2">this is how it&#39;s supposed to work this</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.159" end="01:18:01.040" style="s2">is the fundamental basis of</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.520" end="01:18:02.719" style="s2">political legitimacy as the founders</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.040" end="01:18:05.040" style="s2">understood it and of</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.719" end="01:18:05.760" style="s2">uh you know the moral dignity of</p>

<p begin="01:18:09.120" end="01:18:11.840" style="s2">and this is the way we&#39;re governed now</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.320" end="01:18:12.159" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t look anything like that i</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.840" end="01:18:15.360" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.159" end="01:18:18.480" style="s2">in in many ways it&#39;s the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.360" end="01:18:20.320" style="s2">and well go ahead what are the what are</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.480" end="01:18:21.199" style="s2">the the tools of this regime that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:23:48.400" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">know if it can&#39;t go on forever it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.960" end="01:23:54.239" style="s2">right your job as a corporation is to</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.880" end="01:23:55.840" style="s2">make money which means you need to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.239" end="01:23:57.600" style="s2">focused on the core mission and on the</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.840" end="01:24:00.840" style="s2">bottom line and all of these things</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.600" end="01:24:03.199" style="s2">so you know how long how long can woke</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.840" end="01:24:04.480" style="s2">capital keep the stuff going if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.199" end="01:24:05.920" style="s2">not focused on the core mission if</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.480" end="01:24:07.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not focused on basic competence</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.920" end="01:24:09.120" style="s2">if they&#39;re not focused on what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.120" end="01:24:11.760" style="s2">there to do and i&#39;m making money</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.120" end="01:24:14.239" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know um you never want to bet</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.760" end="01:24:15.920" style="s2">against these guys</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.239" end="01:24:17.440" style="s2">look at how much they&#39;ve managed to</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.920" end="01:24:19.360" style="s2">accomplish for themselves how much power</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.440" end="01:24:22.320" style="s2">they&#39;ve managed to accrue</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.360" end="01:24:22.960" style="s2">already but i just have to think an</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.320" end="01:24:26.320" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.960" end="01:24:27.920" style="s2">this um wacky</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.320" end="01:24:30.000" style="s2">this hasn&#39;t happened before i you know i</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.920" end="01:24:31.360" style="s2">know something about history you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.000" end="01:24:33.120" style="s2">you know i try to look back trying to</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.360" end="01:24:35.120" style="s2">think of a time when like the all the</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.120" end="01:24:37.440" style="s2">major centers of the economy</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.120" end="01:24:39.280" style="s2">were not merely focused on something</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.440" end="01:24:41.120" style="s2">other than their core mission but</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.280" end="01:24:43.280" style="s2">we&#39;re focused on things that</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.120" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">legitimately tear at the social fabric</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.280" end="01:24:45.920" style="s2">on a daily basis</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:49.600" style="s2">and how long can that possibly last for</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.920" end="01:24:49.600" style="s2">them and for the society itself</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.760" end="01:24:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just hard to imagine that this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.280" end="01:24:57.040" style="s2">like a truly new order of the ages that</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.960" end="01:24:58.560" style="s2">can last a couple centuries or longer</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.040" end="01:25:00.320" style="s2">i mean i wonder if it can last a couple</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.560" end="01:25:03.840" style="s2">decades or longer well</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.320" end="01:25:07.600" style="s2">i think it lasts as long as the</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.840" end="01:25:09.840" style="s2">government in power is not focusing on</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.600" end="01:25:11.679" style="s2">antitrust so i think that i i believe</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.840" end="01:25:13.040" style="s2">that this is this is like anti-trust</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.679" end="01:25:14.719" style="s2">play it&#39;s an alignment</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.040" end="01:25:16.880" style="s2">to diminish the power of the federal</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.719" end="01:25:17.840" style="s2">government deliver to legitimize the</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.880" end="01:25:19.040" style="s2">federal government</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.840" end="01:25:20.800" style="s2">and therefore the corporations are</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.040" end="01:25:22.400" style="s2">aligned with the black lives matter</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.800" end="01:25:23.679" style="s2">activists and antifa</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.400" end="01:25:26.000" style="s2">because they both want to see</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.679" end="01:25:28.639" style="s2">diminishment of federal power and</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.000" end="01:25:29.199" style="s2">and authority and and whatever um and</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.639" end="01:25:31.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.199" end="01:25:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s working out for them at this point</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.360" end="01:25:34.800" style="s2">so until those</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.880" end="01:25:36.239" style="s2">there are reasons to doubt that too in</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.800" end="01:25:36.719" style="s2">that there are so many ways that federal</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.239" end="01:25:39.840" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.719" end="01:25:41.199" style="s2">serves big corporations that uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.840" end="01:25:43.440" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been able to essentially</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.199" end="01:25:46.159" style="s2">co-opt federal power and use it</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.440" end="01:25:47.760" style="s2">to you know how much foreign policy is</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.159" end="01:25:49.040" style="s2">conducted essentially to serve corporate</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.760" end="01:25:49.920" style="s2">interests now so do they want to see</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.040" end="01:25:50.960" style="s2">federal power</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.920" end="01:25:53.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the federal government</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.960" end="01:25:55.280" style="s2">ever barely think of instances where the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.679" end="01:25:57.679" style="s2">federal government of its own accord</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.280" end="01:25:58.480" style="s2">without being forced to by the president</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.679" end="01:26:01.040" style="s2">does anything</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.480" end="01:26:01.520" style="s2">against corporate power but the other</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.040" end="01:26:04.080" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.520" end="01:26:05.679" style="s2">the simpler question for me is you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.080" end="01:26:08.320" style="s2">so i worked at a bank</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.679" end="01:26:09.760" style="s2">right the essence of banking is you loan</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.320" end="01:26:11.440" style="s2">somebody money</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.760" end="01:26:12.800" style="s2">you loan a company or somebody money at</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.440" end="01:26:14.800" style="s2">a certain rate of interest because you</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.800" end="01:26:16.400" style="s2">think you will</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.800" end="01:26:17.840" style="s2">make a profit off that interest he will</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.400" end="01:26:19.440" style="s2">invest the money and spend it wisely and</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.840" end="01:26:20.800" style="s2">be able to pay it back with the interest</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.440" end="01:26:22.560" style="s2">and to do that you have to do very</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.800" end="01:26:23.920" style="s2">careful risk assessment and analysis of</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.560" end="01:26:24.719" style="s2">the company or whatever you&#39;re loaning</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.920" end="01:26:26.000" style="s2">to and</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.719" end="01:26:27.120" style="s2">knowing that a certain percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.000" end="01:26:28.560" style="s2">your loans are going to go bad and</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.120" end="01:26:30.320" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get your money back</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.560" end="01:26:32.159" style="s2">you bake that into your overall</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.320" end="01:26:34.800" style="s2">assessment and as long as</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.159" end="01:26:36.320" style="s2">you know you have a you win more than</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.800" end="01:26:36.719" style="s2">you lose or you win sufficiently more</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.320" end="01:26:39.360" style="s2">than you</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.719" end="01:26:40.320" style="s2">you make money if everything becomes</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.360" end="01:26:42.400" style="s2">about wokeness</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.320" end="01:26:43.440" style="s2">and not about again the core mission how</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.400" end="01:26:44.719" style="s2">long are these firms going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.440" end="01:26:46.000" style="s2">make money it doesn&#39;t matter what their</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.719" end="01:26:46.960" style="s2">relationship with the federal government</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.000" end="01:26:48.239" style="s2">is at that point</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.960" end="01:26:49.440" style="s2">they&#39;ll just crash because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.239" end="01:26:50.000" style="s2">know what they&#39;re doing anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.440" end="01:26:51.840" style="s2">like if</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.000" end="01:26:53.760" style="s2">i run a restaurant and i&#39;m cooking very</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.840" end="01:26:54.800" style="s2">well people are coming in and then i</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.760" end="01:26:56.239" style="s2">decide</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.800" end="01:26:58.480" style="s2">everything is going to be about social</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.239" end="01:26:59.920" style="s2">justice in this restaurant everything</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.480" end="01:27:03.440" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be the wokest restaurant</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.920" end="01:27:05.920" style="s2">in the world and the food starts to suck</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.440" end="01:27:06.639" style="s2">and those waiters are terrible and you</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.920" end="01:27:08.560" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.639" end="01:27:10.320" style="s2">you you wait 30 minutes for your</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.560" end="01:27:11.360" style="s2">appetizer and it&#39;s lame or they bring</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.320" end="01:27:13.440" style="s2">you the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.360" end="01:27:14.560" style="s2">and so on after a while you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.440" end="01:27:16.400" style="s2">aren&#39;t you gonna go out of business i</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.560" end="01:27:18.239" style="s2">mean do the laws of gravity somehow no</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.400" end="01:27:21.760" style="s2">longer apply i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.239" end="01:27:23.360" style="s2">i just don&#39;t i find it</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.760" end="01:27:24.800" style="s2">hard to believe that they can keep this</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.360" end="01:27:26.639" style="s2">going indefinitely</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.800" end="01:27:28.960" style="s2">yeah when i say diminishment of federal</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.639" end="01:27:30.400" style="s2">power with respect to the corporations i</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.960" end="01:27:32.320" style="s2">mean sort of like the co-opting of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.400" end="01:27:34.880" style="s2">federal power for their own interest</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.320" end="01:27:35.600" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely happened yeah and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.880" end="01:27:38.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.600" end="01:27:40.320" style="s2">it it a weaker federal government</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.000" end="01:27:42.239" style="s2">benefits both black lives matter and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.320" end="01:27:44.080" style="s2">corporations in that regard and</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.239" end="01:27:45.360" style="s2">uh to listeners you know you guys know</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.080" end="01:27:47.199" style="s2">i&#39;ve recommended matt stoller&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.360" end="01:27:49.199" style="s2">goliath you should check that out</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.199" end="01:27:50.960" style="s2">uh really lays out the way that both</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.199" end="01:27:53.040" style="s2">parties have come together and supported</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.960" end="01:27:54.719" style="s2">the neo-liberal world order</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.040" end="01:27:57.199" style="s2">and served the corporations at the</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.719" end="01:27:58.159" style="s2">expense of the middle class matt stoller</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.199" end="01:28:00.080" style="s2">somebody i think</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.159" end="01:28:03.120" style="s2">if you haven&#39;t talked to him he you and</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.080" end="01:28:06.320" style="s2">he echo a lot of the similar things and</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.120" end="01:28:08.320" style="s2">uh he he i think is somebody who is is</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.320" end="01:28:10.960" style="s2">very disappointed with the democrats</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.320" end="01:28:12.719" style="s2">um and is is looking to make changes and</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.960" end="01:28:15.600" style="s2">saying a lot of the same things</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.719" end="01:28:16.000" style="s2">that we&#39;re saying um moving on a little</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.600" end="01:28:19.760" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.000" end="01:28:23.040" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about immigration</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.760" end="01:28:24.000" style="s2">briefly yeah that&#39;s a fairly long</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.040" end="01:28:26.239" style="s2">chapter look it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.000" end="01:28:27.360" style="s2">i wrote two years ago in the washington</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.239" end="01:28:28.719" style="s2">post an op-ed</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.360" end="01:28:31.040" style="s2">i wrote two and they&#39;ll never ever</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.719" end="01:28:32.159" style="s2">publish me again um but</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.040" end="01:28:34.080" style="s2">the first one was just saying why do we</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.159" end="01:28:36.480" style="s2">need more people and this is like</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.080" end="01:28:38.480" style="s2">instead of a an 800 word why do we need</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.480" end="01:28:39.600" style="s2">more people this is like 20 000 words on</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.480" end="01:28:41.920" style="s2">why we don&#39;t need more people</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.600" end="01:28:43.199" style="s2">but to me so i take the founder&#39;s point</p>

<p begin="01:29:56.000" end="01:30:01.920" style="s2">well since 1965 so 55 years and with</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.440" end="01:30:04.320" style="s2">very very high unemployment especially</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.920" end="01:30:05.600" style="s2">and with a a labor market that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.320" end="01:30:07.840" style="s2">beaten down in part by</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.600" end="01:30:09.199" style="s2">high immigration since at least since</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.840" end="01:30:13.040" style="s2">the early 70s</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.199" end="01:30:15.440" style="s2">uh wage stagnation and so on um</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.040" end="01:30:16.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t need just the united states for</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.440" end="01:30:19.120" style="s2">a million reasons</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.960" end="01:30:20.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need more people right now and</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.120" end="01:30:23.360" style="s2">we can revisit that later</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.880" end="01:30:23.920" style="s2">as a country as a citizen body later and</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.360" end="01:30:25.600" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.920" end="01:30:27.520" style="s2">all right maybe we need more people in</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.600" end="01:30:28.400" style="s2">year x or y or whatever but i think</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.520" end="01:30:30.880" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.400" end="01:30:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;s plainly obvious to me that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.880" end="01:30:35.280" style="s2">it&#39;s plainly obviously</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.400" end="01:30:36.880" style="s2">insane to take in a million i mean that</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.280" end="01:30:37.199" style="s2">numbers are down under trump but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.880" end="01:30:39.199" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.199" end="01:30:41.040" style="s2">high much higher than they need to be to</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.199" end="01:30:43.280" style="s2">keep taking in people when</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.040" end="01:30:45.360" style="s2">we you know we had i think unemployment</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.280" end="01:30:48.480" style="s2">peaked during the covey year at</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.360" end="01:30:50.400" style="s2">15 or 16. now it&#39;s down to about 10</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.480" end="01:30:51.600" style="s2">and falling so that&#39;s good but what i</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.400" end="01:30:52.480" style="s2">also fear is that you know as soon as it</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.600" end="01:30:54.400" style="s2">gets to</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.480" end="01:30:55.920" style="s2">the the oligarchies are saying oh i</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.400" end="01:30:56.560" style="s2">can&#39;t get anybody to do these jobs</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.920" end="01:30:59.120" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.560" end="01:31:00.080" style="s2">well actually i&#39;ve seen all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.120" end="01:31:03.280" style="s2">stories about</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.080" end="01:31:04.080" style="s2">the success of the of of the immigration</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.280" end="01:31:05.920" style="s2">restriction</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.080" end="01:31:07.760" style="s2">and that people are hiring americans</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.920" end="01:31:08.560" style="s2">again and and you know what at higher</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.760" end="01:31:10.080" style="s2">wages</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.560" end="01:31:11.600" style="s2">and a business of course doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.080" end="01:31:13.280" style="s2">hire anyone at a higher wage but you</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.600" end="01:31:14.880" style="s2">know as an american citizen</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.280" end="01:31:16.880" style="s2">i&#39;m delighted even if it means i have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.880" end="01:31:18.880" style="s2">pay marginally more for</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.880" end="01:31:20.880" style="s2">whatever product i&#39;m paying more for</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.880" end="01:31:21.679" style="s2">yeah you know consumer price index is</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.880" end="01:31:24.800" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.679" end="01:31:27.679" style="s2">the highest good or gdp growth</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.800" end="01:31:30.159" style="s2">uh per capita that&#39;s for sure i did see</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.679" end="01:31:31.920" style="s2">some interesting stories about uh like</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.159" end="01:31:34.159" style="s2">i want to say it was like a fishing town</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.920" end="01:31:36.719" style="s2">in maine that didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.159" end="01:31:37.600" style="s2">immigrant labor and who did they hire</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.719" end="01:31:40.719" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.600" end="01:31:42.239" style="s2">teenagers oh my god that&#39;s impossible to</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.719" end="01:31:45.040" style="s2">imagine in california</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.239" end="01:31:46.239" style="s2">but i um actually there&#39;s one exception</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.040" end="01:31:47.760" style="s2">which i&#39;ll get to in a second but when i</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.239" end="01:31:50.000" style="s2">was a kid in california</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.760" end="01:31:51.760" style="s2">uh everybody i knew worked the summers</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.000" end="01:31:53.280" style="s2">oh yeah high school everybody</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.760" end="01:31:55.199" style="s2">and that became impossible because all</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.280" end="01:31:58.480" style="s2">those jobs got um</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.199" end="01:31:59.920" style="s2">um taken by immigrants you know one</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.480" end="01:32:01.360" style="s2">one of the big exceptions if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.920" end="01:32:03.120" style="s2">in california especially southern</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.360" end="01:32:04.560" style="s2">california but the chain is now all over</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.120" end="01:32:05.679" style="s2">the state and in a few other states it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.560" end="01:32:07.360" style="s2">called in and out burger it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.679" end="01:32:11.199" style="s2">privately owned fast food</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.360" end="01:32:14.080" style="s2">chain and um</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.199" end="01:32:14.320" style="s2">uh you know owned by a christian family</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.080" end="01:32:16.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.320" end="01:32:18.880" style="s2">and when you go there teenagers work</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.159" end="01:32:20.800" style="s2">there now white teenagers hispanic</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.880" end="01:32:22.480" style="s2">blacks every but the difference they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.800" end="01:32:24.159" style="s2">real kids from the local schools and one</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.480" end="01:32:24.560" style="s2">of the reasons is they pay above minimum</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.159" end="01:32:26.880" style="s2">wage</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.560" end="01:32:27.760" style="s2">they always have paid above minimum wage</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.880" end="01:32:29.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.760" end="01:32:30.639" style="s2">nobody else no none of the other fast</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.120" end="01:32:32.080" style="s2">food chains pay above the minimum wage</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.639" end="01:32:33.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of the reasons why the</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.080" end="01:32:36.880" style="s2">service is so much better</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.760" end="01:32:39.199" style="s2">snappier smiling welcome and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.880" end="01:32:40.000" style="s2">boom boom boom right on the money and</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.199" end="01:32:42.800" style="s2">hey the</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.000" end="01:32:43.440" style="s2">the family that owns that they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.800" end="01:32:45.679" style="s2">rich</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.440" end="01:32:46.880" style="s2">which suggests to me there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.679" end="01:32:49.360" style="s2">hire local people</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.880" end="01:32:51.280" style="s2">to hire american citizens to pay a</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.360" end="01:32:52.560" style="s2">decent above minimum wage wage and still</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.280" end="01:32:55.600" style="s2">make a lot of money</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.560" end="01:32:57.360" style="s2">yeah yeah i agree with that i worked i</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.600" end="01:32:59.360" style="s2">worked as early as sixth grade</p>

<p begin="01:33:17.199" end="01:33:21.520" style="s2">even strikes me as a little bit crazy</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.760" end="01:33:23.520" style="s2">but i know what good it did for me it</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.520" end="01:33:25.840" style="s2">certainly made me a hustler</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.520" end="01:33:26.719" style="s2">there&#39;s no question about that in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.840" end="01:33:29.040" style="s2">school year but</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.719" end="01:33:30.480" style="s2">they just definitely kicked my butt to</p>

<p begin="01:33:36.080" end="01:33:39.040" style="s2">time it wasn&#39;t like now where everything</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.520" end="01:33:40.080" style="s2">is scheduled and especially in cove a</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.040" end="01:33:42.480" style="s2">year but</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.080" end="01:33:44.320" style="s2">you know kind of after a certain point</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.480" end="01:33:45.679" style="s2">you can get a car or even ride your bike</p>

<p begin="01:35:10.400" end="01:35:14.800" style="s2">because it acts as a magnet</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.400" end="01:35:15.840" style="s2">um i left the state not really thinking</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.800" end="01:35:18.639" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.840" end="01:35:19.920" style="s2">and and it started to think about it as</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.639" end="01:35:21.760" style="s2">i would go home more and</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.920" end="01:35:23.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it i guess if you&#39;re there maybe</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.760" end="01:35:25.440" style="s2">the change is more</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.119" end="01:35:26.800" style="s2">imperceptible but if you&#39;re gone and you</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.440" end="01:35:28.480" style="s2">come back and you&#39;re gonna come</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.800" end="01:35:30.080" style="s2">everything looks just kind of a little</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.480" end="01:35:32.000" style="s2">more subtly different</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.080" end="01:35:33.199" style="s2">at every six month or 12-month interval</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.000" end="01:35:35.440" style="s2">and i started to think</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.199" end="01:35:37.760" style="s2">this is not this is looking really</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.440" end="01:35:40.480" style="s2">different in a lot a lot a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.760" end="01:35:41.760" style="s2">and the more i studied it the more i</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.480" end="01:35:43.760" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.760" end="01:35:45.760" style="s2">yeah this isn&#39;t working and then i at a</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.760" end="01:35:47.679" style="s2">certain point i realized that the main</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.760" end="01:35:48.960" style="s2">reason california became</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.679" end="01:35:50.800" style="s2">not the only but the main reason</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.960" end="01:35:52.880" style="s2">california became a one-party</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.800" end="01:35:54.960" style="s2">democratic blue state was demographic</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.880" end="01:35:57.119" style="s2">change in two sentences one is</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.960" end="01:35:58.239" style="s2">the continued influx of of legal and</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.119" end="01:36:00.400" style="s2">illegal immigration</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.239" end="01:36:01.920" style="s2">but also the pressure that that put on</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.400" end="01:36:03.920" style="s2">the old california</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.920" end="01:36:05.440" style="s2">middle class to just leave you know the</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.920" end="01:36:07.920" style="s2">california</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.440" end="01:36:09.360" style="s2">base that was the stronghold for nixon</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.920" end="01:36:11.760" style="s2">and reagan</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.360" end="01:36:13.440" style="s2">elected you know uh reagan governor</p>

<p begin="01:39:02.239" end="01:39:05.520" style="s2">exactly at what point he said this so if</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.840" end="01:39:07.360" style="s2">i have the chronology wrong i</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.520" end="01:39:09.360" style="s2">apologize but when he said if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.360" end="01:39:11.360" style="s2">have a border we don&#39;t have a country</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.360" end="01:39:13.040" style="s2">i thought that may be the wisest thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.360" end="01:39:14.159" style="s2">any presidential candidate has said in</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.040" end="01:39:16.960" style="s2">my lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.159" end="01:39:18.400" style="s2">or since and it&#39;s it sounds so</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.960" end="01:39:21.199" style="s2">tautologically obvious</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.400" end="01:39:21.679" style="s2">which it is the fact that he had to say</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.199" end="01:39:23.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.679" end="01:39:25.520" style="s2">because conventional wisdom is so</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.280" end="01:39:28.000" style="s2">against something so basic like that</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.520" end="01:39:30.239" style="s2">and had the courage to say it and what i</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.000" end="01:39:32.000" style="s2">especially loved about it is</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.239" end="01:39:34.080" style="s2">he didn&#39;t feel the need to go into</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.000" end="01:39:36.560" style="s2">intellectual contortions to explain</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.080" end="01:39:37.840" style="s2">why this was the right position to him</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.560" end="01:39:40.480" style="s2">it was just</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.840" end="01:39:41.119" style="s2">self-evident yeah just right from the</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.480" end="01:39:44.400" style="s2">gut</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.119" end="01:39:47.360" style="s2">all right that&#39;s my guy yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.400" end="01:39:47.679" style="s2">it is true and we need more trump as you</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.360" end="01:39:50.239" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.679" end="01:39:51.199" style="s2">there are no existing problems that more</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.239" end="01:39:53.760" style="s2">trump</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.199" end="01:39:54.639" style="s2">can&#39;t solve i love that piece that you</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.760" end="01:39:57.679" style="s2">published</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.639" end="01:39:59.920" style="s2">a few months ago or recently um</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.679" end="01:40:01.600" style="s2">but let&#39;s talk about as we as we sort of</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.920" end="01:40:03.040" style="s2">start to wind this down here let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.600" end="01:40:06.000" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.040" end="01:40:08.080" style="s2">what if we don&#39;t do anything and then</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.000" end="01:40:11.280" style="s2">what do we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.080" end="01:40:11.760" style="s2">uh if we don&#39;t do anything then we get i</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.280" end="01:40:13.280" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.760" end="01:40:14.880" style="s2">likely we get one of the outcomes of</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.280" end="01:40:17.360" style="s2">chapter six or seven so basically</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.880" end="01:40:19.280" style="s2">chapter six says</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.360" end="01:40:20.880" style="s2">what if present trends continue in</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.280" end="01:40:23.360" style="s2">particular what if you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.880" end="01:40:24.320" style="s2">uh you could get the outcome in chapter</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.360" end="01:40:27.760" style="s2">six</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.320" end="01:40:28.320" style="s2">if trump is defeated if he&#39;s re-elected</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.760" end="01:40:30.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.320" end="01:40:31.840" style="s2">um you know has an unsuccessful second</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.159" end="01:40:33.280" style="s2">term or even if he&#39;s re-elected and has</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.840" end="01:40:34.080" style="s2">a successful second term but then is</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.280" end="01:40:36.719" style="s2">defeated</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.080" end="01:40:38.480" style="s2">and then a successor is defeated in 2024</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.719" end="01:40:39.760" style="s2">and the left gets back in power and they</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.480" end="01:40:41.600" style="s2">basically erase</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.760" end="01:40:43.280" style="s2">traces of the trumpet to right now so</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.600" end="01:40:44.480" style="s2">basically what chapter six is</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.280" end="01:40:46.639" style="s2">what if we could take a time machine</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.480" end="01:40:48.000" style="s2">back to 2015 elect hillary clinton and</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.639" end="01:40:49.600" style="s2">just start implementing the democratic</p>

<p begin="01:40:49.600" end="01:40:53.199" style="s2">or it doesn&#39;t even have to be hillary</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.199" end="01:40:56.239" style="s2">whoever it is yeah you know</p>

<p begin="01:40:56.239" end="01:41:00.639" style="s2">any of them what does that look like and</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.159" end="01:41:02.159" style="s2">i theorize it out</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.639" end="01:41:04.880" style="s2">a version of that was published on</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.159" end="01:41:07.520" style="s2">american greatness um</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.880" end="01:41:08.880" style="s2">last friday under the title another</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.520" end="01:41:11.119" style="s2">happy title</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.880" end="01:41:12.239" style="s2">uh a tyranny perpetual and universal</p>

<p begin="01:41:12.239" end="01:41:15.440" style="s2">this is the phrase tyranny perpetual</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.840" end="01:41:17.280" style="s2">universal comes from</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.440" end="01:41:18.480" style="s2">the introduction to leo strauss&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.280" end="01:41:21.679" style="s2">1949 book</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.480" end="01:41:23.679" style="s2">on tyranny um which i explained at the</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.679" end="01:41:25.280" style="s2">at the end and then chapter seven and</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.679" end="01:41:26.560" style="s2">then i and then so the second half of</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.280" end="01:41:28.320" style="s2">the first half of chapter six says this</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.560" end="01:41:29.679" style="s2">is what that would look like and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.320" end="01:41:31.280" style="s2">second half says</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.679" end="01:41:33.760" style="s2">here are the reasons to doubt that they</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.280" end="01:41:37.119" style="s2">couldn&#39;t pull it off for very long</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.760" end="01:41:39.199" style="s2">you know i had a conversation um</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.119" end="01:41:40.159" style="s2">no we mentioned beatty earlier right</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.199" end="01:41:42.159" style="s2">yeah darren</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.159" end="01:41:43.199" style="s2">former white house right or i was</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.159" end="01:41:44.639" style="s2">talking to darren</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.199" end="01:41:46.239" style="s2">and we were sort of debating like how</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.639" end="01:41:47.520" style="s2">long do you think if they got everything</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.239" end="01:41:48.400" style="s2">they wanted how long could they keep it</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.520" end="01:41:50.639" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.400" end="01:41:51.600" style="s2">and darren took the position as i recall</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.639" end="01:41:54.560" style="s2">this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.600" end="01:41:55.760" style="s2">a pretty long time and i was like i</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.560" end="01:41:57.360" style="s2">don&#39;t think so i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.760" end="01:42:00.400" style="s2">think so so in that conversation he was</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.360" end="01:42:03.360" style="s2">a pessimist and i was the</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.400" end="01:42:04.960" style="s2">although i think i say in a way an</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.360" end="01:42:05.600" style="s2">optimist because if they can&#39;t keep it</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.960" end="01:42:08.080" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.600" end="01:42:09.760" style="s2">it won&#39;t end happily it&#39;ll crash in a</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.080" end="01:42:11.040" style="s2">bad way now there may be good outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.760" end="01:42:12.639" style="s2">on the other side but then there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.040" end="01:42:15.840" style="s2">to be a period of</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.639" end="01:42:17.119" style="s2">not good all right can i can i just step</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.840" end="01:42:20.000" style="s2">in there for one second</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.119" end="01:42:22.480" style="s2">john robb who uh is a technologist a</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.000" end="01:42:24.320" style="s2">futurist an analyst network analyst</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.480" end="01:42:26.320" style="s2">he&#39;s described a situation called what</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.320" end="01:42:28.480" style="s2">he calls the long night</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.320" end="01:42:29.600" style="s2">and that is when the convergence of</p>

<p begin="01:42:29.600" end="01:42:35.440" style="s2">ai and sort of tyrannical</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.800" end="01:42:36.719" style="s2">you know ideology that that if it if it</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.440" end="01:42:39.360" style="s2">all happens</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.719" end="01:42:40.239" style="s2">soon enough or at the right time that it</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.360" end="01:42:43.280" style="s2">could just be</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.239" end="01:42:44.639" style="s2">a switch right that we no longer have</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.280" end="01:42:45.760" style="s2">access to bank and we no longer have</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.639" end="01:42:48.159" style="s2">assets to jobs</p>

<p begin="01:42:50.800" end="01:42:55.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s may not actually be a way to</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.600" end="01:42:57.360" style="s2">resist that</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.119" end="01:42:58.560" style="s2">um is that you know yeah you&#39;ve had an</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.360" end="01:43:02.000" style="s2">idea you&#39;ve heard them</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.560" end="01:43:04.080" style="s2">relentlessly i that would have that</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.000" end="01:43:05.280" style="s2">would require technology</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.080" end="01:43:07.440" style="s2">mixed and perhaps mixed with</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.280" end="01:43:09.440" style="s2">pharmaceuticals or something</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.440" end="01:43:11.040" style="s2">to fundamentally change human nature in</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.440" end="01:43:11.920" style="s2">a way that i wonder if it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.040" end="01:43:14.159" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.920" end="01:43:15.440" style="s2">because at a minimum let&#39;s say you could</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.159" end="01:43:17.199" style="s2">you could track everybody all the time</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.440" end="01:43:18.159" style="s2">and inspire fear into everybody all the</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.199" end="01:43:20.320" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.159" end="01:43:21.440" style="s2">i still think if human nature remains</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.320" end="01:43:23.119" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.440" end="01:43:25.280" style="s2">then what you&#39;ll see is just this</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.119" end="01:43:27.679" style="s2">massive drop in productivity and the</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.280" end="01:43:30.880" style="s2">incentive to do anything or be anything</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.679" end="01:43:33.440" style="s2">and the system will be</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.880" end="01:43:35.520" style="s2">in a sense self-correcting you know what</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.440" end="01:43:38.560" style="s2">i mean am i am i making sense like if</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.520" end="01:43:40.080" style="s2">so you know the the the soviets there</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.560" end="01:43:41.520" style="s2">was an old joke from the soviet union</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.080" end="01:43:43.600" style="s2">about how the soviet economy worked or</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.520" end="01:43:45.920" style="s2">how payroll worked the worker said</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.600" end="01:43:47.119" style="s2">we pretend to work they pretend to pay</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.920" end="01:43:49.360" style="s2">us right</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.119" end="01:43:51.119" style="s2">everybody knew that they were producing</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.360" end="01:43:52.719" style="s2">nothing and earning nothing</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.119" end="01:43:54.480" style="s2">if you get to that point where nobody</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.719" end="01:43:55.119" style="s2">has any incentive there&#39;s no joy in</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.480" end="01:43:56.480" style="s2">their life</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.119" end="01:43:57.840" style="s2">they know they&#39;re completely impressed</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.480" end="01:43:58.960" style="s2">they don&#39;t get to own anything keep</p>

<p begin="01:44:03.440" end="01:44:07.360" style="s2">then and then what happens to</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.040" end="01:44:08.480" style="s2">you know as a prosaic matter i think i</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.360" end="01:44:10.239" style="s2">ask this yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.480" end="01:44:11.760" style="s2">this gets to the second half of chapter</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.239" end="01:44:13.199" style="s2">six which is reasons to doubt</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.760" end="01:44:15.199" style="s2">reasons to doubt they can keep this</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.199" end="01:44:16.560" style="s2">going if they come up with a system like</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.199" end="01:44:17.920" style="s2">that i mean just as a basic point</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.560" end="01:44:19.199" style="s2">who&#39;s going to build the gulf stream</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.920" end="01:44:20.159" style="s2">airplanes and who&#39;s going to fix them</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.199" end="01:44:21.119" style="s2">and who&#39;s going to fly them and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.159" end="01:44:22.239" style="s2">going to maintain them</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.119" end="01:44:24.239" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re going to have people</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.239" end="01:44:26.159" style="s2">competent enough and who have enough</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.239" end="01:44:27.679" style="s2">who get enough out of their lives to put</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.159" end="01:44:29.600" style="s2">effort into this or is everybody</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.679" end="01:44:31.119" style="s2">just going to be like i i know that the</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.600" end="01:44:31.920" style="s2">game is rigged and defeated against me</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.119" end="01:44:33.600" style="s2">so okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.920" end="01:44:35.600" style="s2">i&#39;ll take my pill and go play my video</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.600" end="01:44:37.600" style="s2">game in which case</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.600" end="01:44:39.679" style="s2">there won&#39;t be gated estates anymore or</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.600" end="01:44:40.719" style="s2">there might be the ruins of gated estate</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.679" end="01:44:41.679" style="s2">somewhere but no one will be able to</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.719" end="01:44:42.880" style="s2">maintain them or live in them which</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.679" end="01:44:44.560" style="s2">means the oligarchs</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.880" end="01:44:45.600" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to enjoy their spectacular</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.560" end="01:44:47.440" style="s2">wealth this is what&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.600" end="01:44:49.360" style="s2">things that i think</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.440" end="01:44:50.480" style="s2">sounds implausible to me for that reason</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.360" end="01:44:52.560" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.480" end="01:44:53.840" style="s2">again never bet against these guys i</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.560" end="01:44:56.320" style="s2">mean who thought that</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.840" end="01:44:58.639" style="s2">to this point who thought that corporate</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.320" end="01:45:00.400" style="s2">america would pledge whatever it was 1.7</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.639" end="01:45:01.199" style="s2">billion dollars to black lives matter in</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.400" end="01:45:03.119" style="s2">like a week</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.199" end="01:45:04.960" style="s2">i didn&#39;t think that so anything can</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.119" end="01:45:06.800" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.960" end="01:45:08.880" style="s2">i definitely didn&#39;t see that coming</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.800" end="01:45:09.600" style="s2">either and unfortunately it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.880" end="01:45:12.719" style="s2">be with us</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.600" end="01:45:14.560" style="s2">for a little bit longer so</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.719" end="01:45:16.320" style="s2">we don&#39;t think it could stay together</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.560" end="01:45:18.239" style="s2">the democratic left</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.320" end="01:45:20.480" style="s2">possible maybe a little bit maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.239" end="01:45:22.159" style="s2">little bit longer than we think</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.480" end="01:45:24.000" style="s2">and then chapter seven is to finally</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.159" end="01:45:27.040" style="s2">okay and if it doesn&#39;t then what happens</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.000" end="01:45:30.320" style="s2">and then what happens well</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.040" end="01:45:32.159" style="s2">you know um i think the certainly the</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.320" end="01:45:35.920" style="s2">events of 2020 are going to</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.159" end="01:45:38.080" style="s2">um accelerate the big sort</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.920" end="01:45:39.520" style="s2">in other words if you&#39;re a red person</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.080" end="01:45:41.360" style="s2">living in a blue state</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.520" end="01:45:42.639" style="s2">you&#39;re going to leave and maybe vice</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.360" end="01:45:43.679" style="s2">versa i think it&#39;s going to be more the</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.639" end="01:45:45.119" style="s2">former than the latter</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.679" end="01:45:46.800" style="s2">but blue areas are going to get bluer</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.119" end="01:45:49.199" style="s2">red areas are going to get redder</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.800" end="01:45:50.960" style="s2">okay and that&#39;ll be mostly peaceful just</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.199" end="01:45:54.080" style="s2">moving bands and you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.960" end="01:45:57.119" style="s2">individual private decisions um</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.080" end="01:46:00.320" style="s2">another possibility is that when</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.119" end="01:46:00.960" style="s2">that i theorize when the left regains</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.320" end="01:46:02.960" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.960" end="01:46:04.719" style="s2">if the left regains power i mean when is</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.960" end="01:46:10.320" style="s2">probably a lot more likely than if</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.719" end="01:46:10.320" style="s2">uh it&#39;s easy to imagine some extremely</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.199" end="01:46:16.000" style="s2">zealous ideologue in the white house</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.119" end="01:46:19.760" style="s2">like kamala harris or</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.000" end="01:46:22.080" style="s2">uh elizabeth warren or aoc you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.760" end="01:46:23.840" style="s2">bumbling into another ruby ridge type</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.080" end="01:46:26.560" style="s2">fiasco</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.840" end="01:46:29.119" style="s2">but really provoking something this time</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.560" end="01:46:30.880" style="s2">and that provocation could lead to</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.119" end="01:46:32.800" style="s2">any number of things and one of my calls</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.880" end="01:46:34.960" style="s2">the the uh you know the red state</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.800" end="01:46:37.040" style="s2">uh bangla meaning which is a french word</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.960" end="01:46:38.239" style="s2">it means kind of a no-go zone i could</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.040" end="01:46:40.719" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.239" end="01:46:42.800" style="s2">a a kind of passive resistance in red</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.719" end="01:46:44.320" style="s2">states where they say okay feds</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.800" end="01:46:45.840" style="s2">you you&#39;re not you&#39;re not coming in here</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.320" end="01:46:49.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re not doing that here</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.840" end="01:46:52.239" style="s2">and um you know the feds</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.440" end="01:46:53.600" style="s2">then think you know maybe the these</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.239" end="01:46:55.199" style="s2">zealots in the white house think well</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.600" end="01:46:56.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll send the 80-second airborne in and</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.199" end="01:46:57.920" style="s2">crush them and then they</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.000" end="01:46:59.360" style="s2">what somebody says well wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.920" end="01:47:00.719" style="s2">what if we give that order and they</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.360" end="01:47:02.080" style="s2">don&#39;t follow it or what if we give that</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.719" end="01:47:04.080" style="s2">order when we started and that provokes</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.080" end="01:47:04.400" style="s2">a greater backlash maybe we should cool</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.080" end="01:47:07.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.400" end="01:47:08.560" style="s2">and both sides just sort of agree let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.520" end="01:47:10.400" style="s2">de facto</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.560" end="01:47:11.679" style="s2">leave each other alone because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.400" end="01:47:13.040" style="s2">really like one another and neither one</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.679" end="01:47:14.400" style="s2">of us has the power to push the other</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.040" end="01:47:17.840" style="s2">around too much</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.400" end="01:47:19.840" style="s2">and you end up getting a kind of radical</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.840" end="01:47:23.040" style="s2">federalism and decentralization</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.840" end="01:47:25.119" style="s2">without it either formally being decreed</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.040" end="01:47:26.880" style="s2">that&#39;s another possibility we see the</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.119" end="01:47:29.520" style="s2">beginnings of that already don&#39;t we with</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.880" end="01:47:32.159" style="s2">uh sanctuary states and cities and</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.520" end="01:47:32.560" style="s2">yeah but only from only from the blue</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.159" end="01:47:35.199" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.560" end="01:47:36.639" style="s2">we don&#39;t see it at all because so far</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.199" end="01:47:38.080" style="s2">anytime the reds step out of line the</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.639" end="01:47:39.520" style="s2">feds have gone in there and said we will</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.080" end="01:47:41.360" style="s2">come and just squash you</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.520" end="01:47:42.639" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t push back on that just to</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.360" end="01:47:45.679" style="s2">smidge in</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.639" end="01:47:47.280" style="s2">virginia last winter and spring there</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.679" end="01:47:49.920" style="s2">was the second amendment</p>

<p begin="01:47:56.159" end="01:47:59.280" style="s2">nothing came of that the virginia</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.520" end="01:48:01.040" style="s2">legislature still rammed through</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.280" end="01:48:02.400" style="s2">all of its anti-gun legislation on a</p>

<p begin="01:48:02.400" end="01:48:09.199" style="s2">and nothing has happened on that so</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.639" end="01:48:10.239" style="s2">what i have yet to see is successful red</p>

<p begin="01:48:16.480" end="01:48:19.600" style="s2">hasn&#39;t gotten</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.679" end="01:48:21.040" style="s2">you know bad or dire enough for somebody</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.600" end="01:48:22.880" style="s2">to try that yet</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.040" end="01:48:24.480" style="s2">and could get there i think another</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.880" end="01:48:25.360" style="s2">possibility which we can&#39;t really rule</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.480" end="01:48:27.440" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.360" end="01:48:29.119" style="s2">uh is the secession or at least the</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.440" end="01:48:30.400" style="s2">attempt at secession some people say</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.119" end="01:48:32.159" style="s2">well secession could never happen to</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.400" end="01:48:34.400" style="s2">which i say maybe maybe not i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.159" end="01:48:35.199" style="s2">but the attempt is much it could</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.400" end="01:48:38.000" style="s2">certainly happen</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.199" end="01:48:39.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to imagine right now</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.000" end="01:48:41.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s not that hard to imagine in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.679" end="01:48:42.239" style="s2">near future some state saying i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.600" end="01:48:44.159" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.239" end="01:48:45.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s legislature filing a session</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.159" end="01:48:46.960" style="s2">resolution</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.360" end="01:48:49.440" style="s2">and where it goes from there you know is</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.960" end="01:48:52.400" style="s2">gained out in the book uh</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.440" end="01:48:54.080" style="s2">you know all the way from a formal</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.400" end="01:48:55.920" style="s2">agreement fine go</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.080" end="01:48:57.199" style="s2">to wait wait what do you want to stay in</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.920" end="01:48:57.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll give you that and then they back</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.199" end="01:49:01.360" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.760" end="01:49:04.960" style="s2">to a war or an attempt at a war</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.360" end="01:49:07.119" style="s2">um and then i talk about</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.960" end="01:49:09.199" style="s2">caesarism which is a very specific type</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.119" end="01:49:10.960" style="s2">of one-man rule and the possibility that</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.199" end="01:49:12.239" style="s2">somebody could take over the country</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.960" end="01:49:14.400" style="s2">this is typically</p>

<p begin="01:49:39.280" end="01:49:43.760" style="s2">could see that self-organization</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.440" end="01:49:45.440" style="s2">beginning in small towns and then</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.760" end="01:49:47.040" style="s2">becoming leagues of small towns it could</p>

<p begin="01:49:47.040" end="01:49:51.520" style="s2">and you could see a patchwork of you</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.920" end="01:49:53.520" style="s2">know states that is to say sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.520" end="01:49:55.280" style="s2">states on the north american continent</p>

<p begin="01:50:08.239" end="01:50:15.520" style="s2">um it&#39;s not impossible by the way</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.679" end="01:50:16.800" style="s2">um that well i&#39;ll leave that out i</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.520" end="01:50:19.199" style="s2">actually deliberately cut that from</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.800" end="01:50:21.280" style="s2">chapter seven so i won&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.199" end="01:50:23.679" style="s2">no that&#39;s the juicy bit particular</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.280" end="01:50:25.760" style="s2">thought um</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.679" end="01:50:26.880" style="s2">and then that chapter closes with the</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.760" end="01:50:28.800" style="s2">kind of the darkest</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.880" end="01:50:30.239" style="s2">part of the book of all which i it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.800" end="01:50:31.679" style="s2">reference to the classical notion of the</p>

<p begin="01:50:31.679" end="01:50:35.599" style="s2">i won&#39;t describe it one one can you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.320" end="01:50:37.520" style="s2">just buy it and read it</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.599" end="01:50:39.199" style="s2">and then chapter eight&#39;s my happy ending</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.520" end="01:50:40.320" style="s2">right so the there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.199" end="01:50:41.840" style="s2">wrong with trump that more trump</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.320" end="01:50:43.599" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t solve comes from chapter eight</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.840" end="01:50:45.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s sort of my way of saying look</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.599" end="01:50:47.440" style="s2">here&#39;s a blueprint for how we can avoid</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.040" end="01:50:49.119" style="s2">this if i want to stay together</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.440" end="01:50:50.880" style="s2">as a territorial republic in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.119" end="01:50:53.040" style="s2">currently constituted united states of</p>

<p begin="01:50:53.040" end="01:50:56.639" style="s2">here&#39;s the way we can do it and redress</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.119" end="01:50:59.440" style="s2">all the balances of the economy</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.639" end="01:51:00.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s basically my cut at a trumpet</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.440" end="01:51:03.599" style="s2">populist</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.400" end="01:51:04.639" style="s2">nationalist program for the 2020s and</p>

<p begin="01:51:13.040" end="01:51:16.320" style="s2">why else would you write it</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.159" end="01:51:18.880" style="s2">right and in this case this is mock and</p>
