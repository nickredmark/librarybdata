<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">review that again so let&#39;s review the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">overall idea but the framing of this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">I&#39;m giving you write all constellation</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">of practices and it&#39;s not that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:54.799" style="s2">going to master them all is you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">to from them you&#39;re going to curate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.799" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">collate and cultivate an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">practices and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:03.509" style="s2">keep happening for you and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">remember some of the design features</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.509" end="00:02:09.509" style="s2">just like we have complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">between meditation and contemplation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.509" end="00:02:13.150" style="s2">continent and complementarity between a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:16.180" style="s2">Siddha practice and move</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.150" end="00:02:19.989" style="s2">in practices might see one principle of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.180" end="00:02:23.260" style="s2">design principle is complementarity you</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.989" end="00:02:25.030" style="s2">also related practices on top of each</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.260" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">other the way they you know Praja is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.030" end="00:02:32.739" style="s2">layering of meta and the pasta together</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:35.379" style="s2">we also have practices that link other</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.739" end="00:02:38.970" style="s2">practices together like the Synod Qigong</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.379" end="00:02:41.700" style="s2">practices integrate between the moving</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.970" end="00:02:44.109" style="s2">chicag practices and the seated</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.700" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">meditative practices our mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.109" end="00:02:48.549" style="s2">practices I should say so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.260" style="s2">principles to keep thinking about and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.549" end="00:02:53.709" style="s2">keep trying to and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.260" end="00:02:56.370" style="s2">exemplify them and then what we learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.709" end="00:03:01.209" style="s2">this passed on today was a particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.370" end="00:03:04.329" style="s2">linking practice which is seated chika</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.209" end="00:03:06.370" style="s2">and so I&#39;m going to take you through</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.329" end="00:03:09.159" style="s2">this again I&#39;ll describe it again and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.370" end="00:03:11.079" style="s2">then what we&#39;ll do is we after I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.159" end="00:03:13.720" style="s2">describe it again we&#39;ll set our phones</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.079" end="00:03:17.019" style="s2">get in the posture we&#39;ll set the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.720" end="00:03:20.859" style="s2">for 15 minutes in total I&#39;ll grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.019" end="00:03:24.010" style="s2">through the external one like and right</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.859" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll go into sauna mode you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.010" end="00:03:29.079" style="s2">can do the internal one movement of mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:31.480" style="s2">and then go into whichever seated</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.079" end="00:03:35.819" style="s2">practice you wish so let&#39;s say you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.480" end="00:03:38.199" style="s2">done some of the moving some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.819" end="00:03:39.940" style="s2">standing the jon-jon some of the moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.199" end="00:03:42.849" style="s2">each one you&#39;re doing that the Qigong</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.940" end="00:03:45.190" style="s2">practices alright and then we sit and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.849" end="00:03:47.319" style="s2">what we do is we&#39;re going to and this</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.190" end="00:03:51.220" style="s2">again notice that this is also layering</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.319" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2">on the breathing the moving cheek on</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.220" end="00:03:56.650" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.750" end="00:04:00.099" style="s2">inhale and do lift look up and pantomime</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.650" end="00:04:05.739" style="s2">on as you say all while breathing in and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.099" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">then as you exhale that they are become</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.739" end="00:04:09.250" style="s2">a de prayer position and then as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:12.579" style="s2">inhale you&#39;re pressing in with your</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.579" end="00:04:23.849" style="s2">of your mind you exhale you relax your</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:23.849" style="s2">hands out and you inhale then exhale</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.860" end="00:04:34.430" style="s2">and then the last time when you come to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.140" end="00:04:41.030" style="s2">here you exhale your hands go to here</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.430" end="00:04:42.260" style="s2">and you inhale four times and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.260" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">four and what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.330" end="00:04:48.500" style="s2">your hands that you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.540" style="s2">like what you&#39;re getting Praja your</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.500" end="00:04:52.340" style="s2">hands are conveying the outward moving</p>
