<p begin="00:00:08.460" end="00:00:13.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t know recording on my phone at</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.830" end="00:00:16.170" style="s2">the moment I was doing yoga the obits do</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:17.609" style="s2">you have access to you realized I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.170" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">recorded my video today so I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.609" end="00:00:21.779" style="s2">would just do here before taking the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">track back calling this down on the bus</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.779" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">in Vancouver which can take forever I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">mean there&#39;s so much snow and so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">we think you know climate change because</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s the polar vortex going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.029" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason we&#39;ve stopped calling</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">it global warming and started calling it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">climate change because it&#39;s the changing</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:41.940" style="s2">climate and it&#39;s extreme weather event</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">it&#39;s not just all about warming but how</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.940" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">we actually solve climate change is many</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">fold</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:49.200" style="s2">I haven&#39;t taken notes it&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:49.770" style="s2">think about all the time sort of notes</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">with me</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.770" end="00:00:53.309" style="s2">we need an access to the information we</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">need access to the science that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.309" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">everybody can understand so that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:00:59.670" style="s2">can&#39;t don&#39;t have this debate of like</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a human causes is it not and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.670" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">that we can see okay yeah there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">99% of science showing that it&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">caused or 90% of the science showing</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s human caused 10% showing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:12.420" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s something that humans don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:14.700" style="s2">cause whether or not humans have caused</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.420" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">it we&#39;re gonna suffer the repercussions</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.700" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">so now we need a system to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:22.290" style="s2">deal with environmental catastrophe that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">we&#39;re definitely causing because we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.290" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">the ones creating the chemicals and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">pumping them into the world and creating</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">the pollution but also if there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.390" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">to be extreme weather we need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:31.770" style="s2">to deal with that as well we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">able to have a system to problem-solve</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.770" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">from the ground up to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:37.500" style="s2">people not fall through the cracks and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:39.270" style="s2">so it&#39;s all interrelated because how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.500" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">solve climate changes how we solve</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.270" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">everything give people access to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">information so that solutions can come</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:47.070" style="s2">from every anywhere give people the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">ability to come together and create</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">solutions the tools to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">that and anytime there is a new solution</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">be able being able to assess the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">techniques SS to be able to assess it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">see how good it is compared to what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">have currently currently then yes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:03.820" style="s2">move forward with this all being</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.759" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.820" end="00:02:11.750" style="s2">having an excess information and then an</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.759" end="00:02:13.730" style="s2">actual report card but to actually see</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.750" end="00:02:15.500" style="s2">where are we where do we need to get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.730" end="00:02:17.540" style="s2">and how far along that process are we</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.500" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">that everyone can follow that isn&#39;t Fox</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.540" end="00:02:23.480" style="s2">News or CNN or anyone else giving the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">information that it&#39;s information we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.480" end="00:02:28.430" style="s2">trust because people like us have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:30.980" style="s2">together and said here&#39;s including</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.430" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">climates and iers and climate change</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.980" end="00:02:35.629" style="s2">scientists who are like yes this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.769" style="s2">information here&#39;s here&#39;s everything we</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.629" end="00:02:38.780" style="s2">would want to know about climate change</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.769" end="00:02:40.790" style="s2">in the environment here&#39;s what we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.780" end="00:02:42.519" style="s2">know here&#39;s what we don&#39;t know and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.790" end="00:02:45.709" style="s2">let&#39;s move on with the task of actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.519" end="00:02:48.079" style="s2">saving ourselves and the planet what do</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.709" end="00:02:49.880" style="s2">we do if temperatures go up put them in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.079" end="00:02:52.459" style="s2">with temperatures go down what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.880" end="00:02:55.030" style="s2">if there&#39;s if there are sea waters rise</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.459" end="00:02:57.829" style="s2">how do we move people out of the sea</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.030" end="00:03:00.110" style="s2">cities inland where they&#39;ll be safe</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.829" end="00:03:01.310" style="s2">without destroying our planet do we not</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.110" end="00:03:02.930" style="s2">how do we deal with the mass human</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.310" end="00:03:06.769" style="s2">migration that happens because of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.930" end="00:03:11.090" style="s2">climate change and climate events</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.769" end="00:03:12.260" style="s2">famines and whatnot and so the tools we</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.090" end="00:03:14.389" style="s2">need the tools to be able to solve</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.260" end="00:03:15.650" style="s2">climate change that we need for</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.389" end="00:03:17.359" style="s2">everything else so to sell health care</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.650" end="00:03:19.310" style="s2">but it&#39;s Helfer financial crisis is how</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.359" end="00:03:21.769" style="s2">this all of it is access to information</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.310" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">that is trustworthy and accessible that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.769" end="00:03:24.380" style="s2">we can point back to so we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:25.430" style="s2">have the same old tired of being it</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.380" end="00:03:27.290" style="s2">again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.430" end="00:03:28.940" style="s2">constituents solutions instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.290" end="00:03:32.030" style="s2">problem once we have a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.940" end="00:03:33.530" style="s2">understanding of the problem then we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.030" end="00:03:35.389" style="s2">need to be able to have tools to be able</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.530" end="00:03:37.010" style="s2">to actually accomplish solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.389" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">assess them instead of letting leaving</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.010" end="00:03:41.510" style="s2">it up to government and/or industry then</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:42.950" style="s2">we can actually move forward on projects</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.510" end="00:03:44.930" style="s2">and see ok is this getting better</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.950" end="00:03:47.209" style="s2">because a lot of what does happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.930" end="00:03:48.440" style="s2">world right now is this idea that like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.209" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">okay well I can&#39;t with the solution and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.440" end="00:03:52.190" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the solutions of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:54.709" style="s2">working well you have metrics to test it</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.190" end="00:03:56.120" style="s2">like are we reversing climate change are</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.709" end="00:03:57.769" style="s2">we taking more carbon out than they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.120" end="00:03:59.000" style="s2">putting in and because that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.769" end="00:04:00.049" style="s2">need to get to isn&#39;t in every solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.000" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">has to be able to do that but together</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.049" end="00:04:05.380" style="s2">we need to be able to do that to be able</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.150" end="00:04:08.450" style="s2">to actually look at the problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.380" end="00:04:10.579" style="s2">logically and assess it quantitatively</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.450" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">and then see are we actually making a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.579" end="00:04:13.720" style="s2">better if we&#39;re dealing with poverty or</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:15.610" style="s2">less people in poverty do we have more</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.720" end="00:04:18.190" style="s2">being fed or we are we improving</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.610" end="00:04:18.670" style="s2">people&#39;s lives instead of destroying</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.190" end="00:04:20.410" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.670" end="00:04:22.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s what I metric we even</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.410" end="00:04:26.020" style="s2">look at we just look at GDP we make more</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.750" end="00:04:27.970" style="s2">money this year so this was just to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.020" end="00:04:30.520" style="s2">my video for today I will do that this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.970" end="00:04:32.740" style="s2">topic in a more next time climate change</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.520" end="00:04:34.930" style="s2">hits me snow today I&#39;m just to leave</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.740" end="00:04:36.640" style="s2">with a bare minimum snow it&#39;s like BC</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.930" end="00:04:38.470" style="s2">snowstorm which is like this brave</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.640" end="00:04:40.330" style="s2">sprinkly and like someone took icing</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.470" end="00:04:41.770" style="s2">sugar and put it out but the city does</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.330" end="00:04:43.990" style="s2">kind of shut down when that happens and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.770" end="00:04:46.350" style="s2">I can&#39;t drive what happens so it does</p>
