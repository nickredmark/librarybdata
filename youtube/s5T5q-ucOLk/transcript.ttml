<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">slavicist</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">so how how does that relate to to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:20.319" style="s2">performatism is there a connection there</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">or is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.319" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">a separate separate uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">field of study um it uh it it overlaps i</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">it started out with</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">uh i started out studying a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">uh russian viktor pierle who was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">of a buddhist a kind of a crazy buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">and that led me to the idea that what he</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">was doing was something that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">was more universal that was something</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t just confined</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">to to russian literature or to him and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">that led me on to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">basically to to the whole notion of of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">performatism</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">right so you uh will give a lecture</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">today what is it about</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">uh it&#39;s about performance in other words</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s an attempt just to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">to give an overview of uh of the theory</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">what it is what it is not this is also</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">important and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">to eventually to tie it in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">what the social issues with uh with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">problems of globalization right okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">so how that will work i will make you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">now the host you will have your lecture</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">or like an we can just be open about</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:39.760" style="s2">how that all goes would that be okay for</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">uh here we are the uh the the the title</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">introduction is the performatism is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">and belief after post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">one of my basic ideas is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">in this new cultural development we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">experience or apprehend transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">and and and belief in in the form of art</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">in the form of literature</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:38.160" style="s2">uh in in all sorts of different media</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.160" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">the some of the titles you see here or</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">works you see here are indicative of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">that or</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">and i&#39;ll go into some of them in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">course of the lecture of course i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">do everything here what i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">start out is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">of course is what is performatism that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">um easiest or the most obvious</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:09.520" style="s2">question and uh performatism as i</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">define it is an across-the-board</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">cultural reaction to post-modernism that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">began sometime</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">in the mid-1990s it may best be</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">described</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">as an epical development that replaces</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">postmodern irony and skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">with artistically mediated belief and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">the experience of transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">this is a lot more complicated than uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">obviously than it</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">first sounds this is not a religious</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">revival but it is it tries to describe</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">that art literature film</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">all even architecture forces us into</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">positions where we</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">believe certain things what i would like</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:58.479" style="s2">to start off with is</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">what performatism is not because when i</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:04.319" style="s2">give these lectures i&#39;m very often</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">told and not informed that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.319" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a simply a repetition of modernism</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">and that it is or that is simply</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">continuing something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">post-modernism already did so</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">post-modern uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">performance is not a return to modernism</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">and proformatism is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">a continuation of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">and to explain why that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">i&#39;ll do a very very quick and very</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">superficial run-through</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">of of modernism and and modernism</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">functionality so now what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">modernism it continues to develop in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">into what we what is sometimes called</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">late modernism</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">here we find in very often the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">of what we saw before a return</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">to stylized representations of reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">we find hierarchy structure and order</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">again in in</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">in art and literature and also the human</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">subject is now has been reconstructed</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">and is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">subjected or subordinated to these this</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">higher order or</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">hierarchy and uh here utopian ideals are</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">realized very often in totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">systems of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">political order so uh what happens next</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">we have once more to give visual</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">examples here</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">a very famous painting by otto thistle</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">showing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:45.360" style="s2">german farmer&#39;s family the</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.360" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">and also atomized they&#39;re not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.839" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re part of a higher a higher</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">here the next example</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:03.519" style="s2">from socialist from socialist realism</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">where you see happy happy peasant</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.519" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">women working in a collective part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">stalin&#39;s own dream own utopian dream</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">that he tried to impose</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">on the soviet union and finally</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">we have salvador dali in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">in the west who is obviously not uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">political in the direct sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">word but who</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">imposes a paranoid order on on</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">on the viewer as you see here uh so</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">these are all things that are typical of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.200" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">high modernism late modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">they uh come together in in and and form</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">basically that we have the gulag</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">in russia we have auschwitz in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">germany and we have uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:51.200" style="s2">hiroshima and nagasaki in the west that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">these are</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">that is that the the the modernist is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:58.000" style="s2">striving for</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">order uh for destroying the individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">for also technological innovation leads</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">to these</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">massive catastrophes these disasters</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">and the the question is how do artists</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">how do writers how do people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.399" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">culture deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:21.519" style="s2">and the answer is basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">what we call what we today call</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.519" end="00:11:25.519" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">and the post-modernisms the</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:30.560" style="s2">main goal is our main question main</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">this is basically the the answers to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">are negative that there&#39;s no more</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">as in modernism there is no radical</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">and the main goal of art becomes</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:27.680" style="s2">nothing more new because</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">you have a kind of an art naval style</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.360" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">and you have what looks like an 18th</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">dresser uh on the top so that uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">this this kind of building what this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">kind of building says is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:53.839" style="s2">uh that that style trying to find a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">dominant style is about trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.839" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">assert power</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">and here on this this building in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:02.399" style="s2">certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:05.600" style="s2">unmasks unmasks</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.399" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">that that search as a as a</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">styles really these styles canceled</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">one another out so to speak so this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">modernism postmodernism wrapped up in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">very quick way</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:25.279" style="s2">and is uh as i will try to show that uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.720" style="s2">performatism</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.279" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">which follows these two uh these two</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.720" end="00:16:33.279" style="s2">epochs or these two developments</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">is is is quite different in the way it</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.279" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">goes about doing things</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">um so we now come to the counter logic</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">performatism which started roughly</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">speaking in the mid</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">1990s and has continued on up until</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">today and how does this this work now in</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">a positive way the first question that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">uh or the main question that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">ask or that i think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">uh that writers uh that creative people</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">ask themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:06.959" style="s2">implicitly i don&#39;t think they actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">posed this question</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">explicitly but the problem was how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">stop</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">post-modern irony without returning to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">modernist</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">utopianism or essentialism because if</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">go back to modernism if you start</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">repeating modernism you simply are going</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">to make the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">mistakes as the modernists and on top of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to simply be in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">ironic position of</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">simply repeating something old you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">not going to really be doing anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">new so</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">question is how do you go about doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">anything new</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">under these circumstances and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">the way you do so at least the way that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">have found to be</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">film etc is that performance works</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">construct</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">a formal closed-off inner space</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">this is the first step you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">it there it is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a frame of</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">and within this frame we are now able to</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">in certainly not in post-modernism which</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">tried to try to which</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">tried to expose all these things as</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">and certainly not in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">modernism did it in the sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">now have an</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">artificial frame that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">that that imposes itself on us and makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">us feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">that what we&#39;re doing is in a certain</p>

<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">return to that a little later um</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">what is important here is that this is</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:49.520" style="s2">rather different we see the same posture</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">of all we can start out by saying that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">the picture itself is is within a frame</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">the the outer frame you would say</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">which simply defines the painting this</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">simply a a given</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">of any painting uh this definition</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">allows us to make the connection to uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">to kaspar david friedesh or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:24.960" style="s2">other paintings that have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">a similar a similar theme and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.960" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">we then can focus our attention on</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">the picture itself which presents us</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">with a kind of a unity with a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.039" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">symmetry and an ambivalent symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">within the painting we have a reflection</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">and we have we call an original uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">figure</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">in the in the yellow in the yellow oil</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">and this figure is analogous to the fig</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">to caspar david three there&#39;s a figure</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">he is opaque because we don&#39;t see him we</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">don&#39;t see his face</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">he&#39;s uh he or she is i suppose it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">child</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">is tantalizing um and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">uh this figure is not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:12.240" style="s2">us he&#39;s not interested in in him or</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">herself</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.240" end="00:23:17.919" style="s2">uh the figure is interested in what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">out there what is in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.919" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">uh potentially uh transcendent it</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">what else do we have in the picture we</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">have three dimensionality we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">realism at first it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">confusing when you look at the picture</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:33.080" style="s2">but it&#39;s not too difficult to tell that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">this is really a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.080" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">three-dimensional this is a realistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">picture in a certain sense but what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">also have though is abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">in in the in particular here</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">in the the the background that the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">figure is looking into</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">so we have something comparable to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">friday</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">picture the possibility of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">is suggested but remains ambivalent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:03.760" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">clear if this is a wall or if this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.760" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">simply fog</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">uh we don&#39;t uh we we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">so if we summarize this we could say</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">we have a double frame that the work as</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">a whole confirms the symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">of the inner scene while</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:24.559" style="s2">perhaps showing a way out in other words</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">we we</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.559" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t uh we&#39;re not 100 sure that</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a way out</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.400" end="00:24:34.480" style="s2">but once more this is a figure that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">gives us an apprehension of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.480" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">possibility of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">without really realizing it in the same</p>

<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">that that regis does and the big</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">as as with within all analyses of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">kind of works</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">be it paintings uh the paintings uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">films dramas whatever is this ironic</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">is this meant ironically and this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">something that each person</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:04.080" style="s2">in a certain sense each viewer has to</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.080" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">for his or herself um i do not find this</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">painting ironic in other words it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">the sea floor so um this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">i think an obvious act of an architect</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">um demonstrating transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s an impossible act that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">the architect</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">is now is performed or has performed for</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">and the result is what i call</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">functionalism that we recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">function that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">this building is houses in opera house</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">uh it obviously has a function but why</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">function of having an opera house is in</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">the form of a chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">sea nobody knows and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">this not being able to to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">what this means is is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">a negative indicator of transcendence if</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t explain</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:20.399" style="s2">something at all because it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">too wild to to too strange to too</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.399" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">unheard of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">then this is a a sign of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">this type of architecture plays very</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">strongly with</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:36.399" style="s2">this sort of with this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">um and uh finally in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.399" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">uh i i&#39;d like to address performatism in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">a narrative work in this case in</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:46.840" style="s2">uh in in a movie which i&#39;ll get to very</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">quickly um once more</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">the basic notions of performatism</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">it works through double framing the work</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">will construct</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">a positive state of experience through</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:05.600" style="s2">closure by</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">uh by by creating an enclosed space</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.600" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">this enclosed space is then transcended</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:12.240" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">somewhere in the plot and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">here you can you can you can depict it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">following way inner frame outer frame is</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">first subjected to closure and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">there is some form of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">another thing that is very very typical</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">performance narratives is</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">that the heroes and heroines are</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">separated they&#39;re they&#39;re somehow shut</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">off from other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">this can be psychological it can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">physical or a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">both and here once more a uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">a graphic depiction of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">separation</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">and once more what happens here ideally</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">in in a performative work</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">is that these separated characters</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">transcend their isolation through</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">bonding with one another so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">the double framing and the bonding work</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">to produce at least or at least suggest</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">transcendent outcomes so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">basic</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">formula of performance narrative</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">uh also presented in rather a</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:24.399" style="s2">schematic simple way now um</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">the the movie that i&#39;d like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.399" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">about is</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:30.159" style="s2">parasite which is the oscar-winning</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">movie from 2019 it&#39;s also i think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.159" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">last movie that i saw before</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">covid struck the last movie i saw in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:38.799" style="s2">movie theater before</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">covid struck so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.799" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">it&#39;s still a little bit in my in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">the movie is quite complicated i reduced</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">rather drastically to uh to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">the basic idea if you haven&#39;t seen the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">movie is that a poor</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">korean family pretends to be unrelated</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">to one another</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">in order to gain access to the house of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">a rich family</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">uh who we see here to the right in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">inner frame</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">which is the rich families you can think</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">of as the rich</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">family&#39;s house where most of the action</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">takes place</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">uh the at some point the poor family</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">who are obviously are acting as</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">parasites in</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:24.480" style="s2">the sense of the movie&#39;s title uh take</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.480" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">the family&#39;s house and and and live it</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">up and uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">and have a good time uh unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">what happens there&#39;s a further</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.919" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">complication</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">that there is a second inner frame</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">within the first inner frame and this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:45.039" style="s2">a basement</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">room where another poor person</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">the the husband of the former</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">housekeeper who has been driven out by</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">family is hiding so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">the result is a bloody conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">these poor people and as a result</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">the the father of the poor family kills</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">the father of the rich family and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">think also the mother kills the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">housekeeper&#39;s husband resulting in an</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">enormous</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">bloodbath i&#39;m sorry if i take away the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">the ending of the movie</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">uh but uh it&#39;s unavoidable in this case</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">uh what happens is that the father hides</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">in the hidden</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.399" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">basement room where he remains</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">undiscovered</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">for i think four years this</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">the movie makes it sound plausible so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">have to accept this</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">and he now is now the radically</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">separated character that i spoke of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">earlier in other words he&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">cut off from all communication with</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">dream of a reunion where the son</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:48.159" style="s2">supports this this reunion this this</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.159" end="00:32:54.960" style="s2">transcendence of of of inside</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.600" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">and out so the two characters uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.960" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">bo ideally will bond somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">and uh the film suggests that they will</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:04.799" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:05.519" style="s2">reunited or maybe reunited and that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.799" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">father will</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.519" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">transcend his self-imposed captivity</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">so um this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">for this is in my opinion an exemplary</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">uh an exemplary film in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">it shows how this</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">double framing can work now</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">i&#39;d like to make a jump</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">or perhaps to summarize this</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:35.840" style="s2">the film forces us to identify with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">desire of the main characters to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.840" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">transcend what is a seemingly a hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">closed-off situation the film does this</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">using</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">an a biblical motif which is reunion of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">the father with the sun</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">the film also contains a critique of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:55.600" style="s2">social striving but this critique is</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">somewhat ambivalent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.600" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">uh because we want</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">the characters to succeed we want them</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">to become</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">wealthy we want them to occupy this rich</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">house and this this the striving</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">for transcendence in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:15.280" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">more important than the ethical problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.280" end="00:34:18.800" style="s2">raised by</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:20.480" style="s2">by their actions in doing so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.800" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">this tension between</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.480" end="00:34:28.639" style="s2">uh between doing bad things</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">or doing somewhat uh illegal things</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.639" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">in order to in order to better yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">in order to transcend</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">and then obviously the tension between</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">and legal things like hurting people</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">and the film leaves this open the film</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:49.359" style="s2">remains ambivalent in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">and this leads me into a another</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.359" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">field which is a performance culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">in politics and society and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">here i think one of the main points</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">is that proformatism is a reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">the complete triumph of global</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">capitalism i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:12.800" style="s2">there are very very few uh enclaves</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">where there is no capitalism maybe north</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.800" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">korea maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">belarus very very few countries there</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">are very very few countries where</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">the capitalism is as a economic system</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">function and this replaces</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:32.960" style="s2">the old post modernist or</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.839" end="00:35:35.320" style="s2">notion of a of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.960" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">of an opposition between a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.320" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">non-capitalist periphery that is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">going to resist</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">capitalist hegemony and first world</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">domination this uh this this model was</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">was very important in the 1870s 80s 90s</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.359" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">but i think that in terms of world</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">economic development it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">it it is now obsolete and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">performatism or performances culture is</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">reaction to this new uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">development what i think post-modernist</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">does in this situation where capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">capitalism is everywhere uh literally</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:24.079" style="s2">is that it creates</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">or gives us the ability in culture to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.079" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">create closed off</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">singular spaces within this global</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">capitalism and there are different</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">possibilities that this offers there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">resistance to capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">there is coexistence with capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">there is also</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">then the the co-optation of of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">capitalism which i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">you we find in the in parasite in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">movie that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">just saw that uh uh the movie</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">uh the movie in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">encourages us to co-opt uh co-op</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:01.440" style="s2">capitalism to uh to to better ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">or at least it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">it suggests that the characters are</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:08.640" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">performance culture also plays a role in</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.640" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">uh in what i would call post-ideological</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">politics now post-ideological politics</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">have been with us for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.839" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">no longer have two blocks we no longer</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">have a communist</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">and a a a capitalist system</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:32.320" style="s2">and the the grand ideologies as uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">as leotar was want to call them no</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.320" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:38.079" style="s2">exist in this sense but we do have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">of politics that is based on</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">belief whether good bad or</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">is now very often oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">performative belief systems and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">examples of this would be populism the</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.960" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">also are indicative of this that belief</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.440" end="00:38:15.119" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">uh almost more important than</p>

<p begin="00:39:48.960" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">last thing which is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">um uh the last uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">uh my last point is</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">performance and the pandemic which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">obviously uh affected by and</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">in terms of performatist culture</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:12.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve now been unified by the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.359" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">the virus which</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.319" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">you could think of as an outer frame</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:20.319" style="s2">that is enclosing everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">uh we&#39;re now all in confined to</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.319" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">enclosed spaces through lockdowns</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:26.560" style="s2">through quarantines uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">where in in a certain sense these would</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.560" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">be inner frames</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:33.680" style="s2">we follow rituals that closely resemble</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">religious practices like</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.680" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">masking avoiding physical contact stress</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">baking</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">all things that have religious</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">implications</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">of course unconsciously and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:48.880" style="s2">uh and and we also try to bond with what</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:51.839" style="s2">with others in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">all these restrictions from uh without</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.839" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.319" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">finally we&#39;re all awaiting an act of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">transcendence an act of salvation with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">vaccine the virus mutating to something</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">less harmful or</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">or whatever so this is um uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">so so in this rather strange</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">way grotesque way uh the virus</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">the the virus acts in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">in in a kind of a performantist way</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">without of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">being conscious of of doing so</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">and with that that&#39;s the end of my um</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:31.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the end of my</p>

<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">um is to uh</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">would you elaborate a little bit on um</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">on the relationship between performatism</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">and the pandemic because you could say</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:39.760" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s obviously it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">first no it&#39;s not the first time but how</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.760" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">is it different to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">you know spanish flu say 100 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:51.520" style="s2">like why is that not related to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">performance why is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.520" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">virus corona correlated to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:43:02.319" style="s2">to to covet um</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.839" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">well i wouldn&#39;t the the the this last uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.319" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">the last remarks about</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">um uh about the covet were</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">simply to show how how an act</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">something accidental is is translated</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">into cultural actions or can be can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">thought of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">in terms of a a certain cultural mindset</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.440" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know enough about the the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">the 1918</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">pandemic to to really compare it one</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">thing i do know about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">is is that everybody there there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">few um there are very few depictions of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">um right in cultural in works of culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">which is a little bit different now</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">there are now um i&#39;m aware there there</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">there are numerous essays there are also</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">attempts i think the the new york times</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">had a competition</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">for writers um to to express themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:59.200" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">about the pandemic um so</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.200" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">uh the main point is not that the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">the the 1918 pandemic was somehow</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">modernist in the way it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">it was depicted or in the way it was um</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.319" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">in the way people dealt with it uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">simply because i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">i i have no terms of comparison right</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">okay so but you did do a relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">uh to corona like and and performance</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">like where does it come from</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:32.400" style="s2">like is it just it can&#39;t be just</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:33.880" style="s2">arbitrary that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.400" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">say well there are like these</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.880" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">quasi-religious practices we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">and we are enclosed and it can&#39;t be just</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">circumstantial</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what i mean um it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit accidental um</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">but what it does show is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">of course the virus is is an accident in</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">in in</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">at least as far as we can tell right um</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s an accident and this accident</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:04.800" style="s2">simply</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">for for accidental reasons it fits in</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.800" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:09.680" style="s2">with our present cultural uh mindset</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">which is the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.680" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">the reason that i uh the the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">that i uh picked it out right but it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">it&#39;s essentially accidental right</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">so so um i mean would you say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">um the the paradigm which you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">describing</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">as as performatism has permeated our</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">culture that much</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a phenomenon that fits</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">narrative or that kind of yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">that would that would be the point is</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">that it fits in perfectly with</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">uh with with our cultural mindset and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">with our</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">and with what was going on in in in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">culture as a whole or what has been</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:55.200" style="s2">going on in culture as a whole for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.200" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">perhaps uh 15 20 years but but it is i</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">it is accidental though right right i</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">if um the participants can</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:13.520" style="s2">uh uh say something uh or if</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">they still muted um</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.520" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">can you please use the chat to tell me</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">um if you can say something</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">because i think i unmuted them but i</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">let&#39;s see um another</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">question that i had was about this</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">okay she was just okay perfect</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">okay um uh about the framing</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">so the question that i had was</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">um how can i employ</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.640" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">and use this model of framing and double</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">framing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">look at you know works of art because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">also seems a little bit arbitrary it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:06.160" style="s2">like like it&#39;s it&#39;s a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">act that i have to you know uh to use</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.160" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">like how do i use this model to to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">assess a work of art you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">layman</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">you know if i if i&#39;m confronted with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">with a movie like parasite</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">you know what i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">basically don&#39;t have to you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">usually don&#39;t have to think very hard</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">because these</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">type of movies or books or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">force you to make identifications that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">you would normally not make i think</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">that that&#39;s the one main criteria if</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for a performance this</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">work of art</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2">does this work force me to identify</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">myself with something that normally i</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t identify</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">myself with like with a knife murderer</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">in this particular case</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">right and the the second point is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:05.119" style="s2">is this and this is also very closely</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">connected to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">problem of identification is there how</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">is this meant ironically</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">right is there is is this work making</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">fun of me</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">is it making fun of the characters is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:21.040" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">um and uh i don&#39;t believe that i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">if you take these two criteria as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.520" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">layman and apply them to anything that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">you read or watch</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">you&#39;ll be able to you&#39;ll be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">a pretty good idea of what what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">performance</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">and what is not right also subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">without going through all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">okay involved okay i think lena has a</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">lena do you hear me yes i do</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">my camera doesn&#39;t work on this computer</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">right well thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">uh for this interesting lecture uh so</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">you brought out</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">uh three examples of architecture the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">modern functionalistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">skyscraper than the atnt building which</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">postmodern and had these um</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">sort of ironical uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">applications the um the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">chippendale and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">art deco and then the opera house</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">in hamburg or concert hall in hamburg</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">which has i think the the bottom part</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">the red</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2">brick part was was that an original</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:35.599" style="s2">building that had the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">the gray part with the light and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.599" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">sort of the waves on top added to it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">yes it wasn&#39;t originally i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">a warehouse of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:51.040" style="s2">yeah um and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">um so the the first one is strictly</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.040" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">functionalistic and very sort of machine</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:57.760" style="s2">like then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:49:59.440" style="s2">second one which is the postmodern with</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.760" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">the ironical distance to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.440" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">something human made in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">then you have the opera house that has</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">a stylized piece of nature namely the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:15.359" style="s2">ocean or you could also see the waves on</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">top as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.359" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">sails on a sailboat or something very</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">organic that it that is added to</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">something non-organic at all</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">and so i was wondering if there is in</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">this transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">in the um performative</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">framework is is there a relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">nature that is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">there in in the modern and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.240" end="00:50:47.040" style="s2">post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:48.079" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a a a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.079" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">um in this particular case</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">i think there is but</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">in this also in this particular case</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:03.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s constructed nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">in other words it&#39;s not an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.040" end="00:51:09.760" style="s2">uh integrate nature into directly</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">into the um into the the into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.760" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">architectural structure</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">uh that would something be something</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">more more even perhaps more post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:20.240" style="s2">that the post-post-modern buildings you</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">know with grassy roofs and with</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.240" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">the nature around them um</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">the postmodern or the excuse me the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:36.480" style="s2">performance architecture that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">seen or described up to now tends to to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">to be very very constructed and when</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">nature does appear as sort of when</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">something natural does appear</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">then as as a very clearly marked</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">construct</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">as as in this case so it&#39;s not a back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.960" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">right right so would you do you see this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:52:04.319" style="s2">do you see this uh epoch in</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:07.359" style="s2">in culture as uh coming towards an end</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.319" end="00:52:09.839" style="s2">or is is this continuing do you see</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.359" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">something else replacing it now</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.839" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">because this is this has really been</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:14.079" style="s2">going on for 30 years which according to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.079" end="00:52:17.200" style="s2">definition of post-modernism was also 30</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.200" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">yeah basically it should be it should be</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">on its way out</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">but i haven&#39;t seen uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">seen anything that is is is radically</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:33.280" style="s2">different from it up to now</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s also possible that i have uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">performative blinders on that i&#39;m simply</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">uh so so taken by uh by by the theory</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">itself that i don&#39;t see these things</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:44.960" style="s2">this is also</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">possible in cognitive terms but</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.960" end="00:52:48.240" style="s2">up to now i haven&#39;t seen anything that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">uh that that would suggest that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">radically different out there that is is</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">replacing it at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.240" end="00:52:59.599" style="s2">but i&#39;m always open suggestions you just</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.599" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">nature so i was wondering i mean some of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:04.800" style="s2">the new architecture</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">is as you said i mean there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">grass on the roof and your</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:11.920" style="s2">uh i</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">i would even guess that even though it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.920" end="00:53:14.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like nature but as you said</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.720" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a human uh replica replication of</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:22.000" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">it might actually be a co2 neutral</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.000" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">building i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:30.240" style="s2">the hamburg um concept building here</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:32.400" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know i&#39;m just i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.240" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">you know thinking that it it may not</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.400" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">look as if it&#39;s in harmony with nature</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">but it might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">but then there is a visual aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">harmony with nature which you brought it</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">up yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">which is so is nature integrated into</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">architecture and that might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">one of the future</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:56.960" style="s2">uh or what is currently in the making</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.119" end="00:53:59.839" style="s2">because i mean it takes a while</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.960" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">to to create a building so i mean if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:04.240" style="s2">compare to</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:06.000" style="s2">fashion for instance that that shifts</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">two to three times per year you have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:11.280" style="s2">new collection three of two or three</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:12.960" style="s2">four times per year and so you design it</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.280" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">within six months before it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.960" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">market but but a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:19.760" style="s2">building a concert hall i mean that&#39;s 10</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:22.400" style="s2">15 years in the making maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.760" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">so what we see as architecture now was</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:28.240" style="s2">an idea for a very long i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">just an idea a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.240" end="00:54:34.240" style="s2">so so the the trends the uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">the values the aesthetics that manifest</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">themselves in architecture</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">uh half</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">they were they emerged earlier than we</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">see them now because it takes a time it</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">takes a while to build it</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s entirely possible i i i</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:55.839" style="s2">kind of keep my eyes peeled for new</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">buildings when i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:54:59.200" style="s2">in different cities uh up to now i</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.200" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">anything like that but as i said and i</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">think as you also properly said that</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">these in architecture it takes a a</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">longer time</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">very often for these things to to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:18.319" style="s2">realized and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">but as of now i haven&#39;t seen anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">drastically different from from these</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">performatist</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">buildings</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.960" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">well can i chime in just for a second</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">because like uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">staying on topic of of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">philharmony it&#39;s like um the that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">architect used nature as far underst as</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">i understand it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:44.480" style="s2">a means to an end because it seems as</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">you said like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.480" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">like a transcendent heavenly thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:54.799" style="s2">appearing as like nature as water but</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s prime is or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.799" end="00:55:59.359" style="s2">important is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:56:01.440" style="s2">experience of heavenly beauty uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">and and and and what&#39;s the point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.440" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">not the point</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">that it&#39;s uh imitating nature but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">more the the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">beauty and and and some</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:16.480" style="s2">outer worldly form manifesting on top of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.720" end="00:56:18.000" style="s2">of the factory hall and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.480" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.000" end="00:56:22.480" style="s2">uh what it&#39;s about it&#39;s not about nature</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:26.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s about the experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:30.319" style="s2">um mediated through imitation of nature</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.559" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">do i get that right that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.319" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">precisely what i would have said is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">nature is a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">um but what is what is really most</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">important is this this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:46.480" style="s2">of transcendence of somehow</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:48.559" style="s2">apprehending transcendence um</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">and there are other aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.559" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">building that that also</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:54.960" style="s2">that demonstrate that i think that if</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s broken off in different</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.960" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">places that the top is</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:57:00.880" style="s2">is separated from the bottom it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:03.359" style="s2">float on the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.880" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">it has other aspects that all convey</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:09.760" style="s2">of impossibility that that suggests</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.760" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">so you have to discard disbelief</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">actively</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">and so and i think that that is also is</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:20.720" style="s2">could you describe that also as a frame</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:21.520" style="s2">that you have to set that frame to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.720" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">discard</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.520" end="00:57:25.119" style="s2">you know you mentioned in your book like</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:26.319" style="s2">the american what what&#39;s the movie</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.119" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">american</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.319" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">american beauty american beauty or or</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:31.839" style="s2">life of pi</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:33.040" style="s2">where you have like these opposing</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.839" end="00:57:36.240" style="s2">descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.040" end="00:57:39.200" style="s2">of what happened on the boat uh and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:40.319" style="s2">you have like like one realistic and one</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.200" end="00:57:43.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.319" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">more mythical or more fantastic way of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:50.160" style="s2">describing the events but the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">the the work of art forces you</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.160" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">to to maybe choose the more unrealistic</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:57.119" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">fantastical one because it it</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.119" end="00:58:01.280" style="s2">points to a higher form of love or</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.000" end="00:58:04.319" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.280" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">you know and so it does does</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">does that is that a framing</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:11.839" style="s2">to discard disbelief and to to to choose</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.839" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">or or what what is that do you</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">know about him yes i know i know what</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s uh in ideal terms it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not a cognitive decision in other</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">words it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:29.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not the result of some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">reflection about do i want to discard</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.119" end="00:58:32.319" style="s2">belief</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">and uh rather a disbelief and do i want</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.319" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">to believe</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:40.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s rather a case of of of uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">belief imposing itself right and so that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.559" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">i guess</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">i can&#39;t resist this belief there&#39;s a see</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:48.880" style="s2">i do not know your book i only heard</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:51.920" style="s2">this lecture now so</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.880" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">uh but the story of pi uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.920" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a a crucial line in in</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:59:01.760" style="s2">in that movie um which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">reason why he was telling the story in</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">that way was because reality was too</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">unbearable yeah so the real story i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:14.160" style="s2">what actually happened on that boat um</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.520" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">i think his mother was killed uh by one</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:21.440" style="s2">sailors or something like that so um</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">so he turns this into a parable and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.440" end="00:59:27.520" style="s2">an entirely symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.319" end="00:59:30.400" style="s2">myth myth that he creates yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.520" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">he simply cannot bear to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.400" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">yeah or the the objective truth but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.079" end="00:59:40.799" style="s2">a spiritual truth exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:44.079" style="s2">um and if we look at that um</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">concert hall there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.079" end="00:59:47.280" style="s2">some of the same there because i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:51.839" style="s2">the original red brick building is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.720" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.839" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">if that was an old warehouse of of</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="00:59:59.520" style="s2">modernism</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">and of capitalism and of of all this</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.520" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">maybe unbearable stuff then it has this</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">piece of beauty on top of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">which becomes a narrative and it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.839" end="01:00:11.599" style="s2">also i mean that is reflecting the sea</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">it is on the harbor</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.599" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">yes i even lived</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">so i wonder if if uh if part of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">performance</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.359" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">is really because there is something</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">that is so un unbearable</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">that we have to beautify it we have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">turn it into a narrative that is grander</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:34.240" style="s2">than that unbearable reality that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:37.920" style="s2">actually facing</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.240" end="01:00:41.839" style="s2">um in a certain sense yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.920" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">one thing that i didn&#39;t talk about uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.839" end="01:00:43.599" style="s2">much in the lecture because it would</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.200" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.599" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">too complicated and leads into all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">of philosophical questions is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:53.599" style="s2">um that this this this type of mindset</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">aesthetics yes i can&#39;t even pronounce it</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.599" end="01:00:58.319" style="s2">as statisticizes</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:01:00.319" style="s2">reality which is exactly what you uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.319" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">what you described here is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.319" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">um the tendency is to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">uh to present ugly reality or to to</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:10.880" style="s2">regard reality as something ugly as</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">something that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.880" end="01:01:14.720" style="s2">threatening and that to try to make it</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:17.760" style="s2">bearable</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.720" end="01:01:20.799" style="s2">through the aesthetic means</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.760" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">and this leads also to spiritualization</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.799" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">at least to aesthetization</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:27.040" style="s2">and these things very often go uh go go</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.000" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">hand in hand</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.040" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">and these the like the life of pi</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">views this is something positive i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s you would agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:39.440" style="s2">the book is not making fun of</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.760" end="01:01:41.760" style="s2">a pie or who follow his</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.440" end="01:01:42.720" style="s2">uh who who choose the more beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.760" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.720" end="01:01:46.319" style="s2">um it&#39;s an attitude it&#39;s a mindset that</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.319" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">then yourself reproject onto the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">and maybe cause that ugly uh ugly world</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">to to</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">to to to become better in some way i</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">think that&#39;s how an ethics of</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.280" end="01:02:02.640" style="s2">of of performatism would work</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:04.319" style="s2">i i think the same thing is in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.640" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">painting with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.319" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">yellow raincoat i mean that&#39;s uh this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">very bleak uh surrounding</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s gray and it&#39;s raining and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">uh basically europe and freaking october</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">like now um and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">that is that is kind of unbearable and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:24.880" style="s2">you know that you have like four months</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:27.359" style="s2">ahead with the same kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.880" end="01:02:28.079" style="s2">crappy weather so uh and in that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.359" end="01:02:30.960" style="s2">have that</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.079" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">bright yellow raincoat and a child maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.960" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">even playing in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">in the water and the rain there so i</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">think there is that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:39.760" style="s2">you know ping-pong between the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:43.119" style="s2">unbearable and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.760" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">and the beauty and the um</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.119" end="01:02:47.359" style="s2">making it bearable yes that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s very definitely a</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.359" end="01:02:53.680" style="s2">a part of of performatism and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.880" end="01:02:55.599" style="s2">as i said it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:59.440" style="s2">of a gut reaction against</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.599" end="01:03:04.160" style="s2">uh postmodernism which tends to</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.440" end="01:03:07.039" style="s2">uh simply stick its finger in the wound</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.160" end="01:03:07.599" style="s2">continually in other words to uh to to</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.039" end="01:03:10.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:11.839" style="s2">to to to demonstrate to us that any</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.480" end="01:03:14.160" style="s2">attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.839" end="01:03:15.359" style="s2">to be to experience beauty or experience</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.160" end="01:03:18.559" style="s2">anything higher</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.359" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">it is an illusion that will keep us from</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.559" end="01:03:23.039" style="s2">facing</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">uh facing harsh reality so</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.039" end="01:03:27.440" style="s2">you i mean both both mindsets are</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.440" end="01:03:33.359" style="s2">but in cultural terms i think this uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">the the post-modern mindset set has</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.359" end="01:03:37.280" style="s2">outlived itself</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">that it&#39;s uh it&#39;s now perceived as</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.280" end="01:03:41.039" style="s2">simply being</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">irony for the sake of of irony&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.039" end="01:03:46.160" style="s2">it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:49.200" style="s2">um people want this this this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.160" end="01:03:52.000" style="s2">uh these these kind of higher higher</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.200" end="01:03:52.000" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:04:01.039" style="s2">so how do you how do you see</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.520" end="01:04:05.520" style="s2">beauty because i mean that is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.039" end="01:04:07.599" style="s2">the concert hall i mean it is beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.520" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">um it also has a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.599" end="01:04:12.160" style="s2">ugliness i was actually there and when</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">you go up with the escalator it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.160" end="01:04:16.799" style="s2">you have to go through that sort of tube</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:18.079" style="s2">of ugliness before you get to the beauty</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.799" end="01:04:21.440" style="s2">of the building</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.079" end="01:04:24.400" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.440" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">so but i guess i mean beauty is in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.400" end="01:04:28.000" style="s2">eye of the beholder</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">but still there is something objectively</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.000" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">beauty beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.839" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">in that concert hall building and</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:34.559" style="s2">there&#39;s something beautiful in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:38.079" style="s2">childhood the red</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.559" end="01:04:41.440" style="s2">in the yellow uh raincoat</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.079" end="01:04:43.760" style="s2">so so the fact that we dare</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.440" end="01:04:45.440" style="s2">we dare appreciate beauty show beauty</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.760" end="01:04:47.359" style="s2">have beauty</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.440" end="01:04:49.280" style="s2">and i mean that is also transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.359" end="01:04:51.200" style="s2">emotion</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.280" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">because it it connects us with something</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.200" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">deeper inside ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">if we dare uh subjugate ourselves to</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">beauty and just experience it as beauty</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">my sentiments exactly this is yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.640" end="01:05:06.319" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.160" end="01:05:07.280" style="s2">also one of the i think one of the main</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:09.599" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.280" end="01:05:11.359" style="s2">driving principles behind this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.599" end="01:05:14.880" style="s2">cultural development</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.359" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">but so i would like to</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.880" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">because you bring in the modern and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">post-modern and both of those</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:24.960" style="s2">are very individualistic i mean the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">the individual plays a really strong</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.960" end="01:05:30.240" style="s2">role in both</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:31.440" style="s2">epochs in our history and philosophy and</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.240" end="01:05:34.240" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.440" end="01:05:35.440" style="s2">but before that we had a traditional</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.240" end="01:05:36.079" style="s2">culture and that&#39;s where we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.440" end="01:05:39.599" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.079" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we uh used beauty</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.599" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">to connect people</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.760" end="01:05:51.119" style="s2">and to build societies and cohesion</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">and to transcend collectively perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:56.240" style="s2">even but also as an individual</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.520" end="01:05:57.359" style="s2">to aim for something higher than the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.240" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.359" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">uh society i mean the posterity the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:07.119" style="s2">divine whatever we want to call it um</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:12.720" style="s2">so do you see in i mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.119" end="01:06:14.960" style="s2">something beyond uh the performative</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.720" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">that could relate back to something that</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.960" end="01:06:21.760" style="s2">is also connecting people because</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:22.799" style="s2">uh the i mean the child in that painting</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.760" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">is very</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.799" end="01:06:29.119" style="s2">very much alone yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">um yes that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.119" end="01:06:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s this is a big problem in other</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:36.000" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">ideally i suppose that this performance</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.000" end="01:06:39.760" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.960" end="01:06:40.960" style="s2">ethics that i was talking about that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.760" end="01:06:43.280" style="s2">let beauty or</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.960" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">some sort of higher form of experience</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.280" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">work upon yourself and then you project</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.119" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">it back onto others</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:53.599" style="s2">would result in collective uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">some sort of a collective mindset that</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.599" end="01:06:56.880" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:57.920" style="s2">some sort of collective experience that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.880" end="01:07:00.799" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.920" end="01:07:01.920" style="s2">positive in a certain way when you of</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.799" end="01:07:04.960" style="s2">course look at our</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.920" end="01:07:07.839" style="s2">reality and that the pandemic was is</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.960" end="01:07:08.960" style="s2">actually a good example of that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.839" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">pandemic were all</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.960" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">exposed to the same external</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">factors in the pandemic for the most</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.480" end="01:07:18.319" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:18.960" style="s2">and uh of course it doesn&#39;t quite work</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.319" end="01:07:22.400" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.960" end="01:07:24.880" style="s2">that uh you have people who deny the</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.400" end="01:07:26.480" style="s2">deny the existence of the virus you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.880" end="01:07:30.079" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.480" end="01:07:32.559" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s not quite as uh um</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.079" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">is the result is not quite as uplifting</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.559" end="01:07:36.319" style="s2">as what</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:38.079" style="s2">one might one might hope but but what</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.319" end="01:07:39.839" style="s2">you say is also true that this would be</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">the ideal of</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.839" end="01:07:45.520" style="s2">if performatism would be would realize</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:46.960" style="s2">itself in a in a positive way this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.520" end="01:07:49.839" style="s2">the direction that it would</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.960" end="01:07:51.039" style="s2">go in uh unfortunately it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.839" end="01:07:54.079" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.039" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">not going to happen the the way things</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.079" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">the way things look</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.920" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">how do you mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:06.319" style="s2">i mean you you you think that we will</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.440" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">remain as</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.319" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">fragmented as societies individuals and</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:13.119" style="s2">societies</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">as as we have been for the past 30 and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.119" end="01:08:17.759" style="s2">60 years</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.079" end="01:08:21.040" style="s2">or so you don&#39;t think that will change</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.759" end="01:08:23.279" style="s2">um i&#39;m not a prophet i</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.040" end="01:08:25.279" style="s2">i am also not a sociologist this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.279" end="01:08:28.199" style="s2">something that uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.279" end="01:08:29.920" style="s2">this is this is more uh something that</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.199" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">sociologists</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:34.880" style="s2">or students of um of of religion would</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:38.080" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.880" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">would have to look at more closely uh it</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:40.960" style="s2">will be certainly be</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:42.560" style="s2">interesting to see whether the pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.960" end="01:08:46.080" style="s2">leads to any sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.560" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">new cohesiveness um perhaps in certain</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.080" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">regards it</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:51.920" style="s2">it has and will but at the moment of</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:52.319" style="s2">course we&#39;re in the middle of it and</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.920" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.319" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to tell</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.319" end="01:09:00.880" style="s2">i mean the interesting thing is that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.400" end="01:09:02.960" style="s2">pandemic is actually the first time</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.880" end="01:09:03.920" style="s2">uh in human history that we all work</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.960" end="01:09:05.839" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.920" end="01:09:07.199" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s like we have these</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.839" end="01:09:09.839" style="s2">daily exercises</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.199" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">and this lockdowns and washing hands and</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.839" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">whatever but this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">basically like a like daily exercise</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:16.640" style="s2">we&#39;re all doing together</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:19.199" style="s2">yeah and so that&#39;s basically the first</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.640" end="01:09:21.040" style="s2">time in history that that happened</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.199" end="01:09:23.120" style="s2">yeah that we all work together and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.040" end="01:09:26.239" style="s2">that&#39;s and we&#39;re we&#39;re all on</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.120" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">soon together separate but we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.239" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">zoomed together this is once more the</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">paradox of</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">the the paradox that i was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:33.520" style="s2">also with social media we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:35.679" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">we&#39;re all here and at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.679" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">we&#39;re uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:39.839" style="s2">we&#39;re obviously uh simply little pixels</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.359" end="01:09:43.279" style="s2">on on</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.839" end="01:09:46.400" style="s2">on the screen uh so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.279" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of uh um there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.400" end="01:09:51.279" style="s2">of split in in this</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">in the way we we deal with this</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.279" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">there there is also a shared sense of</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:58.719" style="s2">irony towards</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">2020 i mean that has become a thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.719" end="01:10:03.600" style="s2">i mean this this year is so weird and</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">it&#39;s all around the globe it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.600" end="01:10:07.600" style="s2">seven eight billion people suffering</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.480" end="01:10:09.520" style="s2">from the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.600" end="01:10:11.679" style="s2">silly year where everything just seems</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.520" end="01:10:17.120" style="s2">to go haywire</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.679" end="01:10:20.239" style="s2">and everybody everybody notices it</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.120" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">yeah exactly and once more whether this</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.239" end="01:10:27.840" style="s2">actually uh in the final analysis</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:30.000" style="s2">results in some sort of you know basal</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.840" end="01:10:34.000" style="s2">change in human consciousnesses</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:36.159" style="s2">is of course is asking a lot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s possible but it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.159" end="01:10:40.320" style="s2">moment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.760" end="01:10:41.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear that that will happen</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:42.960" style="s2">that&#39;s why why are you saying</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.440" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">consciousness because</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.960" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">lena if i may because lena is uh she</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">studied uh theology if i if i remember</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:53.120" style="s2">right and she wrote a couple of books</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:54.080" style="s2">uh on metamodernism for example and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.120" end="01:10:56.800" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:58.400" style="s2">uh the nordic secret and um what i was</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.800" end="01:11:01.679" style="s2">wondering like if</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.400" end="01:11:02.320" style="s2">is there you know because metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.679" end="01:11:04.640" style="s2">connects</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.320" end="01:11:05.360" style="s2">cultural stages also like very broadly</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.640" end="01:11:06.800" style="s2">speaking to</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.360" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">cognitive development and</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.800" end="01:11:11.280" style="s2">self-authorship and self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:12.560" style="s2">in a kind of way so if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.280" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">performatism</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.560" end="01:11:18.640" style="s2">is there uh is is there</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.920" end="01:11:20.640" style="s2">an increase of some form of world</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.640" end="01:11:23.679" style="s2">building of sense making of</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:26.800" style="s2">of complexity of of yeah say</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.679" end="01:11:28.880" style="s2">psychological development a need to to</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.800" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">participate or to create</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.880" end="01:11:32.719" style="s2">uh such works of art or is it like</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:36.560" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.719" end="01:11:40.800" style="s2">separated just like cultural phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.560" end="01:11:43.760" style="s2">as a cultural phenomenon um</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.800" end="01:11:44.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s very hard to say um one of</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.760" end="01:11:46.560" style="s2">the my</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.320" end="01:11:47.920" style="s2">my basic ideas is that uh that</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.560" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">performatism</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.920" end="01:11:52.800" style="s2">uh works mainly on the the level of</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:56.560" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.800" end="01:11:58.480" style="s2">in other words that uh it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.560" end="01:12:00.080" style="s2">it does raise your consciousness or</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.480" end="01:12:00.719" style="s2">change your consciousness in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.080" end="01:12:03.360" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.719" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">uh but not through reflection uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.360" end="01:12:06.960" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:09.360" style="s2">mainly through uh the the these</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.960" end="01:12:11.520" style="s2">the experiencing of these uh higher</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.360" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">states of</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">of of of whatever love beauty</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:19.120" style="s2">these positive higher states that are</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">being imposed on us</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.120" end="01:12:27.280" style="s2">um so it&#39;s mainly mainly intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.520" end="01:12:30.640" style="s2">so that i don&#39;t i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.280" end="01:12:32.960" style="s2">thought about how it could be translated</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.640" end="01:12:35.120" style="s2">or transferred into</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.960" end="01:12:36.560" style="s2">into into into into actual</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.120" end="01:12:40.239" style="s2">self-improvement</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.560" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">in in that in that sense i don&#39;t uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.239" end="01:12:43.360" style="s2">well not so much self-improvement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">maturational it&#39;s natural it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.360" end="01:12:47.679" style="s2">maturation yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:48.880" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s it it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.679" end="01:12:50.560" style="s2">possible but</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.880" end="01:12:52.000" style="s2">like i said this is it&#39;s it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.560" end="01:12:56.560" style="s2">bit out of my</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.000" end="01:12:59.840" style="s2">uh uh out of my uh out of my box it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.560" end="01:13:05.840" style="s2">uh i i simply haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.840" end="01:13:05.840" style="s2">haven&#39;t dealt with that right</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.600" end="01:13:10.960" style="s2">but you might i mean like like one one</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.000" end="01:13:14.000" style="s2">of lena&#39;s books</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.960" end="01:13:17.120" style="s2">deals with you know works of art</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">you know in in the german history</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.120" end="01:13:22.800" style="s2">like and how they uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:24.560" style="s2">connect very well to stages of</p>

<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:43.199" style="s2">these were the ideals put</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.600" end="01:13:45.280" style="s2">forward by the german philosophers and</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.199" end="01:13:47.520" style="s2">can very well describe by psychology</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.280" end="01:13:49.600" style="s2">today and so you have to think about</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.520" end="01:13:51.440" style="s2">you know when if if they created works</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.600" end="01:13:54.560" style="s2">of art and literature and</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.440" end="01:13:55.679" style="s2">so like what kind of psychological stage</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.560" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">of development</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.679" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">corresponds to performatism or</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:01.679" style="s2">metamodernism or</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:03.120" style="s2">whatever you know it&#39;s like it has to</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.679" end="01:14:06.000" style="s2">come from somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.120" end="01:14:06.719" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not like arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.000" end="01:14:09.120" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.719" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">itself out of itself you know what i</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.120" end="01:14:15.920" style="s2">mean it&#39;s like there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:19.600" style="s2">a form of cognitive mindset</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.920" end="01:14:23.199" style="s2">to you know to approach yeah i would</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.600" end="01:14:25.040" style="s2">i would be able to um yes</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.199" end="01:14:26.560" style="s2">to deal with the term cognitive mindset</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.040" end="01:14:28.000" style="s2">i think that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.560" end="01:14:29.920" style="s2">that&#39;s more like what it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:32.080" style="s2">uh i can&#39;t say i can&#39;t say anything</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.920" end="01:14:34.080" style="s2">about how that ties in with</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.080" end="01:14:35.920" style="s2">uh german philosophy i would have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.080" end="01:14:37.280" style="s2">read leona&#39;s book which i would be</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.920" end="01:14:39.199" style="s2">interested in looking at but at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.280" end="01:14:41.600" style="s2">moment i can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.199" end="01:14:43.760" style="s2">comment on it i like to hear that i</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.600" end="01:14:46.239" style="s2">can&#39;t comment on it</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.760" end="01:14:46.239" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.520" end="01:14:51.920" style="s2">right so i think it was the um</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.600" end="01:14:57.120" style="s2">or let me put it in a different way i</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.480" end="01:15:00.400" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.120" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">the what we call art uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.400" end="01:15:04.480" style="s2">the difference between art and</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:06.480" style="s2">entertainment and we&#39;re we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.480" end="01:15:07.760" style="s2">we&#39;re in the the field of the aesthetics</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.480" end="01:15:09.600" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.760" end="01:15:11.199" style="s2">so that can be architecture that can be</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.600" end="01:15:14.400" style="s2">art that can be fashion</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.199" end="01:15:16.159" style="s2">but it&#39;s any kind of symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.400" end="01:15:19.840" style="s2">representation of</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.159" end="01:15:22.080" style="s2">what is important to us and</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.840" end="01:15:23.840" style="s2">the way that i distinguish between</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.080" end="01:15:26.320" style="s2">entertainment and art is that</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.840" end="01:15:29.679" style="s2">entertainment confirms</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.320" end="01:15:32.800" style="s2">uh and reproduces what we already know</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.679" end="01:15:36.640" style="s2">so it makes us feel safe but</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.800" end="01:15:39.120" style="s2">art expands our symbolic world</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.640" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">and it expands what we&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.120" end="01:15:43.360" style="s2">communicating to one another</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:44.400" style="s2">and so we have different areas of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:46.239" style="s2">arts we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.400" end="01:15:47.840" style="s2">architecture we&#39;ve got music we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.239" end="01:15:51.360" style="s2">design we got</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.840" end="01:15:53.440" style="s2">um poetry got theater i mean there are</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.360" end="01:15:54.800" style="s2">paintings all these different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.440" end="01:15:58.080" style="s2">arts and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.800" end="01:16:00.560" style="s2">expanding our our symbolic world and our</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.080" end="01:16:01.120" style="s2">way of being in this world and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.560" end="01:16:04.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.120" end="01:16:08.480" style="s2">the arts expand our</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">symbolic world and we do not have yet</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.480" end="01:16:12.239" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:12.719" style="s2">symbols that it is creating it will have</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.239" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.719" end="01:16:16.880" style="s2">the intuition of those who are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:20.000" style="s2">on the fringes of</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.880" end="01:16:23.280" style="s2">of the culture those who come up with a</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.000" end="01:16:26.320" style="s2">sentiment that hasn&#39;t been put into</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.280" end="01:16:27.040" style="s2">symbols yet who create those symbols and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.320" end="01:16:30.719" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.040" end="01:16:33.360" style="s2">we call them artists um</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.719" end="01:16:35.040" style="s2">or great architects because they</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.360" end="01:16:38.159" style="s2">captured something</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.040" end="01:16:41.360" style="s2">far enough in advance that was still</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.159" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">somehow meaningful to the investors in</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.360" end="01:16:44.719" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:46.320" style="s2">buildings that allowed them to design</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.719" end="01:16:48.239" style="s2">the kind of building and build it and</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.320" end="01:16:50.960" style="s2">here we are with with</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:52.560" style="s2">architecture that someone i mean that</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.960" end="01:16:55.520" style="s2">that points forward</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.560" end="01:16:58.080" style="s2">but was actually conceived maybe 5 10 or</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.520" end="01:17:01.040" style="s2">15 years earlier</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.080" end="01:17:01.280" style="s2">and that expresses who we are or who we</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.040" end="01:17:04.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.280" end="01:17:06.320" style="s2">about to become um and</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.400" end="01:17:08.800" style="s2">that makes it all right so yes we are in</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.320" end="01:17:12.320" style="s2">the intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.800" end="01:17:16.800" style="s2">field uh but that intuition</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.320" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">it it points in a direction</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:20.560" style="s2">yes i completely agree that uh in other</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:23.520" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.560" end="01:17:25.840" style="s2">um there is this at some point in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.520" end="01:17:29.440" style="s2">mid 90s it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard to say</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.840" end="01:17:32.560" style="s2">where or when it exactly started this</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.440" end="01:17:35.920" style="s2">this this this intuition of creative</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.560" end="01:17:39.440" style="s2">people began and uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.920" end="01:17:41.360" style="s2">it it it it began in</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.440" end="01:17:43.120" style="s2">it began all over the place it began as</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.360" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">i said i started out in russia and i</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.120" end="01:17:46.080" style="s2">quickly discovered</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.000" end="01:17:48.480" style="s2">it was it was in america it was</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.080" end="01:17:52.159" style="s2">eventually in germany also</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.480" end="01:17:56.840" style="s2">uh so that uh and this intuition also</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.159" end="01:18:00.400" style="s2">also spread to become a collective</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.840" end="01:18:02.880" style="s2">um almost a collective consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.400" end="01:18:03.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s even trickled down i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.880" end="01:18:05.600" style="s2">trickled down to</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.840" end="01:18:07.600" style="s2">to popular culture to what you called</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.600" end="01:18:13.520" style="s2">entertainment that right</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.600" end="01:18:15.280" style="s2">yeah and so i mean if if we were to</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.520" end="01:18:17.280" style="s2">um and one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.280" end="01:18:19.520" style="s2">interesting right now because of social</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.280" end="01:18:23.040" style="s2">media and because of technology</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.520" end="01:18:23.600" style="s2">um in the west we have we have driven</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.040" end="01:18:28.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.600" end="01:18:30.960" style="s2">uh development since the last 500 years</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.960" end="01:18:32.960" style="s2">and there has been a sort of a natural</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.960" end="01:18:34.320" style="s2">barrier between our culture and other</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.960" end="01:18:37.920" style="s2">cultures because</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.320" end="01:18:40.719" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t the communicational tools</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.920" end="01:18:41.920" style="s2">to spread all this information all these</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.719" end="01:18:44.640" style="s2">stories and</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.920" end="01:18:47.360" style="s2">symbols but with mass media and</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.640" end="01:18:50.800" style="s2">particularly with social media</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.360" end="01:18:54.320" style="s2">500 years of aesthetics</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.800" end="01:19:00.239" style="s2">are suddenly worldwide in no time</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.320" end="01:19:00.239" style="s2">and this whole um conflict or</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.280" end="01:19:04.960" style="s2">clash between the the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.920" end="01:19:07.199" style="s2">society and</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.960" end="01:19:08.480" style="s2">aesthetics and values and the modern</p>

<p begin="01:19:08.480" end="01:19:13.360" style="s2">and aesthetics and values and</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.960" end="01:19:19.520" style="s2">post-modern with the irony</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.360" end="01:19:22.000" style="s2">uh and also with the performatism here</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.520" end="01:19:23.320" style="s2">that is like all over the place around</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.000" end="01:19:25.600" style="s2">the globe</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.320" end="01:19:26.320" style="s2">simultaneously so there are a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:19:26.320" end="01:19:32.960" style="s2">outside the western civilization</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.440" end="01:19:34.080" style="s2">that have to face both the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.960" end="01:19:37.040" style="s2">society and</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.080" end="01:19:38.080" style="s2">modernism and post-modernism and this</p>

<p begin="01:19:38.080" end="01:19:43.920" style="s2">and you know everything simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:45.760" style="s2">and they have a tremendous challenge</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.920" end="01:19:49.040" style="s2">figuring out which is what and</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.760" end="01:19:52.159" style="s2">and how to navigate this we after all</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.040" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">are have had sort of a progressive</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.159" end="01:19:56.719" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:20:01.360" style="s2">of these increasingly complex</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.719" end="01:20:04.400" style="s2">and self-referential aesthetic systems</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.360" end="01:20:07.600" style="s2">yeah i i once again i i agree that</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.400" end="01:20:09.920" style="s2">this is uh this is the new uh challenge</p>

<p begin="01:25:00.320" end="01:25:04.159" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a difficult process</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:07.600" style="s2">in all these countries because</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.159" end="01:25:10.480" style="s2">they are split between populism</p>

<p begin="01:26:27.040" end="01:26:30.960" style="s2">there&#39;s never really been a civil</p>

<p begin="01:27:12.800" end="01:27:18.719" style="s2">very nice conversation here too i was</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.880" end="01:27:20.320" style="s2">uh so i&#39;ll try to take a look at at one</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.719" end="01:27:21.679" style="s2">of your books and see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.320" end="01:27:24.800" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.679" end="01:27:25.520" style="s2">and uh yeah yeah one one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.800" end="01:27:28.000" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.520" end="01:27:30.000" style="s2">interests me and i never had the chance</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.000" end="01:27:33.199" style="s2">is like what what happens</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.000" end="01:27:34.400" style="s2">when uh they are like uh proponents of</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.199" end="01:27:37.280" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.400" end="01:27:39.600" style="s2">uh uh systems of thought you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.280" end="01:27:42.080" style="s2">dealing with post-post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.600" end="01:27:42.719" style="s2">say metamodernism performatism integral</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.080" end="01:27:46.239" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.719" end="01:27:47.840" style="s2">a couple of uh uh developmental</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.239" end="01:27:48.719" style="s2">psychologist bringing them all to a</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.840" end="01:27:51.360" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.719" end="01:27:54.000" style="s2">and trying to hash out you know okay</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.360" end="01:27:56.960" style="s2">what are we talking about actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.000" end="01:27:57.679" style="s2">because it seems to me that uh all these</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.960" end="01:28:01.280" style="s2">views are</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.679" end="01:28:02.880" style="s2">kind of grand and and holistic and but</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.280" end="01:28:05.199" style="s2">at the same time have like a very</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.880" end="01:28:06.159" style="s2">particular approach to a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.199" end="01:28:08.880" style="s2">phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.159" end="01:28:10.960" style="s2">phenomenon and so like what okay what</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.880" end="01:28:13.520" style="s2">what are we actually talking about</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.960" end="01:28:14.000" style="s2">you know is it a cultural phase is a is</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.520" end="01:28:16.480" style="s2">it just</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.000" end="01:28:18.560" style="s2">like a theory about art is it is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.480" end="01:28:20.080" style="s2">developmental stage is it a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.560" end="01:28:22.239" style="s2">stage it&#39;s a movement</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.080" end="01:28:24.800" style="s2">you know all these lingering open</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.239" end="01:28:27.280" style="s2">questions if we deal with okay what is</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.800" end="01:28:28.239" style="s2">what comes after post-modernism you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.280" end="01:28:30.400" style="s2">and so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.239" end="01:28:31.360" style="s2">if you have different proponents of of</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.400" end="01:28:34.080" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.360" end="01:28:35.679" style="s2">uh uh schools that would be interesting</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.080" end="01:28:38.400" style="s2">to see okay is there</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.679" end="01:28:39.600" style="s2">maybe a meta narrative that can be de</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.400" end="01:28:43.199" style="s2">constructed</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.600" end="01:28:44.719" style="s2">or uh experienced uh if</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.199" end="01:28:47.600" style="s2">if we bring all these different</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.719" end="01:28:49.679" style="s2">perspectives to one table you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.600" end="01:28:51.280" style="s2">you know what i&#39;m saying it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.679" end="01:28:51.840" style="s2">that would be like very interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.280" end="01:28:54.560" style="s2">me too</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.840" end="01:28:55.199" style="s2">yeah this is one general problem is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.560" end="01:28:57.719" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.199" end="01:28:59.440" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no discourse about</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.719" end="01:29:00.400" style="s2">post-post-modernism in other words there</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.440" end="01:29:03.840" style="s2">are many different</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.400" end="01:29:06.880" style="s2">approaches and there is but</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.840" end="01:29:10.560" style="s2">there is no sort of overarching</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.880" end="01:29:11.360" style="s2">discussion of of what is going on so</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.560" end="01:29:15.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.360" end="01:29:16.960" style="s2">um i tend to usually have contact with</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.120" end="01:29:19.280" style="s2">the literary scholars</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.960" end="01:29:21.360" style="s2">and uh don&#39;t get into much contact with</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.280" end="01:29:24.560" style="s2">the the integral people or with</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.360" end="01:29:27.600" style="s2">with the psychology um</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.560" end="01:29:30.800" style="s2">so so it would indeed be interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.600" end="01:29:32.480" style="s2">get that kind of discourse uh going but</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.800" end="01:29:35.360" style="s2">at the present moment in academia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.480" end="01:29:36.960" style="s2">very difficult right</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.360" end="01:29:39.199" style="s2">i mean and at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.960" end="01:29:41.520" style="s2">postmodernism faces the same problem</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.199" end="01:29:42.480" style="s2">because uh depends on on who you are</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.520" end="01:29:44.000" style="s2">asking</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.480" end="01:29:45.920" style="s2">post-modernism is this and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.000" end="01:29:47.040" style="s2">post-modernism is that and you know then</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.920" end="01:29:49.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.040" end="01:29:52.080" style="s2">you know there&#39;s no i mean like we can</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.760" end="01:29:54.400" style="s2">agree on on certain characteristics like</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.080" end="01:29:56.719" style="s2">irony or skepticism against all my</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.400" end="01:29:58.639" style="s2">but this doesn&#39;t say nothing basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.719" end="01:30:01.679" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.639" end="01:30:04.719" style="s2">still still at this point</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.679" end="01:30:06.560" style="s2">nobody knows exactly what post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.719" end="01:30:09.520" style="s2">is because there&#39;s no overarching</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.560" end="01:30:09.840" style="s2">consensus about it you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.520" end="01:30:11.840" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.840" end="01:30:13.360" style="s2">uh that&#39;s uh unfortunately that&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.840" end="01:30:15.199" style="s2">normal right</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.360" end="01:30:17.360" style="s2">the same thing if you you can apply to</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.199" end="01:30:20.400" style="s2">romanticism you can apply that</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.360" end="01:30:23.840" style="s2">you have the same the the exact same</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.400" end="01:30:26.960" style="s2">uh excuse me you have the exact same um</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.840" end="01:30:29.040" style="s2">uh problems with the romanticism uh to a</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.960" end="01:30:31.199" style="s2">certain extent with realism</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.040" end="01:30:32.400" style="s2">that depending on who you are and</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.199" end="01:30:34.239" style="s2">depending on what</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.400" end="01:30:35.760" style="s2">sources you use you&#39;ll come to very</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.239" end="01:30:37.440" style="s2">different conclusions actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.760" end="01:30:39.120" style="s2">i think that&#39;s something that at least</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.440" end="01:30:40.239" style="s2">as a scholar that i it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.120" end="01:30:43.440" style="s2">i&#39;m used to</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.239" end="01:30:44.080" style="s2">right really surprised me that there is</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.440" end="01:30:48.080" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.080" end="01:30:50.400" style="s2">uh consensus but uh i think that</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.080" end="01:30:52.320" style="s2">what what you can actually do is is what</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.400" end="01:30:54.000" style="s2">what you suggested you can agree on</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.320" end="01:30:56.400" style="s2">certain very basic</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.000" end="01:30:58.480" style="s2">things such as irony such as this</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.400" end="01:30:59.199" style="s2">critique of grand narrative right a few</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.480" end="01:31:01.679" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.199" end="01:31:02.960" style="s2">that everybody really does agree on and</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.679" end="01:31:05.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.960" end="01:31:06.960" style="s2">use that as as as a starting point right</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.600" end="01:31:10.080" style="s2">at least as a</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.960" end="01:31:12.400" style="s2">as as common ground for for a discussion</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.080" end="01:31:13.360" style="s2">right so but you think there there could</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.400" end="01:31:16.239" style="s2">be uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.360" end="01:31:18.000" style="s2">like a common ground be found between</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.239" end="01:31:21.040" style="s2">different proponents of</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.000" end="01:31:21.760" style="s2">postmodern schools or is there something</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.040" end="01:31:25.199" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.760" end="01:31:28.840" style="s2">discover or is uh or like a</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.199" end="01:31:32.719" style="s2">common denominator or isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.840" end="01:31:34.560" style="s2">um yes i i i would think sorry</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.719" end="01:31:36.800" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to say if there&#39;s there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.560" end="01:31:39.840" style="s2">know one common denominator but</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.800" end="01:31:42.040" style="s2">uh i&#39;ve tried to to</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.840" end="01:31:43.360" style="s2">find a common denominator or common</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.040" end="01:31:45.920" style="s2">denominators</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.360" end="01:31:47.120" style="s2">with within literary scholarship and you</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.920" end="01:31:50.320" style="s2">can actually do it</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.120" end="01:31:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s possible um i i haven&#39;t ventured</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.320" end="01:31:53.520" style="s2">any farther than that simply because</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.159" end="01:31:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.520" end="01:31:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit too too far outside my field</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.480" end="01:31:59.520" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.040" end="01:32:00.320" style="s2">my tendency would be to think that it is</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.520" end="01:32:02.320" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.320" end="01:32:04.639" style="s2">possible at least at least partially</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.320" end="01:32:07.440" style="s2">possible right</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.639" end="01:32:08.159" style="s2">so i&#39;m optimistic in that so that we by</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.440" end="01:32:09.840" style="s2">i mean like</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.159" end="01:32:11.280" style="s2">the problem probably is that we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.840" end="01:32:13.440" style="s2">in that phase</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.280" end="01:32:14.480" style="s2">and and the historians and the the</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.440" end="01:32:17.440" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.480" end="01:32:19.120" style="s2">you know really are able to paint a</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.440" end="01:32:20.800" style="s2">bigger picture if we all already have</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.120" end="01:32:22.800" style="s2">left that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.800" end="01:32:24.800" style="s2">cultural phase or or whatever it is so</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.800" end="01:32:27.360" style="s2">we&#39;re still in the midst of it</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.800" end="01:32:28.159" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like very hard to hash out</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.360" end="01:32:30.880" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.159" end="01:32:32.080" style="s2">you know the threats between</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.880" end="01:32:34.719" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.080" end="01:32:35.520" style="s2">performatism demodernism transmodernism</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.719" end="01:32:38.880" style="s2">integral where</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.520" end="01:32:41.600" style="s2">where all these interconnecting threats</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.880" end="01:32:42.639" style="s2">are really are so that we can maybe say</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.600" end="01:32:44.719" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.639" end="01:32:46.239" style="s2">and post modernity when it&#39;s about irony</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.719" end="01:32:48.639" style="s2">and critique and</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.239" end="01:32:50.320" style="s2">skepticism that you know that pos post</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.639" end="01:32:52.480" style="s2">mode on stage is</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.320" end="01:32:54.960" style="s2">yeah about what about what is it you</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.480" end="01:32:57.760" style="s2">know what what is that</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.960" end="01:33:00.000" style="s2">you know and for lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.760" end="01:33:03.199" style="s2">what is the essence of</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.000" end="01:33:05.920" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah now this is uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.199" end="01:33:06.480" style="s2">this this is in fact a problem and when</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.920" end="01:33:09.040" style="s2">you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.480" end="01:33:10.080" style="s2">something in something that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.040" end="01:33:13.120" style="s2">hard to</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.080" end="01:33:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.120" end="01:33:19.280" style="s2">um uh that&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.880" end="01:33:20.480" style="s2">quite true of anything it&#39;s an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.280" end="01:33:22.000" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.480" end="01:33:23.520" style="s2">like i said i&#39;m always looking i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.000" end="01:33:24.639" style="s2">always i think lena said you know is</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.520" end="01:33:27.040" style="s2">this going to</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.639" end="01:33:28.560" style="s2">is something new coming is something is</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.040" end="01:33:31.440" style="s2">this going to end and i&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.560" end="01:33:33.120" style="s2">kind of looking for that um at some</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.440" end="01:33:36.080" style="s2">point it will happen</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.120" end="01:33:37.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s once you have this mindset</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.080" end="01:33:39.400" style="s2">whatever it is whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.280" end="01:33:41.760" style="s2">post-modernist modernist or</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.400" end="01:33:44.880" style="s2">post-post-modernism it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.760" end="01:33:44.880" style="s2">to get out of this mindset</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.800" end="01:33:56.080" style="s2">right so yes okay i i think</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.560" end="01:33:58.320" style="s2">um no but you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.080" end="01:34:00.080" style="s2">like you know maybe maybe the last</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.320" end="01:34:02.000" style="s2">question if nobody else</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.080" end="01:34:04.560" style="s2">uh asked but you know it&#39;s like when i</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.000" end="01:34:07.040" style="s2">look at especially like the the</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.560" end="01:34:09.040" style="s2">early forms of metamodernism or integral</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.040" end="01:34:12.639" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s like a lot</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.040" end="01:34:15.360" style="s2">about oscillating between previous</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.639" end="01:34:16.320" style="s2">eras or epochs or paradigms or stages of</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.360" end="01:34:18.320" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.320" end="01:34:20.000" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like you you find a middle</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.320" end="01:34:21.360" style="s2">ground between oscillating between the</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.000" end="01:34:24.000" style="s2">modernist project</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.360" end="01:34:25.600" style="s2">and the the postmodern project and that</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.000" end="01:34:28.320" style="s2">is then defined</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.600" end="01:34:30.159" style="s2">as you know the the integral or the</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.320" end="01:34:32.400" style="s2">metamode on the stage</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.159" end="01:34:34.159" style="s2">so but i always have the feeling okay</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.400" end="01:34:36.320" style="s2">that that may be true but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.159" end="01:34:38.560" style="s2">something more</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.320" end="01:34:40.080" style="s2">right some some like like with an</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.560" end="01:34:42.719" style="s2">emergence emergence</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.080" end="01:34:44.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really only happen with</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.719" end="01:34:46.800" style="s2">integrating what comes before</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.239" end="01:34:48.400" style="s2">but also creating something new that</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.800" end="01:34:50.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.400" end="01:34:51.600" style="s2">understandable by the elements which</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.080" end="01:34:54.560" style="s2">created it in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.600" end="01:34:56.560" style="s2">so emergence is always always there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.560" end="01:34:58.800" style="s2">always a new information it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.560" end="01:34:59.679" style="s2">just oscillating between what came</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.800" end="01:35:01.840" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.679" end="01:35:04.000" style="s2">and so i think like okay what you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.840" end="01:35:04.400" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s it&#39;s a new understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.000" end="01:35:07.679" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.400" end="01:35:11.280" style="s2">beauty and uh transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.679" end="01:35:14.400" style="s2">you know so maybe maybe like this i mean</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.280" end="01:35:16.480" style="s2">the the one of the final stages of of of</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.400" end="01:35:18.800" style="s2">of the keegan robert keegan model of</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.480" end="01:35:21.199" style="s2">development actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.800" end="01:35:22.560" style="s2">is it self-transcendent is that the</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.199" end="01:35:25.679" style="s2">actual transforming</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.560" end="01:35:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s self-transforming yes so</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.679" end="01:35:32.400" style="s2">um but there&#39;s also like some</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.960" end="01:35:35.520" style="s2">but you could also i mean i when when uh</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.400" end="01:35:39.199" style="s2">i wrote the the nordic secret i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.520" end="01:35:41.199" style="s2">i kept writing it wrong and because it</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.199" end="01:35:42.800" style="s2">it made more sense to call it</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.199" end="01:35:46.560" style="s2">transcending</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.800" end="01:35:49.600" style="s2">right uh so i had to go back and uh</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.560" end="01:35:53.119" style="s2">actually check what we have been writing</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.600" end="01:35:54.000" style="s2">um so yeah so cell transforming self</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.119" end="01:35:57.360" style="s2">transcending</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.000" end="01:35:58.800" style="s2">right um and i think what what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.360" end="01:36:02.400" style="s2">experiencing now</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.800" end="01:36:05.679" style="s2">is that i mean there is this</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.400" end="01:36:07.600" style="s2">hunger for a meaning and depth</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.679" end="01:36:08.880" style="s2">uh which we could not have in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.600" end="01:36:12.639" style="s2">post-modern</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.880" end="01:36:13.360" style="s2">era i mean you were not allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.639" end="01:36:18.480" style="s2">actually feel</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.360" end="01:36:18.480" style="s2">something really genuine</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.560" end="01:36:23.040" style="s2">and you always have to distance yourself</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.239" end="01:36:24.800" style="s2">from it and you can&#39;t live like that</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.040" end="01:36:26.480" style="s2">i mean you can you can have it as a</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.800" end="01:36:29.600" style="s2">coping mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.480" end="01:36:31.119" style="s2">but but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a life and i i</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.600" end="01:36:32.800" style="s2">think that is where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.119" end="01:36:34.320" style="s2">where we&#39;re heading and it&#39;s also why we</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.800" end="01:36:37.040" style="s2">see populism</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.320" end="01:36:37.600" style="s2">um and people are reacting to this sort</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.040" end="01:36:40.560" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.600" end="01:36:40.560" style="s2">self distancing</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.119" end="01:36:44.800" style="s2">yeah this is yeah this system i once</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.920" end="01:36:48.159" style="s2">more agree</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.800" end="01:36:49.440" style="s2">that this is a this is the</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.159" end="01:36:51.520" style="s2">direction we&#39;re heading in that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.440" end="01:36:54.080" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult uh</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.520" end="01:36:56.239" style="s2">even in during the time of</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.080" end="01:36:58.239" style="s2">post-modernism i&#39;m not really sure that</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.239" end="01:37:01.600" style="s2">very many people actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.239" end="01:37:04.480" style="s2">lived this kind of disillusioned</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.600" end="01:37:06.159" style="s2">life that was being propagated in in</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.480" end="01:37:08.320" style="s2">high culture and in</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.159" end="01:37:09.440" style="s2">philosophy in philosophy and in in</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.320" end="01:37:12.480" style="s2">obviously also in</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.440" end="01:37:13.760" style="s2">the halls of major universities i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.480" end="01:37:18.000" style="s2">not sure that</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.760" end="01:37:21.840" style="s2">that was a really uh really a viable</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.000" end="01:37:21.840" style="s2">a viable lifestyle even then</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.880" end="01:37:28.320" style="s2">but it does i mean it does do something</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.960" end="01:37:31.520" style="s2">to culture</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.320" end="01:37:34.239" style="s2">when you cannot be sincere and and</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.520" end="01:37:36.239" style="s2">and when i mean of course you&#39;re sincere</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.239" end="01:37:38.159" style="s2">in your relationships and your personal</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.239" end="01:37:41.520" style="s2">relationships and you</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.159" end="01:37:43.600" style="s2">uh you can exp you can experience it</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.520" end="01:37:45.360" style="s2">in your life and you can have you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.600" end="01:37:46.639" style="s2">intimate relationships you can have all</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.360" end="01:37:49.040" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.639" end="01:37:50.000" style="s2">and as you say you&#39;re absolutely right</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.040" end="01:37:52.880" style="s2">it did not</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.000" end="01:37:54.960" style="s2">you know define everyday life and the</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.880" end="01:37:58.560" style="s2">way that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.960" end="01:37:59.440" style="s2">lived our lives but if the acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.560" end="01:38:03.280" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.440" end="01:38:08.560" style="s2">if the culture the pop culture</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.280" end="01:38:11.600" style="s2">all the and even the arts tell us that</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.560" end="01:38:12.000" style="s2">nothing matters it is really hard to</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.600" end="01:38:14.400" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.000" end="01:38:15.360" style="s2">at least in the public sphere a</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.400" end="01:38:19.760" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.360" end="01:38:22.000" style="s2">discussion or debate um and to</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.760" end="01:38:22.880" style="s2">stand up for something that really means</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.000" end="01:38:26.000" style="s2">something to you</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.880" end="01:38:30.080" style="s2">or to others yeah this is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.000" end="01:38:31.040" style="s2">so so so at the collective level uh so</p>

<p begin="01:38:31.040" end="01:38:35.440" style="s2">individual level we have had the</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.040" end="01:38:38.639" style="s2">sincerity but at the collective level</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.440" end="01:38:42.960" style="s2">it has been it&#39;s been very hard to</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.639" end="01:38:46.400" style="s2">uh to you know take things seriously</p>
