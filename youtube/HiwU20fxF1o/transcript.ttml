<p begin="00:00:03.090" end="00:00:06.569" style="s2">can be a bit dispiriting to look into</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.680" end="00:00:09.090" style="s2">the future given the looming shadows</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.569" end="00:00:11.940" style="s2">that we see I mean the house is now</p>

<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:18.779" style="s2">folks may think that that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.039" end="00:00:20.430" style="s2">and I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:32.279" style="s2">mean I do think what the president did</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:39.180" style="s2">is very troubling that on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.279" end="00:00:41.399" style="s2">mm-hmm basically he famously speaks</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.180" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">off-the-cuff and says really appalling</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.399" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">things and to make this one to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:49.170" style="s2">impeachment frankly I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.550" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">the right thing to do is because it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">obviously very troubling to have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">president imply things in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">an election like this but Wow the drums</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">of impeachment have been drummed loud</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">from the vasila of his taking office and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:07.790" style="s2">it does seem like people are jumping at</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">something that might constitute grounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.790" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">where effectively it&#39;s not hard to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">mmm how this could end I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">terrible</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">right but by the way I&#39;m conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">the fact as we as we touch on Trump here</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">again that just from a pure consumer</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:29.939" style="s2">perspective a lot of people who who</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">would want to hear the part of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.939" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">conversation where it&#39;s like Brett</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">Weinstein and John Wood jr. on Donald</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:37.530" style="s2">Trump and we spend the next like 10 or</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:39.659" style="s2">20 minutes just talking about talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.530" end="00:01:41.640" style="s2">about Trump right that&#39;s Trump is good</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.659" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">for clicks and it&#39;s good for clicks</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.640" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">ratings and so if any will add an amount</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">for that reason no we don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">clip watching this video right we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">podcasts how much darker can we get</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">before people can&#39;t even see the amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:12.330" style="s2">things that were that&#39;s what we Phil&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:02:19.030" end="00:02:24.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it is it is you know I think why I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.629" end="00:02:28.599" style="s2">even brought this up I mean I know why</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.900" end="00:02:30.129" style="s2">it is it is interesting to note what</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.599" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">motivates people as consumers at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.129" end="00:02:37.209" style="s2">certain point like the I look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:41.500" style="s2">the moment where people realize the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.209" end="00:02:44.470" style="s2">that we do have the ability to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.500" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">shift this conversation in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.470" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">from a demand side of things is able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:53.950" style="s2">sort of change the market viability of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:55.959" style="s2">certain messages and certain ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.950" end="00:02:59.139" style="s2">certain certain messengers and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.959" end="00:03:01.659" style="s2">right now Trump is a messenger for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.139" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">sort of you know sort of chaos in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.659" end="00:03:07.389" style="s2">culture and our government and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:09.159" style="s2">that derives support on some level from</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.389" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">even from his worst enemies because</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.159" end="00:03:12.549" style="s2">everybody&#39;s so obsessed with them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:15.579" style="s2">you know and one thing I would just</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.549" end="00:03:17.290" style="s2">encourage people about his just not be</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.579" end="00:03:20.379" style="s2">so obsessed with Donald Trump and look</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.290" end="00:03:25.269" style="s2">it&#39;s not that he&#39;s not an important you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.379" end="00:03:27.609" style="s2">know figure in all of this he is and but</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.269" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">Trump would not exist if we were not for</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.609" end="00:03:33.190" style="s2">pre-existing patterns symptom he really</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:35.470" style="s2">is a symptom and and and some people</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.190" end="00:03:37.989" style="s2">want to push back against that but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.470" end="00:03:41.349" style="s2">anybody who sees him as the root cause</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.989" end="00:03:44.229" style="s2">of these larger problems is on the one</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.349" end="00:03:45.430" style="s2">hand therefore I think going to act in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.229" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">way to where they&#39;re going to seek a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.430" end="00:03:49.540" style="s2">short-term solution to the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:52.479" style="s2">Donald Trump which is likely not even to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.540" end="00:03:54.220" style="s2">be effective and that might be oh what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.479" end="00:03:56.530" style="s2">happened I hear with this urge this on</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.220" end="00:03:58.090" style="s2">these these people are so focused on</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.530" end="00:04:00.940" style="s2">Trump that they have the sense that if</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.090" end="00:04:02.500" style="s2">we can just deal with that problem that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.940" end="00:04:05.260" style="s2">we will be somewhere and the fact is we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.500" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">would be nowhere but even if but even if</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.260" end="00:04:11.949" style="s2">they succeeded in that in that effort it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:13.780" style="s2">would likely result in a you know it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.949" end="00:04:15.849" style="s2">would likely be attended by more or less</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.780" end="00:04:17.769" style="s2">the deafness to the to the broader and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.849" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">deeper concerns which brought them about</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.769" end="00:04:22.060" style="s2">in the first place which will therefore</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:23.950" style="s2">lead to a continuation of those subtlety</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.060" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">and trends will still be here twenty</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.950" end="00:04:28.140" style="s2">years down the road one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:29.910" style="s2">somebody you know craftier smarter than</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.140" end="00:04:31.380" style="s2">the presidents on so forth will come</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.910" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">back the other way and I would say a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.380" end="00:04:36.600" style="s2">similar thing to conservatives who</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:39.630" style="s2">believe that because look actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.600" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">precisely parallel for many Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.630" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">and conservatives including a good many</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:45.690" style="s2">who would never who would tell you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:47.250" style="s2">pretty readily that they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.690" end="00:04:49.470" style="s2">they don&#39;t want their kids to looked at</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.250" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">Donald Trump as a role model but they</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.470" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">felt that there needed to be a a strong</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.590" end="00:04:59.580" style="s2">man you know who stood up against the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:02.040" style="s2">extremism of the left against the you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.580" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">know the social justice lunacy that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.040" end="00:05:07.890" style="s2">see it evergreen and that they fill as</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">is permeating the the culture of</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.070" end="00:05:29.820" style="s2">his wake and for conservatives who think</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.000" end="00:05:32.010" style="s2">that way I have the exact sort of same</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.820" end="00:05:34.440" style="s2">advice you know don&#39;t don&#39;t seek a</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.440" end="00:05:41.370" style="s2">is a a longer-term sort of cultural and</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.910" end="00:05:48.060" style="s2">arrived at within the American people</p>

<p begin="00:05:49.860" end="00:05:53.940" style="s2">had on top of that which I think allows</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.110" end="00:05:59.370" style="s2">for quite a bit of room for disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.940" end="00:06:03.510" style="s2">right you know but for there to be sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.370" end="00:06:05.910" style="s2">of a revival in our democratic or</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.169" end="00:07:21.870" style="s2">is right and to return it squarely to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.069" end="00:07:23.699" style="s2">focus on the fact that really this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.870" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">a question of you and Donald Trump this</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.699" end="00:07:27.960" style="s2">is a question of you and your neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:29.250" style="s2">you know I see them like that right this</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.960" end="00:07:31.110" style="s2">is a question of you and your neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.250" end="00:07:34.469" style="s2">right and to see the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.110" end="00:07:38.849" style="s2">one and the other yeah I love this</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.469" end="00:07:42.750" style="s2">framing I have complex feelings about</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.750" end="00:07:47.099" style="s2">don&#39;t really feel like he&#39;s up to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.460" end="00:07:51.389" style="s2">challenge of the office on the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.099" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">hand all right let me try reaching</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.389" end="00:07:56.580" style="s2">across the aisle on this one Donald</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:08:00.150" style="s2">Trump accomplished something that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.580" end="00:08:04.589" style="s2">else in recent memory has done he broke</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.150" end="00:08:07.909" style="s2">through the duopoly and that required</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.589" end="00:08:10.710" style="s2">somebody of a particularly unusual</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.909" end="00:08:12.629" style="s2">Constitution and we are now left with</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.710" end="00:08:15.389" style="s2">such a person in office which has been</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.629" end="00:08:17.729" style="s2">an interesting experience to be sure but</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.389" end="00:08:20.009" style="s2">to the extent that we were suffering</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.729" end="00:08:22.589" style="s2">from the duopoly and something broke</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.009" end="00:08:28.440" style="s2">through it wasn&#39;t Bernie Sanders Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.589" end="00:08:31.050" style="s2">Sanders was my guy in this fight but he</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.440" end="00:08:33.479" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do it and in the end he folded</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.050" end="00:08:35.459" style="s2">to Clinton which I must say still leaves</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.479" end="00:08:39.329" style="s2">a bitter taste in my mouth I think he</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.459" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">should have stayed true to the fight but</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.329" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">Trump did manage to break through the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:47.370" style="s2">duopoly which tells us in fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:49.020" style="s2">is possible and that is an important if</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.370" end="00:08:50.220" style="s2">he&#39;s done nothing else he has done that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.020" end="00:08:52.410" style="s2">service for us as he has demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.220" end="00:08:53.640" style="s2">that the story that could not be</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.410" end="00:08:56.400" style="s2">disrupted by anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.640" end="00:08:57.660" style="s2">was in fact open to be challenged by</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.400" end="00:09:03.020" style="s2">somebody who was sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.660" end="00:09:03.020" style="s2">politically savvy which I think he is</p>
