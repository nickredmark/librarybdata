<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">an admittance part but if I also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">know whether anyone can admit people in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:17.310" style="s2">or just the admin&#39;s because if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">possibility that if we have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.310" end="00:02:21.240" style="s2">questions we can as we admit people copy</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">and paste them over to something right</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.240" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">so that we can say and and get the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">people who are ready in there to answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:28.710" style="s2">them as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:30.620" style="s2">I know we&#39;ve tried to have a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.710" end="00:02:33.810" style="s2">questionnaires that haven&#39;t quite worked</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.620" end="00:02:38.940" style="s2">out but yeah anyway I think having</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.810" end="00:02:40.320" style="s2">questions is a good idea maybe Carrie</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.940" end="00:02:42.600" style="s2">and I could work together to come up</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.320" end="00:02:45.180" style="s2">with some because Carrie seems to want</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.600" end="00:02:47.790" style="s2">to do more of the like back-end customer</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.180" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">relation management part so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.790" end="00:02:50.880" style="s2">would facilitate that process makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:52.490" style="s2">sense as well right without having too</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.880" end="00:02:55.320" style="s2">many questions like one or two questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.490" end="00:02:58.320" style="s2">to say are you in the right place okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.320" end="00:03:01.020" style="s2">are you adding and are we gonna add to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.320" end="00:03:02.670" style="s2">yours and so I think that just</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.020" end="00:03:04.380" style="s2">acknowledging that and then maybe with</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.670" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">Bentley gets here we can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.380" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">as well</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.449" end="00:12:01.069" style="s2">another tool but if there&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.609" end="00:12:02.509" style="s2">sort of acting as like the go-between so</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.129" end="00:13:15.829" style="s2">it depended on what you use in and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.039" end="00:13:16.939" style="s2">it may have a specific wiki it&#39;s them</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.180" end="00:14:51.460" style="s2">it&#39;s must be riveting to watch</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.450" end="00:14:56.860" style="s2">spectators although I appreciate them</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.750" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">okay yes I think we can probably dive</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.070" end="00:15:05.480" style="s2">deeper into that I&#39;ll uh I&#39;ll take a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:08.090" style="s2">look let&#39;s see sort of what how flexible</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.480" end="00:15:10.700" style="s2">it is and how how much we can change the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.090" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">database set up to sort of skew to our</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.700" end="00:15:18.470" style="s2">needs dragging the stuff did we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:21.290" style="s2">interested in taking on that work it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.470" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">tool that works for them right that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.290" end="00:15:24.800" style="s2">integration and you&#39;ve put in time on</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:26.690" style="s2">knack and then figuring out this new</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:27.830" style="s2">tool and if they can go together which</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.690" end="00:15:28.850" style="s2">means I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.830" end="00:15:35.060" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know either of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.850" end="00:15:36.770" style="s2">things see it Pacific just if it makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.060" end="00:15:37.940" style="s2">sense to a drill and it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.770" end="00:15:42.530" style="s2">sense to carry that wouldn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.940" end="00:15:43.760" style="s2">it carries the one doing the work but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.530" end="00:15:45.380" style="s2">also don&#39;t want someone to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.760" end="00:15:47.840" style="s2">do all the work and then go away and not</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.380" end="00:15:49.940" style="s2">have you know lunch I said this is why I</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.840" end="00:15:52.430" style="s2">think the civic CRM because you can help</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.940" end="00:15:55.070" style="s2">select members in there so so so like</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.430" end="00:15:57.890" style="s2">the group off yeah so so like a Joe</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.070" end="00:15:58.940" style="s2">Jubilee that leave us access to that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.890" end="00:16:01.190" style="s2">I drop dead tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.940" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">you&#39;d still have access to it you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.190" end="00:16:05.090" style="s2">mean you wouldn&#39;t you know because this</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:06.860" style="s2">is what a thing about think people that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.090" end="00:16:09.260" style="s2">start things and if they disappear and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.860" end="00:16:12.260" style="s2">then just you know I really missed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.260" end="00:16:14.570" style="s2">just like oh you know it disappears</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.260" end="00:16:16.940" style="s2">and all that work we can&#39;t get access to</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.570" end="00:16:18.530" style="s2">it and blardy blardy blar you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.940" end="00:16:20.600" style="s2">mean so I think it&#39;d be useful for you</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.530" end="00:16:22.250" style="s2">Jubilee as well because if you know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.600" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">could just you know instead of you</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.250" end="00:16:26.150" style="s2">having spreadsheets on Google Docs and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:28.010" style="s2">stuff like that you could put your stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.150" end="00:16:30.410" style="s2">in there that you know we could see and</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.010" end="00:16:32.390" style="s2">then you know and they&#39;ll keep you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.410" end="00:16:35.060" style="s2">nights as well you know in terms of you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.390" end="00:16:37.100" style="s2">speaking to and as well you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.060" end="00:16:43.400" style="s2">it would have to be as easy as putting</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.100" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">it on it - yeah yeah yes cool it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.400" end="00:16:47.450" style="s2">like it&#39;s something that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:53.960" style="s2">download and then install on to some</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.450" end="00:16:57.470" style="s2">kind of a server I&#39;m not sure how ill</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.960" end="00:17:00.050" style="s2">ities I signed up green geeks ages ago</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.470" end="00:17:01.880" style="s2">he said by is it the main name and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.050" end="00:17:03.860" style="s2">can host as many domain names as you</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.880" end="00:17:05.780" style="s2">like and haven&#39;t done book at all with</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.860" end="00:17:07.610" style="s2">it anyway so if you want if you need</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.780" end="00:17:09.560" style="s2">them somewhere as long as you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.610" end="00:17:11.540" style="s2">domain name for whatever it is you do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.560" end="00:17:14.300" style="s2">I could probably host it and give you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.540" end="00:17:16.130" style="s2">access you know I mean if you can get</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.300" end="00:17:18.290" style="s2">maybe one of the programmers to come and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.130" end="00:17:20.600" style="s2">give us a hand sort of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.290" end="00:17:21.950" style="s2">putting the stuff on it so we could run</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.600" end="00:17:23.630" style="s2">it from that that would be great because</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.950" end="00:17:27.350" style="s2">as I said I haven&#39;t been using it for</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.630" end="00:17:29.060" style="s2">ages you know so and you can have as</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.350" end="00:17:31.430" style="s2">many domain names and you could host as</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.060" end="00:17:34.280" style="s2">much as you like so you know I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.430" end="00:17:36.380" style="s2">quite happy to off with that as well and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.280" end="00:17:39.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually used this before</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:42.140" style="s2">yeah well as a self be abused Drupal and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.290" end="00:17:45.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to try to build myself a site</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.140" end="00:17:46.460" style="s2">before Facebook user Drupal and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.050" end="00:17:48.440" style="s2">quite a good operating content</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.460" end="00:17:50.990" style="s2">management software I think it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.440" end="00:17:53.090" style="s2">better than Joomla but the learning</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.990" end="00:17:54.890" style="s2">curve is quite steep because when I what</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.090" end="00:17:56.990" style="s2">happened to me was that I get people</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.890" end="00:17:58.550" style="s2">giving me things right and then I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.990" end="00:17:59.960" style="s2">like all week later network with all</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.550" end="00:18:01.940" style="s2">these people I just want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.960" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">people of that and then although you</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.940" end="00:18:06.260" style="s2">know people who would do album even the</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:07.820" style="s2">program and that the kinds of leg dip so</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.260" end="00:18:09.890" style="s2">these out we looked at a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.820" end="00:18:11.300" style="s2">then you go away so I ended up having to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.890" end="00:18:13.970" style="s2">try install it myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.300" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">and that and it&#39;s all a question of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.970" end="00:18:17.990" style="s2">modules of what you need and you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">build it as you know what you need as</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.990" end="00:18:20.990" style="s2">you go you know because that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.210" style="s2">like truthful rather than the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.990" end="00:18:24.770" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve saw software as</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.210" end="00:18:27.650" style="s2">well so it doesn&#39;t cost anything to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.770" end="00:18:29.330" style="s2">install and download the only problem I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.650" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">had was it was making it look pretty</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.330" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">because it didn&#39;t have any CSS skills or</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:37.580" style="s2">HTML and that whereas I could install</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:39.020" style="s2">modules but I didn&#39;t know what I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.580" end="00:18:41.270" style="s2">doing with them and I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.020" end="00:18:43.010" style="s2">learn I was trying to gather loads of</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.270" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">people while trying to live programming</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.960" end="00:19:18.770" style="s2">start looking into where the hosting is</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.059" end="00:19:19.940" style="s2">and what sort of touch musicians we make</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.770" end="00:19:26.570" style="s2">and actually get in there and do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.940" end="00:19:28.490" style="s2">because that sounds sounds useful and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.570" end="00:19:29.690" style="s2">that&#39;s more actually in the world that</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.399" end="00:19:45.289" style="s2">of like collecting things well not even</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.289" end="00:19:47.270" style="s2">data just so you know cuz you can&#39;t keep</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.990" end="00:21:49.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually done it myself years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.429" end="00:21:49.650" style="s2">for as I said it just needs a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.140" end="00:21:52.860" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.650" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">well so I mean it says integration with</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.860" end="00:21:57.240" style="s2">Drupal are you saying that it would use</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:21:58.950" style="s2">Drupal as the full-back in and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.240" end="00:22:00.900" style="s2">need a separate service and I may be</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.950" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">asking questions in a way that&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.340" end="00:22:14.340" style="s2">not even have to use their service you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:16.230" style="s2">know I mean people you don&#39;t have to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.340" end="00:22:19.020" style="s2">don&#39;t have to install something else</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.230" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">other than Drupal from civic CRM to work</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.020" end="00:22:22.200" style="s2">oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:24.270" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s not clear on the website that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.200" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">when they say they say just say it</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.270" end="00:22:30.059" style="s2">integrates they didn&#39;t say that they can</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:31.320" style="s2">use the CMS as the backend but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.059" end="00:22:34.890" style="s2">probably what they mean but they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.320" end="00:22:36.690" style="s2">not very clear I could go to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.890" end="00:22:38.520" style="s2">developer Docs and maybe I&#39;ll say but</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.690" end="00:22:42.750" style="s2">it&#39;d take a little while to look at and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.520" end="00:22:44.280" style="s2">figure out because I you know I you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.750" end="00:22:46.200" style="s2">when you say you have green geeks I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.280" end="00:22:48.330" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t that have a cost for</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:50.490" style="s2">hosting well it does like I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.330" end="00:22:53.780" style="s2">paying for their yearly I paid for that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.490" end="00:22:58.350" style="s2">yearly $600 and what I&#39;ve got a year and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.780" end="00:23:00.600" style="s2">to host stuff and that&#39;s it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.350" end="00:23:01.610" style="s2">get charged for however many sites you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.600" end="00:23:05.820" style="s2">host of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.610" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">yeah until I mean we won&#39;t be using a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.820" end="00:23:13.400" style="s2">lot of resources so that&#39;ll work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:13.400" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.140" end="00:23:21.670" style="s2">Yeah right now I don&#39;t have any I guess</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:25.240" style="s2">I have one running server that I could</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.670" end="00:23:27.070" style="s2">also put it on but it&#39;s running a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.240" end="00:23:29.190" style="s2">different technology base so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.070" end="00:23:34.600" style="s2">something that&#39;s compatible that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.190" end="00:23:37.260" style="s2">easier now the green geeks pricing looks</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.600" end="00:23:37.260" style="s2">pretty reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.750" end="00:23:57.150" style="s2">okay yes I guess we can a carry and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.420" end="00:24:00.030" style="s2">can connect I&#39;ll be just over Facebook</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:44.190" style="s2">really depends on the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.750" end="00:25:48.870" style="s2">questions if it&#39;s just to filter out</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.190" end="00:25:51.630" style="s2">bots then it&#39;d be useful just to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.870" end="00:25:55.010" style="s2">one or two questions yeah it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.630" end="00:25:55.010" style="s2">really matter too much what they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.490" end="00:26:05.580" style="s2">but I think what you said sounded great</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:08.909" style="s2">I think what&#39;s your project or what kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.580" end="00:26:11.399" style="s2">of projects are you interested in answer</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.909" end="00:26:14.429" style="s2">one or the other and then even links to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.399" end="00:26:16.889" style="s2">your project so we can because we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.429" end="00:26:19.769" style="s2">the one game vplace also that projects</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.889" end="00:26:22.919" style="s2">are allowed to join right like we let</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.769" end="00:26:26.190" style="s2">pages and groups in the heart our human</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.919" end="00:26:27.779" style="s2">being because it makes sense yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.190" end="00:26:30.090" style="s2">think you&#39;re gonna answer ask that all</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.779" end="00:26:32.580" style="s2">and at least the first question all in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.090" end="00:26:34.529" style="s2">one question just say if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.580" end="00:26:37.100" style="s2">project tell us about it if not what</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.529" end="00:26:40.080" style="s2">type of projects are you interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.100" end="00:26:44.610" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know I guess you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.080" end="00:26:50.009" style="s2">leave certain questions blank yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.610" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">so either way then the other question is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.009" end="00:26:54.149" style="s2">because they go away as soon as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:56.820" style="s2">asked is this just for BOTS and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.149" end="00:27:00.360" style="s2">they&#39;re in we&#39;re fine or do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.820" end="00:27:02.100" style="s2">have a process procedure of whoever&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.360" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">letting that person in copies and pastes</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.100" end="00:27:06.659" style="s2">it to a document so we have a list of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.059" style="s2">who people are and what their projects</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.659" end="00:27:13.499" style="s2">are coming in and then we can always ask</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.059" end="00:27:17.580" style="s2">going back we know what ours are but for</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.499" end="00:27:20.100" style="s2">everyone because we&#39;ve 200 members it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.580" end="00:27:29.720" style="s2">going to be difficult to track all of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.100" end="00:27:29.720" style="s2">them especially if joint projects and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.379" end="00:27:36.619" style="s2">very interested in helping of projects</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.390" end="00:29:46.110" style="s2">outsourcing to Venezuela which I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.180" end="00:29:48.330" style="s2">like I should have learned how to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.110" end="00:29:50.400" style="s2">before coming on but I don&#39;t say it for</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.330" end="00:29:54.540" style="s2">years oh it&#39;s gonna happen in the next</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.400" end="00:29:57.180" style="s2">few minutes but there&#39;s something with</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.540" end="00:29:59.430" style="s2">Danielle posted his post of looking for</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.180" end="00:30:00.900" style="s2">four people in Venezuela I&#39;m whines no</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.430" end="00:30:02.670" style="s2">there was something where I was like we</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.900" end="00:30:05.070" style="s2">all have projects we want people to work</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.670" end="00:30:07.230" style="s2">on is there a way to kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.070" end="00:30:09.060" style="s2">something I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.230" end="00:30:11.310" style="s2">it but Omni wind helps all of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.060" end="00:30:15.090" style="s2">projects and helps them of course get</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.310" end="00:30:17.730" style="s2">employed I feel that most people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.090" end="00:30:19.560" style="s2">speak English and have tech as their</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.730" end="00:30:21.750" style="s2">actual thing are employed in Venezuela</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.560" end="00:30:23.879" style="s2">like they don&#39;t actually have but</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.750" end="00:30:27.029" style="s2">there&#39;s people who maybe only speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.879" end="00:30:29.369" style="s2">Spanish and have tech and or are like</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.029" end="00:30:34.279" style="s2">data entry level right and speak English</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.369" end="00:30:36.509" style="s2">and would there be a way to kind of mass</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.279" end="00:30:40.649" style="s2">want to say mass employee but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.509" end="00:30:44.519" style="s2">wrong create an all-new in solution</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.649" end="00:30:45.690" style="s2">right for our projects and I am and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.519" end="00:30:48.199" style="s2">have this inkling that there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.690" end="00:30:53.009" style="s2">more countries like Venezuela happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.199" end="00:30:56.069" style="s2">yeah do it was there a reason why he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.009" end="00:30:58.019" style="s2">specifically mentioned Venezuela well</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.069" end="00:31:01.499" style="s2">they make like 10 bucks a month from</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.019" end="00:31:03.119" style="s2">there and so there&#39;s the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.499" end="00:31:03.389" style="s2">paying someone a couple hundred bucks a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.119" end="00:31:09.929" style="s2">month</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.389" end="00:31:12.589" style="s2">it is decent for them and not yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.929" end="00:31:15.239" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t limit it to any particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.589" end="00:31:20.909" style="s2">geographic location but yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.239" end="00:31:24.419" style="s2">having some or as a group vetting either</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.909" end="00:31:26.849" style="s2">individuals or contract companies</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.419" end="00:31:29.819" style="s2">because even there&#39;s a lot of companies</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.849" end="00:31:31.919" style="s2">that help would help manage that and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.819" end="00:31:35.429" style="s2">think they&#39;re worth their money for like</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.919" end="00:31:37.619" style="s2">a project that Adria her I are doing but</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.429" end="00:31:39.539" style="s2">what I&#39;ve never really done is gone</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.619" end="00:31:42.749" style="s2">through and vetted those organizations</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.539" end="00:31:45.479" style="s2">and even for some startups in my local</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.749" end="00:31:47.190" style="s2">area that I&#39;m mentoring but the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.479" end="00:31:49.859" style="s2">always comes up so I need to I need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.190" end="00:31:52.019" style="s2">hire some devs for a short small project</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.859" end="00:31:53.609" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to pay a lot what do I</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.019" end="00:31:56.489" style="s2">do it&#39;d be nice to have an answer for</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.609" end="00:32:00.029" style="s2">them I just haven&#39;t dedicated the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.489" end="00:32:04.709" style="s2">to say okay I&#39;m gonna find either well</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.029" end="00:32:07.379" style="s2">or both some contract individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.709" end="00:32:12.209" style="s2">you know use them on a small project see</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.379" end="00:32:14.819" style="s2">how they go and then maybe even there</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.209" end="00:32:16.109" style="s2">are some organizations I can&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.819" end="00:32:18.539" style="s2">what they&#39;re called the contracting</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.109" end="00:32:19.979" style="s2">companies where we would vet a few of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.539" end="00:32:21.929" style="s2">those and kind of have a list of hey</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.979" end="00:32:23.369" style="s2">these are people we know we&#39;ve used so</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.929" end="00:32:24.929" style="s2">when you&#39;re going out there on up work</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.369" end="00:32:26.929" style="s2">or freelance you&#39;re not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.929" end="00:32:30.239" style="s2">screwed which has happened to several</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.929" end="00:32:33.539" style="s2">I&#39;ve had funded startups in the Dallas</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.239" end="00:32:35.339" style="s2">area that have showed me some stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.539" end="00:32:37.660" style="s2">they got that was pretty bad and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.339" end="00:32:38.980" style="s2">spent tens of thousands of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.660" end="00:32:42.330" style="s2">and they ended up with an app that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.980" end="00:32:45.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not even close to working</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.330" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">so that would be a beneficial thing I</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.610" end="00:32:55.150" style="s2">think to do so I guess I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:57.610" style="s2">yes that was really long yes now I am</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.150" end="00:33:01.630" style="s2">I&#39;m looking on up work just to see like</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.610" end="00:33:04.300" style="s2">what&#39;s out there in Venezuela and there</p>

<p begin="00:33:52.810" end="00:33:56.280" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about like hey if these</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.070" end="00:33:59.530" style="s2">people are used to making $6 a month</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.280" end="00:34:00.970" style="s2">then if we you know if we can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.530" end="00:34:03.790" style="s2">something where they&#39;re making $200 a</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.970" end="00:34:07.420" style="s2">month that&#39;s a massive increase and no</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.790" end="00:34:09.940" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.420" end="00:34:11.350" style="s2">more like the manual labor jobs were</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.940" end="00:34:17.860" style="s2">like you can&#39;t outsource it you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.350" end="00:34:20.919" style="s2">be there and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.860" end="00:34:22.929" style="s2">it&#39;s their government jobs pay them six</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.919" end="00:34:24.820" style="s2">dollars a month which is not in any way</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.929" end="00:34:26.260" style="s2">enough to live on our first standard of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.820" end="00:34:29.290" style="s2">living it like we&#39;re you can&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.260" end="00:34:32.860" style="s2">anywhere for $6 a month right but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.290" end="00:34:35.740" style="s2">exactly having kind of almost like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.860" end="00:34:37.630" style="s2">guess like together tech employees like</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.740" end="00:34:39.190" style="s2">one or two people that&#39;s like hey if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.630" end="00:34:40.660" style="s2">paid out X amount and they were working</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.190" end="00:34:43.419" style="s2">on wiki election and this and that but</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.660" end="00:34:45.160" style="s2">you know and then as for as more as</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.419" end="00:34:48.100" style="s2">needed they possibly have more people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.160" end="00:34:50.500" style="s2">recruit or I just of like the go-between</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.100" end="00:34:51.070" style="s2">that I guarantee are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.500" end="00:34:53.050" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.070" end="00:34:56.200" style="s2">Tech and development but don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.050" end="00:34:57.340" style="s2">English they can do it in Spanish right</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.200" end="00:34:59.980" style="s2">and having someone else who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.340" end="00:35:01.450" style="s2">necessarily tech but speaks Spanish and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.980" end="00:35:03.310" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the problem is you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.450" end="00:35:05.830" style="s2">need to be apples tech on Spanish but</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.310" end="00:35:07.900" style="s2">you know liaison they get they get much</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.830" end="00:35:09.610" style="s2">more money probably but being able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.900" end="00:35:12.700" style="s2">coordinate but that was just things</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.610" end="00:35:15.430" style="s2">sparking he starting fires what would I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.700" end="00:35:16.660" style="s2">do I was in my experience and a magician</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.430" end="00:35:18.730" style="s2">definitely might have something to say</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.660" end="00:35:20.710" style="s2">here but tech for the most part is</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.730" end="00:35:22.600" style="s2">English like you&#39;re coding is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.710" end="00:35:25.390" style="s2">much always done in English so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.600" end="00:35:26.920" style="s2">a coder I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.390" end="00:35:29.350" style="s2">coder that didn&#39;t help me speak like</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.920" end="00:35:32.980" style="s2">some English I&#39;ve worked with several</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.350" end="00:35:36.610" style="s2">developers that their English was not</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.980" end="00:35:37.990" style="s2">sufficient to communicate with and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.610" end="00:35:39.910" style="s2">needed a translator I&#39;ve worked with</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.990" end="00:35:42.940" style="s2">some companies the company that I worked</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.910" end="00:35:45.550" style="s2">for supplied a translator companies I</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.940" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t work for that I fired did not</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.550" end="00:35:50.920" style="s2">supply a translator and they just had</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:52.690" style="s2">guys that didn&#39;t speak great and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.920" end="00:35:54.010" style="s2">it&#39;d be okay if I spoke that language</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.690" end="00:35:56.080" style="s2">but they need to be able to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.010" end="00:35:58.210" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of people that can code</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.080" end="00:36:01.780" style="s2">but can&#39;t speak in a way enough way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.210" end="00:36:04.390" style="s2">do that and so I do think I do think</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.780" end="00:36:08.140" style="s2">having someone who is really familiar</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.390" end="00:36:14.260" style="s2">with the language is that they use</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.140" end="00:36:16.450" style="s2">commonly is is a huge benefit that does</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.260" end="00:36:18.600" style="s2">that to the cost but yeah it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.450" end="00:36:20.770" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to get like a really</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.600" end="00:36:22.870" style="s2">narrow subset of people who were like</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.770" end="00:36:25.630" style="s2">tech speak good English and aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.870" end="00:36:26.980" style="s2">already on something like upwork or like</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.630" end="00:36:29.020" style="s2">doing something where they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.980" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">reasonable money in the area and not</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.020" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">they six dollars a month so our so part</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:37.000" style="s2">of this goal which I didn&#39;t see the post</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:40.630" style="s2">but was hey there&#39;s some people that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.000" end="00:36:43.360" style="s2">getting screwed so we want to help them</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.630" end="00:36:45.310" style="s2">right so yeah if that was the goal then</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.360" end="00:36:47.530" style="s2">I would say it would be good if we found</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.310" end="00:36:49.960" style="s2">one person that could speak their</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.530" end="00:36:52.630" style="s2">language and be a liaison and then they</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.960" end="00:36:55.300" style="s2">might also help maybe even in that area</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.630" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">and they would help find people and as</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.300" end="00:36:59.980" style="s2">part of our process they would be you</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:01.180" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.980" end="00:37:04.750" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t even have to be great</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.180" end="00:37:07.470" style="s2">developers because it would be part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.750" end="00:37:10.440" style="s2">you know growing that society and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.470" end="00:37:15.339" style="s2">helping that community and that culture</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.440" end="00:37:18.609" style="s2">grow their skills so yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.339" end="00:37:20.829" style="s2">if we have enough funding in the group I</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.609" end="00:37:23.170" style="s2">mean it&#39;s great if they don&#39;t cost that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.829" end="00:37:24.579" style="s2">much but I don&#39;t know if we have it</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.170" end="00:37:28.270" style="s2">actually enough dollars going through it</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.579" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">to be very impactful in that yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.270" end="00:37:34.059" style="s2">more also like if there was a space for</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:36.549" style="s2">data entry right something that actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.059" end="00:37:38.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take tech skills is more just</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.549" end="00:37:39.579" style="s2">basic literacy but they don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.920" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">English</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.579" end="00:37:46.540" style="s2">having that liaison and finding like how</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:48.609" style="s2">do we get people jobs that we you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.540" end="00:37:50.349" style="s2">can hire them for that or more and would</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.609" end="00:37:52.059" style="s2">that help right because it&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.349" end="00:37:54.069" style="s2">solution raising doesn&#39;t necessarily be</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.059" end="00:37:57.099" style="s2">that process raising doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.069" end="00:37:59.829" style="s2">at the moment but wiki lection might and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.099" end="00:38:01.930" style="s2">Gilly bot might write like I don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.829" end="00:38:03.400" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s definitely a chance that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.930" end="00:38:05.470" style="s2">some of our projects will get to a point</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.400" end="00:38:07.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh we just need every name of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.470" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">every governor in the universe they turn</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.630" end="00:38:12.549" style="s2">you know every you know a bridge for</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:13.809" style="s2">them that&#39;s something that although I</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.549" end="00:38:15.700" style="s2">guess up works actually changed their</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.809" end="00:38:17.410" style="s2">pricing model since I last used it for</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.700" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">that but that&#39;s actually what I started</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.410" end="00:38:22.119" style="s2">out using up work for was for scraping</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:23.170" style="s2">government information and you could</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.119" end="00:38:24.819" style="s2">find people for like three or four</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.170" end="00:38:26.290" style="s2">dollars an hour but I think they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.819" end="00:38:27.880" style="s2">changed their pricing now I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.290" end="00:38:31.089" style="s2">you can get somebody under I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.880" end="00:38:32.559" style="s2">five which is still pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.089" end="00:38:39.609" style="s2">but if we&#39;re talking about like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.559" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">hundred hours yeah like how much is in</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.609" end="00:38:44.700" style="s2">the video that I think Julie you need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:47.109" style="s2">post it or you know Florida deliver</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.700" end="00:38:48.970" style="s2">talking about as well and then making</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.109" end="00:38:50.829" style="s2">six dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.970" end="00:38:53.049" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s broken because then they also</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.829" end="00:38:54.339" style="s2">showed like here&#39;s you know a food car</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.049" end="00:38:56.559" style="s2">on the street where they&#39;re selling hot</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.140" end="00:39:40.660" style="s2">and then possibly sell it and do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.460" end="00:39:42.910" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re getting people to</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:04.810" style="s2">computers and internet and they just</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.310" end="00:40:07.870" style="s2">need to be connected with people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.810" end="00:40:09.220" style="s2">have and another technology to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.870" end="00:40:11.410" style="s2">go through which I don&#39;t know if we</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.220" end="00:40:13.450" style="s2">could focus this down to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.410" end="00:40:16.990" style="s2">area or group of people that we know but</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.450" end="00:40:19.000" style="s2">there&#39;s the Amazon Mechanical Turk which</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.990" end="00:40:22.450" style="s2">is something you&#39;d probably also use for</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.000" end="00:40:24.100" style="s2">scraping data but I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.450" end="00:40:25.720" style="s2">could focus that towards like oh we want</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.100" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">to help people in this area and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.720" end="00:40:29.470" style="s2">but just to throw it out there yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:31.990" style="s2">don&#39;t think like that kind of has the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.470" end="00:40:33.640" style="s2">same limitation as up working that if</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.990" end="00:40:36.190" style="s2">they&#39;re on there they&#39;re already making</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.640" end="00:40:40.030" style="s2">some money like it&#39;s you know probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.190" end="00:40:43.570" style="s2">somewhat reasonable and yeah I wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.030" end="00:40:49.840" style="s2">big fan of Mechanical Turk I tried I did</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.570" end="00:40:51.550" style="s2">like work more just cuz it it makes</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.840" end="00:40:52.900" style="s2">prints it was very data focused like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.550" end="00:40:54.370" style="s2">could sort of build your thing I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.900" end="00:40:56.110" style="s2">okay here&#39;s a record I want you to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.370" end="00:40:57.910" style="s2">find this and do this research it would</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.110" end="00:40:59.380" style="s2">be great for that for like something</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.910" end="00:41:01.480" style="s2">going on finding government officials or</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.380" end="00:41:05.470" style="s2">Amazon would fit better when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.480" end="00:41:07.300" style="s2">care who does the work and then up works</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.470" end="00:41:08.770" style="s2">more like I&#39;m gonna vet this person a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.300" end="00:41:10.600" style="s2">little bit before they do the work and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.770" end="00:41:12.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll have one person doing it so it</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.600" end="00:41:14.140" style="s2">really depends on the style of work on</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.040" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">what&#39;s better yeah but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.140" end="00:41:18.190" style="s2">unlikely our projects Mechanical Turk</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:20.620" style="s2">will work real well because it takes so</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.190" end="00:41:22.630" style="s2">much set up and we don&#39;t need that much</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.620" end="00:41:24.520" style="s2">data I mean you could have like one</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.630" end="00:41:27.400" style="s2">person going in and finding the website</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.520" end="00:41:29.529" style="s2">for every community every city</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.400" end="00:41:31.150" style="s2">right Janna in the sphere or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.529" end="00:41:32.410" style="s2">and then the other person that could go</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.150" end="00:41:35.829" style="s2">in and then someone who could say okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.410" end="00:41:37.390" style="s2">find the cities you know teachers union</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.829" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">or something like that you know right</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.390" end="00:41:41.380" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:43.150" style="s2">and that&#39;s something where I prefer</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.380" end="00:41:44.260" style="s2">personally to work on something like up</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.150" end="00:41:46.450" style="s2">work so I can just keep working with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.260" end="00:41:49.150" style="s2">same person and you know I can learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.450" end="00:41:51.130" style="s2">like oh did person is good but when I</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.150" end="00:41:52.630" style="s2">first started doing it I was on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.130" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">project where we hired ten people and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.630" end="00:41:56.710" style="s2">three of them were good like three them</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:58.779" style="s2">actually really good results and it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.710" end="00:41:59.799" style="s2">quality and like they agreed with each</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.779" end="00:42:01.510" style="s2">other because we had multiple people</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.799" end="00:42:03.309" style="s2">script so it&#39;s the same thing to see</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.510" end="00:42:05.799" style="s2">like okay these people don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.309" end="00:42:07.270" style="s2">anyone their stuff isn&#39;t good but then</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.799" end="00:42:14.680" style="s2">let&#39;s read that word we kept working</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.270" end="00:42:16.390" style="s2">with them for years something&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.680" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">mean we don&#39;t really need this it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.390" end="00:42:20.440" style="s2">just me trying to like I said Starfire</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:22.869" style="s2">its of like there is part of me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.440" end="00:42:24.190" style="s2">like we can I get 10,000 of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.869" end="00:42:25.329" style="s2">together even if I don&#39;t speak their</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.190" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">language and have them to have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.329" end="00:42:30.490" style="s2">solution raising for their own society</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:36.849" style="s2">but that&#39;s a whole other fire to start</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.490" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">and not yeah because the initial post</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.849" end="00:42:46.289" style="s2">was about using resources it&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:50.349" style="s2">word but using helping people who have</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.289" end="00:42:53.049" style="s2">basically no work and they&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.349" end="00:42:56.529" style="s2">something for which there is no need</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.049" end="00:43:01.510" style="s2">right now in that country right and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.529" end="00:43:04.089" style="s2">sounded very like positive and in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.510" end="00:43:09.609" style="s2">conversation we also started talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.089" end="00:43:13.390" style="s2">about the work that is not paid as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.609" end="00:43:17.170" style="s2">in the first world and it sounded kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.390" end="00:43:21.099" style="s2">of I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.170" end="00:43:21.849" style="s2">the difference between one and the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.099" end="00:43:27.150" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.849" end="00:43:29.829" style="s2">well is it just me that my mind just</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.150" end="00:43:33.250" style="s2">called he likes both sides of the Omni</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.829" end="00:43:34.839" style="s2">win but you like we we need cheap labor</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.250" end="00:43:38.920" style="s2">let&#39;s be honest we have no money and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.839" end="00:43:39.869" style="s2">want no cheap labor and for them to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.920" end="00:43:41.670" style="s2">a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.869" end="00:43:43.890" style="s2">and be able to support their families</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.670" end="00:43:46.200" style="s2">and how do those two needs get met and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.890" end="00:43:48.650" style="s2">separating them so that like we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.200" end="00:43:54.019" style="s2">conflating the two is that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.650" end="00:43:57.589" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just I&#39;m kind of afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.019" end="00:44:00.049" style="s2">from being positive and helping people</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.589" end="00:44:03.900" style="s2">so we don&#39;t know the route of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.049" end="00:44:08.220" style="s2">outsourcing work that just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.900" end="00:44:12.900" style="s2">cheaper over there it&#39;s something I had</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.220" end="00:44:17.970" style="s2">come back with previously and it just it</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.900" end="00:44:20.130" style="s2">wasn&#39;t very positive I&#39;m not sure not</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.970" end="00:44:22.559" style="s2">kind of trying to find the spot in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.130" end="00:44:24.269" style="s2">Venn diagram where like the overlap and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.559" end="00:44:25.829" style="s2">it&#39;s like cheap labor and where that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.269" end="00:44:27.210" style="s2">cheap labor isn&#39;t exploitative like</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.829" end="00:44:29.910" style="s2">where&#39;s actually still helpful to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.210" end="00:44:31.859" style="s2">person like yeah and this is like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.910" end="00:44:33.660" style="s2">late 90s I think that there was an</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.859" end="00:44:35.249" style="s2">article that came out on slash dot where</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.660" end="00:44:36.269" style="s2">like there was all this hype around like</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.249" end="00:44:38.309" style="s2">oh we&#39;re taking advantage of the people</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.269" end="00:44:39.990" style="s2">in India because we&#39;re paying them so</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.309" end="00:44:41.339" style="s2">little and then they had an interview</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.990" end="00:44:43.380" style="s2">with somebody from India that was doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.339" end="00:44:44.910" style="s2">this and talking about you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.380" end="00:44:48.299" style="s2">you feel being paid such a small amount</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.910" end="00:44:51.989" style="s2">it&#39;s like my rent is $80 a month so if I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.299" end="00:44:53.549" style="s2">make $2 an hour that&#39;s great mmm well I</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.989" end="00:44:55.710" style="s2">remember the exact numbers but ended up</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.549" end="00:44:58.140" style="s2">being like okay it actually is like here</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.710" end="00:45:00.390" style="s2">we it&#39;s actually good for them the only</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.140" end="00:45:01.739" style="s2">real issue is that you know in theory</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.390" end="00:45:03.809" style="s2">that&#39;s taking away jobs from somebody</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.739" end="00:45:05.789" style="s2">here but if we&#39;re talking about people</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.809" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">like me and Bentley and anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.789" end="00:45:09.569" style="s2">paying out of our own pocket for a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:11.999" style="s2">project we don&#39;t have the money to pay</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.569" end="00:45:20.450" style="s2">somebody $50 an hour for it because then</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.999" end="00:45:24.749" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t pay rent I mean Honore sorry</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.450" end="00:45:28.559" style="s2">no just I hope even if it was possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.749" end="00:45:31.700" style="s2">the best way of just making it happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.559" end="00:45:41.190" style="s2">apart from like then doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.700" end="00:45:43.589" style="s2">would be to duplicate what outsourcing</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.190" end="00:45:45.329" style="s2">the idea of together tech so they do the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.589" end="00:45:50.999" style="s2">same thing they come together and talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.329" end="00:45:54.380" style="s2">about solutions that are good for them</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.999" end="00:46:00.690" style="s2">with all the rock</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.380" end="00:46:02.930" style="s2">context so that&#39;s something that could</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.690" end="00:46:06.660" style="s2">be connected to this equation as well</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.930" end="00:46:12.320" style="s2">cheap labor yes it&#39;s nice to have but</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.660" end="00:46:17.900" style="s2">then helping them as the title of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.320" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">of the thing and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.900" end="00:46:26.930" style="s2">spreading the idea of like making stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:29.100" style="s2">happen together as we discuss here so</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.930" end="00:46:31.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s nothing different from how</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.100" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">normally in the world people do it so</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.820" end="00:46:38.730" style="s2">exporting that idea as well and teaching</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:42.180" style="s2">them how to do it this way that could be</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.730" end="00:46:47.970" style="s2">even like the most beneficial part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.180" end="00:46:50.100" style="s2">this I love that cuz it sounds like then</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.970" end="00:46:52.590" style="s2">it might naturally emerge that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.100" end="00:46:55.080" style="s2">like hey do you have work for us we cost</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.590" end="00:46:57.600" style="s2">less you know what I mean like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.080" end="00:46:59.310" style="s2">like just how you&#39;re helping Adriel and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.600" end="00:47:01.080" style="s2">Bentley do their projects I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.310" end="00:47:03.630" style="s2">this because less but like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.080" end="00:47:05.400" style="s2">that right it naturally emerges that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.630" end="00:47:07.230" style="s2">like why wouldn&#39;t I use somebody I trust</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.400" end="00:47:08.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s here but helping them come</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.230" end="00:47:10.230" style="s2">together in translations and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.460" end="00:47:12.570" style="s2">where I was like maybe doing a solution</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.230" end="00:47:14.970" style="s2">raising with them even if I don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.570" end="00:47:16.650" style="s2">like the same language like finding that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.970" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">and having it be something that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.650" end="00:47:22.950" style="s2">that&#39;s not what you&#39;re saying but like</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:25.380" style="s2">ground up their their solutions what do</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.950" end="00:47:30.869" style="s2">they need and how can we um even with</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.380" end="00:47:33.990" style="s2">them instead of for them or especially</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.869" end="00:47:38.420" style="s2">if you know my experience with</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.990" end="00:47:44.070" style="s2">outsourcing is basically one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.420" end="00:47:47.369" style="s2">corpus I worked or before when they</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.070" end="00:47:51.600" style="s2">talked about hiring people you know Far</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.369" end="00:47:54.150" style="s2">East the main point was yeah we need ten</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.600" end="00:47:59.580" style="s2">of them because they cost this much and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.150" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">the emphasis was on how much it costs as</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.580" end="00:48:05.119" style="s2">opposed to you know UK programmers which</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:10.849" style="s2">it was just bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:14.260" style="s2">for many reasons but and we never and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.849" end="00:48:18.680" style="s2">the company never actually understood</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.260" end="00:48:21.230" style="s2">that like a local context for them and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.680" end="00:48:23.779" style="s2">it was also that because we just</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.230" end="00:48:27.410" style="s2">couldn&#39;t agree on basic things because</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.779" end="00:48:30.289" style="s2">of the cultural differences so it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.410" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">bad and in this case there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.289" end="00:48:37.670" style="s2">differences but they definitely might</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:40.069" style="s2">and should be used know the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.670" end="00:48:43.819" style="s2">thing they might have solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.069" end="00:48:49.400" style="s2">ideas that we don&#39;t and we can import</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.819" end="00:48:51.799" style="s2">that from them as well as we can let</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.400" end="00:48:57.230" style="s2">them know about the solutions and I know</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.799" end="00:48:59.569" style="s2">way of thinking we have so yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.230" end="00:49:02.529" style="s2">mutual like cooperation which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.569" end="00:49:11.569" style="s2">beneficial for all parties involved</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.529" end="00:49:16.490" style="s2">Justin assault something emerging in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.569" end="00:49:19.160" style="s2">brain of like having and this would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.490" end="00:49:21.019" style="s2">for them to do but having like a house</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.160" end="00:49:23.029" style="s2">in Venice Millia where people can come</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.019" end="00:49:25.759" style="s2">and stay learn to code learn to become</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.029" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">tech workers that they can possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.759" end="00:49:33.380" style="s2">paid to do that and then they then have</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:35.539" style="s2">a real like a skill that can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.380" end="00:49:37.400" style="s2">outsourced anywhere right that they can</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.539" end="00:49:38.839" style="s2">outsource it&#39;s not about now you own now</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.400" end="00:49:41.180" style="s2">we own you and you have to work for us</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.839" end="00:49:42.859" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you how do they empower</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.180" end="00:49:43.970" style="s2">themselves and then empower the next</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.859" end="00:49:45.349" style="s2">people who come through and the next</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.970" end="00:49:47.859" style="s2">people come through and have it be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.349" end="00:49:50.539" style="s2">regenerative system where people and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.859" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">that they&#39;re fed and provided a house</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.539" end="00:49:54.019" style="s2">well they&#39;re learning to code and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:56.509" style="s2">possibly have enough you know 100 bucks</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.019" end="00:49:58.549" style="s2">a month to live for their families I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.509" end="00:49:59.509" style="s2">sorry to to support their families I</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.549" end="00:50:01.220" style="s2">don&#39;t even have a hundred bucks a month</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.509" end="00:50:03.470" style="s2">is enough but if they&#39;re getting fed</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.220" end="00:50:05.529" style="s2">then that&#39;s any way that would be for</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.470" end="00:50:08.529" style="s2">them to figure to figure out with that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.529" end="00:50:11.210" style="s2">one of my dreams so like long time was</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.529" end="00:50:16.070" style="s2">having a worldwide network of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.210" end="00:50:18.770" style="s2">hackerspaces precisely houses that can</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.070" end="00:50:21.620" style="s2">promote technical ideas and people come</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.770" end="00:50:27.590" style="s2">together and do stuff for fun technical</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.620" end="00:50:31.820" style="s2">stuff for fun puckered spaces yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.590" end="00:50:36.860" style="s2">what&#39;s called without physical spaces</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.820" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">yes well we couldn&#39;t these days you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.860" end="00:50:42.230" style="s2">virtualize pretty much everything so but</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">the original idea for hacker space was</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.230" end="00:50:48.920" style="s2">just a house or like a flat of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:51.170" style="s2">physical space full of stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.920" end="00:50:53.630" style="s2">people could actually physically come</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.170" end="00:50:56.780" style="s2">together and do and learn from each</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.630" end="00:51:05.750" style="s2">other and it was not an organization</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.780" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">even together right okay that also helps</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.750" end="00:51:09.500" style="s2">get around alike you know we&#39;re not sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:11.180" style="s2">how available Internet is there well we</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.500" end="00:51:12.170" style="s2">can be sure that the the hacker space</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.180" end="00:51:14.360" style="s2">has internet and that&#39;s all we really</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.170" end="00:51:15.620" style="s2">have to care about yeah you know and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.360" end="00:51:17.930" style="s2">there would have to be computers and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.620" end="00:51:19.580" style="s2">monitors and a lodge has but that helps</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.930" end="00:51:21.530" style="s2">sort of alleviate that or it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.580" end="00:51:24.320" style="s2">you kind of know it but you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.530" end="00:51:27.350" style="s2">the resources cool you can go here and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.320" end="00:51:29.240" style="s2">use them and then you don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.350" end="00:51:30.230" style="s2">don&#39;t it but you&#39;d be getting paid and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.240" end="00:51:37.130" style="s2">then eventually you might be able to buy</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.230" end="00:51:39.800" style="s2">your own coders Without Borders is way</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.130" end="00:51:41.390" style="s2">and it was more for in Canada itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.800" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s so expensive to hire people</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.390" end="00:51:45.050" style="s2">here you know a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:47.330" style="s2">a year is what you would need to pay to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.050" end="00:51:49.460" style="s2">compete with Google at least right but</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.330" end="00:51:51.350" style="s2">having it be like hey you&#39;re a baby</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.460" end="00:51:54.410" style="s2">coder right you&#39;re just graduating come</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.350" end="00:51:57.620" style="s2">live rent-free learn and offer your</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.410" end="00:51:59.240" style="s2">skills for six months to a year the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.620" end="00:52:00.710" style="s2">that that could work in other countries</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.240" end="00:52:03.380" style="s2">and it could be from the ground up or</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.710" end="00:52:06.230" style="s2">they&#39;re connected with each other but no</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.380" end="00:52:08.750" style="s2">one&#39;s top-down you know like this is how</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.230" end="00:52:11.870" style="s2">it works it&#39;s like hey what projects do</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.750" end="00:52:13.880" style="s2">you want to work on what ya know whether</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.870" end="00:52:15.260" style="s2">it&#39;s for yourself and it&#39;s for profit or</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.880" end="00:52:16.760" style="s2">what it&#39;s what it&#39;s for interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.260" end="00:52:18.590" style="s2">because then it seems that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.760" end="00:52:20.420" style="s2">seeing how well some of the game B</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.590" end="00:52:26.290" style="s2">principles work in that country that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.420" end="00:52:26.290" style="s2">not really that game a exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.560" end="00:52:35.089" style="s2">but just the one thing that might out</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.329" end="00:52:36.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like maybe it&#39;s not that they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.089" end="00:52:38.390" style="s2">cheap labor</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.020" end="00:52:45.730" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.390" end="00:52:52.609" style="s2">maybe US Canada and UK are countries</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.730" end="00:52:55.010" style="s2">totally over long prices so and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.609" end="00:52:58.190" style="s2">question is why and also the answer part</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.010" end="00:53:02.270" style="s2">of the answer is like yeah food shelter</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.190" end="00:53:06.410" style="s2">and the everything like bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.270" end="00:53:10.099" style="s2">mussels pyramid is just other priced in</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.410" end="00:53:13.339" style="s2">some countries and therefore so don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.099" end="00:53:17.510" style="s2">nice to so that&#39;s very long far away</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.339" end="00:53:22.280" style="s2">think but work together so so the prices</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.510" end="00:53:27.940" style="s2">are level but so that the same standard</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.280" end="00:53:32.180" style="s2">of living can be reasonably and easily</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.940" end="00:53:36.410" style="s2">kept in all countries so sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.180" end="00:53:40.130" style="s2">see two up some countries come second a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.410" end="00:53:43.869" style="s2">little sorry yeah I think some of it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.130" end="00:53:48.470" style="s2">just a peculiarities of different</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.869" end="00:53:51.050" style="s2">economies interacting because not all</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.470" end="00:53:53.270" style="s2">countries of course but and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.050" end="00:53:55.160" style="s2">you know I do an hours with you know how</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.270" end="00:53:58.130" style="s2">many hours do I have to work in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.160" end="00:54:01.369" style="s2">pay for my rent in my groceries that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.130" end="00:54:03.530" style="s2">the same even though in one place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.369" end="00:54:05.000" style="s2">ten dollars and in that same currency in</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.530" end="00:54:07.040" style="s2">the other place would be worth a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.000" end="00:54:09.619" style="s2">you know a different number of hours so</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.040" end="00:54:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just kind of a quirk of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.619" end="00:54:19.160" style="s2">known undesigned</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.200" end="00:54:21.319" style="s2">kind of an economic system then so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.160" end="00:54:23.030" style="s2">and that is kind of evening out I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.319" end="00:54:27.260" style="s2">that&#39;s been one of the problems you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.030" end="00:54:29.740" style="s2">India used to be cheap for us but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.260" end="00:54:32.470" style="s2">not and that&#39;s great for them hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.740" end="00:54:35.750" style="s2">okay absolutely gonna fit it there</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.470" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">society in the dirt I think it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.750" end="00:54:39.450" style="s2">the same thing in China too as these</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:42.030" style="s2">jobs go over there that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.450" end="00:54:43.770" style="s2">our standards it pays a lot by their</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.030" end="00:54:45.030" style="s2">standards and so it starts to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.770" end="00:54:46.620" style="s2">raise everyone up because now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.030" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">more money in the local economies there</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.620" end="00:54:50.190" style="s2">and the people who are doing it like</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:52.890" style="s2">they&#39;re ballers over there</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.190" end="00:54:54.870" style="s2">yeah the odors from India who are you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.890" end="00:54:56.490" style="s2">know in like the late 90s early 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.870" end="00:55:00.950" style="s2">that were making pennies by our</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.490" end="00:55:03.630" style="s2">standards were doing very well locally</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.950" end="00:55:07.260" style="s2">it&#39;s I don&#39;t think we what Milton</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.630" end="00:55:10.140" style="s2">Friedman kind of was saying that this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.260" end="00:55:16.610" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen though the kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.140" end="00:55:20.130" style="s2">of great skipped a couple steps but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.610" end="00:55:22.590" style="s2">some benefit yeah you know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.130" end="00:55:24.150" style="s2">of it is sort of in how you actually do</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.590" end="00:55:26.580" style="s2">it and how you treat people and the sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.150" end="00:55:28.320" style="s2">of spaces that you do right listen are</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.580" end="00:55:30.090" style="s2">there windows or there lights or is it</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.320" end="00:55:31.590" style="s2">you know is it like a nice space to work</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.090" end="00:55:34.680" style="s2">or is it like you know a sweatshop</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.590" end="00:55:36.660" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty big difference for yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.680" end="00:55:40.350" style="s2">the day-to-day you know spending 40</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.660" end="00:55:43.710" style="s2">hours a week in a place or 60 hours a</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.350" end="00:55:45.150" style="s2">week in a place country or even just two</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.710" end="00:55:48.590" style="s2">hours a week in a place like if it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.150" end="00:55:48.590" style="s2">enough you know no thanks</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.010" end="00:55:54.330" style="s2">yeah but I think as we do hire people</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.900" end="00:55:58.470" style="s2">how and it would be kind of hypocritical</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.330" end="00:56:00.090" style="s2">we didn&#39;t think of an omni win yes I</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.470" end="00:56:03.150" style="s2">think that&#39;s super important and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.090" end="00:56:05.730" style="s2">impact of our dollars spend in the lives</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.150" end="00:56:09.390" style="s2">of the people that are receiving it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.730" end="00:56:11.850" style="s2">something too for us to consider yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.390" end="00:56:13.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of the benefits like and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.850" end="00:56:16.080" style="s2">that can actually kind of be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.500" end="00:56:17.850" style="s2">selling points is hey you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.080" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">if you&#39;re new at this</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.850" end="00:56:20.850" style="s2">hey you&#39;ll be making some money which</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:22.830" style="s2">also be an experience for people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.850" end="00:56:24.120" style="s2">worked in this industry you know and</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.830" end="00:56:26.070" style="s2">learn the terms and how things operate</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.120" end="00:56:27.660" style="s2">and so then if you want to go to a place</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.070" end="00:56:29.940" style="s2">like upwork and start charging you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.660" end="00:56:33.660" style="s2">coals from closer to Western prices this</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.940" end="00:56:35.820" style="s2">gets you on that road I guess we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.660" end="00:56:38.670" style="s2">have anyone else other than Pedro right</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.820" end="00:56:41.160" style="s2">now that&#39;s willing to spend some or had</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.670" end="00:56:46.650" style="s2">some funding regardless of where it came</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.160" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">from to spend right as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.650" end="00:56:51.420" style="s2">Daniel doesn&#39;t he think wants to move</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:52.960" style="s2">his project forward but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.420" end="00:56:56.710" style="s2">he&#39;s investing you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.960" end="00:56:57.910" style="s2">do you wonder if that&#39;s kind of a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.710" end="00:56:59.440" style="s2">value thing right like if they could</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.910" end="00:57:01.210" style="s2">spend fifty or hundred dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.440" end="00:57:02.770" style="s2">but if they&#39;re like I know this to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.210" end="00:57:04.780" style="s2">started it&#39;s gonna be $500 a month</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.770" end="00:57:06.730" style="s2">minimum so I&#39;m not even gonna bother but</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.780" end="00:57:08.950" style="s2">if are like hey could you afford fifty a</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.730" end="00:57:10.510" style="s2">month to you know get five or ten or</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.950" end="00:57:12.670" style="s2">however many hours of somebody&#39;s time a</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.510" end="00:57:15.010" style="s2">month okay that might be reasonable like</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.670" end="00:57:17.440" style="s2">I might be able to and that was what I</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.010" end="00:57:20.020" style="s2">was like is there like if we could pool</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:21.550" style="s2">our resources and hire one person right</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.020" end="00:57:23.170" style="s2">so they know they have enough work was</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.550" end="00:57:25.059" style="s2">kind of where my mind was going but if</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.170" end="00:57:26.950" style="s2">we only have two projects and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.059" end="00:57:30.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really work but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.950" end="00:57:33.609" style="s2">something percolating of like worker</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.760" end="00:57:35.680" style="s2">cooperatives in each of any country that</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.609" end="00:57:36.730" style="s2">wants to start one and beyond just a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:39.069" style="s2">workers cooperative where you have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.730" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">pay X amount of money like Co living</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.069" end="00:57:44.260" style="s2">part of it like a hackerspace Cola</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:46.000" style="s2">Dean&#39;s that they like a program they can</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.260" end="00:57:48.520" style="s2">run together bring people together live</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.000" end="00:57:51.309" style="s2">together and choose which projects they</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.520" end="00:57:53.140" style="s2">work on things like our projects that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.309" end="00:57:54.910" style="s2">are world-changing or not right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.140" end="00:57:56.890" style="s2">things that are like I work for IBM I</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.910" end="00:57:58.119" style="s2">work for Microsoft whatever that happens</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.890" end="00:58:00.790" style="s2">to be they&#39;re agreeing on together but</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.119" end="00:58:03.730" style="s2">also interconnected with one another so</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.790" end="00:58:06.369" style="s2">that have no idea how that works and we</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.730" end="00:58:08.799" style="s2">all speak different languages but my</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.369" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">guess is it with with translation and</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.799" end="00:58:13.750" style="s2">with enough people speaking a common</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">Venn diagram of language right that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.750" end="00:58:22.839" style="s2">actually does Spanish just never had</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">time what we found at me today I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.839" end="00:58:28.809" style="s2">tried and that might actually be like so</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:30.250" style="s2">for example if Eduardo wanted to act as</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.809" end="00:58:32.410" style="s2">a translator maybe he doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.250" end="00:58:35.710" style="s2">pay maybe we all chip in a bit to pay</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.410" end="00:58:37.960" style="s2">for his part and he acts as a translator</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.710" end="00:58:39.250" style="s2">and like that&#39;s sort of one of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.960" end="00:58:41.770" style="s2">because that&#39;s an important skill set</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.250" end="00:58:44.920" style="s2">that you know not many people in this</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.770" end="00:58:46.750" style="s2">group have yeah and another thing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.920" end="00:58:48.430" style="s2">think about if there is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.750" end="00:58:50.650" style="s2">like hacker space like that there is</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.430" end="00:58:53.079" style="s2">also training people on how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.650" end="00:58:56.290" style="s2">work as being a part of it they could</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.079" end="00:58:59.349" style="s2">come in knowing oh yeah nothing or very</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.290" end="00:59:04.329" style="s2">little or just a little bit and then you</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.349" end="00:59:05.530" style="s2">know yeah I think you know it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.329" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">hard to figure out how much do you pay</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.530" end="00:59:08.349" style="s2">for that how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:11.490" style="s2">or at their time you know all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.349" end="00:59:14.710" style="s2">but I feel like there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.490" end="00:59:17.650" style="s2">that we could figure out the minutiae of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.710" end="00:59:19.480" style="s2">the details its interests ends like</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.650" end="00:59:26.789" style="s2">instead of like a tech project incubator</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.480" end="00:59:29.260" style="s2">at the tech person incubator oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.789" end="00:59:32.369" style="s2">that sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.260" end="00:59:35.319" style="s2">we satirized our tunnels to the low tech</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.369" end="00:59:37.029" style="s2">but this is my dough that the network I</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.319" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">know are very spoke to Jubilee above</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.029" end="00:59:42.819" style="s2">this but this is where no other network</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:45.160" style="s2">of people starts you know I mean so if</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.819" end="00:59:46.869" style="s2">you stay like if we&#39;ve been say like six</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.160" end="00:59:48.309" style="s2">months down the line I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.869" end="00:59:51.250" style="s2">with youse all on the sea on I&#39;m stuff</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.250" end="00:59:55.359" style="s2">we&#39;d have all the information there to</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.049" end="00:59:57.549" style="s2">go to maybe start something with you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.359" end="01:00:00.369" style="s2">know who&#39;s interested in that idea you</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.549" end="01:00:01.809" style="s2">know I mean so so from all the work that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.369" end="01:00:03.849" style="s2">you have done previously having these</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.809" end="01:00:05.769" style="s2">conversations and that I thought being</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.849" end="01:00:08.109" style="s2">it you know implemented in the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.769" end="01:00:10.029" style="s2">you would have known right let&#39;s send</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.109" end="01:00:14.380" style="s2">so-and-so over there to do that for what</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.029" end="01:00:16.599" style="s2">you know I mean so um but yeah it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.380" end="01:00:19.500" style="s2">about having the network there and know</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.599" end="01:00:21.609" style="s2">we knew everybody yes you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.500" end="01:00:26.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve said we just haven&#39;t had that skill</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.609" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">set summer and we&#39;re very good for</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.410" end="01:00:30.779" style="s2">reassigning that to no one right like</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:33.789" style="s2">it&#39;s like we didn&#39;t know that was needed</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.779" end="01:00:37.690" style="s2">in our skill set and capacity to be able</p>
