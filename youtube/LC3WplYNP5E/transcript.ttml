<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">they do yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">bit of history that we have to recap Jim</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s try and kind of keep it as</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:28.380" style="s2">light as possible why I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:31.619" style="s2">really important topic right now is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.380" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">because the intellectual dark web was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.619" end="00:01:37.080" style="s2">an attempt to solve the problem of truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:39.210" style="s2">and the problem of sense making in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.080" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2">digital age and I think all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">things that it was responding to when it</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.060" end="00:01:47.700" style="s2">was kind of constellated and that was in</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">around 2018 are even more pressing now</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.700" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">and I think I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">with me but this sense of solving the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">problem of truth and the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">sense making in the digital media age</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:01.170" style="s2">seems that it&#39;s at the core of solving</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">any of the other kind of really pressing</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">problems because if we don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">true we can&#39;t really reward innate we</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">can&#39;t react I would certainly agree with</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:11.640" style="s2">you and you know in our work in the game</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">be world for instance I would not say</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.640" end="00:02:15.569" style="s2">that sense making is necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:17.580" style="s2">hardest of the problems that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.569" end="00:02:19.140" style="s2">solved but it&#39;s the first one that needs</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.580" end="00:02:22.230" style="s2">to be solved because without the ability</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.140" end="00:02:25.019" style="s2">to identify truth and have</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.230" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">and people adhere to it and apply it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.019" end="00:02:28.409" style="s2">a sensible fashion it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:30.750" style="s2">difficult to solve any of the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.409" end="00:02:33.720" style="s2">parts of the so-called meta-crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.750" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">absolutely with you there yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.720" end="00:02:37.590" style="s2">glad he brought up game B because and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:40.230" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.590" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">valuable podcast that you put together</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.230" end="00:02:44.220" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s listened to by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">of people who are approaching these</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.220" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">questions at a really high level and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:52.650" style="s2">originally the intellectual dark web was</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.430" end="00:02:54.660" style="s2">framed as something of a game B</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.650" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">enterprise and I don&#39;t know if you want</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.660" end="00:02:58.440" style="s2">to recap what that what that might mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">what game B is at this point before we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.440" end="00:03:03.690" style="s2">go any further into it yeah to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">game B is the attempt some of us have</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.690" end="00:03:09.390" style="s2">been working on including some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:11.220" style="s2">members of the IDW since 2012 to develop</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.390" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">a new social operating system for</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.220" end="00:03:17.310" style="s2">humanity which his goal is to avert the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:19.410" style="s2">failure modes itself terminating modes</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.310" end="00:03:20.870" style="s2">that we what we think of game a is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.410" end="00:03:24.359" style="s2">headed on to whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.870" end="00:03:26.060" style="s2">overpopulation overheating of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.359" end="00:03:28.680" style="s2">running out of natural resources</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.060" end="00:03:31.349" style="s2">endogenous failures such as Wars or</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.680" end="00:03:33.419" style="s2">economic collapse etc and literally</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.349" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">replacing that with a better social</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.419" end="00:03:39.980" style="s2">operating system that whose hallmarks</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:43.500" style="s2">are self-organizing Network centric</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.980" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">decentralized and metastable yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.500" end="00:03:47.609" style="s2">then I guess within the sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:51.690" style="s2">realm you&#39;re looking at kind of what are</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.609" end="00:03:54.989" style="s2">the game a self terminating systems that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.690" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">are destabilizing or a corrupting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.989" end="00:04:01.919" style="s2">information ecology and I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:04.889" style="s2">intellectual dark web and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.919" end="00:04:08.069" style="s2">Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.889" end="00:04:09.629" style="s2">conversation on the Rubin report so Bret</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.069" end="00:04:11.750" style="s2">Weinstein the evolutionary biologist</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.629" end="00:04:14.730" style="s2">Eric Weinstein is a mathematician and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.750" end="00:04:15.810" style="s2">that there&#39;s that they&#39;re brothers that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.730" end="00:04:19.139" style="s2">it&#39;s not a coincidence they have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.810" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">same the same surname but they were on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.139" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">show called the Rubin report and talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:26.729" style="s2">about how truth seeking cannot survive</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:28.470" style="s2">an encounter with market forces and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.729" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">think of all things that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.470" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">summarizes the problem and and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:36.110" style="s2">problem that then infests academia</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:38.830" style="s2">because you get motivated research</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.110" end="00:04:42.350" style="s2">it infest journalism because you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.830" end="00:04:45.320" style="s2">financial motives like truth as a as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.350" end="00:04:49.220" style="s2">enterprise and in a way you could argue</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.320" end="00:04:51.890" style="s2">that academia and journalism properly</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.220" end="00:04:53.930" style="s2">exercised is actually a game B</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.890" end="00:04:55.490" style="s2">enterprise if you&#39;re making truth the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.930" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">highest value it&#39;s actually a game the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.490" end="00:04:58.610" style="s2">enterprise-e you then look at what are</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">the market failures and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.610" end="00:05:04.010" style="s2">failure conditions of that kind of truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:06.920" style="s2">seeking enterprise and the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.010" end="00:05:09.830" style="s2">dark word was originally consisted of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.920" end="00:05:12.830" style="s2">group of public intellectuals a group of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.830" end="00:05:15.980" style="s2">podcasters including people like sam</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.830" end="00:05:17.930" style="s2">harris joe rogan jordan peterson brett</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.980" end="00:05:20.990" style="s2">and eric obviously heather high-end</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.930" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">Bret&#39;s wife Claire layman of quill EPS</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.990" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">and quill let the magazine was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:27.500" style="s2">considered something of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:30.260" style="s2">in-house magazine for the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.500" end="00:05:34.700" style="s2">dark web it was framed as people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.260" end="00:05:36.740" style="s2">tended to reject orthodoxy who engaged</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.700" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">in first principles thinking didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.740" end="00:05:43.010" style="s2">along with the crowd and it was also if</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:44.210" style="s2">there was a if there was a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.010" end="00:05:46.730" style="s2">that it was sort of coalesced around</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.210" end="00:05:50.510" style="s2">that was often criticized for it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.730" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">that it was acting in response to what</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.510" end="00:05:56.420" style="s2">it saw as the constraining of free</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:59.270" style="s2">debate by the excesses of campus culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.420" end="00:06:03.380" style="s2">by identity politics by the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.270" end="00:06:05.330" style="s2">woke left so it had a political aim but</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.380" end="00:06:08.690" style="s2">also I know that it was considered</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.330" end="00:06:11.570" style="s2">certainly or especially by Eric and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.690" end="00:06:13.220" style="s2">Brett as only the sort of media side of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.570" end="00:06:17.000" style="s2">a much broader conversation that needed</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.220" end="00:06:18.680" style="s2">to happen in terms of orthodoxies and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.000" end="00:06:20.180" style="s2">consensus thinking that have built up</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.680" end="00:06:21.710" style="s2">within lots of different disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.180" end="00:06:23.750" style="s2">obviously Brett would be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.710" end="00:06:25.940" style="s2">evolutionary biology Eric will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.750" end="00:06:27.470" style="s2">talking about physics and their argument</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.940" end="00:06:29.330" style="s2">was that so many of these different sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.470" end="00:06:30.710" style="s2">of academic fields had got stuck at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.330" end="00:06:32.270" style="s2">same time obviously that&#39;s a huge</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.270" end="00:06:39.590" style="s2">into but the intellectual dark web was</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.480" end="00:06:42.500" style="s2">was named in early 2018 and then it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.590" end="00:06:45.740" style="s2">identified in the New York Times by a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.500" end="00:06:49.040" style="s2">journalist called Barry Weiss in may 20</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.740" end="00:06:49.380" style="s2">18 and then it rose to it picked up</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.040" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.380" end="00:06:54.060" style="s2">there were loads of Facebook groups</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:56.340" style="s2">there was it it it really landed as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.060" end="00:06:57.780" style="s2">concept or as a meme it was very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.340" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">strong and there was a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.780" end="00:07:02.340" style="s2">around it and a lot of discussions was</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:04.170" style="s2">it what was the intellectual dark where</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.340" end="00:07:07.620" style="s2">was it this group of people was it a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.170" end="00:07:10.050" style="s2">certain type of interaction was it a set</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.620" end="00:07:11.970" style="s2">of good faith principles and Eric would</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.050" end="00:07:13.110" style="s2">say he came up with the term in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.970" end="00:07:15.930" style="s2">first place he&#39;d say that he</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.110" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">deliberately did not define it because</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.930" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">he wanted it to be you know to have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:22.170" style="s2">little bit of mystique and to also that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:24.810" style="s2">he thought defining it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.170" end="00:07:26.670" style="s2">mistake but it but it certainly I</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.810" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">interviewed quite a few of the members</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.670" end="00:07:32.760" style="s2">of it and I think it was Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:34.860" style="s2">who said it he obviously pointed he kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.760" end="00:07:37.380" style="s2">of questioned whether it really existed</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.860" end="00:07:39.660" style="s2">but he said it had to exist in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.380" end="00:07:41.370" style="s2">sense because the name stuck and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.660" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">the fact that the name stuck meant that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.370" end="00:07:44.610" style="s2">it was referring to it to a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">and you can kind of argue what that real</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.610" end="00:07:50.790" style="s2">thing was but it was all for me it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:52.190" style="s2">really the coming to consciousness of an</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.790" end="00:07:56.370" style="s2">alternative to the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.190" end="00:07:58.470" style="s2">traditional media entity it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.370" end="00:08:00.690" style="s2">uniting a very disparate group of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.470" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">but all of whom had thrived in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.690" end="00:08:06.750" style="s2">digital world had kind of grown up</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:09.390" style="s2">outside the mainstream bubbles and had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.750" end="00:08:11.460" style="s2">lot of heterodox opinions and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.390" end="00:08:12.900" style="s2">different perspectives that that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.460" end="00:08:14.460" style="s2">fully I think the reason that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.900" end="00:08:17.400" style="s2">succeeded a lot of what they were saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.460" end="00:08:18.270" style="s2">was not fully reflected in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.400" end="00:08:20.280" style="s2">traditional media</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.270" end="00:08:21.870" style="s2">that&#39;s quite a lot of words Jim I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.280" end="00:08:23.940" style="s2">know if you wanted to to jump in at any</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.870" end="00:08:27.630" style="s2">point yeah let me jump back to that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.940" end="00:08:29.340" style="s2">again as a new Brett and Eric new Brett</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.630" end="00:08:30.750" style="s2">quite well and Eric a little bit and has</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.340" end="00:08:34.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve had some conversations mostly</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.750" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">about science actually so I did watch</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.020" end="00:08:37.860" style="s2">the rise of the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:40.469" style="s2">with some interest and with some</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.860" end="00:08:42.810" style="s2">sympathy right and I do think that there</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.469" end="00:08:44.310" style="s2">you know Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.810" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">despite what maybe Jordan Peterson had</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.310" end="00:08:48.950" style="s2">to say there was some organizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:52.140" style="s2">principles that may not have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.950" end="00:08:54.060" style="s2">entirely obvious to maybe even the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.140" end="00:08:57.390" style="s2">people involved but struck me at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.060" end="00:08:59.970" style="s2">as where they were coming from and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.390" end="00:09:01.350" style="s2">then also some motivations call it basic</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.970" end="00:09:02.670" style="s2">human motivations which I&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.350" end="00:09:06.120" style="s2">in a second</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.670" end="00:09:07.830" style="s2">look at the people who are generally</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.120" end="00:09:09.150" style="s2">thought to be part of the IDW and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.830" end="00:09:11.370" style="s2">course one of the things about the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.150" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">is there is no such thing there is no</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.370" end="00:09:15.570" style="s2">actual club there is no actual members</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:18.990" style="s2">is just sort of a consensus of who is or</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.570" end="00:09:21.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t it an ID w ER and what stands out</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.990" end="00:09:23.940" style="s2">- for me is that there are people from</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.330" end="00:09:25.110" style="s2">the left and the right people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.940" end="00:09:27.510" style="s2">probably about the farthest on the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.110" end="00:09:28.980" style="s2">would be Ben Shapiro farthest on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.510" end="00:09:31.170" style="s2">left at least of the personalities that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.980" end="00:09:34.020" style="s2">I know of it might be Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.170" end="00:09:37.830" style="s2">who&#39;s actually pretty far left but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.020" end="00:09:41.430" style="s2">all fall within the broader domain of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.830" end="00:09:42.900" style="s2">classic liberalism essentially the you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.430" end="00:09:45.060" style="s2">know the theories that I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.900" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">point to is that were come from the work</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.060" end="00:09:51.930" style="s2">of John Stuart Mill and the in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:54.750" style="s2">century and you know essentially confirm</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.930" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">and the evolution of that thinking into</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.750" end="00:09:59.070" style="s2">what we might call a modernist</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:10:03.660" style="s2">perspective and that what they stand in</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.070" end="00:10:06.540" style="s2">opposition to is we call it we label it</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.660" end="00:10:09.000" style="s2">woke but I would suggest that the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.540" end="00:10:12.090" style="s2">deeper intellectual history trend there</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.000" end="00:10:14.670" style="s2">and there is post-modernism and critical</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.090" end="00:10:17.310" style="s2">theory and in fact one of the members of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.670" end="00:10:19.980" style="s2">the intellectual dark webs Steven Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.310" end="00:10:23.090" style="s2">has written quite eloquently and also</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.980" end="00:10:25.650" style="s2">john hate on you know the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.090" end="00:10:28.350" style="s2">post-modernism and critical theory as</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.650" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">applied in academia and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.350" end="00:10:33.390" style="s2">truthfully you know from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">with similar sympathies post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.390" end="00:10:37.170" style="s2">and critical theory just sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.030" style="s2">moonshine and nonsense tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.170" end="00:10:42.120" style="s2">truth i mean some of this horseshit we</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.030" end="00:10:44.550" style="s2">hear about you know though we can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.120" end="00:10:46.350" style="s2">there&#39;s only two sexes as well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:48.510" style="s2">say there are only two sexes and from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.350" end="00:10:51.540" style="s2">certain perspective with a certain lens</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.510" end="00:10:54.090" style="s2">looking at let&#39;s say DNA you can say</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.540" end="00:10:56.190" style="s2">people are either XX or XY there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.090" end="00:10:59.160" style="s2">tiny percent of percentage of people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.190" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">are XX y but it&#39;s ignore that small</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.160" end="00:11:03.660" style="s2">amount of people you can say there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:05.010" style="s2">two two sexes but in certain parts of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.660" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">academia you&#39;re not allowed to say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.010" end="00:11:10.770" style="s2">for reasons of postmodernist</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:14.820" style="s2">race basically so that&#39;s to my mind the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.770" end="00:11:16.110" style="s2">real organizing center of those of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.820" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">self-organized</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.110" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">essentially as the IDW then in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:23.130" style="s2">human motivation one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:24.630" style="s2">I think stands out is that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.130" end="00:11:25.410" style="s2">all these people these the ones that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.630" end="00:11:30.269" style="s2">know of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.410" end="00:11:32.459" style="s2">we&#39;re victims of various attacks by mobs</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.269" end="00:11:34.829" style="s2">online principally though in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.459" end="00:11:37.800" style="s2">Brett actually in person and the famous</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.829" end="00:11:40.019" style="s2">Battle of Evergreen State University and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.800" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a natural inclination of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.019" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">victims of mobs to mob together</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.540" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">themselves and produce a gang you know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:48.300" style="s2">remember when I was in seventh grade</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:51.420" style="s2">you know seventh grader in a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.300" end="00:11:53.100" style="s2">rough neighborhood and you know we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.420" end="00:11:54.660" style="s2">at the mercy of the ninth graders until</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.100" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">we formed the pickpockets Club</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.660" end="00:11:59.100" style="s2">eventually we had about 80 members and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:01.410" style="s2">even the ninth graders were afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.100" end="00:12:03.810" style="s2"> with us right and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.410" end="00:12:06.510" style="s2">at the human motivational level again</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.810" end="00:12:10.500" style="s2">perhaps subconsciously the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.510" end="00:12:12.779" style="s2">binding energy of the IDW was that these</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.500" end="00:12:15.810" style="s2">people have been attacked by various</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.779" end="00:12:18.510" style="s2">insane mobs and you know chose to club</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.810" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">together to fight back collectively or</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.510" end="00:12:22.589" style="s2">at least to find solace with each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:25.980" style="s2">and again that&#39;s one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.589" end="00:12:27.990" style="s2">found is a big plots around the IDW and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.980" end="00:12:31.620" style="s2">again a kind of a meta organizing</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.990" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">principle is at least to a degree these</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.620" end="00:12:35.570" style="s2">were folks who were committed to saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:38.430" style="s2">what they thought was true irrespective</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.570" end="00:12:40.860" style="s2">of what the mobs thought and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.430" end="00:12:43.230" style="s2">while as you pointed out people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.860" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">think of them as in opposition to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.230" end="00:12:47.820" style="s2">woke post modernist mob I would say</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:50.850" style="s2">every one of the ones I know of is also</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.820" end="00:12:53.910" style="s2">in strong opposition to the willfully</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.850" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">ignorant right-wing mobs right these are</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.910" end="00:12:57.420" style="s2">all people who believe in evolution oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:12:58.769" style="s2">how what a striking idea I&#39;ll bet</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:09.630" style="s2">hoax right these are people grounded in</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.149" end="00:13:16.980" style="s2">actually strong more strongly opposed to</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:25.800" style="s2">the binding energy was and and where</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.070" end="00:13:27.870" style="s2">they fit in space and in intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.800" end="00:13:29.579" style="s2">history what do you think about that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.870" end="00:13:29.939" style="s2">think I&#39;d agree with most of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.579" end="00:13:32.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.939" end="00:13:34.709" style="s2">few things that you mentioned that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.339" end="00:13:36.479" style="s2">like to pick up on but not dive too much</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.709" end="00:13:37.079" style="s2">into one of which he mentioned Steven</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.479" end="00:13:40.289" style="s2">Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.079" end="00:13:42.449" style="s2">now whether Steven Pinker is in the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.289" end="00:13:45.269" style="s2">or not is a very interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.449" end="00:13:47.039" style="s2">and I know that some of the members</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.269" end="00:13:49.859" style="s2">would think that he probably isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.039" end="00:13:51.209" style="s2">because he duh and actually that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.859" end="00:13:52.949" style="s2">kind of even though he&#39;s had his own</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.209" end="00:13:56.279" style="s2">run-ins with kind of identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.949" end="00:13:59.789" style="s2">he and his very skeptical of of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.279" end="00:14:02.039" style="s2">he actually he&#39;s got a very sort of pan</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.789" end="00:14:03.869" style="s2">glassy and view on the world and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.039" end="00:14:06.569" style="s2">actually the sort of the core of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.869" end="00:14:09.209" style="s2">saw it as an existential project to to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.569" end="00:14:11.639" style="s2">recover certain values that he that he</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.209" end="00:14:12.929" style="s2">that he wasn&#39;t so you can kind of dive</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.639" end="00:14:16.979" style="s2">into that but the question of whether he</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.929" end="00:14:18.479" style="s2">as a with with his sort of beliefs is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.979" end="00:14:20.849" style="s2">part of it or not is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.479" end="00:14:22.739" style="s2">question the other the other point that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.849" end="00:14:24.739" style="s2">I wanted to make which is when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.739" end="00:14:27.599" style="s2">talked about the sort of dividing line</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.739" end="00:14:29.609" style="s2">why that&#39;s really relevant right now is</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.599" end="00:14:31.919" style="s2">that over the last couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.609" end="00:14:34.499" style="s2">there&#39;s been a series of revolts in</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.919" end="00:14:37.169" style="s2">American newsrooms arguably you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.499" end="00:14:39.509" style="s2">say that that I&#39;m putting out a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.169" end="00:14:41.209" style="s2">later today saying asking the question</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.509" end="00:14:44.669" style="s2">whether whether journalism is dead</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.209" end="00:14:46.049" style="s2">because and that there was an</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.669" end="00:14:48.929" style="s2">interesting that the woman who wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.049" end="00:14:50.369" style="s2">original IDW article Barry Weiss</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.929" end="00:14:54.539" style="s2">who&#39;s an opinion writer of the New York</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.369" end="00:14:56.549" style="s2">Times wrote a series of tweets that went</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.539" end="00:14:59.970" style="s2">very viral and caused a real reaction</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.549" end="00:15:01.799" style="s2">where she said that what we&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.970" end="00:15:03.629" style="s2">a lot of newsrooms most famously at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.799" end="00:15:06.779" style="s2">New York Times when the opinion editor</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.629" end="00:15:09.899" style="s2">was forced to resign maybe about a week</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.779" end="00:15:13.649" style="s2">ago after an editorial by a US Senator</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.899" end="00:15:16.499" style="s2">Tom cotton and then a revolt within the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.649" end="00:15:19.379" style="s2">newsroom and she described this split</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.499" end="00:15:21.179" style="s2">between the new younger generation of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.379" end="00:15:23.459" style="s2">woke journalists and then the older</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.179" end="00:15:25.409" style="s2">generation of liberal journalists who</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.459" end="00:15:26.879" style="s2">were then they were realizing that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.409" end="00:15:28.919" style="s2">actually had fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.879" end="00:15:30.929" style="s2">values the new set of journalists were</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.919" end="00:15:33.059" style="s2">much more focused on whether something</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.929" end="00:15:35.639" style="s2">was causing harm and a lot of them all</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.059" end="00:15:37.829" style="s2">tweeted in unison that this op-ed by Tom</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.639" end="00:15:41.009" style="s2">cotton was putting their colleagues in</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.829" end="00:15:42.419" style="s2">danger and and the older journalists who</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.009" end="00:15:43.570" style="s2">believe in more sort of freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.419" end="00:15:45.910" style="s2">speech and classical</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.570" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">all values and she said that that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.910" end="00:15:50.100" style="s2">split was playing out throughout</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:53.950" style="s2">companies and news organizations</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.100" end="00:15:55.720" style="s2">throughout America and this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.950" end="00:15:57.400" style="s2">astonishing thing is the speed this has</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.720" end="00:16:00.580" style="s2">happened like this is this has come in</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.400" end="00:16:03.490" style="s2">in the last two weeks really and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.580" end="00:16:05.980" style="s2">I think most people looking at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.490" end="00:16:08.080" style="s2">going on now would agree that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.980" end="00:16:09.790" style="s2">what the intellectual dark word was</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.080" end="00:16:10.470" style="s2">pointing to and warning about has now</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.790" end="00:16:13.450" style="s2">come true</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.470" end="00:16:16.870" style="s2">very very prescient I think I think a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.450" end="00:16:18.400" style="s2">lot of people are saying and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.870" end="00:16:20.290" style="s2">something like you mentioned Brett</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.400" end="00:16:23.170" style="s2">Weinstein and evergreen being the sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.290" end="00:16:26.470" style="s2">of the the most clear example of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.170" end="00:16:29.560" style="s2">happens if you get kind of mob rule in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.470" end="00:16:31.510" style="s2">university campus and a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.560" end="00:16:34.530" style="s2">seems to be playing out more broadly now</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.510" end="00:16:38.200" style="s2">in in society and in culture so I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.530" end="00:16:40.960" style="s2">exploring what the intellectual darkweb</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.200" end="00:16:42.610" style="s2">got right whether it was a successful</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.960" end="00:16:45.220" style="s2">prototype of something that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.610" end="00:16:46.270" style="s2">recover or whether it failed I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.220" end="00:16:49.950" style="s2">there are different perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.270" end="00:16:52.780" style="s2">you can take my my take on it is that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.950" end="00:16:54.310" style="s2">it succeeded in some ways and failed in</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.780" end="00:16:57.670" style="s2">others and I think looking at why it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.310" end="00:16:59.200" style="s2">failed is really valuable because it it</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.670" end="00:17:02.380" style="s2">points to a lot of the failure</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.200" end="00:17:03.670" style="s2">conditions of sense making some I could</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.380" end="00:17:07.449" style="s2">kind of cut with on the top of my head</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.670" end="00:17:10.240" style="s2">is audience capture they&#39;re they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.449" end="00:17:12.220" style="s2">of rewards that you orient towards not</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.240" end="00:17:14.829" style="s2">just financial rewards but rewards in</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.220" end="00:17:17.020" style="s2">terms of aligned incentive structures</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.829" end="00:17:19.150" style="s2">you mentioned this sort of sense of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.020" end="00:17:21.220" style="s2">being and I think you pointed to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.150" end="00:17:23.170" style="s2">idea that they became a tribe as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.220" end="00:17:24.699" style="s2">if you define yourself as being anti</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.170" end="00:17:27.400" style="s2">tribal what happens when you become a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.699" end="00:17:30.030" style="s2">tribe of anti tribal thinkers that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.400" end="00:17:33.100" style="s2">itself starts to create issues of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.030" end="00:17:35.710" style="s2">in-groups and out-groups as well and now</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.100" end="00:17:37.540" style="s2">I&#39;m also interested in of that original</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.710" end="00:17:40.180" style="s2">constellation of people who are in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.540" end="00:17:43.510" style="s2">intellectual dark web who is still I</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.180" end="00:17:46.330" style="s2">like the frame that samo Berger came up</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.510" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">with with when you talked about live</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.330" end="00:17:50.860" style="s2">players and dead players who&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:53.380" style="s2">live player and who&#39;s who&#39;s a dead</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.860" end="00:17:56.340" style="s2">player now and I think I think some are</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.380" end="00:17:58.530" style="s2">still alive and some are no longer</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.340" end="00:18:00.810" style="s2">really generating any novelty or</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.530" end="00:18:01.860" style="s2">generating any kind of interest and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.810" end="00:18:03.420" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these different different</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.860" end="00:18:06.120" style="s2">issues that I&#39;d be interested to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.420" end="00:18:08.490" style="s2">later on in the conversation yeah let me</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.120" end="00:18:09.570" style="s2">make a couple of reactions and then and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.490" end="00:18:11.580" style="s2">then I&#39;ll turn it back over to you to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.570" end="00:18:12.900" style="s2">talk about you know where it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.580" end="00:18:14.580" style="s2">it&#39;s been successful where it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.900" end="00:18:17.310" style="s2">failure or where you may be thought of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.580" end="00:18:21.210" style="s2">as a prototype with some level of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.310" end="00:18:22.710" style="s2">success you know this issue of the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.210" end="00:18:25.530" style="s2">two weeks in the newsroom and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.710" end="00:18:27.710" style="s2">generally in popular culture and their</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.530" end="00:18:29.300" style="s2">revolts in the streets is to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.710" end="00:18:31.320" style="s2">highlighting what I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.300" end="00:18:35.190" style="s2">previously that you know the correct way</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.320" end="00:18:37.560" style="s2">to think about is and or positioning at</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:44.910" style="s2">essentially you&#39;re seeing is people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.350" end="00:18:46.500" style="s2">educated principally at elite</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.910" end="00:18:49.170" style="s2">universities and this is an important</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.500" end="00:18:52.200" style="s2">thing to keep in mind the post modernist</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.790" end="00:19:54.150" style="s2">suggest the IDW is an attempt to oppose</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:57.770" style="s2">that you know the post modernist</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.490" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">be thought of as a prototype actually</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:54.820" style="s2">some data I pulled up this morning I did</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.820" end="00:21:00.130" style="s2">looks at the occurrence rate of searches</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.680" end="00:21:03.610" style="s2">for various terms on IDW and it Peaks</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.130" end="00:21:06.940" style="s2">very highly in June July August</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.610" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">September of 2018 and has been gradually</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.940" end="00:21:13.320" style="s2">downhill since then with a few ups and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">downs but is now down at you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.320" end="00:21:18.370" style="s2">a twentieth of what it was at its peak</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:20.860" style="s2">and then just for fun just now I</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.370" end="00:21:23.110" style="s2">compared it with the search term game B</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.860" end="00:21:25.300" style="s2">and interestingly game be an</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.110" end="00:21:29.350" style="s2">intellectual dark web or not are now at</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.300" end="00:21:31.030" style="s2">about the same level of salience on</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.350" end="00:21:33.640" style="s2">Google Trends even though game B was</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.030" end="00:21:36.070" style="s2">basically very very little two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.640" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">so gives you a sense that at least at</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.070" end="00:21:41.580" style="s2">the at the level that&#39;s captured by</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:44.680" style="s2">Google Trends intellectual dark web is</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.580" end="00:21:46.930" style="s2">is on a downward trend had quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.680" end="00:21:49.150" style="s2">happened yet but it&#39;s close yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.930" end="00:21:51.870" style="s2">wanted to pick up on just some of your</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.150" end="00:21:54.610" style="s2">framing before about post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.870" end="00:21:58.660" style="s2">the the values of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.610" end="00:22:00.490" style="s2">web because and I find I I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.660" end="00:22:02.920" style="s2">that you&#39;re you&#39;re not a fan of ken</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.920" end="00:22:07.540" style="s2">reading a brief history of everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.990" end="00:22:09.190" style="s2">and I we have a tentative agreement by</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.540" end="00:22:10.920" style="s2">Ken to be on my podcast</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.190" end="00:22:14.050" style="s2">right and I am surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.920" end="00:22:15.550" style="s2">integralists in my life and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.050" end="00:22:19.030" style="s2">know much about it and I&#39;ve dug into it</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.550" end="00:22:20.500" style="s2">and my quick reaction is probably no to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.030" end="00:22:23.020" style="s2">no surprise that part of it I find</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.500" end="00:22:23.920" style="s2">useful and part of it I find shall we</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.020" end="00:22:26.440" style="s2">say three question</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.920" end="00:22:29.770" style="s2">marks the part I found useful so far are</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.440" end="00:22:31.330" style="s2">the so called four quadrants I actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.770" end="00:22:32.740" style="s2">have started using those when I</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.330" end="00:22:35.680" style="s2">approached certain classes of problems</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.740" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">and found it actually a useful framework</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.680" end="00:22:40.660" style="s2">now some of the upper levels of his</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">levels I find to be in the category of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.660" end="00:22:47.500" style="s2">moonshine and nonsense but that may just</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:49.990" style="s2">be my Philistine anti spiritualist self</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.500" end="00:22:52.780" style="s2">so I&#39;m digging into it I hope to know</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.990" end="00:22:55.150" style="s2">more and so far I find it an impressive</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.780" end="00:22:57.010" style="s2">body of work yeah I was I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.150" end="00:22:59.860" style="s2">principally and I would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.010" end="00:23:02.980" style="s2">recommend the e-book Trump in a post</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.860" end="00:23:04.690" style="s2">truth world where he goes through the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.980" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">difference so he uses a system called</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.690" end="00:23:09.250" style="s2">spiral dynamics which I think originally</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:12.460" style="s2">came from Clare graves and it looks at</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.250" end="00:23:15.460" style="s2">different different ways of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.460" end="00:23:17.650" style="s2">the world and the principal one is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.460" end="00:23:20.230" style="s2">tension between modernist values and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.650" end="00:23:21.490" style="s2">postmodern values and so I wouldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.230" end="00:23:23.260" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t throw out post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.490" end="00:23:26.740" style="s2">completely I think there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.260" end="00:23:28.810" style="s2">valuable parts within it but the and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.740" end="00:23:31.150" style="s2">this is where I think this particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.810" end="00:23:33.010" style="s2">frame the Wilbur frame or the spiral</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.150" end="00:23:35.470" style="s2">dynamics frame is really really useful</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.010" end="00:23:38.400" style="s2">to understand the intellectual darkweb</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.470" end="00:23:40.390" style="s2">because the question is whether a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.400" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">realization that the Left can go too far</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.390" end="00:23:45.040" style="s2">and that this this particular postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:48.160" style="s2">worldview can become pathological</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.040" end="00:23:50.170" style="s2">whether you&#39;re moving on to a potential</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.160" end="00:23:53.020" style="s2">higher synthesis or you&#39;re falling down</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.170" end="00:23:54.550" style="s2">to a simply kind of reacting a place</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.020" end="00:23:56.350" style="s2">where you&#39;re just reacting against it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.550" end="00:23:58.840" style="s2">and I think some of the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.350" end="00:24:01.990" style="s2">intellectual dark web did push on to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.840" end="00:24:06.040" style="s2">sort of higher synthesis and some just</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.990" end="00:24:09.670" style="s2">kind of retreated to bashing bashing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.040" end="00:24:12.190" style="s2">left bashing post-modernism and I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.670" end="00:24:13.720" style="s2">sort of Jordan Pederson at his best</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.190" end="00:24:17.250" style="s2">would go to the synthesis and that his</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.720" end="00:24:20.560" style="s2">worse would kind of go go to a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.250" end="00:24:23.560" style="s2">lower kind of what do you call it a lack</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.560" end="00:24:26.350" style="s2">of synthesis it&#39;s difficult to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.560" end="00:24:28.360" style="s2">about without the understanding some</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.350" end="00:24:29.920" style="s2">some part of that map and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.360" end="00:24:31.480" style="s2">highly encourage people if they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.920" end="00:24:33.700" style="s2">familiarized themselves with it to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.480" end="00:24:35.830" style="s2">at the Trump and a post truth world</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.700" end="00:24:37.570" style="s2">because it goes through the value</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.830" end="00:24:39.790" style="s2">systems in a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.570" end="00:24:41.920" style="s2">in a very clever way that also talks</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.790" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">about current events I always found it</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.920" end="00:24:45.670" style="s2">quite hard to understand wilbo and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:48.250" style="s2">was just talking more theoretically but</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.670" end="00:24:51.130" style="s2">that book really applied it to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">current world and some of some people</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.130" end="00:24:56.230" style="s2">you&#39;re probably familiar with so Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:58.810" style="s2">will talk about integral as being a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.230" end="00:24:59.920" style="s2">really useful operating system and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.810" end="00:25:01.480" style="s2">the best thing to do with it is to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.920" end="00:25:03.850" style="s2">understand it and then forget it</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.480" end="00:25:06.130" style="s2">because if you if you&#39;ve spent too long</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.850" end="00:25:07.660" style="s2">within it you start talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.130" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">start basically just getting lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.660" end="00:25:12.790" style="s2">territory you start talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:14.860" style="s2">colors and these sort of Integra leaves</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.790" end="00:25:17.320" style="s2">that mean that you&#39;re no longer talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.860" end="00:25:21.040" style="s2">to people outside that world so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.320" end="00:25:24.850" style="s2">hugely useful frame and I think within</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.040" end="00:25:26.890" style="s2">integral it really shows are you are you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.850" end="00:25:29.770" style="s2">pushing on to a to a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.890" end="00:25:32.560" style="s2">synthesis that sees the value of some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.770" end="00:25:35.890" style="s2">the some of the challenges that</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.560" end="00:25:38.770" style="s2">post-modernism plays to the original</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.890" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">kind of modernist perspective and I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.770" end="00:25:42.220" style="s2">think there are more I mean you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:44.920" style="s2">this conversation I&#39;m sure with someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.220" end="00:25:46.390" style="s2">that Hansy fryin apt who will challenge</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.920" end="00:25:49.390" style="s2">challenge your perspectives on</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.390" end="00:25:51.280" style="s2">post-modernism but but I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.390" end="00:25:53.710" style="s2">that way of looking at it that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.280" end="00:25:55.270" style="s2">developmental lens is something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.710" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">said quite a few times that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.270" end="00:26:00.610" style="s2">intellectual darkweb needed and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.530" style="s2">really have and I think if it had had</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.610" end="00:26:04.660" style="s2">that developmental lens it would have it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.530" end="00:26:07.990" style="s2">would have helped be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.660" end="00:26:09.970" style="s2">discerning about where the criticism was</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.990" end="00:26:12.130" style="s2">coming from the critique of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.970" end="00:26:13.960" style="s2">post-modernism was coming from a more</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.130" end="00:26:16.870" style="s2">integrated place aware was coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.960" end="00:26:18.790" style="s2">more disintegrative place yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.870" end="00:26:21.490" style="s2">actually I&#39;d have had two conversations</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.790" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">with Hansie Frye neck on my podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.490" end="00:26:27.100" style="s2">they were very very interesting and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.970" end="00:26:30.460" style="s2">did disagree a bit about post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.100" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">but I would say surprisingly I think we</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.460" end="00:26:34.330" style="s2">were in strong agreement that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:37.420" style="s2">actually manifested in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.330" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">right now post-modernism is much more of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.420" end="00:26:43.030" style="s2">a negative than a positive though as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:45.750" style="s2">set of critiques it is useful and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.030" end="00:26:48.730" style="s2">that is my top-level take away that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.750" end="00:26:50.650" style="s2">post-modernism as a school of critics is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.730" end="00:26:51.490" style="s2">perfectly reasonable and they have said</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.650" end="00:26:53.620" style="s2">a lot of them poor</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.490" end="00:26:55.350" style="s2">things that need to be said but when</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.620" end="00:26:57.700" style="s2">post-modernism tries to become</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.350" end="00:26:59.470" style="s2">constructive to actually build what</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.700" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">comes next as they&#39;re trying to do in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.470" end="00:27:04.000" style="s2">these newsrooms that you referenced it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:06.340" style="s2">a disaster it&#39;d be as if you took a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:08.530" style="s2">academic movie critic and put them in</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.340" end="00:27:12.160" style="s2">charge of a moody movie studio just an</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.530" end="00:27:13.809" style="s2">insane thing to do and I think the you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.160" end="00:27:16.380" style="s2">know that these eruptions over the last</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.809" end="00:27:18.940" style="s2">few weeks is just proof positive that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.380" end="00:27:21.790" style="s2">that you turn loose people with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.940" end="00:27:23.110" style="s2">point of view on actual institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.790" end="00:27:24.730" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna do nothing but trash them</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.110" end="00:27:27.550" style="s2">but you know there are different points</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.730" end="00:27:29.620" style="s2">of view on that and so my own hope is</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.550" end="00:27:33.340" style="s2">that we can find a way to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.620" end="00:27:34.809" style="s2">higher level of society maybe like meta</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.340" end="00:27:37.270" style="s2">modernism or at least in the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.809" end="00:27:39.220" style="s2">neighborhood similar values I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.270" end="00:27:41.260" style="s2">call alignment beyond agreement if not</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.220" end="00:27:43.210" style="s2">the same in all the details but without</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.260" end="00:27:45.280" style="s2">having to traverse the swamp of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.210" end="00:27:47.980" style="s2">post-modernism think of it as a side</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.280" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">toolkit but not as a main road to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.980" end="00:27:51.880" style="s2">through to get to the other side yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:52.420" style="s2">think I think I definitely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.880" end="00:27:54.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.420" end="00:27:58.059" style="s2">if we&#39;re not sort of throwing the baby</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.400" end="00:27:59.590" style="s2">out with the bathwater again think of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.059" end="00:28:01.000" style="s2">as a toolkit on the side it&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.590" end="00:28:03.040" style="s2">reasonable think about it as actually a</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.000" end="00:28:05.740" style="s2">road we need to go through in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.040" end="00:28:08.890" style="s2">our social evolution I say moonshine and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.740" end="00:28:10.270" style="s2">nonsense love to get your views and now</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.890" end="00:28:12.400" style="s2">that we&#39;ve talked about the history a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.270" end="00:28:15.910" style="s2">little bit of positioning in historical</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.400" end="00:28:18.370" style="s2">space and in philosophical space overall</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.910" end="00:28:20.410" style="s2">whether you think the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.370" end="00:28:22.540" style="s2">darkweb has been a success of failure or</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.410" end="00:28:24.190" style="s2">maybe just stay stay interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.540" end="00:28:28.330" style="s2">prototype love to hear your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.190" end="00:28:30.490" style="s2">that yeah I think it definitely I did an</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.330" end="00:28:32.410" style="s2">interview with Brett Weinstein quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.490" end="00:28:33.610" style="s2">recently that I&#39;m putting out probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.410" end="00:28:36.040" style="s2">in the next couple of days where he</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.610" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">describes it as a prototype and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.040" end="00:28:41.020" style="s2">really important to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">relationship with prototyping and so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.020" end="00:28:48.790" style="s2">would say yes it was it was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:50.620" style="s2">successful there was something about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.790" end="00:28:52.570" style="s2">phenomenon of the intellectual darkweb</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.620" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">and of Jordan Peterson as well that kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.570" end="00:28:58.179" style="s2">of broke a conversational seal in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:59.740" style="s2">culture and things that were that had</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.179" end="00:29:04.039" style="s2">not been talked about were being talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.740" end="00:29:08.929" style="s2">about in in sort of mainstream circles</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.039" end="00:29:10.970" style="s2">I I look at a lot of the the problems or</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.929" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">what happened with it a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.970" end="00:29:19.309" style="s2">centers on in particular Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:22.460" style="s2">because Dave Rubin was he&#39;s a chat show</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.309" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">host who very much identified himself</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.460" end="00:29:27.769" style="s2">with the intellectual dark web early on</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:28.970" style="s2">he saw a kind of an opportunity he did a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.769" end="00:29:31.129" style="s2">lot of really good work at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.970" end="00:29:33.009" style="s2">of bringing together a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.129" end="00:29:35.049" style="s2">people on his show in in Los Angeles</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.009" end="00:29:38.570" style="s2">there were some really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.049" end="00:29:40.309" style="s2">conversations probably in 2018 that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.570" end="00:29:42.259" style="s2">seemed to be kind of going into new</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.309" end="00:29:45.349" style="s2">territory I think the really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.259" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">thing for me is this sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.349" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">conversation going into new territory</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:53.779" style="s2">how do we how does that happen and one</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:55.369" style="s2">of the ways that that certainly brett</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.779" end="00:29:57.710" style="s2">has talked about is that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.369" end="00:29:59.359" style="s2">bootstrap a kind of safety and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.710" end="00:30:01.519" style="s2">what the intellectual dark web did</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.359" end="00:30:03.799" style="s2">because they knew each other there was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.519" end="00:30:07.429" style="s2">familiarity they all agreed and trusted</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.799" end="00:30:08.869" style="s2">each other too yet to engage in good</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.429" end="00:30:14.119" style="s2">faith conversations that they were then</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.869" end="00:30:15.559" style="s2">able to go into new territory and the so</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.119" end="00:30:17.330" style="s2">you had these conversations between say</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.559" end="00:30:19.820" style="s2">Bret and Eric on the Rubin report you</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.330" end="00:30:21.619" style="s2">had one with Jordan Peterson and Ben</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.820" end="00:30:23.179" style="s2">Shapiro that was really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.619" end="00:30:25.369" style="s2">whether they were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.179" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">religious truth and you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.369" end="00:30:29.570" style="s2">sense of intellectual exploration you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:32.989" style="s2">got the sense of real excitement and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.570" end="00:30:34.099" style="s2">then something happened over the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.989" end="00:30:35.929" style="s2">couple of years and it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.099" end="00:30:38.450" style="s2">various reasons why that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.929" end="00:30:41.210" style="s2">novelty sort of seemed to fall away</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.450" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">there was there were lots of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.210" end="00:30:46.099" style="s2">high-profile public events run by a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:47.869" style="s2">company called Pangburn that then came</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.099" end="00:30:50.029" style="s2">to an end because Pangburn was</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.869" end="00:30:53.960" style="s2">incredibly badly run he lost a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.029" end="00:30:55.789" style="s2">money some of the events were canceled</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.960" end="00:30:57.349" style="s2">and that and Pangburn didn&#39;t give the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.789" end="00:31:01.159" style="s2">money back to the people who booked the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.349" end="00:31:02.989" style="s2">tickets and that failure really affected</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.159" end="00:31:04.580" style="s2">the kind of inertia and trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.989" end="00:31:05.989" style="s2">the conversation so there were lots of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.580" end="00:31:08.029" style="s2">high-profile conversations and then that</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.989" end="00:31:12.169" style="s2">stopped I think Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.029" end="00:31:15.259" style="s2">illness certainly didn&#39;t help and he is</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.169" end="00:31:18.229" style="s2">sort of retiring from public life</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.259" end="00:31:20.299" style="s2">probably about eight months ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.229" end="00:31:24.979" style="s2">really also took a lot of the energy out</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.299" end="00:31:28.669" style="s2">of the the the situation but why I</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.979" end="00:31:30.200" style="s2">mentioned Dave Rubin is that he he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.669" end="00:31:33.489" style="s2">highly identified with the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.200" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2">dark web but then had a series of</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.489" end="00:31:39.259" style="s2">encounters that and and he was he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.950" end="00:31:41.299" style="s2">criticized by by quite a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.259" end="00:31:43.489" style="s2">there were some articles in in quality I</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.299" end="00:31:46.549" style="s2">think there was a general sense that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.489" end="00:31:48.739" style="s2">was starting to coalesce around a much</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.549" end="00:31:51.830" style="s2">less sophisticated perspective that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.739" end="00:31:53.989" style="s2">just an T it was just criticism of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.830" end="00:31:55.909" style="s2">left and nothing else and that he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.989" end="00:31:58.249" style="s2">really open to dialogue wasn&#39;t open to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.909" end="00:31:59.629" style="s2">criticism I had a conversation with him</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.249" end="00:32:01.369" style="s2">I had an interview with him on his on</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.629" end="00:32:02.839" style="s2">his show where I put some of those</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.369" end="00:32:05.509" style="s2">criticisms to him and he was very</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.839" end="00:32:07.369" style="s2">unhappy about that and I think the fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.509" end="00:32:10.519" style="s2">that he was identified so strongly with</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.369" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">the intellectual dark web his own sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.519" end="00:32:15.739" style="s2">of lack of curiosity and lack of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:19.219" style="s2">interest and lack of one lack of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.739" end="00:32:22.219" style="s2">potential of sort of moving his ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.219" end="00:32:24.739" style="s2">really started to to have an impact on</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.219" end="00:32:26.839" style="s2">the on the wider topic but then at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.739" end="00:32:28.789" style="s2">same time you&#39;ve got so I look at this</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.839" end="00:32:31.789" style="s2">idea of live players and dead players</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.789" end="00:32:35.119" style="s2">I&#39;d say that Dave Rubin is a is a dead</p>

<p begin="00:36:13.670" end="00:36:18.140" style="s2">let me react that a little bit thinking</p>

<p begin="00:36:18.140" end="00:36:24.950" style="s2">on something which is that this group of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.340" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">people for whatever reason have gone</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.950" end="00:36:29.150" style="s2">into different modes right some would</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:30.950" style="s2">continue doing what they&#39;ve always done</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.150" end="00:36:33.080" style="s2">you know Steven Pinker whether he&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.260" end="00:36:45.470" style="s2">see and I think you you point this out</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.480" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">is a community of thinking that let that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.470" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">ratchets each other up and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:52.580" style="s2">my notes this morning I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:53.720" style="s2">about this I thought an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.580" end="00:36:57.800" style="s2">thing to do would be to compare and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.720" end="00:37:00.140" style="s2">contrast the IDW in this compare him</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.800" end="00:37:01.730" style="s2">with a couple other earlier intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.140" end="00:37:03.490" style="s2">traditions that did ratchet each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.730" end="00:37:06.710" style="s2">up you know think of the Bloomsbury</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.490" end="00:37:08.690" style="s2">intellectuals in London in the early</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.710" end="00:37:10.130" style="s2">part of the 20th century and when I</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.690" end="00:37:13.030" style="s2">happen to have just done a deep dive</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.130" end="00:37:16.280" style="s2">into preparing for a podcast the German</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.450" end="00:37:24.619" style="s2">in the early 19th century there these</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.470" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">people had very intense arguments</p>

<p begin="00:37:34.940" end="00:37:39.590" style="s2">I would say it is true that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.010" end="00:37:41.300" style="s2">really ratchet yourself up or ratchet</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.040" end="00:37:50.780" style="s2">a few things on podcasts but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.470" end="00:37:53.630" style="s2">that they&#39;re not crucibles for creation</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.780" end="00:37:56.840" style="s2">of intense new models and perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.630" end="00:37:57.740" style="s2">and it may well be that the tools of the</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.270" end="00:38:08.840" style="s2">well yeah it is and you know bluesberry</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.670" end="00:38:11.000" style="s2">people most of that thinking was done</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.840" end="00:38:12.950" style="s2">over dinners often which led to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.000" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">lecherous evenings right the German</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.619" end="00:38:24.170" style="s2">communities and it may be that these</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.130" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">virtual tools are just not strong enough</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.350" end="00:40:51.920" style="s2">all had those high-profile encounters</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.910" end="00:40:56.810" style="s2">like evergreen being the classic one</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.920" end="00:40:58.100" style="s2">with with Bret but the but the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.810" end="00:40:59.860" style="s2">question and the one that I keep coming</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.100" end="00:41:03.740" style="s2">back to is how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.860" end="00:41:07.130" style="s2">conversations that that take us into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.740" end="00:41:08.630" style="s2">place of novelty because this sense that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.130" end="00:41:10.730" style="s2">I have and maybe you have as well as</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.630" end="00:41:12.500" style="s2">that none of the solutions on the table</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.730" end="00:41:14.150" style="s2">right now and anyone who thinks they</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.500" end="00:41:15.560" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on or thinks they know</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.150" end="00:41:17.800" style="s2">what the solution is to the problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.560" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">that we&#39;re encountering now is by is</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.800" end="00:41:24.530" style="s2">definitely wrong so we need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:26.540" style="s2">way of having these conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.530" end="00:41:28.190" style="s2">take us into new places take us into</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.540" end="00:41:30.500" style="s2">places of novelty and to find a way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.190" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">doing that either in public or in</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.500" end="00:41:35.930" style="s2">private that there&#39;s also my I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.420" style="s2">Peter Lindbergh before but he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.930" end="00:41:40.010" style="s2">talked about the concept of the dark</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.420" end="00:41:42.050" style="s2">forest theory of the Internet which I</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.010" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">think originally came from Yancey</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.060" end="00:41:51.620" style="s2">now are happening in sort of back</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.400" end="00:41:53.630" style="s2">channels they&#39;re happening in the dark</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.620" end="00:41:55.670" style="s2">forest and not happening out in the open</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.630" end="00:41:58.120" style="s2">because those conversations are easily</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.670" end="00:42:02.600" style="s2">attacked those conversations are easily</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.120" end="00:42:06.200" style="s2">blown up by various accusations that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.600" end="00:42:09.110" style="s2">easily made on on social media so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.200" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">for me is that is the question that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.110" end="00:42:12.620" style="s2">like to kind of put out to people</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:15.980" style="s2">listening to this podcast and and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.620" end="00:42:17.510" style="s2">wider community that we are that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.980" end="00:42:20.210" style="s2">part of like how do we have these</p>

<p begin="00:42:20.210" end="00:42:24.950" style="s2">privately that that move our thinking on</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.790" end="00:42:25.430" style="s2">words because I don&#39;t think enough of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.950" end="00:42:26.839" style="s2">them a hat</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.430" end="00:42:29.660" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we&#39;re challenging and</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.930" end="00:42:40.700" style="s2">in place in the way that they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.260" end="00:42:42.050" style="s2">that that&#39;s my sense at least I might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.700" end="00:42:44.630" style="s2">missing out on all the good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.050" end="00:42:46.040" style="s2">so it might just be me no I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.630" end="00:42:48.109" style="s2">you are I mean I think there are some</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.040" end="00:42:50.390" style="s2">good conversations happening in the dark</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.109" end="00:42:53.390" style="s2">forest or in the shady forest you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.390" end="00:42:54.890" style="s2">we have our game B group on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.390" end="00:42:56.809" style="s2">which has some pretty good conversations</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.890" end="00:42:59.660" style="s2">but to your point we have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.809" end="00:43:02.059" style="s2">relentlessly police that thing because</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.660" end="00:43:05.420" style="s2">there are attacks organized attacks</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.059" end="00:43:06.920" style="s2">amazingly from both what you would could</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.420" end="00:43:08.809" style="s2">be thought of as the far right and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.920" end="00:43:12.500" style="s2">far left a couple weeks ago we had to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.809" end="00:43:15.290" style="s2">bounce six neo-fascist infiltrators and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.500" end="00:43:19.240" style="s2">at the same time booted a dozen kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.290" end="00:43:21.619" style="s2">proto and Tifa types simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.240" end="00:43:23.599" style="s2">you know suddenly the conversation went</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.619" end="00:43:27.020" style="s2">back to normal but it&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.599" end="00:43:29.059" style="s2">difficult to do these things on public</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.020" end="00:43:30.680" style="s2">forums and in you know in our case we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.059" end="00:43:32.809" style="s2">have a membrane we have membership and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.680" end="00:43:34.549" style="s2">we can kick people out but we&#39;ll let</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.809" end="00:43:36.410" style="s2">pretty much anybody who&#39;s not obviously</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.299" end="00:43:43.369" style="s2">near the platform&#39;s we have today are</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">not nearly enough and you know part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.369" end="00:43:46.609" style="s2">the answer may be pointing to the bat</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">back to the past and again as I</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.609" end="00:43:52.069" style="s2">mentioned Bloomsbury and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:55.180" style="s2">that crucible German Romanticism at</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.069" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">yenna University in the in the duchy of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.180" end="00:44:00.950" style="s2">Aimar in the early 19th century or even</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:05.329" style="s2">the early days of game B where we</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.950" end="00:44:07.940" style="s2">basically crucible that idea in five day</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.329" end="00:44:11.329" style="s2">and a half long face-to-face meetings</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.940" end="00:44:14.510" style="s2">where more interesting intellectual work</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.329" end="00:44:17.059" style="s2">got done in was less than 10 days than</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.510" end="00:44:20.900" style="s2">any 10-day period I can point to in my</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.059" end="00:44:26.180" style="s2">whole life so I do think it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.900" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">drop our over fascination with these</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.180" end="00:44:31.069" style="s2">online platforms as they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.010" end="00:44:33.559" style="s2">very important for disseminating what is</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.069" end="00:44:36.799" style="s2">created but I&#39;ve now come to the view</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.559" end="00:44:39.320" style="s2">that they&#39;re only part of the job of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.799" end="00:44:42.620" style="s2">creation that we have to find hi</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.320" end="00:44:45.320" style="s2">coherence higher binding energy more</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.620" end="00:44:49.060" style="s2">real work has to be done than it then</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.320" end="00:44:51.950" style="s2">can be done today on these big platforms</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.060" end="00:44:54.680" style="s2">yeah and is your sense that that has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.950" end="00:44:58.280" style="s2">be done in face-to-face well I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.680" end="00:45:00.860" style="s2">face to face is best however you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.280" end="00:45:05.420" style="s2">everything in life is trade-offs in time</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.860" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">and in space and in money I have found</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.420" end="00:45:10.430" style="s2">here during the zombie apocalypse that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">zoom culture works quite well for some</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.430" end="00:45:15.380" style="s2">things it&#39;s not as good as face to face</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:17.090" style="s2">but it&#39;s a shitload better than text on</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.380" end="00:45:19.400" style="s2">Facebook or on Twitter I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.090" end="00:45:21.800" style="s2">that so I think we can be more</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.400" end="00:45:25.160" style="s2">intelligent like I have a project going</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.800" end="00:45:27.340" style="s2">on right now all based in zoom which may</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.160" end="00:45:30.230" style="s2">actually create some interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.340" end="00:45:33.350" style="s2">but I think face to face also needs to</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.230" end="00:45:36.050" style="s2">be part of it you know if there was</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.350" end="00:45:38.180" style="s2">going to be a game be meeting in Austin</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.050" end="00:45:41.510" style="s2">Texas in May but that you know the cove</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.180" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">at 19 thing destroyed that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.510" end="00:45:47.480" style="s2">having a traditional in one place</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.480" end="00:45:52.100" style="s2">new intellectual trends would be very</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.700" end="00:45:54.470" style="s2">helpful and as we all know the formal</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.100" end="00:45:57.020" style="s2">sessions are only about 25% of the value</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.470" end="00:45:58.550" style="s2">the real value is the conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.020" end="00:46:00.920" style="s2">the lobby in the hall room around the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.550" end="00:46:03.050" style="s2">coffee table and at dinner and drinks</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.920" end="00:46:05.870" style="s2">afterwards so I think we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.050" end="00:46:09.020" style="s2">stopped being so hypnotized by social</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.870" end="00:46:10.820" style="s2">media platforms as the place to form the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.020" end="00:46:12.140" style="s2">intellectual ideas unfortunately I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.820" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck with them for a while for</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.140" end="00:46:18.170" style="s2">propagation but I&#39;m not convinced yet</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:20.990" style="s2">that they are gonna take us real far in</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.170" end="00:46:23.420" style="s2">the creating the next generation of good</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.990" end="00:46:27.110" style="s2">ideas yes and I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.420" end="00:46:30.610" style="s2">about staring into the critique as well</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.110" end="00:46:34.040" style="s2">or steering into self-reflection and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.610" end="00:46:34.460" style="s2">criticism that needs to to happen as</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.040" end="00:46:35.330" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.460" end="00:46:36.950" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.330" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">something that it seems very very</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.950" end="00:46:42.200" style="s2">difficult to do that in public and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:44.690" style="s2">may be much easier to do it in in in</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.200" end="00:46:46.970" style="s2">sort of private conversations yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.690" end="00:46:49.190" style="s2">actually having a conversation with one</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.970" end="00:46:52.970" style="s2">of the well-known opponents of game B</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.190" end="00:46:55.640" style="s2">about potentially doing a convergence</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.970" end="00:46:57.290" style="s2">in private to find out what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.640" end="00:47:00.980" style="s2">we agree about and why the hell are we</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.290" end="00:47:03.050" style="s2">so fixated on what we disagree about and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.980" end="00:47:04.760" style="s2">I do think that techniques like that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.050" end="00:47:07.310" style="s2">going to be important as well and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.760" end="00:47:09.109" style="s2">have to stress test our ideas right you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.310" end="00:47:10.670" style="s2">know you didn&#39;t really go into it in</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.109" end="00:47:13.970" style="s2">great detail but this problem of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.670" end="00:47:15.830" style="s2">audience capture is a real one right you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.970" end="00:47:17.480" style="s2">know you you get a platform that has a</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.830" end="00:47:20.180" style="s2">specific point of view and you capture a</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.480" end="00:47:22.099" style="s2">bunch of listeners and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.180" end="00:47:23.270" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of caught in the bind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.099" end="00:47:26.270" style="s2">giving your audience what they want</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.270" end="00:47:28.460" style="s2">right and that&#39;s not how you really</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.270" end="00:47:30.890" style="s2">stress test your ideas you have to and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.460" end="00:47:33.980" style="s2">perhaps do those offline using different</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.890" end="00:47:37.010" style="s2">techniques yes and there&#39;s audience</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.980" end="00:47:38.060" style="s2">capture that&#39;s so there&#39;s yeah it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.010" end="00:47:40.010" style="s2">interesting question because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.060" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">different facets of that in the digital</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.010" end="00:47:44.420" style="s2">world there&#39;s audience capture in terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:48.290" style="s2">of giving the audience what what they</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.420" end="00:47:49.820" style="s2">want and anyone who&#39;s got I know as we</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.290" end="00:47:52.580" style="s2">run a YouTube channel there&#39;s a comments</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.820" end="00:47:55.070" style="s2">thread I&#39;m very aware of that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.580" end="00:47:56.869" style="s2">it&#39;s do it certainly acts as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.070" end="00:48:00.740" style="s2">gravitational force it&#39;s one that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.869" end="00:48:04.570" style="s2">think I have struggled to resist like I</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.740" end="00:48:07.790" style="s2">could have certainly put out way more</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.570" end="00:48:10.070" style="s2">popular films but I think it would have</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.790" end="00:48:12.950" style="s2">been a short cut and I don&#39;t think the I</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.070" end="00:48:16.190" style="s2">don&#39;t think the community that the Revel</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.950" end="00:48:18.140" style="s2">wisdom has built up and they&#39;re yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.190" end="00:48:19.339" style="s2">the reputation that we built up would</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.140" end="00:48:21.260" style="s2">have survived if I&#39;d taken those</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.339" end="00:48:23.450" style="s2">shortcuts but it&#39;s very easy to feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.260" end="00:48:26.390" style="s2">that as a gravitational force but</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.450" end="00:48:28.280" style="s2">there&#39;s also in the world of sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.390" end="00:48:30.020" style="s2">big tech platforms there&#39;s another form</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.280" end="00:48:32.180" style="s2">of audience capture which is algorithmic</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.020" end="00:48:35.210" style="s2">capture that I know is something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.180" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen Brett and Heather talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.210" end="00:48:39.170" style="s2">the beginning of their podcast that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:42.470" style="s2">they&#39;re aware that their podcast is</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.170" end="00:48:45.230" style="s2">being grouped together with effectively</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.470" end="00:48:46.700" style="s2">sort of generally right-wing content and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.230" end="00:48:48.710" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t obviously they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.700" end="00:48:51.560" style="s2">describe themselves as right-wing but</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.710" end="00:48:53.869" style="s2">somehow because of the nature of what</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.560" end="00:48:56.599" style="s2">happened to them and because they they</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.869" end="00:48:58.310" style="s2">were appearing on certain podcasts at</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.599" end="00:49:00.290" style="s2">the beginning that the algorithms are</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.310" end="00:49:02.270" style="s2">now pushing them towards so you can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.290" end="00:49:05.980" style="s2">you can be vulcanized in many different</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.270" end="00:49:08.290" style="s2">ways and not and not always be</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.980" end="00:49:10.869" style="s2">of actions that you yourself are taking</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.290" end="00:49:12.369" style="s2">there are also the big tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.869" end="00:49:15.130" style="s2">got their finger on the scales in</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.369" end="00:49:17.560" style="s2">various ways as well so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.130" end="00:49:19.900" style="s2">lots of different levels to audience</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.560" end="00:49:22.030" style="s2">capture and some of it is not even to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.900" end="00:49:23.800" style="s2">with what you&#39;re personally doing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.030" end="00:49:26.109" style="s2">a very good point and a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.800" end="00:49:27.790" style="s2">point and you know actually I think I</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.109" end="00:49:30.910" style="s2">might well use this as an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.790" end="00:49:34.270" style="s2">announce something why not I decided I</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.910" end="00:49:37.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know six weeks ago to take a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.270" end="00:49:41.800" style="s2">six-month break from the large social</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.660" end="00:49:44.080" style="s2">media platform starting July 1 and part</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.800" end="00:49:46.900" style="s2">of it is this exact thing the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.080" end="00:49:50.470" style="s2">yes interesting work is happening here</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.900" end="00:49:53.590" style="s2">but it&#39;s influenced by audience captured</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.470" end="00:49:55.770" style="s2">in it&#39;s influenced by the paucity of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.590" end="00:49:59.890" style="s2">affordances provided by the platform&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.770" end="00:50:01.690" style="s2">it&#39;s influenced in a negative way by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.890" end="00:50:04.150" style="s2">algorithmics especially in the public</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.690" end="00:50:06.910" style="s2">parts of these platforms so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.150" end="00:50:08.890" style="s2">take an intentional six month break from</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.910" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">them and I have turned over the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.890" end="00:50:14.920" style="s2">management of the platforms that I lead</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:16.600" style="s2">on those platforms to other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.920" end="00:50:18.790" style="s2">they&#39;re already trained prepped and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.600" end="00:50:20.830" style="s2">ready to go and I&#39;m gonna go do</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.790" end="00:50:22.119" style="s2">something else for a while and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.830" end="00:50:24.369" style="s2">see what I find out there</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.119" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">good for you let us know what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.369" end="00:50:31.150" style="s2">out in the wilderness I&#39;ve done this</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:33.820" style="s2">every year on for Facebook for the last</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.150" end="00:50:35.290" style="s2">four years but I am much more in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.820" end="00:50:38.080" style="s2">middle of things and I was previously</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.290" end="00:50:40.119" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna also add Twitter to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.080" end="00:50:41.380" style="s2">band so yeah it&#39;d be interesting I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.119" end="00:50:42.940" style="s2">give you a report back from the real</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.380" end="00:50:45.820" style="s2">world and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have some</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.940" end="00:50:47.890" style="s2">conversations in between yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.820" end="00:50:50.190" style="s2">with that it&#39;s time to wrap up and I say</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.890" end="00:50:53.920" style="s2">one thing Jim before we wrap up sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.190" end="00:50:56.619" style="s2">just to to say so rebel wisdoms in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.920" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">process of doing a big series about</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.619" end="00:51:01.119" style="s2">sense making not only about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:02.410" style="s2">intellectual dark web but we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.119" end="00:51:04.750" style="s2">put out a couple of pieces about that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.410" end="00:51:07.630" style="s2">but also looking at information warfare</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.750" end="00:51:09.310" style="s2">talking to Tristan Harris about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.630" end="00:51:11.890" style="s2">influence of the big tech platforms all</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.310" end="00:51:14.260" style="s2">of these different issues and I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.890" end="00:51:15.670" style="s2">to hear from from listeners I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.260" end="00:51:17.290" style="s2">them to check out the series and then to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.670" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">hear any solutions like practical</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.290" end="00:51:20.460" style="s2">solutions to these problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:21.750" style="s2">is what we all need to be working on</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.460" end="00:51:23.160" style="s2">right now so I&#39;d love to hear any</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.750" end="00:51:25.170" style="s2">thoughts and suggestions that people</p>
