<p begin="00:00:01.740" end="00:00:06.990" style="s2">podcast i am brett weinstein your host</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:09.800" style="s2">and i have the privilege of sitting with</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.990" end="00:00:12.240" style="s2">sam harris cognitive neuroscientist and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.800" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">philosopher I actually feel like</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:16.710" style="s2">although he needs no introduction there</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:19.260" style="s2">is a thing that I wish showed up in his</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.710" end="00:00:22.769" style="s2">bio but I&#39;m having trouble figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.260" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">how to phrase something like Sam is an</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.769" end="00:00:28.109" style="s2">important node in our collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">conscious architecture not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.109" end="00:00:31.500" style="s2">agrees with Sam but he thinks matters</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:32.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll take it and I&#39;ll take it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.500" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.040" end="00:00:35.399" style="s2">awesome yeah I&#39;m not sure I can apply it</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:36.420" style="s2">to myself but I will take it from you</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.399" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">this that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.420" end="00:00:41.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t see why I should apply any less</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">to you than anybody else all right so</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">thank you for doing this Sam I really</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:48.750" style="s2">appreciate your willingness to engage</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">arguments that I know must feel like</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.750" end="00:00:52.050" style="s2">people run you through all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">at some level maybe they should just</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.050" end="00:00:55.860" style="s2">read your books to find out what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">answers to the questions that they would</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.860" end="00:01:00.120" style="s2">pose to you are and I should say that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:04.439" style="s2">preparation for today I have done a fair</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.120" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">amount of reading of your material just</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.439" end="00:01:09.150" style="s2">to refresh my memory as to what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:12.330" style="s2">believe and to figure out whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.150" end="00:01:15.750" style="s2">there is indeed a gap worth discussing</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.330" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">sure yeah well I I find that certainly</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">for some of these topics conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">much more flexible than just volleys of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">prose right so so email or blog post or</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">article or book it&#39;s just it&#39;s too rigid</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">because you really you can&#39;t interact</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:35.939" style="s2">with anyone&#39;s real-time response to to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">what you&#39;ve written there so it&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">just bounce off the arguments more often</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">than not so you know I&#39;m happy to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:46.759" style="s2">about it well there&#39;s that I also think</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:50.280" style="s2">that the hidden magic of human nature</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.759" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">actually involves active discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.280" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">about what we disagree over and that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">have learned to think in a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">different way because school trains us</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">to function differently but that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:07.039" style="s2">essence a podcast discussion is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:09.720" style="s2">resurrection of a very ancient and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.039" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">vitally important human form something</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:14.379" style="s2">that might once have taken place over a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">campfire now takes place</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.379" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">somewhat more asynchronously and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:20.079" style="s2">more people can listen in but anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:22.389" style="s2">do think that this is in some ways the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.079" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">return to to an earlier form and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.389" end="00:02:27.939" style="s2">books were a temporary detour yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:31.209" style="s2">living through the Golden Age of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.939" end="00:02:33.219" style="s2">conversation in some ways so it&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.209" end="00:02:34.510" style="s2">happy to be doing it with you yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.219" end="00:02:36.219" style="s2">maybe this is the beginning of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.510" end="00:02:37.989" style="s2">Golden Age and we&#39;re discovering how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.219" end="00:02:40.180" style="s2">do it you know one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.989" end="00:02:42.459" style="s2">frustrates me about the moment that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.180" end="00:02:45.430" style="s2">live in is that we&#39;ve settled on an</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.459" end="00:02:47.049" style="s2">almost arbitrary mode of deciding what</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.430" end="00:02:50.620" style="s2">conversation should happen and when they</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.049" end="00:02:53.079" style="s2">should happen and that a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.620" end="00:02:56.379" style="s2">thinking about how formally this should</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.079" end="00:03:00.489" style="s2">all go down might increase the extent to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.379" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">which we we reach new objectives or even</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.489" end="00:03:07.060" style="s2">things that we didn&#39;t know to pursue hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">so let me say in reading I in</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.060" end="00:03:14.949" style="s2">preparation for this I read free will I</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:17.349" style="s2">read your book lying I read a good chunk</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.949" end="00:03:20.500" style="s2">of the moral landscape and I read your</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.349" end="00:03:22.870" style="s2">wife&#39;s book on consciousness oh nice so</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.500" end="00:03:27.759" style="s2">that gave me some kind of insights and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.870" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">do have the sense that you are super</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.759" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">unusual in the way that you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:35.409" style="s2">there&#39;s a way that your books almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:37.629" style="s2">encyclopedic ly explore your own</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.409" end="00:03:39.459" style="s2">thoughts on a topic so that in essence</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.629" end="00:03:42.220" style="s2">you&#39;re leading the reader through every</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.459" end="00:03:43.689" style="s2">path you&#39;ve been down and where it ends</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.220" end="00:03:45.909" style="s2">and so it&#39;s sort of like a status report</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.689" end="00:03:48.040" style="s2">on all of those arguments and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.909" end="00:03:49.780" style="s2">ultimately the book arrives at your</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.040" end="00:03:52.810" style="s2">conclusion about what all these things</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.780" end="00:03:55.150" style="s2">say together but this it raises a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.810" end="00:03:57.969" style="s2">question for me I worry about anybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.150" end="00:04:00.009" style="s2">who&#39;s written the book including myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.969" end="00:04:02.079" style="s2">I&#39;m writing a book with Heather at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.009" end="00:04:04.540" style="s2">moment and I have another one planned</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.079" end="00:04:07.389" style="s2">and there&#39;s a question about once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.540" end="00:04:09.459" style="s2">written a book unless you&#39;ve gotten it a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.389" end="00:04:12.549" style="s2">hundred percent right you are now in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.459" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">new predicament if it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.549" end="00:04:17.560" style="s2">something about what you&#39;ve written is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:20.620" style="s2">what you thought at a moment but then it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.560" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">turns out you end up somewhere new there</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.620" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">are there aren&#39;t great mechanisms for</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:28.100" style="s2">updating and so I see a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:31.880" style="s2">who have written themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.100" end="00:04:33.230" style="s2">and been unable to escape it hmm unless</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.880" end="00:04:36.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve written a book about the moral</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.230" end="00:04:39.740" style="s2">evil of a line in which case you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.170" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">anchored to that so I hope I&#39;m honest</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.740" end="00:04:46.330" style="s2">enough to declare I&#39;ve realized I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">wrong on any topic I&#39;ve put into print</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:51.920" style="s2">the topic that I think we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">touch free will is one where I&#39;m it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.920" end="00:04:56.360" style="s2">not a matter of sunk cost or being</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:05:01.580" style="s2">identified with a position it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.360" end="00:05:04.700" style="s2">the the topic is the the the geometry of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.580" end="00:05:08.480" style="s2">the topic both of our knowledge and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.700" end="00:05:11.690" style="s2">seems to promise to be the frontier of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.480" end="00:05:13.850" style="s2">our ignorance seems unusually clear to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.690" end="00:05:15.950" style="s2">me right so it&#39;s not like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.850" end="00:05:17.780" style="s2">they&#39;re many topics where I&#39;d be the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.950" end="00:05:22.790" style="s2">first to admit that whatever my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.780" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">is it&#39;s you know it&#39;s up against a just</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.790" end="00:05:29.390" style="s2">a vast region of ignorance which is yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:32.180" style="s2">to be illuminated free will is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.390" end="00:05:38.270" style="s2">really one of those topics so I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.180" end="00:05:41.690" style="s2">know I&#39;m very I have very few reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.270" end="00:05:43.670" style="s2">revisit my my published position here</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.690" end="00:05:46.070" style="s2">but I&#39;m happy to do it but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.670" end="00:05:49.100" style="s2">it&#39;s one place where I&#39;m you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.070" end="00:05:52.310" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m either gonna seem unusually</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.100" end="00:05:54.670" style="s2">incorrigible or or you know arrogantly</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.310" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">overconfident or something depending on</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.670" end="00:05:59.720" style="s2">somebody&#39;s commitment to the opposing</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:00.980" style="s2">view so well there&#39;s there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.720" end="00:06:03.260" style="s2">of how you will seem to members of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.980" end="00:06:04.910" style="s2">audience and you know audiences are</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.260" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">large so you&#39;ll see them every way to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.910" end="00:06:08.120" style="s2">some yeah yeah but to me you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:10.340" style="s2">gonna see in that way I know there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.120" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2">zones where I&#39;ve been so thoroughly over</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.340" end="00:06:15.260" style="s2">a landscape that it&#39;s always possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:17.150" style="s2">something new is going to arise but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.260" end="00:06:19.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve chased every argument from every</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.150" end="00:06:21.560" style="s2">side and so I&#39;m not really expecting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.610" end="00:06:22.820" style="s2">hear something new and I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.560" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">free will is a place where you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.820" end="00:06:28.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the case now I&#39;m hoping to drive</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:31.040" style="s2">you into a headspace that opens</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.610" end="00:06:33.740" style="s2">something on this topic and will vary</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.040" end="00:06:35.750" style="s2">whether that actually happens I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:37.550" style="s2">know whether that would be positive or</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.750" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">negative from your perspective but can</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.550" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">we detour to your book lying for sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:44.870" style="s2">sure so I listened to book lying</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:48.590" style="s2">actually I listened it on the plane and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.870" end="00:06:50.390" style="s2">I in particular love to listen to books</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:52.850" style="s2">where the author is reading it and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.390" end="00:06:54.860" style="s2">fact you you read lying so you&#39;d get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.850" end="00:06:56.600" style="s2">hear it somebody there&#39;s some emotional</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.860" end="00:06:59.330" style="s2">content in the cadences and things like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.600" end="00:07:03.770" style="s2">that and I wondered as I was listening</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.330" end="00:07:06.290" style="s2">to your argument which I overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.770" end="00:07:08.390" style="s2">agree with and I find some analogy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.290" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">how you see this topic and how I see</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.390" end="00:07:11.960" style="s2">this topic that I think is not common I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:13.850" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;re in exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.960" end="00:07:15.740" style="s2">place but more similar place than</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.850" end="00:07:19.670" style="s2">probably two people chosen at random</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.740" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">would be likely to find themselves but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.670" end="00:07:24.710" style="s2">wondered if you wrote that book which</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:28.010" style="s2">makes a very powerful argument that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.710" end="00:07:31.310" style="s2">almost none of the places that a human</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.010" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">being tends to see some sort of lying as</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.310" end="00:07:36.860" style="s2">justified are actually justified if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:42.440" style="s2">chase the full calculus of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.860" end="00:07:44.480" style="s2">consequences of doing so and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.440" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">as you hinted at a couple of minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.480" end="00:07:51.050" style="s2">that having stated that out loud and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:53.200" style="s2">very clearly puts you in a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.050" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">bind that you obviously either</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.200" end="00:07:59.210" style="s2">inadvertently chose or chose knowingly</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:00.470" style="s2">hmm and I was wondering was there any</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.210" end="00:08:05.320" style="s2">part of you when you wrote that book</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.470" end="00:08:08.180" style="s2">that was seeking to tie your own hands</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.320" end="00:08:10.190" style="s2">no well let&#39;s just spell out what fine</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.180" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">do you think that is I imagine it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.190" end="00:08:18.290" style="s2">you think because I&#39;ve been so public in</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:21.740" style="s2">my admonishment around honesty that I I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.290" end="00:08:23.600" style="s2">can never lie in any circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.740" end="00:08:26.930" style="s2">now because that I have so many people</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.600" end="00:08:28.940" style="s2">watching to see whether I&#39;m in you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.930" end="00:08:31.940" style="s2">whether I&#39;m likely to do that or</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.940" end="00:08:33.740" style="s2">inclined to shade the truth is that what</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.940" end="00:08:37.099" style="s2">you mean that I&#39;ve basically set the bar</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.740" end="00:08:39.140" style="s2">publicly and and and now I&#39;ve got many</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.099" end="00:08:41.570" style="s2">people they can potentially call me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.140" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">account that&#39;s the shallow end um I</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.570" end="00:08:46.220" style="s2">would say in the deep end would be you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:49.700" style="s2">know in the book you explore things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.220" end="00:08:52.999" style="s2">marital infidelity friend what you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.700" end="00:08:56.220" style="s2">effectively done in writing that book is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.999" end="00:08:58.529" style="s2">increased the cost that would come to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.220" end="00:09:01.259" style="s2">you if you engaged in marital infidelity</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.529" end="00:09:03.119" style="s2">and it came to light the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.259" end="00:09:05.189" style="s2">you would be viewed as hypocritical is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.119" end="00:09:07.199" style="s2">beyond what most people would face and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.189" end="00:09:09.749" style="s2">that presume you increases the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.199" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">likelihood of it yeah no I&#39;m not aware</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.749" end="00:09:16.679" style="s2">of that as a motive that is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:21.959" style="s2">consequence of it I mean it&#39;s a happy</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.679" end="00:09:30.290" style="s2">consequence of it that I feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.959" end="00:09:35.429" style="s2">the only way for me to really fail is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.290" end="00:09:41.879" style="s2">is to not honor this deepest value right</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.429" end="00:09:44.149" style="s2">and I&#39;m happy for that kind of larger</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.879" end="00:09:47.100" style="s2">expectation that I you know that I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.149" end="00:09:51.779" style="s2">you know betray that value and I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.100" end="00:09:53.610" style="s2">to have you know it&#39;s like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.779" end="00:09:55.679" style="s2">perverse version of it is you know this</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.610" end="00:09:58.049" style="s2">is this dates both of us but you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.679" end="00:09:59.970" style="s2">when Gary Hart was campaigning and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.049" end="00:10:01.619" style="s2">invited the press to you know just you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.970" end="00:10:03.569" style="s2">just follow me around you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.619" end="00:10:07.170" style="s2">he was he was immediately caught having</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.569" end="00:10:13.379" style="s2">an affair I think if you&#39;re someone who</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.170" end="00:10:15.720" style="s2">really wants to adhere to a a path which</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.379" end="00:10:23.910" style="s2">at least on this point seems fairly</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.720" end="00:10:26.369" style="s2">straight and and clearly lit I love the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.910" end="00:10:28.679" style="s2">fact that people expect me to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.369" end="00:10:32.819" style="s2">and and that I that I&#39;ve advertised that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.679" end="00:10:36.689" style="s2">as widely as I as I can and that I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.819" end="00:10:39.029" style="s2">be more hypocritical than most to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.689" end="00:10:41.970" style="s2">dishonest yeah you know that that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.029" end="00:10:44.689" style="s2">be and I think the the obverse of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.970" end="00:10:48.540" style="s2">coin the fact that there is so little</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.689" end="00:10:49.949" style="s2">consequence to public dishonesty in most</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.540" end="00:10:52.470" style="s2">walks of life and the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.949" end="00:10:55.980" style="s2">a president who is the I think even you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.470" end="00:10:59.249" style="s2">know most of his fans would admit lies</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.980" end="00:11:01.679" style="s2">more than almost any public figure that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.249" end="00:11:04.069" style="s2">they can possibly be named you know in</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.679" end="00:11:06.360" style="s2">any sense right now he&#39;d be a hypocrite</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.069" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">I mean stand the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.360" end="00:11:12.149" style="s2">it&#39;s you in many corners not considered</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:17.970" style="s2">a bug but a feature and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.149" end="00:11:21.300" style="s2">just that&#39;s that&#39;s on that&#39;s probably at</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.970" end="00:11:24.420" style="s2">the top of a very short list of worst</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.300" end="00:11:26.670" style="s2">things about our public conversation at</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.420" end="00:11:29.850" style="s2">this point you know I mean and it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.670" end="00:11:32.399" style="s2">opens the door to all of the other toxic</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.850" end="00:11:38.279" style="s2">stuff about our conversation I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.399" end="00:11:40.860" style="s2">intellectual honesty is our only real</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.279" end="00:11:43.350" style="s2">error correcting mechanism you know it</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.860" end="00:11:47.250" style="s2">is that it is what safeguards human</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.350" end="00:11:49.529" style="s2">rationality and it&#39;s the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.250" end="00:11:53.100" style="s2">promises that human conversation allows</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.529" end="00:11:54.630" style="s2">us to explore you know what it grope</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.100" end="00:11:57.870" style="s2">towards what is true in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.630" end="00:11:59.640" style="s2">reliable way and you know insofar as we</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.870" end="00:12:01.140" style="s2">have that right in science that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.640" end="00:12:03.300" style="s2">the very good things about science and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.140" end="00:12:06.149" style="s2">what&#39;s that&#39;s what makes it science and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.300" end="00:12:10.519" style="s2">not some other zone of you know human</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.149" end="00:12:13.199" style="s2">fabrication and I think interpersonally</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.519" end="00:12:15.630" style="s2">honesty is just as important so ya know</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.199" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">I&#39;m happy to be on record in this way</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.630" end="00:12:23.820" style="s2">yeah I I agree and I think actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">very wise because in some sense honesty</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.820" end="00:12:30.810" style="s2">is not easy and that engineering some</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:33.720" style="s2">sort of a paradigm in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.810" end="00:12:36.600" style="s2">expected of you is on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.720" end="00:12:39.560" style="s2">limiting and has to be in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.600" end="00:12:42.660" style="s2">costly but that net the cost is probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.560" end="00:12:43.949" style="s2">well worth it for the benefit of you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.660" end="00:12:47.190" style="s2">know as you point out in your book not</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.949" end="00:12:49.079" style="s2">having to for example track lives that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.190" end="00:12:51.870" style="s2">need to be tended yeah that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.079" end="00:12:54.149" style="s2">cause that people pay yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.870" end="00:12:57.000" style="s2">just a one I when I think about it in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.149" end="00:13:01.380" style="s2">the context of my marriage or in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.000" end="00:13:03.060" style="s2">relationship to my daughters knowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.380" end="00:13:05.730" style="s2">that the other person isn&#39;t going to lie</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.060" end="00:13:07.260" style="s2">to you is such a refuge right now that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.730" end="00:13:09.390" style="s2">the but again the flipside of this would</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.260" end="00:13:12.149" style="s2">be that if you ever you know if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.390" end="00:13:14.790" style="s2">ever lied to my wife and got caught it</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.149" end="00:13:18.120" style="s2">would be an immense betrayal of a sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.790" end="00:13:19.800" style="s2">that you know most other marriages might</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.120" end="00:13:20.070" style="s2">not recognize right because because we</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.800" end="00:13:23.520" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.070" end="00:13:26.550" style="s2">such primacy around the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.520" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to lie to each other but</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.550" end="00:13:34.530" style="s2">having you know put all our chips on</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:36.690" style="s2">that it&#39;s it really is it really makes</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.530" end="00:13:39.530" style="s2">the relationship a kind of refuge that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.690" end="00:13:43.650" style="s2">really can&#39;t imagine the alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.530" end="00:13:47.100" style="s2">yeah I agree with you and this raises a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.650" end="00:13:49.530" style="s2">couple of nearby points that I think are</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.100" end="00:13:52.470" style="s2">maybe worth exploring one of them has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.530" end="00:13:55.350" style="s2">do with your position what you describe</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.470" end="00:13:59.700" style="s2">as an allergy to participating in</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.350" end="00:14:02.070" style="s2">advertising hmm and I have exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.700" end="00:14:04.130" style="s2">same aversion I can&#39;t say it exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.070" end="00:14:08.130" style="s2">same level but at some very extreme</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.130" end="00:14:09.750" style="s2">level and so obviously I&#39;m now starting</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.130" end="00:14:12.120" style="s2">a podcast and trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.750" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">one Ds does that and it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.120" end="00:14:16.680" style="s2">inexpensive process and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:19.800" style="s2">question about the time that goes into</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.680" end="00:14:22.680" style="s2">it and how you end up paying for it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.800" end="00:14:26.550" style="s2">advertising is one obvious route but</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.680" end="00:14:30.840" style="s2">yeah I can&#39;t help but think that there</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.550" end="00:14:33.210" style="s2">is some hazard to one&#39;s credibility at</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.840" end="00:14:36.690" style="s2">the very reason that an advertiser will</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.210" end="00:14:39.060" style="s2">pay to put some product in you know to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.690" end="00:14:41.160" style="s2">have you speak as if you care about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.060" end="00:14:42.780" style="s2">product mmm the very reason that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.160" end="00:14:45.630" style="s2">wish to borrow your voice is that your</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.780" end="00:14:51.270" style="s2">voice has a kind of credibility that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.630" end="00:14:54.440" style="s2">eroded when you are involved in selling</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.270" end="00:14:57.530" style="s2">items right yeah well maybe I should</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.440" end="00:15:02.100" style="s2">should clarify that I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.530" end="00:15:04.950" style="s2">need be or at least there&#39;s their gray</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.100" end="00:15:07.890" style="s2">areas here where it&#39;s probably not worth</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.950" end="00:15:09.840" style="s2">worrying about the the ethical</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.890" end="00:15:14.370" style="s2">implications because I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.840" end="00:15:18.290" style="s2">people who can advertise credibly and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.370" end="00:15:20.730" style="s2">fact it&#39;s so convergent with their brand</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.290" end="00:15:22.710" style="s2">that it&#39;s what their audience wants from</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.730" end="00:15:24.750" style="s2">them so I think of like my friend Tim</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.710" end="00:15:28.970" style="s2">Ferriss who has a very successful</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.750" end="00:15:34.200" style="s2">podcast it&#39;s ad sponsored but Tim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.970" end="00:15:38.730" style="s2">thing is finding good stuff too</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.200" end="00:15:41.430" style="s2">to use to do you know he&#39;s like a you</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.730" end="00:15:44.570" style="s2">know he&#39;s mean he&#39;s got many things at</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.430" end="00:15:48.300" style="s2">this point but we kind of core to his</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.570" end="00:15:51.420" style="s2">brand is to be able to think about</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.300" end="00:15:52.830" style="s2">himself as and what he does as as kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.420" end="00:15:57.110" style="s2">of brand management I mean he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.830" end="00:15:57.110" style="s2">marketer he&#39;s a brilliant marketer and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.140" end="00:16:01.830" style="s2">there&#39;s just no problem with him finding</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.850" end="00:16:03.270" style="s2">the next piece of fitness gear that he</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.830" end="00:16:06.060" style="s2">thinks is amazing and telling his</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.270" end="00:16:08.460" style="s2">audience this is amazing because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.060" end="00:16:10.170" style="s2">I mean yeah I&#39;m his friend and a part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.460" end="00:16:11.490" style="s2">his audience and I want to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.170" end="00:16:14.130" style="s2">next piece of fitness gear is that he</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.490" end="00:16:17.640" style="s2">wants to get behind right so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.130" end="00:16:19.830" style="s2">just not that kind of you know person in</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.640" end="00:16:21.630" style="s2">the world so I agree and I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.830" end="00:16:24.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I will ultimately have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.630" end="00:16:26.130" style="s2">do advertising just as a practical</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.390" end="00:16:28.170" style="s2">matter and I&#39;ve certainly thought about</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.130" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">the border where the only things that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.170" end="00:16:31.800" style="s2">would advertise would be things that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:34.260" style="s2">actually like the product and that means</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.800" end="00:16:37.980" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously costly you&#39;re at it you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.260" end="00:16:41.490" style="s2">know maybe is protective against sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.980" end="00:16:43.740" style="s2">an ethical compromise but nonetheless I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.490" end="00:16:45.060" style="s2">I do think the paradigm of borrowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.740" end="00:16:49.890" style="s2">some but you know let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.060" end="00:16:51.780" style="s2">example when West Wing was on television</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.890" end="00:16:55.620" style="s2">maybe actually shortly after it went off</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.780" end="00:16:57.090" style="s2">I noticed that there was a pain reliever</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.620" end="00:17:00.630" style="s2">at Cameron Bure if it was aspirin or</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.090" end="00:17:03.390" style="s2">what it was but I&#39;m very sensitive for</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.630" end="00:17:06.839" style="s2">some reason I&#39;ve never nailed down I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.390" end="00:17:09.089" style="s2">pretty good at spotting voices that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.839" end="00:17:10.770" style="s2">know I can&#39;t always peg who it is right</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.089" end="00:17:12.180" style="s2">away sometimes takes a half an hour of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.770" end="00:17:13.920" style="s2">listening to figure out who the heck</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.180" end="00:17:15.990" style="s2">that is but right this was Donald</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.920" end="00:17:19.680" style="s2">Sutherland or somebody it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.990" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">Stockard Channing uh-huh and her name</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.680" end="00:17:23.670" style="s2">you know no identifying information was</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:26.670" style="s2">present but the reason that she was</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.670" end="00:17:28.680" style="s2">there was clearly that subliminally</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.670" end="00:17:30.420" style="s2">people took her to be a doctor because</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.680" end="00:17:33.480" style="s2">that was her role the president&#39;s wife</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.420" end="00:17:35.730" style="s2">was a doctor and so to take somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.480" end="00:17:39.870" style="s2">plays a doctor on television and have</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.730" end="00:17:42.540" style="s2">their voice you know in very secure</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.870" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">certain doctorly tones advising you to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.540" end="00:17:47.160" style="s2">take a particular painkiller is more</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:47.790" style="s2">persuasive than just somebody who might</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.160" end="00:17:50.970" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.790" end="00:17:52.800" style="s2">a more resonant voice yeah you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.970" end="00:17:55.110" style="s2">reborrowing credibility from a character</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.800" end="00:17:57.750" style="s2">and presumably for almost everybody they</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.110" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t even notice that they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.750" end="00:18:01.920" style="s2">listening to a doctor who they knew</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:03.240" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a doctor giving them medical</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.920" end="00:18:05.610" style="s2">advice that they knew wasn&#39;t medical</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.240" end="00:18:06.330" style="s2">advice right so anyway I&#39;m sure that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.610" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">effective too</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.330" end="00:18:10.590" style="s2">that&#39;s I bet it was a good play yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:13.560" style="s2">um as long as we&#39;re still in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.590" end="00:18:16.980" style="s2">neighborhood of lying and truth-telling</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.560" end="00:18:19.980" style="s2">and that sort of thing I know you got a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.980" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">lot of pushback on your book relative to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.980" end="00:18:24.750" style="s2">the question of children and there</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a lot of richness to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.750" end="00:18:29.700" style="s2">the question about whether or not one</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:31.320" style="s2">must lie to children whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.700" end="00:18:32.520" style="s2">acceptable to lie to children in a place</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.320" end="00:18:34.530" style="s2">that it wouldn&#39;t be acceptable to lie to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.520" end="00:18:36.270" style="s2">adults or whether children are just</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.530" end="00:18:39.510" style="s2">another example where it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.270" end="00:18:43.050" style="s2">okay to lie to them and it really in</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.510" end="00:18:46.170" style="s2">general isn&#39;t and I raised this because</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.050" end="00:18:47.870" style="s2">I find myself I don&#39;t know if you would</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.170" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">call it lying but I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.870" end="00:18:55.170" style="s2">misleading my children constantly mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:19:02.130" style="s2">and you know as I did with students I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.170" end="00:19:05.040" style="s2">this with a I resort to humor and other</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.130" end="00:19:07.170" style="s2">things but there is a purpose behind it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.040" end="00:19:09.810" style="s2">I&#39;m quite aware of the purpose and in my</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.170" end="00:19:12.570" style="s2">kids case I describe it as immunizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.810" end="00:19:14.850" style="s2">them to the vast sea of bullshit that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.570" end="00:19:16.860" style="s2">know that they will encounter when they</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.850" end="00:19:20.970" style="s2">are interfacing with the world as adults</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.860" end="00:19:22.290" style="s2">directly you have an example Wow I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.970" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">have one offhand I&#39;m sure I could come</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.290" end="00:19:27.630" style="s2">up with a dozen given a couple minutes</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:32.070" style="s2">to think but you know what I will do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.630" end="00:19:34.800" style="s2">I will tell them fictions that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.070" end="00:19:38.190" style="s2">should be able to spot our fictions but</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.800" end="00:19:40.290" style="s2">are dressed up as reality and I will see</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.190" end="00:19:42.300" style="s2">you know if they don&#39;t catch on</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.290" end="00:19:43.950" style="s2">I will mislead them to a greater and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.300" end="00:19:46.590" style="s2">greater degree until they finally do</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.950" end="00:19:49.080" style="s2">catch on so anyway I sort of have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.590" end="00:19:51.570" style="s2">sense that I&#39;m training a detector in</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.080" end="00:19:53.340" style="s2">them now this is not it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.570" end="00:19:58.650" style="s2">like a parent training a child it looks</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:20:00.660" style="s2">like us engaging in you know fun right</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.650" end="00:20:01.470" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of the same way in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.660" end="00:20:04.590" style="s2">household</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.470" end="00:20:08.760" style="s2">wordplay was a constant you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.590" end="00:20:11.670" style="s2">wordplay dishonest because it involves</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.760" end="00:20:13.470" style="s2">you know puns that you know misuse words</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.670" end="00:20:15.660" style="s2">and things I&#39;m surely it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.470" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">nobody would say it is it&#39;s good-natured</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.660" end="00:20:22.770" style="s2">and frankly I think it is great training</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:24.750" style="s2">but I know that I&#39;m a a coldly rational</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.770" end="00:20:26.910" style="s2">being would have to say that I am lying</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.750" end="00:20:28.740" style="s2">to my children when I mislead them my</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.910" end="00:20:30.690" style="s2">ultimate purpose is not to mislead them</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.740" end="00:20:33.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the opposite but what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.690" end="00:20:36.660" style="s2">am i over a line there well I think I</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.960" end="00:20:42.770" style="s2">would need a clear example of this but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.660" end="00:20:42.770" style="s2">mean generally speaking you know there</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.090" end="00:20:53.570" style="s2">there&#39;s flexibility here would like</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.680" end="00:20:56.490" style="s2">maybe the intent is not to deceive I</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.570" end="00:20:58.050" style="s2">mean this would let me just step back</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.490" end="00:20:59.790" style="s2">here when you&#39;re talking about children</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.050" end="00:21:01.980" style="s2">there is it&#39;s relevant that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.790" end="00:21:04.860" style="s2">children right I mean children are not</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.980" end="00:21:06.150" style="s2">full moral or rational agents and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.860" end="00:21:08.850" style="s2">don&#39;t treat the massage right so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.150" end="00:21:10.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a level of paternalism quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.850" end="00:21:14.490" style="s2">literally built into your conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.560" end="00:21:20.670" style="s2">with your own kids and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.490" end="00:21:23.190" style="s2">appropriate for me navigating that has</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.670" end="00:21:26.300" style="s2">never required that I lie to my</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.440" end="00:22:15.100" style="s2">certain point you know you you need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.170" end="00:22:17.530" style="s2">be treated like an adult on these topics</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.100" end="00:22:22.510" style="s2">but the point is not at you know a month</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.530" end="00:22:23.820" style="s2">before her 11th birthday and yet that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.510" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require that I lie about</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.820" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">anything it just requires that I be</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:29.350" style="s2">honest with her that you know listen</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff you don&#39;t need to know now</p>

<p begin="00:22:30.520" end="00:22:33.490" style="s2">now you don&#39;t there&#39;s there&#39;s video I</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.870" end="00:22:35.410" style="s2">could put on for you that you don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.410" end="00:22:40.530" style="s2">having seen so she knows that right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.440" end="00:22:44.950" style="s2">that&#39;s a totally honest communication</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.530" end="00:22:47.110" style="s2">and that suffices right so it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.950" end="00:22:50.260" style="s2">so she knows she knows I&#39;m not lying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.110" end="00:22:52.419" style="s2">her and she knows that that I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.260" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">really keeping a secret from her it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.419" end="00:22:58.690" style="s2">open secret the fact that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:23:02.500" style="s2">secret is not secret and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.690" end="00:23:04.990" style="s2">discharged and clearly all along the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.500" end="00:23:08.950" style="s2">she&#39;s getting the sense that I&#39;m on her</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.990" end="00:23:11.350" style="s2">team right I&#39;m advocating for her in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.950" end="00:23:13.240" style="s2">relationship to a wider reality that she</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.350" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t she knows she doesn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.240" end="00:23:17.260" style="s2">yet and so that&#39;s that&#39;s how I see my</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:21.940" style="s2">role there and it just I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.260" end="00:23:24.760" style="s2">there probably are cases where it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.940" end="00:23:26.230" style="s2">more covert than that where I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.760" end="00:23:28.030" style="s2">telling her that I&#39;m not telling her</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.230" end="00:23:29.260" style="s2">something right I&#39;m just not telling her</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.030" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">something so if she has to take a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.260" end="00:23:34.510" style="s2">medication that has a range of possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.580" style="s2">side effects that are you know low</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.510" end="00:23:37.780" style="s2">probability enough that I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.580" end="00:23:39.850" style="s2">give her the medication in the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.780" end="00:23:41.049" style="s2">place I&#39;ve already judged that she</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.850" end="00:23:43.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to worry about you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.049" end="00:23:46.600" style="s2">seizures and death when I give her this</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.000" end="00:23:49.330" style="s2">medication so I&#39;m not gonna tell her</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.600" end="00:23:52.270" style="s2">that that&#39;s on the you know on the menu</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.330" end="00:23:55.500" style="s2">for for you know some small number of</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.500" end="00:24:01.270" style="s2">because it would just serve to freak her</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.850" end="00:24:03.669" style="s2">out for you know to no good end and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.270" end="00:24:06.460" style="s2">not gonna and but and yet to fully</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.669" end="00:24:07.990" style="s2">unpack that those background facts were</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.460" end="00:24:10.270" style="s2">heard and this is you know every drug</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.990" end="00:24:11.830" style="s2">has you know potential side effects</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.270" end="00:24:14.860" style="s2">which I&#39;m not going to tell you about</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.830" end="00:24:17.140" style="s2">would introduce all the kind of a level</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.140" end="00:24:19.539" style="s2">want to introduce into the system so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.580" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">just not going to talk about it but</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.539" end="00:24:24.429" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s not lying that&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.350" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">contexts is becoming some version of a</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.240" end="00:28:15.540" style="s2">privileged childhoods that you know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.980" end="00:28:17.730" style="s2">mean just at the privilege of having a</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.170" end="00:28:33.540" style="s2">childhood that they can give you like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.570" end="00:28:34.800" style="s2">they&#39;re very few people in human history</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.540" end="00:28:38.070" style="s2">who have been in precisely that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.800" end="00:28:40.500" style="s2">circumstance but the flip side of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.070" end="00:28:42.660" style="s2">is that to have been deprived of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.500" end="00:28:44.790" style="s2">circumstance in one way or another is</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.660" end="00:28:47.040" style="s2">what many people can point to as the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.790" end="00:28:50.250" style="s2">thing that built in a character and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.040" end="00:28:52.700" style="s2">grit and resilience for themselves so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.250" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to square that circle</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.700" end="00:28:56.910" style="s2">yeah I saw somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:57.960" style="s2">I can remember where I encountered it it</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.910" end="00:29:01.860" style="s2">may not have been on Twitter but</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.960" end="00:29:03.150" style="s2">somebody tweeted at one point that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.860" end="00:29:05.220" style="s2">were hoping that their children would</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.150" end="00:29:08.190" style="s2">have just enough trauma to make them</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.220" end="00:29:11.100" style="s2">funny right yeah yeah there&#39;s some truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.190" end="00:29:13.530" style="s2">in that I think yeah well it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.100" end="00:29:15.480" style="s2">interesting puzzle and I do I like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.530" end="00:29:18.540" style="s2">idea you know your point about your kid</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.480" end="00:29:20.880" style="s2">sue being a stand-in for something and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.540" end="00:29:25.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s ancient the standing is</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:27.270" style="s2">likely to be pretty well thought out</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.260" end="00:29:29.010" style="s2">from the perspective of bootstrapping</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.270" end="00:29:31.260" style="s2">some developmental pathways that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.010" end="00:29:33.090" style="s2">otherwise might get missed on the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.260" end="00:29:35.070" style="s2">hand is question about how good a match</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.090" end="00:29:39.270" style="s2">it is for a world as different as ours</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:41.550" style="s2">is from the ancestral world Rick all</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.270" end="00:29:43.950" style="s2">right so maybe it&#39;s time to move on to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.550" end="00:29:45.660" style="s2">free will which is the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.950" end="00:29:50.790" style="s2">controlled you into having a server</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.660" end="00:29:54.120" style="s2">session with me so I&#39;m not quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.790" end="00:29:56.910" style="s2">how to start with you because I have the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.120" end="00:30:00.680" style="s2">sense that somebody like you who&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.910" end="00:30:05.220" style="s2">a position on a topic like freewill</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.680" end="00:30:07.470" style="s2">has a taxonomy in your mind of what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.220" end="00:30:09.510" style="s2">alternative positions are and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:14.040" style="s2">know for sure whether my position is on</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.510" end="00:30:17.790" style="s2">the map or not but I do think it takes</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.040" end="00:30:19.170" style="s2">some some doing to get to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.790" end="00:30:21.150" style="s2">you can see a topic that you know as</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.170" end="00:30:24.990" style="s2">well as this one from a new place which</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.150" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">I&#39;d love to try sure so let&#39;s start this</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.990" end="00:30:29.310" style="s2">way have you ever been in New York yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:30.930" style="s2">yes you have many times yeah and now I</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.310" end="00:30:32.460" style="s2">don&#39;t think you have I&#39;ve always wanted</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.930" end="00:30:34.650" style="s2">to go I should say that I&#39;ve never gone</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.460" end="00:30:36.540" style="s2">because of Zeno&#39;s paradox which has</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.650" end="00:30:39.090" style="s2">prevented me from going and clearly has</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.540" end="00:30:40.740" style="s2">prevented you equally from going right</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.090" end="00:30:43.740" style="s2">but how did I get halfway to New York</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.740" end="00:30:45.090" style="s2">man well that&#39;s the question how did you</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.740" end="00:30:47.040" style="s2">get halfway to New York then how did you</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.090" end="00:30:49.130" style="s2">get halfway there anyway the the reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.040" end="00:30:52.440" style="s2">I raised Zeno&#39;s paradox here and your</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.130" end="00:30:54.810" style="s2">failure to get to New York has to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.440" end="00:30:58.440" style="s2">with the fact that I don&#39;t think there</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.810" end="00:31:01.920" style="s2">is a flaw in the argument of Zeno&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.440" end="00:31:04.590" style="s2">paradox but there is what is it well</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.920" end="00:31:06.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a kind of semantics can</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.590" end="00:31:09.179" style="s2">we know there&#39;s a mathematical flaw</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.420" end="00:31:11.099" style="s2">because you can summon in</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.179" end="00:31:14.639" style="s2">an infinite series right so you can get</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.099" end="00:31:18.419" style="s2">to you can land and it took</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.639" end="00:31:20.460" style="s2">mathematicians I think some centuries to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.419" end="00:31:24.019" style="s2">spell out what was wrong mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.460" end="00:31:28.109" style="s2">with the paradox but it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.019" end="00:31:30.629" style="s2">semantically it&#39;s a false framing of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.109" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">problem you know it&#39;s just the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.629" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">you can&#39;t get all the way there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.729" end="00:31:40.769" style="s2">stated as kind of a term of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.369" end="00:31:42.479" style="s2">the framing and then if you accept that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.769" end="00:31:45.059" style="s2">term well then you just keep cutting</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.479" end="00:31:48.359" style="s2">things in half and you know lo and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.059" end="00:31:51.950" style="s2">behold you never arrive but you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.359" end="00:31:54.419" style="s2">when an arrow leaves a bow it doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.950" end="00:31:56.219" style="s2">just halfway and then half way again and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.419" end="00:31:58.649" style="s2">half way again it goes as far as it goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.219" end="00:32:03.539" style="s2">and sometimes that&#39;s all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.649" end="00:32:06.830" style="s2">target and it&#39;s I mean there there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.539" end="00:32:12.419" style="s2">other trying to think of another example</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.830" end="00:32:15.719" style="s2">I think there are other cleanings that</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.419" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">this is a different example but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.719" end="00:32:22.169" style="s2">a different problem philosophically but</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:24.869" style="s2">there&#39;s their problems like this in</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.169" end="00:32:32.669" style="s2">philosophy where you have kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.869" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">unspecified object which in an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.669" end="00:32:36.929" style="s2">specify its exact boundaries between</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:40.139" style="s2">existence and non-existence you seem to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.929" end="00:32:42.450" style="s2">run into a paradox but it&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.139" end="00:32:45.389" style="s2">paradox just a nature of you know having</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.450" end="00:32:47.219" style="s2">a fuzzy boundary to a certain concept so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.389" end="00:32:49.559" style="s2">you like the concept of a heap right</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.219" end="00:32:51.749" style="s2">like when when does a heap come into</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.559" end="00:32:55.019" style="s2">existence if you have a you know heap of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.749" end="00:32:58.139" style="s2">corn kernels you know one kernel is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.019" end="00:33:01.019" style="s2">a heap two kernels is not a heap three</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.139" end="00:33:03.989" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say yet seem like a heap it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.019" end="00:33:06.509" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible it seems to specify when</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.989" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">a heap is born because you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.509" end="00:33:09.539" style="s2">adding individual kernels and a certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">point you know million kernels is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.539" end="00:33:13.289" style="s2">clearly a pretty big heap right so at</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:15.719" style="s2">some point you get there but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.289" end="00:33:18.359" style="s2">like there there&#39;s no boundary there to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.719" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">actually find and that&#39;s just the nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.359" end="00:33:22.109" style="s2">of the case it&#39;s not that you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:22.950" style="s2">a heap out of adding individual kernels</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.109" end="00:33:24.360" style="s2">of corn well</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.950" end="00:33:26.039" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s not why I raised it I</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.360" end="00:33:28.919" style="s2">certainly agree with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.039" end="00:33:31.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a delineation problem my example</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.919" end="00:33:33.750" style="s2">would be as you go from a mountain to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.110" end="00:33:36.090" style="s2">valley when have you transitioned from</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.750" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">one to the other and the answer is there</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.090" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">is no point but you certainly are more</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:41.880" style="s2">likely to find the river in the valley</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:44.820" style="s2">than on the mountaintop so clearly they</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.880" end="00:33:46.110" style="s2">exist so anyway I accept that and I you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.820" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">know I should also say from my</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.110" end="00:33:48.870" style="s2">perspective I don&#39;t believe that there</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:50.580" style="s2">are any real</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.870" end="00:33:52.679" style="s2">paradoxes or even could be real</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.580" end="00:33:56.010" style="s2">paradoxes in the universe paradox is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.679" end="00:33:59.519" style="s2">byproduct of the absence of some factor</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.010" end="00:34:03.380" style="s2">from your knowledge space and that in</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.519" end="00:34:06.419" style="s2">effect you can use it as an indicator</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.380" end="00:34:08.599" style="s2">well well I would doubt that was so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.419" end="00:34:11.639" style="s2">paradox could also be just the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.599" end="00:34:13.710" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the right intuitions to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.639" end="00:34:16.589" style="s2">understand what is in fact the case so</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.710" end="00:34:19.320" style="s2">our sense of what must be logically so</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.589" end="00:34:23.849" style="s2">you know something either is or is not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.320" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">heap right it just may be that we live</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.849" end="00:34:29.579" style="s2">in a universe where you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:31.290" style="s2">that binary logic just doesn&#39;t apply so</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.579" end="00:34:33.179" style="s2">I mean to more-relevant an example would</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.290" end="00:34:38.220" style="s2">be you know the wave-particle duality</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.179" end="00:34:40.440" style="s2">for something like light that just seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.220" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">inscrutable but maybe that&#39;s the way the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.440" end="00:34:44.429" style="s2">universe is and the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:46.619" style="s2">inscrutable just needs to stop bothering</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.429" end="00:34:48.240" style="s2">us right but it can seem like a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.619" end="00:34:50.579" style="s2">but I think I think we&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.240" end="00:34:53.010" style="s2">same thing in effect what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.579" end="00:34:56.690" style="s2">you if you&#39;re bothered by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.010" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">you can&#39;t define a moment at which a a</p>

<p begin="00:35:03.270" end="00:35:06.540" style="s2">something you don&#39;t understand which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.130" end="00:35:08.540" style="s2">for example the difference between a</p>

<p begin="00:35:08.540" end="00:35:14.040" style="s2">distribution or you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.300" end="00:35:15.630" style="s2">something about the function of language</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.040" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">and the breakdown when it&#39;s trying to</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:23.099" style="s2">or something like that so that is an</p>

<p begin="00:35:23.099" end="00:35:27.630" style="s2">it means to me and what I&#39;ve said to my</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.230" end="00:35:30.420" style="s2">students very frequently is that paradox</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.630" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">is like an X on a treasure map to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.420" end="00:35:33.569" style="s2">extent that you have a paradox it means</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">there&#39;s something to be discovered dig</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.569" end="00:35:37.160" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:39.500" style="s2">and so anyway that&#39;s very valuable with</p>

<p begin="00:35:41.510" end="00:35:46.340" style="s2">paradox is necessarily solved in fact</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.540" end="00:36:00.170" style="s2">illusion because Zeno&#39;s paradox if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.090" end="00:36:01.700" style="s2">follow it to its logical conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.170" end="00:36:04.670" style="s2">means you can&#39;t get anywhere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.700" end="00:36:10.280" style="s2">impossible so obviously we do go places</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.670" end="00:36:12.260" style="s2">and Zeno himself knew that but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.280" end="00:36:15.770" style="s2">that our mathematical system may be</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.260" end="00:36:17.420" style="s2">incapable of at some moment describing</p>

<p begin="00:36:21.950" end="00:36:27.340" style="s2">just such an answer so you</p>

<p begin="00:36:27.340" end="00:36:33.230" style="s2">the reality says Y and reconciling them</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.130" end="00:36:36.200" style="s2">is bound to be productive and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.230" end="00:36:40.130" style="s2">that what is missing is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.200" end="00:36:42.440" style="s2">concept of zero was missing from Greek</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.130" end="00:36:43.550" style="s2">mathematics that&#39;s a crucial concept and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.440" end="00:36:45.620" style="s2">there are lots of things you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.550" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">without it and so something was hinting</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.620" end="00:36:50.360" style="s2">at the absence of zero likewise Monda</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.300" end="00:37:47.780" style="s2">decisive and that said I would imagine</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.700" end="00:38:04.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re not I would say my battle on</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.750" end="00:38:11.720" style="s2">this topic with people has been to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.520" end="00:38:14.210" style="s2">compel them of just what a what a small</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.210" end="00:38:18.050" style="s2">free will one actually has but the</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.050" end="00:38:24.440" style="s2">separates you and me is you believe free</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.270" end="00:38:26.420" style="s2">will is actually a nonentity mm-hm and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.440" end="00:38:28.010" style="s2">believe it is a dim shadow of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.420" end="00:38:30.170" style="s2">people would like it to be and what many</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.010" end="00:38:34.790" style="s2">people think it is but not non-existent</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.170" end="00:38:37.220" style="s2">and that the fact of its being difficult</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.790" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">to attain but not non-existent is</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.220" end="00:38:40.940" style="s2">actually a vital fact one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:43.610" style="s2">necessary and one that&#39;s reflected</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.940" end="00:38:45.460" style="s2">actually in a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.610" end="00:38:49.460" style="s2">people know about how you run your life</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.460" end="00:38:50.810" style="s2">right well so let me make a few</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.460" end="00:38:53.570" style="s2">distinctions which I think will be</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.810" end="00:38:56.270" style="s2">useful because it&#39;s easy to lose sight</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.570" end="00:39:00.830" style="s2">of what the the actual territory here is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.270" end="00:39:02.630" style="s2">so to say that free will is an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.830" end="00:39:05.900" style="s2">or is nonsensical</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.630" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">whether we don&#39;t have it is not to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.900" end="00:39:10.970" style="s2">that there&#39;s no such thing as freedom or</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:13.550" style="s2">autonomy or a difference between being</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.970" end="00:39:14.810" style="s2">coerced in one circumstance or free to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.550" end="00:39:16.840" style="s2">do what you want and another I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.810" end="00:39:19.460" style="s2">those those we have to preserve those</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.840" end="00:39:22.340" style="s2">obvious differences in human life and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.460" end="00:39:25.490" style="s2">our preferences there and I share those</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.340" end="00:39:28.610" style="s2">preferences you know and to not be in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.490" end="00:39:31.880" style="s2">prison camp in North Korea is a good</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.610" end="00:39:34.040" style="s2">thing and what&#39;s bad about being forced</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.880" end="00:39:36.520" style="s2">to be there is or all the obvious bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.040" end="00:39:41.060" style="s2">things about being deprived of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.520" end="00:39:46.430" style="s2">and to have no governance over your your</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.060" end="00:39:51.050" style="s2">day to day existence so the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.430" end="00:39:53.570" style="s2">free will is that well let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.050" end="00:39:56.330" style="s2">basic claim there&#39;s the sense the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.570" end="00:39:59.600" style="s2">the libertarian set was called in</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.330" end="00:40:01.069" style="s2">philosophy the libertarian sense of free</p>

<p begin="00:40:01.069" end="00:40:09.349" style="s2">I would argue people&#39;s default sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.219" end="00:40:11.779" style="s2">it this is a notion that the problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.349" end="00:40:15.650" style="s2">with it is that it really is impossible</p>

<p begin="00:44:27.270" end="00:44:32.310" style="s2">inconsistent with any belief in</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.670" end="00:44:33.690" style="s2">Darwinism that what you have is a</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.410" end="00:44:46.920" style="s2">nothing in fact makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.400" end="00:44:48.900" style="s2">including this conversation it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.920" end="00:44:50.900" style="s2">some sort of odd theater and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.900" end="00:44:53.310" style="s2">thing that makes least sense of all is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.900" end="00:44:55.320" style="s2">consciousness that there should be an</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.310" end="00:44:57.930" style="s2">awareness taking place inside of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.320" end="00:44:59.370" style="s2">totally scripted entity makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.930" end="00:45:01.020" style="s2">so anyway let&#39;s put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.370" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">well let&#39;s bracket that because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.020" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">that that I think is I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:11.160" style="s2">interesting to consider whether our</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:13.560" style="s2">notion of possibility is just a fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.160" end="00:45:14.910" style="s2">right right and as I said you can&#39;t rule</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.560" end="00:45:16.440" style="s2">it out completely or it would be that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.910" end="00:45:18.180" style="s2">the whole thing I mean you know frankly</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.440" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">it could be that we exist inside a</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.180" end="00:45:23.160" style="s2">deterministic computer in which somebody</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.400" end="00:45:25.380" style="s2">had a purpose in getting us to have this</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.160" end="00:45:27.270" style="s2">conversation and feel some way within it</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.380" end="00:45:29.250" style="s2">and you know all sorts of things have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.270" end="00:45:31.320" style="s2">be left formally on the map but I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.250" end="00:45:33.000" style="s2">at a practical level a there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.320" end="00:45:36.810" style="s2">percentage in it if this really is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.000" end="00:45:38.130" style="s2">totally deterministic universe then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.810" end="00:45:40.200" style="s2">hard to even know how to complete that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.130" end="00:45:41.850" style="s2">sentence the level of pointlessness of</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.200" end="00:45:43.530" style="s2">anything other than simply doing what</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.850" end="00:45:45.510" style="s2">you deterministically have no choice but</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.530" end="00:45:49.970" style="s2">to do is what it is and so let&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.510" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">know but but even in even in that case</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.970" end="00:45:54.930" style="s2">there still is a there&#39;s a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:59.670" style="s2">to not knowing what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.930" end="00:46:02.790" style="s2">and there is the reality that a parent</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.670" end="00:46:05.010" style="s2">choice still plays a role in deciding</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.790" end="00:46:07.050" style="s2">what in fact happens is it usually</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.010" end="00:46:08.760" style="s2">mechanistic one yeah but you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.050" end="00:46:10.560" style="s2">wait to see what happens because that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.760" end="00:46:11.970" style="s2">itself a choice which baguettes certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:13.950" style="s2">consequences and closes the door to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.970" end="00:46:15.330" style="s2">other kind of have to say inside of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.950" end="00:46:16.290" style="s2">completely deterministic universe I</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.330" end="00:46:16.530" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.290" end="00:46:18.810" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.530" end="00:46:21.540" style="s2">what do you mean consequence it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.810" end="00:46:24.510" style="s2">well but that&#39;s it&#39;s so fully automatic</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.540" end="00:46:28.080" style="s2">well yes but it but it is in on some</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.510" end="00:46:30.150" style="s2">level where as Zeno by another root</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.080" end="00:46:31.800" style="s2">because yes in a fully it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.150" end="00:46:33.360" style="s2">single object writer there and there</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.800" end="00:46:34.650" style="s2">knows there&#39;s no such thing as events</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.360" end="00:46:36.590" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as causality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.650" end="00:46:38.330" style="s2">just a block universe on some level</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.590" end="00:46:40.520" style="s2">right and future exists as much as the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.330" end="00:46:41.630" style="s2">past so actually let&#39;s let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.520" end="00:46:43.940" style="s2">you know cuz I don&#39;t think we got the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.630" end="00:46:45.080" style="s2">value out of it oh come in in just</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.940" end="00:46:47.570" style="s2">setting the stage here for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.080" end="00:46:49.940" style="s2">discussion that I hope will have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.570" end="00:46:53.420" style="s2">thing about Zeno&#39;s paradox is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.940" end="00:46:56.180" style="s2">actually xenos Zeno style logic is</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.420" end="00:46:59.150" style="s2">recovered by some models that are taken</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.180" end="00:47:01.010" style="s2">seriously in physics in other words in</p>

<p begin="00:47:06.350" end="00:47:12.620" style="s2">trajectories so you know to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.660" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">that you know I drop an item and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.620" end="00:47:16.100" style="s2">one fiber of the carpet versus another</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:18.440" style="s2">fiber of the carpet you get two</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.440" end="00:47:23.900" style="s2">for everything that is downstream of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.330" end="00:47:27.070" style="s2">that that&#39;s it&#39;s some sense an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.900" end="00:47:30.140" style="s2">nonsense explanation is it standing in</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.070" end="00:47:32.420" style="s2">for something that we can&#39;t phrase maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.140" end="00:47:34.040" style="s2">because limits of human cognition or</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.420" end="00:47:36.890" style="s2">language make it impossible to phrase</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.040" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">and so you know the paradoxes of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.890" end="00:47:42.820" style="s2">mechanics for example it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:42.820" style="s2">there&#39;s some way we could construct</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.240" end="00:47:46.940" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s a language barrier</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.170" end="00:47:48.110" style="s2">there&#39;s some way we could construct</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.940" end="00:47:50.510" style="s2">language that those things wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.110" end="00:47:52.070" style="s2">sound so outlandish</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.510" end="00:47:54.410" style="s2">but we don&#39;t have it and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.070" end="00:47:56.090" style="s2">constantly offering them and then stuck</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.410" end="00:47:58.760" style="s2">with the disbelief that comes along so</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.090" end="00:48:01.100" style="s2">anyway my my point would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.760" end="00:48:03.470" style="s2">you&#39;ve been to New York and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.100" end="00:48:06.470" style="s2">that there is a formal problem given a</p>

<p begin="00:48:07.730" end="00:48:13.250" style="s2">have been there and what you&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.380" end="00:48:15.710" style="s2">with is the argument has a strength and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.250" end="00:48:17.480" style="s2">the empirical fact that the argument</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.710" end="00:48:19.670" style="s2">does not appear it apparently prevent</p>

<p begin="00:48:24.560" end="00:48:34.270" style="s2">together right except I think the the</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.839" end="00:50:33.959" style="s2">once you spot the exception if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.949" end="00:50:36.929" style="s2">what it is that the desire to enlarge it</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.959" end="00:50:40.229" style="s2">is overwhelmed and in fact the irony of</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.229" end="00:50:46.589" style="s2">that occupy your time and your thinking</p>

<p begin="00:50:46.589" end="00:50:51.209" style="s2">of freewill that we are handed and to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.349" end="00:50:52.619" style="s2">enlarge it and have it applied to a</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.619" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">think is a completely rational response</p>

<p begin="00:51:05.289" end="00:51:10.569" style="s2">think that that scintilla of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:12.849" style="s2">actually is okay so first of all it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.569" end="00:51:14.410" style="s2">utterly dependent on us not living in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.849" end="00:51:16.089" style="s2">deterministic universe if we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.410" end="00:51:18.819" style="s2">deterministic universe then I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.089" end="00:51:22.599" style="s2">understand a damn thing and it&#39;s game</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.819" end="00:51:24.519" style="s2">over for Brett assuming we don&#39;t and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.599" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">think the physics is pretty clear</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.519" end="00:51:29.680" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to think we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:31.029" style="s2">there&#39;s quantum uncertainty and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.680" end="00:51:32.559" style="s2">that there is quantum uncertainty means</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.029" end="00:51:34.690" style="s2">that uncertainty can exist at higher</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.559" end="00:51:37.239" style="s2">levels through various mechanisms well</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.690" end="00:51:39.160" style="s2">or we live in a universe where I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.239" end="00:51:41.769" style="s2">you take the many-worlds picture</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.160" end="00:51:46.959" style="s2">seriously which again it&#39;s hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.769" end="00:51:48.849" style="s2">but many physicists do at this point we</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.959" end="00:51:52.150" style="s2">live in a world where everything that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.849" end="00:51:53.589" style="s2">can happen does in fact happen somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.150" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">right and you don&#39;t know which one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.589" end="00:51:58.809" style="s2">these worlds you are in right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:52:01.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a new kind of determinism in a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.809" end="00:52:05.559" style="s2">which is like you know every every</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.920" end="00:52:08.529" style="s2">gradation of possible difference in in</p>

<p begin="00:52:18.309" end="00:52:23.769" style="s2">billiard ball hitting another but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.759" end="00:52:25.299" style="s2">uncertainty is we don&#39;t know which one</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.769" end="00:52:27.849" style="s2">we don&#39;t know whether we&#39;re in the</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.089" end="00:52:45.549" style="s2">still can still beyond just understood</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">determinate deterministically in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.549" end="00:52:50.170" style="s2">picture well I&#39;ve never regretted not</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.170" end="00:52:57.249" style="s2">but so here&#39;s the thing I do I I resent</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.799" end="00:55:37.490" style="s2">parsimony and not for a good reason just</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.660" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">because I mean actually Eric does have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.490" end="00:55:40.910" style="s2">term for this sort of thing I hope he</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:43.940" style="s2">won&#39;t resent my applying it here I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.910" end="00:55:45.410" style="s2">he would but desperation physics but</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.940" end="00:55:47.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not even just to forget about many</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.410" end="00:55:51.170" style="s2">worlds for a second just imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.720" end="00:55:52.579" style="s2">universe that is infinitely large right</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.170" end="00:55:55.640" style="s2">now one of the the probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.579" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">consequences of that scenario is that if</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.640" end="00:56:00.680" style="s2">you just go far enough in any direction</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:04.250" style="s2">again you run into the same problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.680" end="00:56:06.589" style="s2">anything that can happen will happen an</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.250" end="00:56:08.299" style="s2">infinite number of times right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.589" end="00:56:09.890" style="s2">that&#39;s how big infinity is so that there</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.299" end="00:56:12.589" style="s2">are an infinite number of identical</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.890" end="00:56:15.619" style="s2">copies of us having infinitely similar</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.589" end="00:56:17.240" style="s2">and and slightly different conversations</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.619" end="00:56:19.309" style="s2">than this an infinite number of times</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.240" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">simply if you make the universe big</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.309" end="00:56:23.029" style="s2">enough and that&#39;s it that just falls out</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:25.130" style="s2">of probability theory right but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.029" end="00:56:27.619" style="s2">this is my point about fractals actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.130" end="00:56:28.760" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m speaking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.619" end="00:56:30.349" style="s2">out of my depth here but my</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.760" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">understanding is that there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.349" end="00:56:35.390" style="s2">with coastlines which is that they get</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">infinitely long the closer you measure</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.390" end="00:56:40.549" style="s2">they approach infinity in length as you</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">get better at measuring the nuances of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.549" end="00:56:44.059" style="s2">coastline right that obviously doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:45.440" style="s2">make any sense the coastline isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.059" end="00:56:49.549" style="s2">getting bigger because you&#39;re measuring</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.440" end="00:56:53.180" style="s2">more finally well I know it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.549" end="00:56:55.849" style="s2">I mean your your ruler has to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.180" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">infinitely thin and small I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.849" end="00:56:59.990" style="s2">you like but the point is as we go down</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:02.119" style="s2">to the Planck scale and as you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.990" end="00:57:04.520" style="s2">Toth to infinity right right you</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.119" end="00:57:07.849" style="s2">discover I screwed up somewhere and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.520" end="00:57:09.319" style="s2">isn&#39;t my ruler ice it&#39;s just not usually</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.849" end="00:57:11.480" style="s2">well this cake it sort of comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.319" end="00:57:12.859" style="s2">Z no yes is it you&#39;ve applied Zeno&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.480" end="00:57:14.960" style="s2">paradox to measure in a closed line</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.859" end="00:57:17.029" style="s2">bingo but the point is there is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.960" end="00:57:19.670" style="s2">do this and it took somebody stepping</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.029" end="00:57:20.900" style="s2">back and saying you know what math is</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.670" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">going to have to be we&#39;re gonna need a</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.900" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">new toolkit just the same way newton and</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:28.010" style="s2">leibniz</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:30.069" style="s2">discovered a toolkit for people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.010" end="00:57:32.839" style="s2">like it when I say it this way but for</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.069" end="00:57:37.069" style="s2">calculating the incalculable which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.839" end="00:57:38.960" style="s2">what calculus did as I see it but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.069" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">the point is I think the many-worlds</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.960" end="00:57:46.089" style="s2">interpretation is</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:48.970" style="s2">a best answer to a problem that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.089" end="00:57:54.099" style="s2">phrased so incorrectly that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.970" end="00:57:56.069" style="s2">that just as if you asked the question</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.099" end="00:57:59.589" style="s2">about where these creatures came from</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.069" end="00:58:01.089" style="s2">3,000 years ago nobody had Darwinism to</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.589" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2">offer so there wasn&#39;t even a way to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.089" end="00:58:05.710" style="s2">begin to phrase the answer credibly hmm</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:07.869" style="s2">you could say well then that leaves you</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.710" end="00:58:09.369" style="s2">picking between deities who might have</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.869" end="00:58:11.170" style="s2">done it and really what we&#39;re after is</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.369" end="00:58:12.700" style="s2">figuring out which one it was when in</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.170" end="00:58:14.559" style="s2">fact it wasn&#39;t any of them it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.700" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">processes that were understandable but</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.559" end="00:58:19.450" style="s2">we didn&#39;t yet have the mechanism to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:22.869" style="s2">so so I think that&#39;s where we are in</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.450" end="00:58:24.819" style="s2">that case yeah it might be and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.869" end="00:58:27.400" style="s2">to see what we&#39;re not seeing here I</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.819" end="00:58:32.319" style="s2">can&#39;t even dimly imagine but it it does</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.400" end="00:58:37.450" style="s2">seem like I mean is it is a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.319" end="00:58:40.510" style="s2">straightforward claim that the again the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.450" end="00:58:44.230" style="s2">the the infinite case is even simpler</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.510" end="00:58:47.170" style="s2">because it&#39;s just you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.230" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">require any notion of universes</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.170" end="00:58:53.589" style="s2">splitting but it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to know</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:56.140" style="s2">where to where to bite the bullet I</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.589" end="00:58:59.770" style="s2">think I think the thing to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.140" end="00:59:01.690" style="s2">would the these counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.770" end="00:59:03.849" style="s2">consequences of infinity it&#39;s just how</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.690" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">counterintuitive infinity is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.849" end="00:59:10.119" style="s2">infinity is not just really really big</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">right right it is and and our intuition</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.119" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">that that it&#39;s just really really big</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:19.359" style="s2">know the rules change when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:21.730" style="s2">put that symbol of infinity on the on</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.359" end="00:59:25.660" style="s2">the paper right rather there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.730" end="00:59:28.540" style="s2">big number if we can agree that in an</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.660" end="00:59:30.250" style="s2">infinitely large universe somewhere at</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.540" end="00:59:33.150" style="s2">some point in fact an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.250" end="00:59:36.160" style="s2">places an infinite number of times a</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.150" end="00:59:38.559" style="s2">asteroid will have hit another asteroid</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.160" end="00:59:40.839" style="s2">and aardvark will have been formed</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.559" end="00:59:44.559" style="s2">absent an atmosphere immediately died</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.839" end="00:59:47.230" style="s2">and disintegrated into a bizarrely large</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.559" end="00:59:48.460" style="s2">petunia of a unusual color right an</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.230" end="00:59:50.589" style="s2">infinite number of times</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.460" end="00:59:52.780" style="s2">I&#39;m telling inverse compatible with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.589" end="00:59:54.369" style="s2">law of laws of physics will have happen</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.780" end="00:59:55.089" style="s2">an infinite number of times yes I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.369" end="00:59:56.349" style="s2">believe that has</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.089" end="00:59:58.150" style="s2">ever happened anywhere in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.349" end="00:59:59.680" style="s2">and I believe that actually what we will</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.150" end="01:00:01.569" style="s2">ultimately come to understand is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.680" end="01:00:02.799" style="s2">the universe has to be limited in a way</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.569" end="01:00:05.229" style="s2">that that actually won&#39;t have occurred</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.799" end="01:00:07.150" style="s2">ever well but one easy way to bound that</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.229" end="01:00:08.710" style="s2">is just say that it&#39;s we don&#39;t live in</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.150" end="01:00:10.420" style="s2">an infinite universe however big it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.710" end="01:00:12.670" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s not very close a being</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.420" end="01:00:14.229" style="s2">right infinite yes okay now worried</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.670" end="01:00:16.089" style="s2">about this particularly definitely large</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.229" end="01:00:17.499" style="s2">isn&#39;t infinite and the differences you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.089" end="01:00:19.749" style="s2">yeah yeah well I agree</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.499" end="01:00:21.880" style="s2">so all right back to free but I just</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.749" end="01:00:23.619" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you I think you if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.880" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">close the door to many worlds or at</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.619" end="01:00:27.719" style="s2">least beat your intuitions into shape</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:30.940" style="s2">there I think you should probably have</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.719" end="01:00:32.680" style="s2">either David Deutsch or Sean Carroll on</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.940" end="01:00:35.079" style="s2">your podcast because they&#39;re both all in</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.680" end="01:00:37.210" style="s2">on that all in I love it when people die</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.079" end="01:00:38.859" style="s2">all I&#39;d want to do is bet against it you</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.210" end="01:00:41.650" style="s2">know I&#39;m certain to be right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.859" end="01:00:45.279" style="s2">easy money so okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.650" end="01:00:47.829" style="s2">back to free will let&#39;s take off the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.279" end="01:00:52.420" style="s2">table a completely deterministic</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.829" end="01:00:54.009" style="s2">universe because even if that was the</p>

<p begin="01:00:55.509" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">that would be you know the discussion</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.489" end="01:01:03.989" style="s2">will be what it is well again I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">that&#39;s not a necessary conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.989" end="01:01:08.920" style="s2">psychologically because you still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:11.349" style="s2">you still don&#39;t know what is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.920" end="01:01:12.930" style="s2">happen next right what something will</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.349" end="01:01:15.729" style="s2">happen now what does it mean to know</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.930" end="01:01:17.650" style="s2">well to be able to talk about to be able</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.729" end="01:01:19.599" style="s2">to sell more able to I mean none of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.650" end="01:01:20.979" style="s2">makes any sense in a completely but it</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.599" end="01:01:23.289" style="s2">mean if it makes psychological sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.979" end="01:01:24.519" style="s2">nothing makes any psychological sense no</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.289" end="01:01:26.349" style="s2">you still have to get lunch</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.519" end="01:01:28.119" style="s2">you still want no there&#39;s no half to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.349" end="01:01:29.499" style="s2">there&#39;s no nothing there is and the</p>

<p begin="01:08:07.630" end="01:08:12.730" style="s2">a dyed-in-the-wool Darwinist I believe</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.180" end="01:08:15.450" style="s2">Darwinism works because there are</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.730" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">multiple outcomes and better outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.450" end="01:08:19.980" style="s2">propagate in a completely deterministic</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:22.870" style="s2">universe you might see the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.980" end="01:08:25.720" style="s2">unfolding but there would be no meaning</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.870" end="01:08:30.279" style="s2">to any of it and well meaning again</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.720" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">meaning is a I think meaning is another</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.279" end="01:08:35.470" style="s2">one of these fishy concepts that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:39.100" style="s2">can be can be applied appropriately in</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.470" end="01:08:40.930" style="s2">within certain frames but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.100" end="01:08:43.029" style="s2">not an ultimate concept it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.930" end="01:08:46.630" style="s2">concept that can be applied everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.029" end="01:08:48.370" style="s2">without creating howlers or</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.630" end="01:08:50.320" style="s2">well that&#39;s the thing is patience if</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.370" end="01:08:51.609" style="s2">this is mean look I&#39;m surprised that</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.320" end="01:08:53.230" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck on a completely</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.609" end="01:08:56.740" style="s2">deterministic universe as a possibility</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.230" end="01:09:03.730" style="s2">well I just don&#39;t see is if it&#39;s pot if</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.740" end="01:09:05.170" style="s2">it&#39;s the case so it&#39;s a so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.730" end="01:09:10.750" style="s2">not talking past each other let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.170" end="01:09:13.630" style="s2">just revisit one point here the it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.750" end="01:09:15.730" style="s2">usually felt I mean I I think it will be</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.630" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2">keenly felt by almost everyone listening</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.730" end="01:09:25.000" style="s2">to us that the problem of free will</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:28.150" style="s2">indoors because on the experiential side</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.000" end="01:09:30.609" style="s2">we sort of know we have it we feel it</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.150" end="01:09:32.650" style="s2">right like our experience is not</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.609" end="01:09:35.050" style="s2">compatible with it being an illusion</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.650" end="01:09:37.150" style="s2">yeah right and so if you&#39;re gonna tell</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.050" end="01:09:39.340" style="s2">me it&#39;s an illusion you&#39;re telling me I</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.150" end="01:09:41.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t go to New York right and so I</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.340" end="01:09:44.080" style="s2">know something&#39;s fishy there because I I</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.050" end="01:09:45.940" style="s2">can choose right now to have tea or</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.080" end="01:09:50.050" style="s2">coffee yeah right it&#39;s what&#39;s on me and</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.940" end="01:09:54.100" style="s2">I can do it you know that sense of being</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.050" end="01:09:56.200" style="s2">in charge right that is that requires</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.100" end="01:09:58.360" style="s2">some additional observation of what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.200" end="01:10:00.760" style="s2">like to be you but that you can get past</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.360" end="01:10:03.520" style="s2">that and realize that your experience</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.760" end="01:10:05.080" style="s2">moment a moment is totally compatible</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:06.760" style="s2">with free will being an illusion so I</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.080" end="01:10:08.770" style="s2">just want to plant a flag there where</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.760" end="01:10:11.110" style="s2">people can see it I agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.770" end="01:10:13.120" style="s2">statement that okay look you and I are</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.110" end="01:10:16.210" style="s2">on the same page with respect to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.120" end="01:10:18.220" style="s2">question of how do we feel we feel free</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.210" end="01:10:21.370" style="s2">what does that imply about how free we</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.220" end="01:10:23.080" style="s2">are almost nothing free will is a useful</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.370" end="01:10:25.060" style="s2">fiction the way most people understand</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.080" end="01:10:27.610" style="s2">it but let me point out but I would make</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.060" end="01:10:29.890" style="s2">the additional point that when I pay</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.610" end="01:10:32.110" style="s2">attention which is you know more and</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.890" end="01:10:35.380" style="s2">more of the time I don&#39;t actually feel</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.110" end="01:10:43.060" style="s2">free in that in that sense like I what I</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.380" end="01:10:46.450" style="s2">feel like is the the witness to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.060" end="01:10:49.660" style="s2">fundamental mystery of being in each</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.450" end="01:10:51.820" style="s2">moment which is thoughts just appear</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.660" end="01:10:53.590" style="s2">intentions just appear some of them are</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.820" end="01:10:57.340" style="s2">seem actionable some of them don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.590" end="01:10:58.690" style="s2">the why I why there&#39;s a why one has</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.340" end="01:11:01.120" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.690" end="01:11:04.450" style="s2">charge in one moment to being actionable</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.120" end="01:11:07.780" style="s2">and in another moment it fails to move</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.450" end="01:11:09.430" style="s2">me all of that is is irreducibly</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.780" end="01:11:11.770" style="s2">mysterious right and there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.430" end="01:11:15.160" style="s2">no place I&#39;m standing as a conscious</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.770" end="01:11:19.510" style="s2">witness to this process where it feels</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.160" end="01:11:21.610" style="s2">like I have the free will that most</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.510" end="01:11:23.740" style="s2">people seem to be talking about oh I</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.610" end="01:11:25.420" style="s2">definitely think the door you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.740" end="01:11:28.600" style="s2">walked through is worth walking through</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.420" end="01:11:31.810" style="s2">in part because it gives you greater</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.600" end="01:11:34.690" style="s2">access to the very limited rarefied and</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.810" end="01:11:37.960" style="s2">I would argue highly desirable freedom</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.690" end="01:11:40.660" style="s2">that is possible ok so let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.960" end="01:11:42.070" style="s2">what that may or may not be ok yeah what</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.660" end="01:11:45.130" style="s2">what that may or may not be so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.070" end="01:11:50.050" style="s2">just notice something you have two</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.130" end="01:11:52.060" style="s2">children yep that&#39;s weird they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.050" end="01:11:58.060" style="s2">highly bred prime number you&#39;re a highly</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.060" end="01:12:00.850" style="s2">successful handsome guy you surely had</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.060" end="01:12:02.530" style="s2">you decided to do it could have arranged</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.850" end="01:12:09.670" style="s2">to have a great deal more children than</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.530" end="01:12:11.590" style="s2">two well I&#39;m not sure about that but are</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.670" end="01:12:16.180" style="s2">you suggesting that I should be more</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.590" end="01:12:20.710" style="s2">moved by by Darwinian logic than I in</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.180" end="01:12:22.930" style="s2">fact am no I&#39;m saying that if there were</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.710" end="01:12:24.760" style="s2">no free will then we know that one of</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.930" end="01:12:26.620" style="s2">the components of the equation that</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.760" end="01:12:29.110" style="s2">ought to be driving you ahead without</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.620" end="01:12:32.020" style="s2">your ability to intervene meaningfully</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.110" end="01:12:34.360" style="s2">on your own behalf would be a fitness</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.020" end="01:12:36.820" style="s2">maximizing function and we would expect</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.360" end="01:12:39.220" style="s2">you to have a great deal more children</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.820" end="01:12:42.370" style="s2">than that given your privileged position</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.220" end="01:12:49.120" style="s2">in the universe and no no so that said</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.370" end="01:12:54.040" style="s2">that suggests that the the determinism</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.120" end="01:13:01.660" style="s2">would cause us to be more slavishly</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.040" end="01:13:06.210" style="s2">devoted to ancient APIs genetically</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.660" end="01:13:08.940" style="s2">driven urges than we are and that</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.210" end="01:13:10.530" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of you know some are all</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.940" end="01:13:13.740" style="s2">these other countervailing forces that</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.530" end="01:13:16.740" style="s2">have civilized us are not yet just more</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.740" end="01:13:20.220" style="s2">determinism right but so my point is if</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.740" end="01:13:23.940" style="s2">your argument were true as you stated it</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.220" end="01:13:25.650" style="s2">which it may be and alone on the floor</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.940" end="01:13:27.810" style="s2">of arguments relative to this puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.650" end="01:13:30.300" style="s2">which I believe it isn&#39;t if it were both</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.810" end="01:13:33.210" style="s2">of those things then I believe one of</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.300" end="01:13:36.990" style="s2">the factors that robs you of free will</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.210" end="01:13:39.000" style="s2">would see fitness as a primary function</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.990" end="01:13:42.450" style="s2">and that what in fact has happened is</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.000" end="01:13:44.370" style="s2">not that civilization has come to a</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.450" end="01:13:46.260" style="s2">wiser understanding of how many children</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.370" end="01:13:51.510" style="s2">to have what&#39;s happened is an accident</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.260" end="01:13:55.770" style="s2">of history that the act of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.510" end="01:13:59.160" style="s2">intercourse and the phenomenon of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.770" end="01:14:01.320" style="s2">reproduction have turned out to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.160" end="01:14:04.110" style="s2">divorced from each other biologically</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.320" end="01:14:08.160" style="s2">there was no need to drive our ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.110" end="01:14:10.740" style="s2">to enjoy reproducing because driving</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.160" end="01:14:13.560" style="s2">them to pursue sex was sufficient to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.740" end="01:14:15.600" style="s2">reproduction to happen the fact of those</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.560" end="01:14:16.170" style="s2">two things being diff different from</p>

<p begin="01:14:16.170" end="01:14:19.470" style="s2">leaves room for us to intervene</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.880" end="01:14:21.600" style="s2">technologically so that you can engage</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.470" end="01:14:23.220" style="s2">in family planning and decide not only</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.600" end="01:14:25.680" style="s2">how many children you want but when you</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.220" end="01:14:29.070" style="s2">want to have them read you know all</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.680" end="01:14:34.700" style="s2">sorts of things so the fact of family</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.070" end="01:14:37.440" style="s2">planning is in many instances at least</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.700" end="01:14:39.530" style="s2">anti-darwinian I&#39;m not arguing against</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.440" end="01:14:40.710" style="s2">it I&#39;m not a fan of being a slave to</p>

<p begin="01:14:40.710" end="01:14:47.100" style="s2">in fact I&#39;ve argued publicly that we</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.100" end="01:14:51.450" style="s2">would have us maximize Fitness because</p>

<p begin="01:14:56.010" end="01:15:01.500" style="s2">would find it very much more difficult</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.810" end="01:15:03.330" style="s2">to to swear off sex mm-hm</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.500" end="01:15:05.310" style="s2">tells us something you have two</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.330" end="01:15:07.050" style="s2">different levels of freedom with respect</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.310" end="01:15:08.280" style="s2">to those two choices and the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.050" end="01:15:11.760" style="s2">you have two different levels is</p>

<p begin="01:16:49.290" end="01:16:55.230" style="s2">too late for me but maybe I can generate</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.890" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">I can bootstrap some freedom for people</p>

<p begin="01:17:41.280" end="01:17:47.940" style="s2">dice and I were to put in some time</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.250" end="01:17:51.239" style="s2">figuring out how let&#39;s say I&#39;ve started</p>

<p begin="01:18:14.280" end="01:18:19.320" style="s2">something like that but anyway you could</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.139" end="01:18:22.230" style="s2">generate a series of experiences in life</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.320" end="01:18:24.449" style="s2">that were only the process of the one</p>

<p begin="01:18:27.389" end="01:18:30.420" style="s2">has happened you would have whatever</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.409" end="01:18:32.280" style="s2">discussions you had in the locations</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.420" end="01:18:35.489" style="s2">that had been chosen for you you would</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.280" end="01:18:39.060" style="s2">see whatever sunsets you saw and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.489" end="01:18:40.770" style="s2">this would generate a mind that at some</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.060" end="01:18:43.560" style="s2">point would be very different</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.770" end="01:18:46.619" style="s2">from the mind that had been constrained</p>

<p begin="01:18:46.619" end="01:18:51.420" style="s2">that followed from each other and</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.330" end="01:18:54.840" style="s2">generated their own their own follow-on</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.420" end="01:18:56.940" style="s2">phenomenon yeah but no more free I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.840" end="01:19:01.699" style="s2">sure about that I mean it is it would be</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.940" end="01:19:06.090" style="s2">different but it&#39;s just as hostage to</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.699" end="01:19:07.739" style="s2">proximate causes that were uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.090" end="01:19:09.030" style="s2">I mean in this case a literally</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.739" end="01:19:13.110" style="s2">uncomfortable like if you&#39;re rolling</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.030" end="01:19:16.619" style="s2">dice to decide what to do next eat next</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.110" end="01:19:18.630" style="s2">say next who to be in the world like</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.619" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">beautiful choosing a career choosing a</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.630" end="01:19:26.280" style="s2">major you you can you&#39;re you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.560" end="01:19:29.639" style="s2">played upon by a process that doesn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.280" end="01:19:32.369" style="s2">that case doesn&#39;t even feel like you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:19:34.969" end="01:19:41.849" style="s2">quite literally giving it away to chance</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.530" end="01:19:45.270" style="s2">yeah and a grand show is a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.849" end="01:19:46.920" style="s2">different life than the person would be</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.270" end="01:19:53.070" style="s2">tending to lead if they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.920" end="01:19:54.990" style="s2">that but it&#39;s it&#39;s not what it&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.070" end="01:19:58.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t align with the freedom that that</p>

<p begin="01:19:58.680" end="01:20:03.540" style="s2">reasonably want nor am I trying to</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.690" end="01:20:05.430" style="s2">resurrect the conventional notion of</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.540" end="01:20:06.810" style="s2">free will okay why would I am getting</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.430" end="01:20:08.430" style="s2">I&#39;m not arguing that as you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.810" end="01:20:12.450" style="s2">bounced around the globe by the roll of</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.430" end="01:20:15.030" style="s2">dice that you are free right you are</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.450" end="01:20:17.040" style="s2">enslaved to a different process but what</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.030" end="01:20:19.260" style="s2">I am arguing is that if you do that long</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.040" end="01:20:23.280" style="s2">enough what you do is you take the</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.260" end="01:20:27.570" style="s2">inputs that hold us captive and you</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.280" end="01:20:30.600" style="s2">drive their influence over yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.570" end="01:20:35.850" style="s2">your descendants toward zero you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.600" end="01:20:39.000" style="s2">get to zero but you drive let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.850" end="01:20:42.240" style="s2">the fact that you know you&#39;re born in</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.000" end="01:20:44.760" style="s2">Los Angeles you go to a certain school</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.240" end="01:20:46.320" style="s2">certain ideas are resonant during the</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.760" end="01:20:48.300" style="s2">period of time all of these things are</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.320" end="01:20:51.150" style="s2">causes that then result in you having</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.300" end="01:20:53.730" style="s2">certain values those values unfold and</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.150" end="01:20:55.140" style="s2">choices those choices manifest in</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.730" end="01:20:56.850" style="s2">phenomena on your life that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.140" end="01:21:00.660" style="s2">experience and so you and I agree that</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.850" end="01:21:04.290" style="s2">this has something very that this</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.660" end="01:21:05.760" style="s2">reduces the actual freedom that you are</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.290" end="01:21:08.730" style="s2">being carried along in a stream much</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.760" end="01:21:11.760" style="s2">more than you typically understand if</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.730" end="01:21:16.020" style="s2">you generate phenomena by random and</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.760" end="01:21:19.470" style="s2">that creates a series of experiences</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.020" end="01:21:21.300" style="s2">that are themselves only sequenced by</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.470" end="01:21:26.180" style="s2">the one choice that you&#39;ve made to break</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.300" end="01:21:29.370" style="s2">free from being captive then eventually</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.180" end="01:21:31.980" style="s2">my argument is you will have generated</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.370" end="01:21:35.760" style="s2">enough novelty you&#39;re not you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.980" end="01:21:37.170" style="s2">generated a escape from causality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.760" end="01:21:38.790" style="s2">what I hear you saying right the</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.170" end="01:21:41.190" style="s2">causality is still there after you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.790" end="01:21:44.790" style="s2">done this for 20 years or you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.190" end="01:21:47.460" style="s2">for 20 generations yeah right you will</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.790" end="01:21:51.990" style="s2">always have causality and causality is</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.460" end="01:21:53.610" style="s2">always an intruder into consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.990" end="01:21:57.390" style="s2">into the space of consciousness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.610" end="01:21:59.400" style="s2">it&#39;s always yes it will never not you</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.390" end="01:22:01.500" style="s2">can&#39;t own it you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.400" end="01:22:05.500" style="s2">actually say</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.500" end="01:22:07.719" style="s2">that consciousness was the the cause of</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.500" end="01:22:09.699" style="s2">that next thing because that next thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.719" end="01:22:11.290" style="s2">simply appeared this is a separate</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.699" end="01:22:13.930" style="s2">conversation about why consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.290" end="01:22:16.270" style="s2">is so inscrutable and in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.930" end="01:22:18.520" style="s2">terms you know it&#39;s hard to say what is</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.270" end="01:22:19.870" style="s2">doing and and if it&#39;s if it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.520" end="01:22:21.699" style="s2">say what is doing it&#39;s hard to say why</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.870" end="01:22:27.070" style="s2">it might have evolved in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.699" end="01:22:31.660" style="s2">but yeah so it doesn&#39;t it still leaves</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.070" end="01:22:33.670" style="s2">us with this this this mystery at the</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.660" end="01:22:36.190" style="s2">level of experience that we why we would</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.670" end="01:22:38.320" style="s2">ever assert something something like</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.190" end="01:22:39.610" style="s2">freedom of will in the first place I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.320" end="01:22:43.360" style="s2">grant you it gives you a very different</p>

<p begin="01:24:59.410" end="01:25:06.540" style="s2">outside of consciousness that no amount</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.210" end="01:25:09.780" style="s2">of training can access it yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.540" end="01:25:12.280" style="s2">that said there&#39;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.780" end="01:25:14.470" style="s2">shallower that isn&#39;t typically conscious</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.280" end="01:25:18.280" style="s2">but can be accessed by consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.470" end="01:25:20.170" style="s2">with behavior could be psychedelics it</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.280" end="01:25:23.980" style="s2">could be sweat lodges it could be</p>

<p begin="01:25:23.980" end="01:25:28.930" style="s2">lots of things can alter where the</p>

<p begin="01:25:28.930" end="01:25:35.110" style="s2">conscious mind is actually it is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.680" end="01:25:38.680" style="s2">part of us that is capable of meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.110" end="01:25:41.560" style="s2">choice it does not have nearly as much</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.680" end="01:25:43.900" style="s2">choice as it imagines the experiments</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.560" end="01:25:45.490" style="s2">that tell us that in general when people</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.900" end="01:25:51.280" style="s2">believe they&#39;ve made a conscious choice</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.490" end="01:25:53.410" style="s2">that the actual choice is not preceded</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.280" end="01:25:55.750" style="s2">at least not preceded far enough by a</p>

<p begin="01:25:55.750" end="01:26:04.450" style="s2">caused by it that those things are</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.170" end="01:26:08.140" style="s2">troubling but the I mean really the</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.450" end="01:26:13.450" style="s2">question is can the mind that thinks</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.140" end="01:26:16.450" style="s2">it&#39;s choosing be trained to increase its</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.450" end="01:26:23.050" style="s2">own capacity to alter our path and can</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.450" end="01:26:26.020" style="s2">it well maybe that&#39;s yes yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.050" end="01:26:28.409" style="s2">think the this is where meaning comes</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.020" end="01:26:34.329" style="s2">back in 21</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.409" end="01:26:36.939" style="s2">you wonder how any of this could impact</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.329" end="01:26:38.889" style="s2">a life and spell the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.939" end="01:26:44.579" style="s2">a good life and a bad life or a life</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.889" end="01:26:48.549" style="s2">worth living in a and something less and</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.579" end="01:26:52.109" style="s2">you know how how the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.549" end="01:26:56.619" style="s2">you know how a deterministic picture of</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.109" end="01:26:58.659" style="s2">the universe may cancel or seemed to</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.619" end="01:27:00.999" style="s2">threaten some of what we think it makes</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.659" end="01:27:04.589" style="s2">life worth living or you know creativity</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.999" end="01:27:07.979" style="s2">even a concept worth entertaining I</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.589" end="01:27:12.399" style="s2">think it&#39;s all of it makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.979" end="01:27:14.949" style="s2">all of these distinctions can run</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.399" end="01:27:17.309" style="s2">through in the content in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.949" end="01:27:19.989" style="s2">psychological circumstance of a</p>

<p begin="01:27:25.389" end="01:27:30.909" style="s2">just there&#39;s there&#39;s a hierarchy of of</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.539" end="01:27:32.979" style="s2">what we want and value in each moment</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.909" end="01:27:35.049" style="s2">right and again we didn&#39;t we we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.979" end="01:27:39.159" style="s2">don&#39;t pick this hierarchy there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.049" end="01:27:41.589" style="s2">moments where we seem to struggle to</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.159" end="01:27:43.899" style="s2">change it or to adhere to deeper values</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.589" end="01:27:46.749" style="s2">when more superficial ones come online</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.899" end="01:27:49.509" style="s2">and seem to threaten them we can become</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.749" end="01:27:54.669" style="s2">at war we can we can fall into conflict</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.509" end="01:28:01.659" style="s2">with ourselves and freedom free you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.669" end="01:28:06.069" style="s2">small F freedom can can seem to depend</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.659" end="01:28:08.259" style="s2">on our being able to resolve those</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.069" end="01:28:11.319" style="s2">conflicts in ways that we don&#39;t regret</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.259" end="01:28:15.689" style="s2">right so if you let me take a very easy</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.319" end="01:28:19.149" style="s2">case and common one you&#39;re trying to eat</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.689" end="01:28:21.459" style="s2">more healthfully there&#39;s a range of</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.149" end="01:28:22.659" style="s2">foods you want to eat but you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.459" end="01:28:25.779" style="s2">to eat them now because your Trent</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.659" end="01:28:28.119" style="s2">you&#39;re now on a diet right and yet you</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.779" end="01:28:29.649" style="s2">know that in a few short hours you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.119" end="01:28:31.599" style="s2">going to be tempted to eat one of these</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.649" end="01:28:33.189" style="s2">foods that is now off your diet right</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.599" end="01:28:37.169" style="s2">and so you&#39;re in opposition with</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.189" end="01:28:39.549" style="s2">yourself and this notion of freedom</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.169" end="01:28:41.770" style="s2">right what would it mean to be free in</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.549" end="01:28:43.720" style="s2">this circumstance well freedom would</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.770" end="01:28:45.870" style="s2">be is it what would it mean to be not</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.720" end="01:28:49.420" style="s2">free at all to be just a mere automaton</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.870" end="01:28:51.850" style="s2">Matan your slave to your passions in</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.420" end="01:28:53.730" style="s2">this regard well then you say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.850" end="01:28:55.930" style="s2">going to be on a diet that lasts exactly</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.730" end="01:28:57.880" style="s2">14 minutes and then you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.930" end="01:29:00.250" style="s2">spoonful of ice cream in your mouth and</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.880" end="01:29:02.530" style="s2">you anything fuck I just screwed up</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.250" end="01:29:03.100" style="s2">again right oh yeah why can&#39;t I stay on</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.530" end="01:29:04.810" style="s2">my diet</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.100" end="01:29:06.070" style="s2">right you you part of you wants to be on</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.810" end="01:29:08.770" style="s2">a diet and part of you wants to eat ice</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.070" end="01:29:12.040" style="s2">cream and and the part that wants to to</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.770" end="01:29:16.210" style="s2">eat wins more or less every hour on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.040" end="01:29:18.850" style="s2">hour and yet the part we&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.210" end="01:29:20.740" style="s2">about the diet is the frustrated part</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.850" end="01:29:22.600" style="s2">which says I still want to be on a diet</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.740" end="01:29:24.640" style="s2">and I can&#39;t I can&#39;t manage it out for</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.600" end="01:29:27.040" style="s2">some reason I&#39;m not free how how can I</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.640" end="01:29:30.220" style="s2">get more freedom in the system right so</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.040" end="01:29:33.070" style="s2">that I can actually adhere to what is in</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.220" end="01:29:35.260" style="s2">fact a deeper value than just getting</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.070" end="01:29:40.270" style="s2">the next bite of ice cream one when the</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.260" end="01:29:42.100" style="s2">desire arises that dichotomy of and that</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.270" end="01:29:45.280" style="s2">hierarchy or a parent hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.100" end="01:29:47.980" style="s2">values again that picture can be</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.280" end="01:29:49.710" style="s2">completely deterministic or you can roll</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.980" end="01:29:55.780" style="s2">as many dice as you want to try to</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.710" end="01:29:58.360" style="s2">jiggle it around but there&#39;s still more</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.780" end="01:30:00.550" style="s2">and less satisfying ways to navigate all</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.360" end="01:30:03.640" style="s2">of that so if somebody comes in and says</p>

<p begin="01:34:06.190" end="01:34:09.550" style="s2">way yes then there&#39;s no there&#39;s no such</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.989" end="01:34:10.630" style="s2">thing as people that&#39;s what I mean like</p>

<p begin="01:34:12.730" end="01:34:17.320" style="s2">that&#39;s it there are no people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.829" end="01:34:20.020" style="s2">nothing there are as if people right</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.320" end="01:34:22.840" style="s2">okay but at the level at which we can</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.020" end="01:34:28.030" style="s2">dignify the the nouns and verbs that</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.840" end="01:34:29.530" style="s2">give us people and their their doings we</p>

<p begin="01:34:29.530" end="01:34:34.750" style="s2">that deterministically okay I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.170" end="01:34:36.550" style="s2">about anything if it&#39;s all determine</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.750" end="01:34:38.409" style="s2">look if we zoom all the way out and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.550" end="01:34:40.630" style="s2">really full determinism from the moment</p>

<p begin="01:34:45.369" end="01:34:52.059" style="s2">joke and the idean the ver no word has a</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.110" end="01:34:55.989" style="s2">meaning there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.059" end="01:34:58.329" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like billiard balls wondering</p>

<p begin="01:35:03.880" end="01:35:07.869" style="s2">think we know completely how but what we</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.070" end="01:35:11.679" style="s2">know is that there&#39;s more than one</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.869" end="01:35:15.750" style="s2">outcome possible and therefore I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.679" end="01:35:19.539" style="s2">know how it is that when a cheetah</p>

<p begin="01:39:29.580" end="01:39:34.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not in any way remotely like the</p>

<p begin="01:39:38.880" end="01:39:42.989" style="s2">mathematically if I say it has no order</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.739" end="01:39:44.400" style="s2">to it because obviously it&#39;s order is</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.989" end="01:39:45.060" style="s2">implied by the relationship of the</p>

<p begin="01:39:54.930" end="01:39:58.050" style="s2">get farther from the decimal place it</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.880" end="01:40:01.370" style="s2">just is it&#39;s a sequence of numbers</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.050" end="01:40:04.500" style="s2">that&#39;s unique yeah but on some level</p>

<p begin="01:40:07.860" end="01:40:13.560" style="s2">has in the local case apparently gotten</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.500" end="01:40:15.510" style="s2">fancier but there&#39;s also been there are</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.560" end="01:40:16.890" style="s2">you know Kenzi aids of simplicity there</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.510" end="01:40:19.620" style="s2">are instances where it goes the other</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.890" end="01:40:21.570" style="s2">direction yeah but in general it started</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.620" end="01:40:24.090" style="s2">at no complexity or yeah trivial</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.570" end="01:40:25.500" style="s2">complexity and reached amazing levels of</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.090" end="01:40:27.990" style="s2">complexity so there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.500" end="01:40:29.310" style="s2">ability to generate complexity and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.990" end="01:40:31.410" style="s2">only reason that works is because</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.310" end="01:40:35.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a cumulative process in it that</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.410" end="01:40:37.770" style="s2">has to do with competition and my point</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.970" end="01:40:39.420" style="s2">really and I don&#39;t know how I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.770" end="01:40:41.490" style="s2">how productive this is but my point is</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.420" end="01:40:43.350" style="s2">not that we can prove that we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.490" end="01:40:46.440" style="s2">a deterministic universe but that</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.350" end="01:40:52.950" style="s2">everything philosophical collapses</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.440" end="01:40:57.330" style="s2">downstream of that one claim well it it</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.950" end="01:41:00.090" style="s2">just depends on what part what what the</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.330" end="01:41:04.620" style="s2">framework is in which you are talking</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.090" end="01:41:07.110" style="s2">about anything because it&#39;s not in a</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.620" end="01:41:09.570" style="s2">deterministic universe you can still</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.110" end="01:41:12.900" style="s2">talk about crocodiles you just so you</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.570" end="01:41:15.120" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s like this this argument</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.900" end="01:41:17.100" style="s2">sounds like there&#39;s no such thing as a</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.120" end="01:41:20.070" style="s2">crocodile because all they&#39;re all a</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.100" end="01:41:23.220" style="s2">crocodile is is carbon and hydrogen and</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.070" end="01:41:24.990" style="s2">nitrogen and oxygen right so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.220" end="01:41:27.030" style="s2">talking about the the periodic table</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.990" end="01:41:29.610" style="s2">there are no crocodiles and there never</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.030" end="01:41:36.110" style="s2">will be crocodiles no no I am talking</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.610" end="01:41:38.820" style="s2">about a process that edits down</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.110" end="01:41:40.980" style="s2">populations to small numbers of</p>

<p begin="01:41:50.610" end="01:41:58.340" style="s2">to DNA but basically I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.230" end="01:42:00.350" style="s2">DNA my point again I&#39;m not arguing that</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.340" end="01:42:02.420" style="s2">deterministic universe is inconceivable</p>

<p begin="01:42:05.240" end="01:42:10.820" style="s2">joke if it&#39;s downstream of a totally</p>

<p begin="01:44:22.610" end="01:44:29.090" style="s2">the characters on screen have a</p>

<p begin="01:44:43.820" end="01:44:50.890" style="s2">right but you haven&#39;t seen this movie</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.290" end="01:44:53.750" style="s2">yet right right do you does the the</p>

<p begin="01:45:06.530" end="01:45:10.040" style="s2">talk about what happened in the movie</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.940" end="01:45:11.570" style="s2">because well nothing in fact happened is</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.040" end="01:45:15.650" style="s2">it so that&#39;s a good question and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.570" end="01:45:18.080" style="s2">going to take it seriously I have two</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.650" end="01:45:20.660" style="s2">different answers one is what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.080" end="01:45:23.930" style="s2">going on in the case of a movie is some</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.660" end="01:45:27.740" style="s2">artistic presence a person or several</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.930" end="01:45:29.240" style="s2">people have created scenarios and for</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.740" end="01:45:31.790" style="s2">whatever reason I&#39;ve decided that I want</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.240" end="01:45:34.460" style="s2">those scenarios to play out in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.790" end="01:45:37.090" style="s2">so that I can vicariously experience or</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.460" end="01:45:40.220" style="s2">witness or enjoy or whatever it is and</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.090" end="01:45:43.160" style="s2">so what I&#39;m allowing to do is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.220" end="01:45:46.100" style="s2">allowing this deterministic piece of</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.160" end="01:45:49.040" style="s2">footage spliced together to create an</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.100" end="01:45:50.960" style="s2">impression I am granting it access to</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.040" end="01:45:54.280" style="s2">parts of my brain and then presumably</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.960" end="01:45:56.690" style="s2">inside my brain I am temporarily</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.280" end="01:45:58.430" style="s2">erecting a little world that contains</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.690" end="01:46:00.410" style="s2">these characters I&#39;m allowing them to</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.430" end="01:46:01.910" style="s2">have identities I&#39;m allowing them to</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.410" end="01:46:03.200" style="s2">interact as they have been scripted in</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.910" end="01:46:07.700" style="s2">front of me as if I was sitting at a</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.200" end="01:46:11.590" style="s2">cafe and watching them interact and I am</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.700" end="01:46:14.000" style="s2">at no point delusional about where I am</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.590" end="01:46:18.380" style="s2">whether these things are real whether</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.000" end="01:46:21.560" style="s2">those are actors or the real people so</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.380" end="01:46:24.300" style="s2">I&#39;m simultaneously aware that the movie</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.560" end="01:46:26.310" style="s2">itself is completely deterministic</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.300" end="01:46:27.840" style="s2">already scripted at the point I sit down</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.310" end="01:46:31.320" style="s2">it&#39;s already over hmm</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.840" end="01:46:33.420" style="s2">but what it does is it feeds data into</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.320" end="01:46:36.480" style="s2">my mind that allows the story to unfold</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.420" end="01:46:37.920" style="s2">in real time in a coherent fashion I see</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.480" end="01:46:40.800" style="s2">no contradiction between those two</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.920" end="01:46:43.320" style="s2">things on the other hand I am sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.800" end="01:46:46.680" style="s2">aware that when I watch such a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.320" end="01:46:49.380" style="s2">I&#39;m sometimes aware for example of how</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.680" end="01:46:53.700" style="s2">far I am from the end of it and</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.380" end="01:46:56.070" style="s2">therefore what plot twists are now off</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.700" end="01:46:57.750" style="s2">the table right if I know there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.070" end="01:47:00.000" style="s2">four minutes left in the thing there are</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.750" end="01:47:02.130" style="s2">certain plot devices that would not be</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.000" end="01:47:04.110" style="s2">useful and so I cannot help myself but</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.130" end="01:47:06.630" style="s2">to know that those things won&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.110" end="01:47:08.460" style="s2">or if a character that I think is</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.630" end="01:47:10.739" style="s2">economically very important to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.460" end="01:47:11.700" style="s2">franchise has been lost there&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.739" end="01:47:14.219" style="s2">of me that thinks you know they probably</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.700" end="01:47:15.780" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t kill that character off so</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.219" end="01:47:19.770" style="s2">quickly and then something like Game of</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.780" end="01:47:21.719" style="s2">Thrones takes that assumption and uses</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.770" end="01:47:23.430" style="s2">it against you by killing off important</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.719" end="01:47:26.219" style="s2">characters which you don&#39;t see coming</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.430" end="01:47:28.230" style="s2">yeah but anyway yeah so I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.219" end="01:47:34.350" style="s2">how well that answers your question well</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.230" end="01:47:42.770" style="s2">I&#39;m just isn&#39;t your moment to moment</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.350" end="01:47:46.890" style="s2">experience of your life compatible with</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.770" end="01:47:48.300" style="s2">this experience of watching a movie so</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.890" end="01:47:50.100" style="s2">that like I say it&#39;s like it&#39;s like in a</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.300" end="01:47:53.790" style="s2">movie we&#39;re still talking you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.100" end="01:47:55.290" style="s2">say of a movie you can&#39;t talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.790" end="01:47:56.960" style="s2">characters you can&#39;t talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.290" end="01:48:01.950" style="s2">people you can&#39;t talk about events</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.960" end="01:48:03.660" style="s2">because however you look at it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.950" end="01:48:06.900" style="s2">nothing there the experience is just</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.660" end="01:48:08.820" style="s2">light on a wall there&#39;s nothing&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.900" end="01:48:10.980" style="s2">moving we&#39;re talking about still frames</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.820" end="01:48:12.810" style="s2">that are that are moving at 24 frames a</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.980" end="01:48:14.790" style="s2">second or we&#39;re just talking about</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.810" end="01:48:16.469" style="s2">pixels or what I so all of that is</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.790" end="01:48:22.530" style="s2">deflationary right there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.469" end="01:48:24.719" style="s2">there there and conceptually there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.530" end="01:48:27.270" style="s2">there&#39;s zero degrees of freedom because</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.719" end="01:48:29.310" style="s2">it&#39;s you know the the the last scene</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.270" end="01:48:33.680" style="s2">exists just as much as the first scene</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.310" end="01:48:36.540" style="s2">there&#39;s actually no causal properties</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.680" end="01:48:37.350" style="s2">displayed between apparent events</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.540" end="01:48:40.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.350" end="01:48:42.090" style="s2">again it&#39;s all scripted right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.320" end="01:48:44.040" style="s2">not like an any one thing caused</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.090" end="01:48:47.190" style="s2">everything&#39;s been arranged to seem like</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.040" end="01:48:49.680" style="s2">it was causing each subsequent thing but</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.190" end="01:48:52.610" style="s2">it was everything was put in place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.680" end="01:48:56.220" style="s2">a still life as Hawes was a studio and</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.610" end="01:48:58.080" style="s2">artists and business interests the cause</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.220" end="01:48:59.760" style="s2">was not what unfolds on the wall yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.080" end="01:49:03.200" style="s2">and so yeah but the experience of</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.760" end="01:49:06.660" style="s2">watching a movie is compatible with</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.200" end="01:49:08.010" style="s2">making all of the distinctions we want</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.660" end="01:49:10.380" style="s2">to make about human events and</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.010" end="01:49:12.900" style="s2">conversations and motives and how things</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.380" end="01:49:15.780" style="s2">looked and felt and the emotions</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.900" end="01:49:16.380" style="s2">displayed and when is certainly when</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.780" end="01:49:19.650" style="s2">it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.380" end="01:49:23.760" style="s2">you&#39;re so taken in by the illusion of it</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.650" end="01:49:25.800" style="s2">that it seems not only like real life it</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.760" end="01:49:29.400" style="s2">seems more real than real life in some</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.800" end="01:49:32.730" style="s2">sense because you&#39;re you&#39;re able your</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.400" end="01:49:35.880" style="s2">relationship to it is such that you can</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.730" end="01:49:39.840" style="s2">in in some strange way you can get</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.880" end="01:49:41.880" style="s2">closer to the drama of human events then</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.840" end="01:49:43.470" style="s2">you can ever afford to do in real life</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.880" end="01:49:45.420" style="s2">when you&#39;re being seen by the other</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.470" end="01:49:46.860" style="s2">people in the room right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.420" end="01:49:48.870" style="s2">what&#39;s I mean the vote the pure</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.860" end="01:49:52.680" style="s2">voyeurism of watching a movie is what</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.870" end="01:49:55.980" style="s2">what&#39;s so seductive about it but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.680" end="01:49:59.700" style="s2">struck by the fact that real life you</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.980" end="01:50:04.610" style="s2">know this conversation is totally</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.700" end="01:50:07.560" style="s2">compatible with zero degrees of freedom</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.610" end="01:50:08.430" style="s2">in its unfolding no it&#39;s formally</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.560" end="01:50:11.310" style="s2">compatible</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.430" end="01:50:12.870" style="s2">well it&#39;s we cannot prove that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.310" end="01:50:16.230" style="s2">not what&#39;s going on but it&#39;s also but</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.870" end="01:50:18.530" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenologically as the</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.230" end="01:50:21.270" style="s2">experience of it is compatible with it</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.530" end="01:50:23.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like I don&#39;t even think it is but I</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.270" end="01:50:25.290" style="s2">can&#39;t formally rule it out that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.580" end="01:50:27.090" style="s2">would say so let me let me try it let me</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.290" end="01:50:28.620" style="s2">try this on a different way someplace I</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.090" end="01:50:31.110" style="s2">think it&#39;s closer to home for you based</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.620" end="01:50:36.980" style="s2">on the examples you use in your your</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.110" end="01:50:40.650" style="s2">books there&#39;s a cemetery near my house</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.980" end="01:50:43.320" style="s2">my kids and my wife and I ride through</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.650" end="01:50:46.170" style="s2">it with some regularity on our bikes and</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.320" end="01:50:48.150" style="s2">electric unicycles and stuff one day my</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.170" end="01:50:50.580" style="s2">wife and I were biking back through it</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.150" end="01:50:51.130" style="s2">and I was shocked in general you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.580" end="01:50:54.370" style="s2">see any</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.130" end="01:50:58.630" style="s2">funereal activity but there was a</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.370" end="01:51:03.280" style="s2">funeral in process two people clearly</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.630" end="01:51:05.770" style="s2">parents burying a tiny casket carrying</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.280" end="01:51:10.690" style="s2">pall bearers of this tiny casket on this</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.770" end="01:51:13.480" style="s2">hill and it shocked me a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.690" end="01:51:16.690" style="s2">there was something so much of the story</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.480" end="01:51:18.250" style="s2">was obvious from what I was seeing</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.690" end="01:51:20.380" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t nail it down a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.250" end="01:51:22.929" style="s2">percent but it was like one frame was</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.380" end="01:51:28.210" style="s2">sufficient yeah it&#39;s it reminds me of</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.929" end="01:51:30.400" style="s2">the there was a contest for one one</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.210" end="01:51:36.670" style="s2">sentence novels yeah I think an example</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.400" end="01:51:40.030" style="s2">is like baby shoes for sale unworn or</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.670" end="01:51:43.320" style="s2">something like that yeah yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.030" end="01:51:47.409" style="s2">it&#39;s a Hemingway actually is baby shoes</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.320" end="01:51:50.020" style="s2">for sale never used or something yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.409" end="01:51:54.639" style="s2">fact a friend of mine has run a contest</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.020" end="01:51:59.889" style="s2">for six-word stories in his magazine but</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.639" end="01:52:02.280" style="s2">anyway some days later I went back to</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.889" end="01:52:06.400" style="s2">look at what was going on on that hill</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.280" end="01:52:08.199" style="s2">because other night Heather had not seen</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.400" end="01:52:09.610" style="s2">the same thing and so I wanted to figure</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.199" end="01:52:13.719" style="s2">out what I had seen so that we could at</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.610" end="01:52:20.080" style="s2">least understand it and it turned out</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.719" end="01:52:27.630" style="s2">that entire Hill was dedicated to very</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.080" end="01:52:30.969" style="s2">young children stillborn children and</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.630" end="01:52:34.270" style="s2">the reason I raise it here is that in a</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.969" end="01:52:36.760" style="s2">completely deterministic universe what</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.270" end="01:52:39.040" style="s2">the hell is going on with that hell can</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.760" end="01:52:44.380" style="s2">you imagine a completely deterministic</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.040" end="01:52:48.420" style="s2">universe in which babies are created it</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.380" end="01:52:51.310" style="s2">brought all the way to the point of</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.420" end="01:52:53.920" style="s2">birth or shortly thereafter only to</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.310" end="01:52:57.000" style="s2">torture their parents with their loss</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.920" end="01:52:59.650" style="s2">and put their parents through the</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.000" end="01:53:01.849" style="s2">agonizing decision to either treat this</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.650" end="01:53:04.849" style="s2">as the death of</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.849" end="01:53:07.369" style="s2">a human or two fail to treat it that way</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.849" end="01:53:09.590" style="s2">I mean that Hill to me makes no</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.369" end="01:53:12.290" style="s2">philosophical sense in a deterministic</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.590" end="01:53:15.230" style="s2">universe in a non deterministic universe</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.290" end="01:53:20.060" style="s2">that Hill is a tragedy but I understand</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.230" end="01:53:28.639" style="s2">it well no because I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.060" end="01:53:32.960" style="s2">as perverse to imagine that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.639" end="01:53:38.440" style="s2">chance in that it&#39;s I mean the only</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.960" end="01:53:41.860" style="s2">thing as perverse as mere clockwork is</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.440" end="01:53:45.380" style="s2">just disparities and good and bad luck</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.860" end="01:53:47.960" style="s2">right if it&#39;s just luck that spells the</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.380" end="01:53:50.570" style="s2">difference between having a happy long</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.960" end="01:53:54.380" style="s2">and happy life you know with with you</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.570" end="01:53:59.469" style="s2">know surrounded by loving friends and</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.380" end="01:54:03.409" style="s2">family and colleagues and being in a</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.469" end="01:54:04.940" style="s2">14-inch casket right that doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.409" end="01:54:07.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t redeem that doesn&#39;t reclaim our</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.940" end="01:54:09.199" style="s2">our sense of the way things should be oh</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.280" end="01:54:12.429" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t reclaim any goodness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.199" end="01:54:17.480" style="s2">still why as I say it&#39;s a tragedy but</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.429" end="01:54:21.590" style="s2">its meaning is radically altered the</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.480" end="01:54:23.690" style="s2">idea that those children might have</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.590" end="01:54:25.730" style="s2">grown into adults that was at least a</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.690" end="01:54:28.070" style="s2">possibility it was on the menu of</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.730" end="01:54:31.010" style="s2">possibilities and something went wrong</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.070" end="01:54:36.099" style="s2">but but if that something that went</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.010" end="01:54:41.900" style="s2">wrong was the the flap of a butterfly&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.099" end="01:54:43.369" style="s2">wings a continent away right again as a</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.900" end="01:54:47.150" style="s2">bad analogy because now I&#39;m invoking</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.369" end="01:54:50.270" style="s2">chaos and chaos as deterministic but if</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.150" end="01:54:52.820" style="s2">if it&#39;s a pure dice roll somewhere in</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.270" end="01:54:59.119" style="s2">the ether that is causing the difference</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.820" end="01:55:02.540" style="s2">rather than mere determinism then it</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.119" end="01:55:04.159" style="s2">just seems to me it&#39;s just as morally</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.540" end="01:55:07.540" style="s2">again nothing turns on this because</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.159" end="01:55:11.840" style="s2">whether or not reality is morally</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.540" end="01:55:13.489" style="s2">inscrutable or unfathomable you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.840" end="01:55:15.560" style="s2">this is nowhere written that it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.489" end="01:55:16.970" style="s2">be so right I mean we just</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.560" end="01:55:19.430" style="s2">we&#39;re just now talking about our</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.970" end="01:55:22.610" style="s2">preferences no but I guess what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.430" end="01:55:26.390" style="s2">getting at is first so I can put myself</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.610" end="01:55:28.790" style="s2">easily in the position of parents in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.390" end="01:55:30.770" style="s2">two scenarios here parents of a child</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.790" end="01:55:32.300" style="s2">who might have lived but didn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.770" end="01:55:33.710" style="s2">parents of a child who was never going</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.300" end="01:55:36.380" style="s2">to live because that was written since</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.710" end="01:55:39.200" style="s2">the beginning of the universe right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.380" end="01:55:42.350" style="s2">very angry at that second scenario that</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.200" end="01:55:44.030" style="s2">first scenario fills me with sorrow but</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.350" end="01:55:46.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t have anyone to be angry about</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.030" end="01:55:49.460" style="s2">bad luck exists and it sucks when it</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.790" end="01:55:52.550" style="s2">afflicts you but it&#39;s not the same cruel</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.460" end="01:55:55.550" style="s2">joke as a universe that decided to award</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.550" end="01:55:59.000" style="s2">a child to you and then rob you of it</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.550" end="01:56:01.700" style="s2">without accept in that universe you</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.000" end="01:56:03.970" style="s2">don&#39;t have any illusion that you could</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.700" end="01:56:06.260" style="s2">have or should have more importantly</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.970" end="01:56:08.270" style="s2">done something differently well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.260" end="01:56:09.560" style="s2">no question that there&#39;s a burden along</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.270" end="01:56:10.940" style="s2">with the universe in which multiple</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.560" end="01:56:12.290" style="s2">things can happen that when things go</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.940" end="01:56:13.760" style="s2">wrong you got to ask what role you</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.290" end="01:56:16.460" style="s2">played in it there&#39;s no no question</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.760" end="01:56:19.250" style="s2">about that well you do have to ask it in</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.460" end="01:56:21.230" style="s2">a deterministic one it&#39;s just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.250" end="01:56:25.100" style="s2">at a different level it&#39;s like your</p>

<p begin="01:56:28.070" end="01:56:34.280" style="s2">right like you know did this bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.730" end="01:56:37.280" style="s2">happen because I&#39;m the sort of person</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.280" end="01:56:41.360" style="s2">who is you know negligent or drives</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.280" end="01:56:43.820" style="s2">drunk or something right and yet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.360" end="01:56:46.340" style="s2">no place to stand where there&#39;s no place</p>

<p begin="01:56:46.340" end="01:56:51.770" style="s2">to happen given the way the universe was</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.830" end="01:56:55.310" style="s2">at yes but I don&#39;t know what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.770" end="01:56:58.100" style="s2">ask I mean even a word like ask seems to</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.310" end="01:56:59.840" style="s2">me ridiculous in the context where it is</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.100" end="01:57:01.820" style="s2">just another billiard ball ricocheting</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.840" end="01:57:04.160" style="s2">off just another rail the issue though</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.820" end="01:57:08.210" style="s2">is that is that randomness doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.160" end="01:57:10.130" style="s2">reclaim what people the the meaning that</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.210" end="01:57:12.230" style="s2">people think they&#39;re going to lose here</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.130" end="01:57:14.930" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t recover it but it is</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.230" end="01:57:16.850" style="s2">necessary to recovering it it is not</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.930" end="01:57:19.880" style="s2">sufficient but it is necessary that</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.850" end="01:57:21.890" style="s2">would be my point if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.880" end="01:57:23.750" style="s2">randomness you can&#39;t recover it if there</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.890" end="01:57:27.380" style="s2">is randomness you might not recover it</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.750" end="01:57:29.540" style="s2">but at least the possibility exists</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.380" end="01:57:32.000" style="s2">well it&#39;s just well yeah I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.540" end="01:57:34.400" style="s2">see that I mean again I don&#39;t see I</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.000" end="01:57:36.020" style="s2">don&#39;t see the emotional stakes here or</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.400" end="01:57:40.810" style="s2">the psychological stakes quite the way</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.020" end="01:57:43.969" style="s2">you do they I see because that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.810" end="01:57:46.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a significant consequence I mean</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.969" end="01:57:50.000" style="s2">really the only parameter that that is</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.639" end="01:57:52.790" style="s2">of consequence here is the fact that we</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.000" end="01:57:55.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next</p>

<p begin="01:59:10.510" end="01:59:14.780" style="s2">there&#39;s simply what happens and what</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.920" end="01:59:18.099" style="s2">happens has this element of this</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.780" end="01:59:23.300" style="s2">continuous element of surprise and</p>

<p begin="01:59:23.300" end="01:59:30.290" style="s2">apparent choices are in fact the</p>

<p begin="01:59:32.719" end="01:59:40.099" style="s2">right so my choice to eat the the ice</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.099" end="01:59:41.090" style="s2">cream is that is the thing that ended my</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.099" end="01:59:42.679" style="s2">diet at</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.090" end="01:59:44.840" style="s2">moment right like I could have been the</p>

<p begin="01:59:44.840" end="01:59:50.449" style="s2">yet again right so and then a month from</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.349" end="01:59:53.030" style="s2">now after I&#39;ve gone to you know Chaco</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.449" end="01:59:54.830" style="s2">willing boot camp and I have a different</p>

<p begin="01:59:54.830" end="01:59:58.369" style="s2">everything else now I&#39;m the guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.929" end="02:00:00.409" style="s2">cleared out all the ice cream in the</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.369" end="02:00:03.650" style="s2">house now now I&#39;m the guy who&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.409" end="02:00:05.239" style="s2">diet and lo and behold I&#39;m losing weight</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.650" end="02:00:07.010" style="s2">and you know in terms it turns out that</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.239" end="02:00:10.369" style="s2">my body functions the way anybody does</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.010" end="02:00:12.380" style="s2">and and physics matters again there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.369" end="02:00:13.820" style="s2">free will intruding here but I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.380" end="02:00:20.980" style="s2">what I&#39;m having this very different</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.820" end="02:00:26.119" style="s2">experience and it&#39;s it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.980" end="02:00:28.270" style="s2">intelligible and compatible with our</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.119" end="02:00:31.940" style="s2">ordinary intuitions about choice and</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.270" end="02:00:34.159" style="s2">probability given the fact that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.940" end="02:00:36.920" style="s2">know what&#39;s gonna happen next right and</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.159" end="02:00:39.440" style="s2">that would that would be true in a fully</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.920" end="02:00:43.730" style="s2">in a fully clockwork deterministic</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.440" end="02:00:45.050" style="s2">universe I you know you don&#39;t you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.730" end="02:00:45.980" style="s2">know what you&#39;re gonna think next right</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.050" end="02:00:48.260" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re gonna think</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.980" end="02:00:51.710" style="s2">next and we&#39;re both gonna hear what you</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.260" end="02:00:53.270" style="s2">say next well again my objection here is</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.710" end="02:00:55.489" style="s2">philosophical I can&#39;t know if I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.270" end="02:00:57.590" style="s2">to completed completely deterministic</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.489" end="02:00:59.210" style="s2">universe all I can know is that none of</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.590" end="02:01:01.250" style="s2">the things that I think I know make any</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.210" end="02:01:03.170" style="s2">sense in the way I think I know them</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.250" end="02:01:03.679" style="s2">even the idea of knowing that makes no</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.170" end="02:01:05.360" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.679" end="02:01:08.690" style="s2">well that they wouldn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.360" end="02:01:10.880" style="s2">if you could experience the universe</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.690" end="02:01:13.460" style="s2">from that point of view right they would</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.880" end="02:01:15.800" style="s2">make sense given that you apparently can</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.460" end="02:01:19.699" style="s2">only experience the universe from this</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.800" end="02:01:21.770" style="s2">point of view so look can we agree that</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.699" end="02:01:24.020" style="s2">if the universe were some aliens</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.770" end="02:01:25.610" style="s2">screensaver that they could have rigged</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.020" end="02:01:27.080" style="s2">it in a completely deterministic fashion</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.610" end="02:01:29.150" style="s2">and that it could have all of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.080" end="02:01:31.219" style="s2">creatures that I know and love in it and</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.150" end="02:01:33.489" style="s2">I could be a character and you could be</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.219" end="02:01:36.170" style="s2">a character and we could be as</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.489" end="02:01:39.290" style="s2">determined as the characters in a in a</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.170" end="02:01:41.300" style="s2">film that there&#39;s nothing against the</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.290" end="02:01:42.710" style="s2">law of physics that prevents that other</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.300" end="02:01:45.409" style="s2">than I would argue that the outer</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.710" end="02:01:46.790" style="s2">universe has to not be deterministic in</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.409" end="02:01:49.400" style="s2">order for that to have come to be but</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.790" end="02:01:50.540" style="s2">let&#39;s be agnostic about that point yeah</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.400" end="02:01:54.230" style="s2">well no but I was making a slightly</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.540" end="02:02:02.900" style="s2">different point which is that the the</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.230" end="02:02:07.480" style="s2">rolls on the hill for young kids in any</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.900" end="02:02:12.520" style="s2">one of these universes carries the same</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.480" end="02:02:17.390" style="s2">tragedy and can be parsed from the same</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.520" end="02:02:21.800" style="s2">set of psychological intuitions in any</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.390" end="02:02:25.880" style="s2">of these universes simply because we as</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.800" end="02:02:27.500" style="s2">parents or they as parents never knew</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.880" end="02:02:29.240" style="s2">what was gonna happen next</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.500" end="02:02:31.910" style="s2">couldn&#39;t know what was gonna happen next</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.240" end="02:02:34.490" style="s2">all right so it&#39;s like we&#39;re just we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.910" end="02:02:38.060" style="s2">at this point in the movie whether this</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.490" end="02:02:41.270" style="s2">is really a movie or or it&#39;s really or</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.060" end="02:02:42.980" style="s2">the stakes are really real right whether</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.270" end="02:02:45.830" style="s2">this the movies already been shot or</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.980" end="02:02:47.510" style="s2">we&#39;re shooting it now right this is a</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.830" end="02:02:49.010" style="s2">this is actually that this is this is a</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.510" end="02:02:52.520" style="s2">probably better use of the analogy</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.010" end="02:02:55.220" style="s2">there&#39;s the imagine a documentary right</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.520" end="02:02:57.860" style="s2">where what&#39;s being filmed is not</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.220" end="02:02:59.990" style="s2">scripted it&#39;s really being shut you know</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.860" end="02:03:04.070" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s real life you know on film</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.990" end="02:03:05.870" style="s2">right so the question is are we are we</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.070" end="02:03:08.300" style="s2">shooting this now or has this already</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.870" end="02:03:15.530" style="s2">been shot on some level that different</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.300" end="02:03:18.530" style="s2">yeah and from the point of view of from</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.530" end="02:03:20.450" style="s2">the point of view of everyone who</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.530" end="02:03:22.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.450" end="02:03:24.350" style="s2">right the fact that it might be possible</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.550" end="02:03:27.140" style="s2">to know what&#39;s gonna happen next or what</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.350" end="02:03:30.350" style="s2">what you know to see the the last scene</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.140" end="02:03:32.120" style="s2">before you see the first scene well okay</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.350" end="02:03:35.210" style="s2">that&#39;s philosophically interesting to</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.120" end="02:03:38.660" style="s2">entertain right and let&#39;s get the</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.210" end="02:03:42.040" style="s2">physicists to work on on the problem of</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.660" end="02:03:42.040" style="s2">whether or not that&#39;s so but</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.340" end="02:03:46.990" style="s2">subjectively and in the space in which</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.170" end="02:03:50.630" style="s2">we try to make meaning out of our lives</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.990" end="02:03:52.720" style="s2">the thing that matters is we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.630" end="02:03:56.450" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen next and at each</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.720" end="02:03:59.870" style="s2">point along the way we have to act right</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.450" end="02:04:02.720" style="s2">we have this apparent burden of deciding</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.870" end="02:04:07.610" style="s2">what to have for lunch right and we we</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.720" end="02:04:10.730" style="s2">go left or right by turns and</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.610" end="02:04:15.800" style="s2">the process is subjectively inscrutable</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.730" end="02:04:17.420" style="s2">and and it&#39;s bound to be so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.800" end="02:04:20.660" style="s2">the space in which we make our lives and</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.420" end="02:04:25.960" style="s2">so and I don&#39;t see how determinism</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.660" end="02:04:34.550" style="s2">randomness some combination thereof ever</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.960" end="02:04:38.390" style="s2">changes the the maybe unless it changes</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.550" end="02:04:43.360" style="s2">that moment to moment reality where you</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.390" end="02:04:46.700" style="s2">know one philosophical truth being so</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.360" end="02:04:51.410" style="s2">gives you a different picture of the</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.700" end="02:04:53.770" style="s2">future essentially I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.410" end="02:04:56.210" style="s2">see how it matters I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.770" end="02:04:57.800" style="s2">bizarre it&#39;s bizarre to think that the</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.210" end="02:05:00.140" style="s2">big picture is bizarre to think about</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.800" end="02:05:04.060" style="s2">whatever is true I mean III think I I</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.140" end="02:05:07.490" style="s2">think I feel that randomness is is</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.060" end="02:05:09.290" style="s2">stranger than you you think it is but so</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.490" end="02:05:12.050" style="s2">I&#39;m so the the comparison between</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.290" end="02:05:14.120" style="s2">determinism and randomness you know or</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.050" end="02:05:17.060" style="s2">determinism plus randomness doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.120" end="02:05:19.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t as invidious in my brain as it is</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.060" end="02:05:25.880" style="s2">in yours because I both are just yeah</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.820" end="02:05:28.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve been possible to think about but we</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.880" end="02:05:31.160" style="s2">have this we have this moment right and</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.220" end="02:05:34.220" style="s2">then things keep appearing and among</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.160" end="02:05:39.020" style="s2">those things are thoughts intentions</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.220" end="02:05:45.490" style="s2">desires preferences and it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.020" end="02:05:48.020" style="s2">basis of this roiling ocean of</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.490" end="02:05:51.010" style="s2">phenomenology that we make our lives</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.020" end="02:05:55.610" style="s2">right and so and no one who has a kid</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.010" end="02:05:58.070" style="s2">knows what that kid will be like as an</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.610" end="02:06:00.290" style="s2">adult or whether he or she will reach</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.070" end="02:06:03.730" style="s2">adulthood right that&#39;s that&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.290" end="02:06:07.460" style="s2">that is built into the circumstance and</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.730" end="02:06:10.010" style="s2">any any story we tell ourselves about</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.460" end="02:06:11.350" style="s2">what was going to happen what was bound</p>

<p begin="02:06:20.460" end="02:06:25.980" style="s2">we had to act under uncertainty in every</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.770" end="02:06:27.900" style="s2">in every moment and still do well you</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.980" end="02:06:29.969" style="s2">know I I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only</p>

<p begin="02:06:39.840" end="02:06:44.429" style="s2">those things lose all actual meaning not</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.110" end="02:06:45.810" style="s2">that you wouldn&#39;t be saying them and not</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.429" end="02:06:46.920" style="s2">that I wouldn&#39;t be hearing them and that</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.810" end="02:06:48.510" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t be you know there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.920" end="02:06:53.340" style="s2">choice about any of it but they lose all</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.510" end="02:06:55.920" style="s2">actual meaning up in many different</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.340" end="02:06:57.480" style="s2">frames I mean they lose meaning again</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.920" end="02:06:59.790" style="s2">just if you&#39;re gonna use the periodic</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.480" end="02:07:03.000" style="s2">table as well as your frame they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.790" end="02:07:06.929" style="s2">lose meaning the fact is humans evolved</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.000" end="02:07:09.770" style="s2">they evolved to use language with each</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.929" end="02:07:14.190" style="s2">other to exchange abstract ideas across</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.770" end="02:07:17.489" style="s2">open space so that they could reside in</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.190" end="02:07:20.280" style="s2">multiple brains simultaneously and their</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.489" end="02:07:22.080" style="s2">implications could be discussed well no</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.280" end="02:07:24.810" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no but you&#39;re smuggling</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.080" end="02:07:26.640" style="s2">purpose into the air which need not</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.810" end="02:07:28.890" style="s2">exist and there&#39;s the fact that this is</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.640" end="02:07:29.909" style="s2">all happening but we didn&#39;t do this so</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.890" end="02:07:31.949" style="s2">that we could do this</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.909" end="02:07:34.650" style="s2">we didn&#39;t it&#39;s not intentional but</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.949" end="02:07:37.890" style="s2">evolution built our capacity to exchange</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.650" end="02:07:39.030" style="s2">abstract ideas across open space for a</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.890" end="02:07:40.530" style="s2">reason which is that it gave us</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.030" end="02:07:42.360" style="s2">competitive advantage over creatures</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.530" end="02:07:43.949" style="s2">that had less of that ability okay but</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.360" end="02:07:46.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a different reason that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.949" end="02:07:48.780" style="s2">there&#39;s no teleology in this system this</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.770" end="02:07:51.420" style="s2">is this can still be pushed from behind</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.780" end="02:07:52.290" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s effectively this is this</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.420" end="02:07:55.860" style="s2">this works</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.290" end="02:07:58.219" style="s2">like there&#39;s a survivor bias here it was</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.860" end="02:08:01.370" style="s2">a massive surveillance bias to provide</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.219" end="02:08:04.350" style="s2">advantage in a universe in which</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.370" end="02:08:06.510" style="s2">advantage appears to make a difference</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.350" end="02:08:08.820" style="s2">between success and failure which to me</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.510" end="02:08:10.830" style="s2">requires that some other outcome was</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.820" end="02:08:13.050" style="s2">possible were it not for the capacities</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.830" end="02:08:15.179" style="s2">in question that&#39;s yeah I mean I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.050" end="02:08:17.280" style="s2">see that again now we&#39;re sort of going</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.179" end="02:08:20.190" style="s2">around the same track here but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.280" end="02:08:21.989" style="s2">see the necessity of supposing that I</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.190" end="02:08:24.179" style="s2">mean I think that may in fact be true</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.989" end="02:08:25.560" style="s2">right I mean possibility you know that</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.179" end="02:08:29.639" style="s2">stands a very good chance of being a</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.560" end="02:08:33.820" style="s2">real thing right but it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.639" end="02:08:36.520" style="s2">consider how reality how you&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.820" end="02:08:37.960" style="s2">- look if it weren&#39;t a thing yeah if</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.520" end="02:08:39.820" style="s2">there&#39;s simply just what happened I</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.960" end="02:08:41.290" style="s2">would expect it to work the same way but</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.820" end="02:08:42.880" style="s2">if I could stand outside of it I would</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.290" end="02:08:45.940" style="s2">say that&#39;s a ridiculously cruel joke</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.880" end="02:08:47.110" style="s2">okay and yeah you know if this is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.940" end="02:08:49.840" style="s2">say that this is a deterministic</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.110" end="02:08:52.630" style="s2">universe and that some parents somewhere</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.840" end="02:08:54.970" style="s2">can&#39;t help but listen in to this podcast</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.630" end="02:08:57.190" style="s2">and then they lose a child and they end</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.970" end="02:09:00.400" style="s2">up burying the child on that hill and</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.190" end="02:09:03.760" style="s2">they end up thinking you mean that child</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.400" end="02:09:06.550" style="s2">was only ever a cruel joke that that</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.760" end="02:09:10.270" style="s2">that child was never there was no</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.550" end="02:09:13.240" style="s2">possibility of it becoming a person I</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.270" end="02:09:16.930" style="s2">would think that person standing on that</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.240" end="02:09:18.970" style="s2">hill would have a right to be resentful</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.930" end="02:09:21.760" style="s2">of a universe in which that was the only</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.970" end="02:09:25.750" style="s2">option in a way bad luck okay but there</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.760" end="02:09:28.240" style="s2">so it may why why cash in your chips</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.750" end="02:09:30.670" style="s2">there I mean there&#39;s so there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.240" end="02:09:32.920" style="s2">other reasons to be resentful of a</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.670" end="02:09:35.230" style="s2">universe even if you think there are</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.920" end="02:09:36.250" style="s2">degrees of this universe even if you</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.230" end="02:09:40.750" style="s2">think there are massive degrees of</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.250" end="02:09:43.060" style="s2">freedom and there&#39;s there are different</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.750" end="02:09:44.500" style="s2">ways to interpret even that moment I</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.060" end="02:09:46.960" style="s2">mean like a cruel joke is just one</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.500" end="02:09:49.390" style="s2">provincial framing to put on the nature</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.960" end="02:09:50.950" style="s2">of reality that when when a million are</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.390" end="02:09:52.630" style="s2">available let&#39;s write let&#39;s try another</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.950" end="02:09:57.180" style="s2">one that I think maybe hits more</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.630" end="02:10:00.280" style="s2">squarely on the head hmm you use in I</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.180" end="02:10:01.810" style="s2">think the moral landscape maybe not sure</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.280" end="02:10:05.140" style="s2">one of your books you use the example of</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.810" end="02:10:08.050" style="s2">locked-in syndrome mmm-hmm this is a</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.140" end="02:10:11.260" style="s2">situation in which somebody&#39;s conscious</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.050" end="02:10:14.950" style="s2">mind is awake and functioning normally</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.260" end="02:10:17.170" style="s2">but they are left with no power to</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.950" end="02:10:19.780" style="s2">communicate with the outside world or</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.170" end="02:10:22.990" style="s2">act in any way they can&#39;t raise a limb</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.780" end="02:10:25.540" style="s2">or anything like that truly one of the</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.990" end="02:10:27.970" style="s2">most frightening things that could</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.540" end="02:10:29.470" style="s2">happen you have a person especially in</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.970" end="02:10:31.270" style="s2">light of the fact that the outside world</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.470" end="02:10:33.430" style="s2">might be unaware that that is what has</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.270" end="02:10:35.290" style="s2">happened to you yeah and in previous</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.430" end="02:10:37.030" style="s2">periods in history would have certainly</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.290" end="02:10:38.590" style="s2">been aware but it certainly would have</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.030" end="02:10:40.360" style="s2">been unaware that that was what was</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.590" end="02:10:44.440" style="s2">happening to you yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.360" end="02:10:47.290" style="s2">as terrifying as it gets yeah I believe</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.440" end="02:10:51.190" style="s2">that we are all in some</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.290" end="02:10:53.050" style="s2">since in that syndrome if we are in a</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.190" end="02:10:55.090" style="s2">completely deterministic universe and</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.050" end="02:10:57.730" style="s2">yet have something that functions as a</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.090" end="02:10:59.739" style="s2">consciousness if we are absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.730" end="02:11:03.270" style="s2">trapped on a trajectory and there is no</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.739" end="02:11:06.280" style="s2">hope of in any way deviating it we our</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.270" end="02:11:07.720" style="s2">conscious Minds trapped as conscious</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.280" end="02:11:10.900" style="s2">minds on trajectories in which</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.720" end="02:11:13.000" style="s2">consciousness has essentially no meaning</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.900" end="02:11:14.739" style="s2">other than yeah but the thing is we</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.000" end="02:11:18.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know how good the movie is going</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.739" end="02:11:22.060" style="s2">to get right we&#39;re the movie right and</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.220" end="02:11:25.570" style="s2">it&#39;s and it could already be shot but we</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.060" end="02:11:29.040" style="s2">the final scene could just be the the</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.570" end="02:11:32.550" style="s2">the most spectacular firework display</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.040" end="02:11:34.450" style="s2">you could be could be could not only be</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.550" end="02:11:36.370" style="s2">stranger than we imagine it could be</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.450" end="02:11:39.580" style="s2">stranger than we can&#39;t imagine right</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.370" end="02:11:42.040" style="s2">that that seems to me</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.580" end="02:11:44.040" style="s2">and I know you know you&#39;re you&#39;re none</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.040" end="02:11:48.760" style="s2">of these things but it seems to me</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.040" end="02:11:51.610" style="s2">solipsistic and hedonistic and no no you</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.760" end="02:11:55.140" style="s2">forget about it&#39;s not mere pleasure</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.610" end="02:11:58.900" style="s2">it just it could be you know just just</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.140" end="02:12:01.510" style="s2">inscribe your deepest creative values in</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.900" end="02:12:04.680" style="s2">the space provided but just without the</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.510" end="02:12:08.530" style="s2">freedom to do otherwise right but then</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.680" end="02:12:11.260" style="s2">whatever it is having been scripted</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.530" end="02:12:14.230" style="s2">since the beginning of the movie is not</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.260" end="02:12:18.610" style="s2">a consequence of anything to which I</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.230" end="02:12:21.220" style="s2">might ascribe cause it just simply</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.610" end="02:12:22.630" style="s2">happens and so my delight at the fact</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.220" end="02:12:27.880" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.630" end="02:12:31.390" style="s2">and would like to know is it&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.880" end="02:12:33.160" style="s2">about somatic experience over which</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.390" end="02:12:34.420" style="s2">there&#39;s no possibility that it could</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.160" end="02:12:36.340" style="s2">ever have been other I mean I again I</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.420" end="02:12:38.590" style="s2">just I think every word here loses its</p>
<p begin="02:12:36.340" end="02:12:42.070" style="s2">meaning well it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.590" end="02:12:44.280" style="s2">ematic experience it&#39;s the life of the</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.070" end="02:12:47.830" style="s2">mind as well right it&#39;s just whatever</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.280" end="02:12:52.810" style="s2">you you know I see us as functioning in</p>
<p begin="02:12:47.830" end="02:12:55.780" style="s2">a a landscape of mind where we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.810" end="02:12:57.310" style="s2">know what experiences are possible yeah</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.780" end="02:13:00.639" style="s2">right we know we know that we know the</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.310" end="02:13:03.790" style="s2">ones we&#39;ve had and we can</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.639" end="02:13:08.139" style="s2">we can form intuitions about what should</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.790" end="02:13:10.570" style="s2">be adjacent to us in mental space right</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.139" end="02:13:12.340" style="s2">and what might be available to more</p>
<p begin="02:13:10.570" end="02:13:13.360" style="s2">insightful or more intelligent or</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.340" end="02:13:15.429" style="s2">longer-lived</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.360" end="02:13:17.199" style="s2">minds than our own right we can&#39;t we can</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.429" end="02:13:19.840" style="s2">form we can you know get our science</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.199" end="02:13:22.810" style="s2">fiction writers to tell us good stories</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.840" end="02:13:26.679" style="s2">about what might be possible we can</p>

<p begin="02:13:26.679" end="02:13:32.230" style="s2">by various methods you know which again</p>

<p begin="02:16:25.909" end="02:16:30.380" style="s2">more or less assumes a mind that is</p>

<p begin="02:16:44.630" end="02:16:49.070" style="s2">whereas I would say the word appreciate</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.639" end="02:16:55.219" style="s2">has zero meaning you know it is well</p>

<p begin="02:16:55.219" end="02:17:01.250" style="s2">is still mere mechanism in your mattress</p>
<p begin="02:16:58.790" end="02:17:04.370" style="s2">but it feels a certain way right so and</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.250" end="02:17:07.609" style="s2">like I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t author my</p>

<p begin="02:17:21.260" end="02:17:25.910" style="s2">there&#39;s still this experience of being</p>

<p begin="02:18:09.979" end="02:18:16.250" style="s2">appear to me so the fact that I am</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.559" end="02:18:18.439" style="s2">speaking to you by vibrating the air</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.250" end="02:18:20.570" style="s2">molecules between us in such a way that</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.439" end="02:18:23.360" style="s2">they vibrate a membrane in the side of</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.570" end="02:18:26.870" style="s2">your head which then causes hairs in a</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.360" end="02:18:29.599" style="s2">canal to flop over such that you can</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.870" end="02:18:31.639" style="s2">deduce the abstract meaning in my mind</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.599" end="02:18:34.370" style="s2">and build a version of it in your own</p>
<p begin="02:18:31.639" end="02:18:36.889" style="s2">mind that&#39;s such an odd way if I say hey</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.370" end="02:18:39.290" style="s2">pass the salt and I&#39;m doing this through</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.889" end="02:18:41.059" style="s2">this utterly magical mechanism of</p>

<p begin="02:18:41.840" end="02:18:47.179" style="s2">right and the purpose is to get the salt</p>

<p begin="02:18:47.179" end="02:18:55.189" style="s2">of the table what a mundane thing to</p>

<p begin="02:18:55.189" end="02:19:01.460" style="s2">means why am I able to put an abstract</p>

<p begin="02:19:03.649" end="02:19:08.450" style="s2">strange it&#39;s everything is strange no I</p>
<p begin="02:19:07.130" end="02:19:10.670" style="s2">think it&#39;s like a posture I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.450" end="02:19:12.679" style="s2">like saying that a baseline but guess</p>
<p begin="02:19:10.670" end="02:19:14.000" style="s2">what you measure it more closely but I</p>
<p begin="02:19:12.679" end="02:19:16.070" style="s2">mean this is this is the joke you know</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.000" end="02:19:17.479" style="s2">people say life is strange but you know</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.070" end="02:19:20.260" style="s2">I say compared to what I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="02:19:17.479" end="02:19:22.760" style="s2">this is Randy Newman or somebody but the</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.260" end="02:19:27.040" style="s2">what are you comparing it to like this</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.760" end="02:19:31.849" style="s2">is everything looked at closely</p>
<p begin="02:19:27.040" end="02:19:33.260" style="s2">disgorges it&#39;s utter strangeness let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:31.849" end="02:19:35.570" style="s2">put it this way I do believe in</p>
<p begin="02:19:33.260" end="02:19:37.490" style="s2">parsimony and so my point is not that it</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.570" end="02:19:39.639" style="s2">isn&#39;t all very very strange because it</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.490" end="02:19:42.219" style="s2">is my point is</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.639" end="02:19:44.469" style="s2">we ought to minimize the necessity of</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.219" end="02:19:47.500" style="s2">strangeness to our explanations as much</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.469" end="02:19:49.840" style="s2">as possible because as we allow</p>
<p begin="02:19:47.500" end="02:19:53.250" style="s2">ourselves strangeness in our</p>

<p begin="02:19:53.250" end="02:19:59.819" style="s2">devolves into madness well no I think</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.939" end="02:20:06.040" style="s2">that made strangeness I think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.819" end="02:20:08.319" style="s2">it&#39;s in eradicable in just in every case</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.040" end="02:20:13.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not that I mean is it&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.319" end="02:20:13.680" style="s2">fundamental strangeness to the fact that</p>
<p begin="02:20:13.830" end="02:20:26.130" style="s2">anything exists right however it exists</p>

<p begin="02:20:28.659" end="02:20:33.279" style="s2">like if you look closely enough at</p>
<p begin="02:20:31.420" end="02:20:38.470" style="s2">what&#39;s happening or what seems to be</p>
<p begin="02:20:33.279" end="02:20:42.479" style="s2">happening then ideas that sound like</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.470" end="02:20:49.989" style="s2">they add a whopping dose of strangeness</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.479" end="02:20:51.460" style="s2">to the picture don&#39;t actually add much</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.989" end="02:20:55.120" style="s2">at all so like the idea that this might</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.460" end="02:20:58.540" style="s2">be a simulation right well is that</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.120" end="02:21:01.180" style="s2">really much stranger than what seems to</p>

<p begin="02:24:04.860" end="02:24:09.660" style="s2">essentially goes to goes to zero in</p>

<p begin="02:24:09.660" end="02:24:15.480" style="s2">interation iterations of gameplay so</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.061" end="02:24:19.170" style="s2">this is a good place to maybe shift</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.480" end="02:24:23.480" style="s2">topics slightly um but that does seem to</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.170" end="02:24:26.070" style="s2">me like another way of speaking about</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.480" end="02:24:28.230" style="s2">metaphorical truth that and in fact I</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.070" end="02:24:32.940" style="s2">got into this in a recent podcast with</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.230" end="02:24:37.500" style="s2">Jim rut where my argument was that color</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.940" end="02:24:39.511" style="s2">is in effect a sort of useful fiction</p>
<p begin="02:24:37.500" end="02:24:41.341" style="s2">it&#39;s not that the wavelengths aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.511" end="02:24:45.150" style="s2">real but are categorizing them and</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.341" end="02:24:46.650" style="s2">painting our world our internal world</p>
<p begin="02:24:45.150" end="02:24:49.290" style="s2">with them in order to figure out where</p>
<p begin="02:24:46.650" end="02:24:56.040" style="s2">one object starts and another stops that</p>
<p begin="02:24:49.290" end="02:24:58.261" style="s2">that is a highly useful falsehood</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.040" end="02:25:00.120" style="s2">deployed in the interest of our fitness</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.261" end="02:25:02.431" style="s2">and that in fact that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.120" end="02:25:03.780" style="s2">sometimes the truth helps us with</p>
<p begin="02:25:02.431" end="02:25:05.521" style="s2">respect to fitness but where the two</p>
<p begin="02:25:03.780" end="02:25:07.230" style="s2">diverge you should expect Fitness to</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.521" end="02:25:10.021" style="s2">dominate and that that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="02:25:07.230" end="02:25:12.721" style="s2">perceptually and it&#39;s true cognitively</p>
<p begin="02:25:10.021" end="02:25:15.120" style="s2">and in every other we&#39;re assuming</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.721" end="02:25:17.551" style="s2">evolution is is the explanation yeah I</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.120" end="02:25:21.450" style="s2">mean his argument is that truth is just</p>
<p begin="02:25:17.551" end="02:25:24.721" style="s2">never a variable I mean it always washes</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.450" end="02:25:26.370" style="s2">out but it&#39;s you know I didn&#39;t take that</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.721" end="02:25:30.900" style="s2">part of the conversation with him very</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.370" end="02:25:34.940" style="s2">far it makes sense to me if I mean that</p>
<p begin="02:25:30.900" end="02:25:37.681" style="s2">the the intuition is well you need to be</p>
<p begin="02:25:34.940" end="02:25:39.990" style="s2">more or less in touch with whatever</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.681" end="02:25:42.450" style="s2">reality at large is because that would</p>
<p begin="02:25:39.990" end="02:25:44.660" style="s2">be that has to be adaptive right because</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.450" end="02:25:49.891" style="s2">you&#39;re in relationship to this thing so</p>
<p begin="02:25:44.660" end="02:25:52.561" style="s2">and so it&#39;s is so again it would be a</p>
<p begin="02:25:49.891" end="02:25:56.130" style="s2">kind of a bad edit of reality but still</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.561" end="02:26:00.870" style="s2">some some truth must be getting in he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:56.130" end="02:26:02.761" style="s2">got a more fundamental claim about truth</p>
<p begin="02:26:00.870" end="02:26:04.650" style="s2">at the end of the day just not getting</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.761" end="02:26:08.250" style="s2">in right we have what we have is a</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.650" end="02:26:10.561" style="s2">fitness landscape that is select we have</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.250" end="02:26:13.290" style="s2">we have built a you evolution that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.561" end="02:26:17.730" style="s2">built as a user interface that need have</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.290" end="02:26:18.601" style="s2">no relationship to reality outside the</p>

<p begin="02:26:21.690" end="02:26:27.681" style="s2">you once you run those numbers you get</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.751" end="02:26:31.891" style="s2">you get conjugal in his framework</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.681" end="02:26:34.711" style="s2">conscious agents that have no truth</p>

<p begin="02:26:42.900" end="02:26:48.181" style="s2">within their regime and anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:46.440" end="02:26:49.740" style="s2">interesting my intuitions have kind of</p>
<p begin="02:26:48.181" end="02:26:51.860" style="s2">slowly migrated in that direction at</p>

<p begin="02:26:51.860" end="02:27:02.221" style="s2">plausible if not convincing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.801" end="02:27:04.230" style="s2">just we you know we don&#39;t know I mean</p>
<p begin="02:27:02.221" end="02:27:07.230" style="s2">this is just comes back to the the JBS</p>
<p begin="02:27:04.230" end="02:27:10.131" style="s2">Haldane quote which I&#39;ve mangled a few</p>
<p begin="02:27:07.230" end="02:27:15.450" style="s2">times here which is the the idea that</p>
<p begin="02:27:10.131" end="02:27:17.461" style="s2">reality is not only stranger than we</p>

<p begin="02:27:20.641" end="02:27:30.860" style="s2">yeah the British version and that is you</p>
<p begin="02:27:28.410" end="02:27:33.471" style="s2">know just based on Darwinian principles</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.860" end="02:27:36.181" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t be surprising to us</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.471" end="02:27:39.211" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason why we EV Aleutian</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.181" end="02:27:41.791" style="s2">would have given us intuitions properly</p>
<p begin="02:27:39.211" end="02:27:46.021" style="s2">formed so as to take the measure of how</p>
<p begin="02:27:41.791" end="02:27:47.551" style="s2">strange reality might seem in the end</p>
<p begin="02:27:46.021" end="02:27:50.101" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna disagree with that slightly I</p>
<p begin="02:27:47.551" end="02:27:53.730" style="s2">mean I I basically agree and I have said</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.101" end="02:27:56.581" style="s2">elsewhere that you are not built to be</p>
<p begin="02:27:53.730" end="02:27:58.620" style="s2">right you&#39;re built to be effective and</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.581" end="02:27:59.971" style="s2">that those two depart from each other</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.620" end="02:28:01.801" style="s2">but they don&#39;t always depart from each</p>
<p begin="02:27:59.971" end="02:28:03.690" style="s2">other and I would argue that actually</p>
<p begin="02:28:01.801" end="02:28:07.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a temporal phenomenon where</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.690" end="02:28:11.101" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;re useful fictions are</p>
<p begin="02:28:07.530" end="02:28:13.761" style="s2">much less useful and that it makes sense</p>
<p begin="02:28:11.101" end="02:28:15.860" style="s2">to step in the direction of an</p>
<p begin="02:28:13.761" end="02:28:18.780" style="s2">interaction with reality that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="02:28:15.860" end="02:28:21.841" style="s2">informative in order for you to alter</p>
<p begin="02:28:18.780" end="02:28:24.751" style="s2">what you think and therefore what you do</p>
<p begin="02:28:21.841" end="02:28:27.081" style="s2">in a way that enhances fitness and so I</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.751" end="02:28:29.881" style="s2">would argue that our capacity to do this</p>
<p begin="02:28:27.081" end="02:28:32.999" style="s2">is adaptive and what it means is that</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.881" end="02:28:35.680" style="s2">our relationship to reality is</p>
<p begin="02:28:32.999" end="02:28:38.169" style="s2">arbitrary nor does it exist at a</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.680" end="02:28:41.350" style="s2">constant strength but it shifts based on</p>
<p begin="02:28:38.169" end="02:28:43.959" style="s2">where we are in in history mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="02:28:41.350" end="02:28:47.259" style="s2">so anyway it&#39;s a sort of middle ground</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.959" end="02:28:48.850" style="s2">position I guess but but I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:47.259" end="02:28:52.109" style="s2">interesting how all of these discussions</p>

<p begin="02:28:52.109" end="02:28:57.999" style="s2">relatives of each other so you know the</p>
<p begin="02:28:55.270" end="02:29:00.009" style="s2">freewill discussion has treaded very</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.999" end="02:29:02.409" style="s2">close to the religious discussion that</p>
<p begin="02:29:00.009" end="02:29:05.379" style="s2">we&#39;ve been involved in in various places</p>
<p begin="02:29:02.409" end="02:29:08.680" style="s2">and maybe it would make some sense to to</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.379" end="02:29:13.390" style="s2">visit that before we finish this up can</p>
<p begin="02:29:08.680" end="02:29:15.969" style="s2">I return you to a moment in the debate</p>
<p begin="02:29:13.390" end="02:29:19.600" style="s2">between you and Jordan Peterson where I</p>
<p begin="02:29:15.969" end="02:29:21.819" style="s2">was moderating in Vancouver there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.600" end="02:29:26.709" style="s2">moment late on what must have been day</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.819" end="02:29:34.060" style="s2">one in which you leveled a challenge to</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.709" end="02:29:36.640" style="s2">Jordan about why a God as he sees that</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.060" end="02:29:41.079" style="s2">entity would give a damn about whether</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.640" end="02:29:43.029" style="s2">or not you masturbated or would be in</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.079" end="02:29:47.109" style="s2">any way responsive to prayers that you</p>
<p begin="02:29:43.029" end="02:29:49.239" style="s2">might offer and it was a tough spot for</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.109" end="02:29:51.699" style="s2">me because at that moment I felt like</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.239" end="02:29:53.439" style="s2">there was a lot to be done between you</p>
<p begin="02:29:51.699" end="02:29:55.810" style="s2">and me but it wasn&#39;t my debate with you</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.439" end="02:29:57.729" style="s2">there you were there to talk to Jordan</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.810" end="02:30:00.279" style="s2">and I was there to keep you guys on</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.729" end="02:30:02.649" style="s2">track which actually I should just thank</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.279" end="02:30:02.949" style="s2">you it was an honor to be invited to do</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.649" end="02:30:05.459" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.949" end="02:30:09.729" style="s2">yeah likewise you you were great there</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.459" end="02:30:12.159" style="s2">but my question is I think that in that</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.729" end="02:30:14.770" style="s2">moment I offered some pushback as much</p>
<p begin="02:30:12.159" end="02:30:16.539" style="s2">as I could manage given the context and</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.770" end="02:30:19.949" style="s2">said look actually there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.539" end="02:30:22.180" style="s2">reason that a metaphorical God should</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.949" end="02:30:24.879" style="s2">have an opinion on whether or not you</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.180" end="02:30:26.409" style="s2">should masturbate and I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="02:30:24.879" end="02:30:29.289" style="s2">around to saying I also think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.409" end="02:30:33.219" style="s2">mechanism by which prayers do not</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.289" end="02:30:36.489" style="s2">require a supernatural entity for them</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.219" end="02:30:41.049" style="s2">to be sensible in a in a Darwinian sense</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.489" end="02:30:43.629" style="s2">of the term and I I remember our</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.049" end="02:30:44.899" style="s2">interaction I thought I saw a light bulb</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.629" end="02:30:47.119" style="s2">go on over your</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.899" end="02:30:49.550" style="s2">head as you got pushback from me on that</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.119" end="02:30:52.399" style="s2">topic do you remember the net no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:30:49.550" end="02:30:54.560" style="s2">remember it so I&#39;d have to queue up the</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.399" end="02:31:00.609" style="s2">video or we can play it play out the</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.560" end="02:31:03.439" style="s2">movie in real time here well the the</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.609" end="02:31:06.229" style="s2">pushback I gave you got lost because of</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.439" end="02:31:07.189" style="s2">course masturbation is so funny that you</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.229" end="02:31:08.449" style="s2">know there&#39;s just no way the</p>
<p begin="02:31:07.189" end="02:31:11.630" style="s2">conversation was going to endure the</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.449" end="02:31:15.189" style="s2">question but the pushback was look</p>
<p begin="02:31:11.630" end="02:31:19.489" style="s2">obviously masturbation interfaces with</p>
<p begin="02:31:15.189" end="02:31:21.020" style="s2">motivation about sex and motivation</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.489" end="02:31:23.689" style="s2">about sex has everything to do with</p>
<p begin="02:31:21.020" end="02:31:25.369" style="s2">fitness and so doesn&#39;t it make a great</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.689" end="02:31:29.930" style="s2">deal of sense that should these</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.369" end="02:31:33.800" style="s2">religious beliefs be literally false</p>
<p begin="02:31:29.930" end="02:31:37.489" style="s2">metaphorically true statements that a</p>
<p begin="02:31:33.800" end="02:31:40.039" style="s2">deity described in such statements would</p>
<p begin="02:31:37.489" end="02:31:42.109" style="s2">actually prefer that you not masturbate</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.039" end="02:31:44.779" style="s2">such a innovated to reproduce oh yeah</p>
<p begin="02:31:42.109" end="02:31:46.640" style="s2">yeah no no that I totally accept that I</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.779" end="02:31:50.419" style="s2">think what I wouldn&#39;t have accepted</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.640" end="02:31:53.180" style="s2">there is that Jordan I mean I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:31:50.419" end="02:31:55.010" style="s2">be talking about a metaphorical God</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.180" end="02:31:56.810" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think Jordan was talking</p>
<p begin="02:31:55.010" end="02:32:00.470" style="s2">about a metaphorical God and they say if</p>
<p begin="02:31:56.810" end="02:32:05.779" style="s2">you were just talking about the the</p>
<p begin="02:32:00.470" end="02:32:08.229" style="s2">possible pragmatism of certain doctrines</p>
<p begin="02:32:05.779" end="02:32:10.369" style="s2">that have been traditionally anchored to</p>
<p begin="02:32:08.229" end="02:32:14.060" style="s2">what we have every reason to believe</p>
<p begin="02:32:10.369" end="02:32:16.579" style="s2">that our false beliefs about deities</p>
<p begin="02:32:14.060" end="02:32:18.789" style="s2">well then yeah I mean that&#39;s a rationale</p>
<p begin="02:32:16.579" end="02:32:21.439" style="s2">that that makes total sense to me okay</p>
<p begin="02:32:18.789" end="02:32:24.319" style="s2">so what I didn&#39;t get around to was the</p>
<p begin="02:32:21.439" end="02:32:28.100" style="s2">the point about prayer so let&#39;s take the</p>
<p begin="02:32:24.319" end="02:32:30.249" style="s2">classic the classic prayer of the the</p>

<p begin="02:32:36.439" end="02:32:44.619" style="s2">sleep is very likely to focus on things</p>
<p begin="02:32:39.619" end="02:32:48.319" style="s2">that are possible and desirable or</p>

<p begin="02:32:59.079" end="02:33:05.050" style="s2">tomorrow and the recital or whatever it</p>
<p begin="02:33:01.540" end="02:33:08.770" style="s2">is it&#39;s interesting that that comes</p>
<p begin="02:33:05.050" end="02:33:12.399" style="s2">right before the conscious mind goes</p>
<p begin="02:33:08.770" end="02:33:16.510" style="s2">offline and the brain as a whole remains</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.399" end="02:33:19.659" style="s2">active and engaged in scenario building</p>

<p begin="02:33:21.100" end="02:33:26.020" style="s2">although my guess is somebody has proved</p>
<p begin="02:33:22.899" end="02:33:28.000" style="s2">it is that your thought process</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.020" end="02:33:31.180" style="s2">immediately before going to bed has a</p>

<p begin="02:33:39.130" end="02:33:42.760" style="s2">world now it might be that you asked</p>
<p begin="02:33:41.020" end="02:33:45.340" style="s2">your deity to intervene on things where</p>
<p begin="02:33:42.760" end="02:33:46.960" style="s2">your ability to use your brain to find a</p>
<p begin="02:33:45.340" end="02:33:49.449" style="s2">solution is meaningless you know if you</p>

<p begin="02:33:52.390" end="02:33:59.680" style="s2">be answered on the other hand if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:33:53.880" end="02:34:02.590" style="s2">praying to not screw up that one move in</p>
<p begin="02:33:59.680" end="02:34:05.319" style="s2">the recital tomorrow then it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="02:34:02.590" end="02:34:07.390" style="s2">that you end up running through the</p>
<p begin="02:34:05.319" end="02:34:09.189" style="s2">various things that trip you up and when</p>
<p begin="02:34:07.390" end="02:34:11.649" style="s2">you get to the recital actually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:34:09.189" end="02:34:14.649" style="s2">more practice than you realize your</p>
<p begin="02:34:11.649" end="02:34:18.159" style="s2">prayer might be answered right well I</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.649" end="02:34:20.380" style="s2">think there are many reasons why prayer</p>
<p begin="02:34:18.159" end="02:34:24.670" style="s2">might be good for something that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:34:20.380" end="02:34:26.739" style="s2">entail a God actually listening and that</p>
<p begin="02:34:24.670" end="02:34:34.750" style="s2">that&#39;s just one by me that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="02:34:26.739" end="02:34:39.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a little I mean obviously most</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.750" end="02:34:42.399" style="s2">prayer is not necessarily paired with</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.180" end="02:34:45.939" style="s2">sleep right and maybe the prayer prayer</p>
<p begin="02:34:42.399" end="02:34:47.770" style="s2">is a tool or as an injunction is not you</p>
<p begin="02:34:45.939" end="02:34:49.329" style="s2">know you know our you know sort of</p>
<p begin="02:34:47.770" end="02:34:50.920" style="s2">cartoon picture of what it must be like</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.329" end="02:34:54.159" style="s2">to be religious we picture people</p>
<p begin="02:34:50.920" end="02:34:56.859" style="s2">praying before they go to sleep but in</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.159" end="02:35:00.069" style="s2">you know just theologically prayer as a</p>
<p begin="02:34:56.859" end="02:35:02.319" style="s2">mechanism isn&#39;t you know yeah</p>
<p begin="02:35:00.069" end="02:35:03.430" style="s2">I&#39;m unaware of anyone recommending that</p>
<p begin="02:35:02.319" end="02:35:05.829" style="s2">you do it at the end of the day as</p>
<p begin="02:35:03.430" end="02:35:07.479" style="s2">opposed to you know whenever the fancy</p>

<p begin="02:35:13.810" end="02:35:19.750" style="s2">any time of day and there are many</p>
<p begin="02:35:18.520" end="02:35:22.210" style="s2">reasons why it could have good</p>
<p begin="02:35:19.750" end="02:35:23.620" style="s2">consequences for you I mean one kind of</p>
<p begin="02:35:22.210" end="02:35:26.770" style="s2">more basic reason that has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="02:35:23.620" end="02:35:29.020" style="s2">with you know memory or skill</p>

<p begin="02:39:18.160" end="02:39:22.271" style="s2">things point in the same direction of</p>

<p begin="02:39:34.780" end="02:39:40.720" style="s2">mean here but trying to strengthen your</p>
<p begin="02:39:37.479" end="02:39:44.470" style="s2">your lineage or your congregation or</p>
<p begin="02:39:40.720" end="02:39:47.170" style="s2">whatever whatever the entity is right so</p>
<p begin="02:39:44.470" end="02:39:49.060" style="s2">okay that&#39;s all that&#39;s all good it</p>
<p begin="02:39:47.170" end="02:39:51.580" style="s2">sounds like we&#39;re on the same page about</p>
<p begin="02:39:49.060" end="02:39:54.840" style="s2">that I guess what I what I want to get</p>
<p begin="02:39:51.580" end="02:40:00.700" style="s2">at do you feel that your position on</p>
<p begin="02:39:54.840" end="02:40:01.990" style="s2">religion is in motion at all my my basic</p>
<p begin="02:40:00.700" end="02:40:08.189" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="02:40:01.990" end="02:40:13.180" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say is just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:40:08.189" end="02:40:16.180" style="s2">always allowed for multiple things to be</p>
<p begin="02:40:13.180" end="02:40:18.250" style="s2">true which which seem incompatible at</p>
<p begin="02:40:16.180" end="02:40:20.680" style="s2">first glance but you know are easily</p>
<p begin="02:40:18.250" end="02:40:24.040" style="s2">reconciled and have always been from my</p>
<p begin="02:40:20.680" end="02:40:26.979" style="s2">point of view so the the fact that you</p>
<p begin="02:40:24.040" end="02:40:28.990" style="s2">can you can you know this is a point</p>
<p begin="02:40:26.979" end="02:40:31.479" style="s2">I&#39;ve always made explicitly we have to</p>
<p begin="02:40:28.990" end="02:40:33.040" style="s2">acknowledge that religion isn&#39;t just one</p>
<p begin="02:40:31.479" end="02:40:34.240" style="s2">thing there are many different religions</p>
<p begin="02:40:33.040" end="02:40:35.830" style="s2">on offer and they do things differently</p>
<p begin="02:40:34.240" end="02:40:38.790" style="s2">right they believe different things</p>
<p begin="02:40:35.830" end="02:40:41.229" style="s2">there&#39;s different consequences to each</p>
<p begin="02:40:38.790" end="02:40:45.550" style="s2">you know that they&#39;re obviously there</p>
<p begin="02:40:41.229" end="02:40:49.300" style="s2">their similarities but I mean religion</p>
<p begin="02:40:45.550" end="02:40:51.460" style="s2">is a is a very broad concept like food</p>
<p begin="02:40:49.300" end="02:40:52.810" style="s2">right and you know not all foods are</p>
<p begin="02:40:51.460" end="02:40:54.490" style="s2">doing the same thing and they&#39;re not you</p>
<p begin="02:40:52.810" end="02:41:00.820" style="s2">know they&#39;re not all fit for the same</p>
<p begin="02:40:54.490" end="02:41:05.110" style="s2">occasion and so if you can point to a</p>
<p begin="02:41:00.820" end="02:41:09.370" style="s2">local instance where some person&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="02:41:05.110" end="02:41:13.030" style="s2">or some communities life was obviously</p>
<p begin="02:41:09.370" end="02:41:17.260" style="s2">made better by religion that is not</p>
<p begin="02:41:13.030" end="02:41:19.180" style="s2">actually a a point against any argument</p>
<p begin="02:41:17.260" end="02:41:20.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever made right and so I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="02:41:19.180" end="02:41:26.110" style="s2">acknowledged that those you can find</p>
<p begin="02:41:20.950" end="02:41:28.720" style="s2">those examples right and so too with the</p>
<p begin="02:41:26.110" end="02:41:31.000" style="s2">flipside of that you can find atheists</p>
<p begin="02:41:28.720" end="02:41:33.790" style="s2">doing terrible things and made miserable</p>
<p begin="02:41:31.000" end="02:41:36.189" style="s2">by their atheism or atheists who wish</p>
<p begin="02:41:33.790" end="02:41:38.350" style="s2">they were religious right and can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="02:41:36.189" end="02:41:39.760" style="s2">that thing that you know they know is</p>
<p begin="02:41:38.350" end="02:41:40.870" style="s2">making life meaningful for their</p>
<p begin="02:41:39.760" end="02:41:43.900" style="s2">religious brothers</p>
<p begin="02:41:40.870" end="02:41:48.760" style="s2">sisters and they&#39;re all depressed and</p>
<p begin="02:41:43.900" end="02:41:51.730" style="s2">nihilistic and the fact that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:41:48.760" end="02:41:54.430" style="s2">have religion or something something</p>
<p begin="02:41:51.730" end="02:41:58.140" style="s2">that would do the work of religion is</p>
<p begin="02:41:54.430" end="02:42:00.460" style="s2">some part of that that problem for them</p>
<p begin="02:41:58.140" end="02:42:03.521" style="s2">again that&#39;s not a rejoinder to anything</p>
<p begin="02:42:00.460" end="02:42:07.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever said I mean my my basic</p>
<p begin="02:42:03.521" end="02:42:09.720" style="s2">argument is that whatever is good</p>
<p begin="02:42:07.450" end="02:42:14.920" style="s2">whatever good can be found in religion</p>
<p begin="02:42:09.720" end="02:42:16.840" style="s2">is I&#39;ve yet to find an important</p>
<p begin="02:42:14.920" end="02:42:18.630" style="s2">exception to this rule ml admit as</p>
<p begin="02:42:16.840" end="02:42:23.320" style="s2">possible that there is an exception but</p>
<p begin="02:42:18.630" end="02:42:25.180" style="s2">is is better found some other way right</p>
<p begin="02:42:23.320" end="02:42:27.670" style="s2">so if you can give me a list of things</p>
<p begin="02:42:25.180" end="02:42:30.790" style="s2">that that you know moral actions that</p>
<p begin="02:42:27.670" end="02:42:32.351" style="s2">religion gets people to do I can find</p>
<p begin="02:42:30.790" end="02:42:35.410" style="s2">you better reasons to do those things</p>
<p begin="02:42:32.351" end="02:42:36.880" style="s2">right reasons that scale better that are</p>
<p begin="02:42:35.410" end="02:42:39.010" style="s2">more durable that will not that will</p>
<p begin="02:42:36.880" end="02:42:41.140" style="s2">survive contact with our ongoing</p>
<p begin="02:42:39.010" end="02:42:42.970" style="s2">investigation of the way the universe is</p>
<p begin="02:42:41.140" end="02:42:44.710" style="s2">scientifically there&#39;s nothing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:42:42.970" end="02:42:46.990" style="s2">gonna find out about our brains</p>
<p begin="02:42:44.710" end="02:42:49.330" style="s2">that&#39;ll cancer that&#39;ll cancel these good</p>
<p begin="02:42:46.990" end="02:42:52.150" style="s2">reasons for being moral or going to</p>
<p begin="02:42:49.330" end="02:42:54.820" style="s2">Africa to to alleviate famine whereas</p>
<p begin="02:42:52.150" end="02:42:56.830" style="s2">the virgin birth of Jesus is a bad</p>
<p begin="02:42:54.820" end="02:42:59.710" style="s2">reason to do those things right even if</p>
<p begin="02:42:56.830" end="02:43:01.990" style="s2">it gets again undeniable it gets some</p>
<p begin="02:42:59.710" end="02:43:06.040" style="s2">number of people to do good things you</p>
<p begin="02:43:01.990" end="02:43:07.960" style="s2">know under the ages of crazy police so</p>
<p begin="02:43:06.040" end="02:43:12.851" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t think so there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="02:43:07.960" end="02:43:15.760" style="s2">been what I perceive to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:43:12.851" end="02:43:18.070" style="s2">flexibility in my view because it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="02:43:15.760" end="02:43:20.380" style="s2">know there again there&#39;s no you you can</p>
<p begin="02:43:18.070" end="02:43:22.830" style="s2">point to mountains of good done</p>
<p begin="02:43:20.380" end="02:43:26.170" style="s2">somewhere sometime for religious reasons</p>
<p begin="02:43:22.830" end="02:43:27.521" style="s2">and its net it&#39;s never been never never</p>
<p begin="02:43:26.170" end="02:43:29.440" style="s2">been in contradiction to what I thought</p>
<p begin="02:43:27.521" end="02:43:32.380" style="s2">was true okay</p>
<p begin="02:43:29.440" end="02:43:35.820" style="s2">so I want to point you to two things</p>
<p begin="02:43:32.380" end="02:43:39.610" style="s2">where I think there might be a reason to</p>
<p begin="02:43:35.820" end="02:43:41.860" style="s2">to open it up and check whether or not</p>
<p begin="02:43:39.610" end="02:43:44.980" style="s2">you still feel the way you did in the</p>
<p begin="02:43:41.860" end="02:43:46.450" style="s2">moral landscape you write that you have</p>
<p begin="02:43:44.980" end="02:43:49.390" style="s2">been confronted with people who make the</p>
<p begin="02:43:46.450" end="02:43:51.521" style="s2">argument that because religion is</p>
<p begin="02:43:49.390" end="02:43:54.090" style="s2">long-standing it must therefore be</p>

<p begin="02:44:18.330" end="02:44:25.590" style="s2">correctly you make the argument that a</p>

<p begin="02:44:49.109" end="02:44:58.200" style="s2">by the same logic the first would be</p>

<p begin="02:45:24.899" end="02:45:33.450" style="s2">one thing that is religion for me is</p>
<p begin="02:45:28.520" end="02:45:36.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s another name we put</p>

<p begin="02:45:36.750" end="02:45:41.010" style="s2">in the it&#39;s becoming increasingly</p>
<p begin="02:45:38.640" end="02:45:43.200" style="s2">willful and in them you know as we get</p>
<p begin="02:45:41.010" end="02:45:44.760" style="s2">more knowledge on board but so I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="02:45:47.069" end="02:45:53.100" style="s2">must be doing its work because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:45:49.350" end="02:45:55.229" style="s2">highly conserved it&#39;s a certain point of</p>

<p begin="02:45:57.859" end="02:46:04.740" style="s2">probably a better analogy is to</p>
<p begin="02:46:02.010" end="02:46:06.960" style="s2">witchcraft which is also a cultural</p>

<p begin="02:46:06.960" end="02:46:12.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very similar to religion in certain</p>
<p begin="02:46:08.970" end="02:46:15.720" style="s2">ways you know believing in magic spells</p>
<p begin="02:46:12.000" end="02:46:19.590" style="s2">is a lot like believing in prayer again</p>
<p begin="02:46:15.720" end="02:46:21.870" style="s2">ubiquitous and still survives in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:46:19.590" end="02:46:24.830" style="s2">really just a contingent fact of recent</p>
<p begin="02:46:21.870" end="02:46:27.750" style="s2">history that it isn&#39;t as universal</p>
<p begin="02:46:24.830" end="02:46:29.940" style="s2">currently as religion is and if you go</p>
<p begin="02:46:27.750" end="02:46:31.380" style="s2">to Africa it&#39;s basically Universal in</p>
<p begin="02:46:29.940" end="02:46:34.800" style="s2">Africa right so if we were living on</p>
<p begin="02:46:31.380" end="02:46:36.950" style="s2">Planet Africa magic would be more or</p>
<p begin="02:46:34.800" end="02:46:40.740" style="s2">less just as much of a going concern as</p>
<p begin="02:46:36.950" end="02:46:44.910" style="s2">religion is I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:46:40.740" end="02:46:46.560" style="s2">saying listen oh I never run into this</p>
<p begin="02:46:44.910" end="02:46:48.930" style="s2">argument and someone must be making it</p>
<p begin="02:46:46.560" end="02:46:51.570" style="s2">somewhere but no one is coming back at</p>
<p begin="02:46:48.930" end="02:46:53.850" style="s2">me you know in the Jordan Peterson mode</p>

<p begin="02:46:57.840" end="02:47:03.210" style="s2">important and Europe you know European</p>

<p begin="02:59:39.120" end="02:59:44.490" style="s2">for Iron Age religion first I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="02:59:42.960" end="02:59:48.960" style="s2">why you go back to the Iron Age I</p>

<p begin="02:59:48.960" end="02:59:53.790" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be Abrahamic about it or at</p>
<p begin="02:59:51.180" end="02:59:56.460" style="s2">least with respect to Judaism and</p>

<p begin="02:59:56.460" end="03:00:00.900" style="s2">there mm-hmm because I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="02:59:59.100" end="03:00:06.720" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:00:00.900" end="03:00:09.720" style="s2">talking about why tread carefully around</p>
<p begin="03:00:06.720" end="03:00:13.200" style="s2">structures whose roots go back to the</p>
<p begin="03:00:09.720" end="03:00:15.360" style="s2">Iron Age well no but specific beliefs</p>
<p begin="03:00:13.200" end="03:00:18.870" style="s2">yes and like that I mean that the the</p>
<p begin="03:00:15.360" end="03:00:20.940" style="s2">crucial thing for me with respect to any</p>
<p begin="03:00:18.870" end="03:00:22.640" style="s2">of these religions as a thing that the</p>
<p begin="03:00:20.940" end="03:00:28.260" style="s2">only thing that an atheist needs to do</p>
<p begin="03:00:22.640" end="03:00:30.270" style="s2">to win the argument is to point out that</p>
<p begin="03:00:28.260" end="03:00:32.010" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to believe that any of</p>
<p begin="03:00:30.270" end="03:00:34.140" style="s2">these books are anything other than</p>
<p begin="03:00:32.010" end="03:00:35.460" style="s2">books right it&#39;s it&#39;s a textual claim</p>
<p begin="03:00:34.140" end="03:00:38.250" style="s2">again just now we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="03:00:35.460" end="03:00:40.050" style="s2">Judaism Christianity and Islam sure the</p>
<p begin="03:00:38.250" end="03:00:44.070" style="s2">moment you deal with the books the</p>
<p begin="03:00:40.050" end="03:00:47.640" style="s2">moment you say there&#39;s these books do</p>
<p begin="03:00:44.070" end="03:00:49.830" style="s2">not bear the slightest sign of</p>
<p begin="03:00:47.640" end="03:00:52.550" style="s2">omniscient author&#39;s authorship we know</p>
<p begin="03:00:49.830" end="03:00:55.560" style="s2">too much about how they were authored</p>
<p begin="03:00:52.550" end="03:00:58.830" style="s2">the reason is there&#39;s nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="03:00:55.560" end="03:01:00.450" style="s2">the supernatural yeah and what&#39;s more if</p>
<p begin="03:00:58.830" end="03:01:02.610" style="s2">you just think of how good a book would</p>
<p begin="03:01:00.450" end="03:01:05.730" style="s2">would be if it were the product of</p>
<p begin="03:01:02.610" end="03:01:07.620" style="s2">omniscience you know it just it it made</p>
<p begin="03:01:05.730" end="03:01:09.840" style="s2">it just beggars belief that anyone</p>
<p begin="03:01:07.620" end="03:01:12.780" style="s2">imagines these books were the the</p>
<p begin="03:01:09.840" end="03:01:15.570" style="s2">product of omniscience so the moment you</p>
<p begin="03:01:12.780" end="03:01:18.120" style="s2">do that you have destroyed these</p>
<p begin="03:01:15.570" end="03:01:21.480" style="s2">religions there that it is it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="03:01:18.120" end="03:01:23.360" style="s2">unrecoverable error to to I mean it is</p>
<p begin="03:01:21.480" end="03:01:27.360" style="s2">the thing it is the point passed which</p>
<p begin="03:01:23.360" end="03:01:29.040" style="s2">no self-respecting I mean remand Judaism</p>
<p begin="03:01:27.360" end="03:01:31.350" style="s2">is a slight tweak on this because you</p>
<p begin="03:01:29.040" end="03:01:33.330" style="s2">know that most Jews have lost their</p>
<p begin="03:01:31.350" end="03:01:37.470" style="s2">religion and just don&#39;t want to admit it</p>
<p begin="03:01:33.330" end="03:01:39.511" style="s2">but the the the moment you get past this</p>
<p begin="03:01:37.470" end="03:01:42.120" style="s2">textual claim</p>
<p begin="03:01:39.511" end="03:01:45.601" style="s2">and you just reduce these to be in books</p>
<p begin="03:01:42.120" end="03:01:49.800" style="s2">like any other books susceptible to to</p>
<p begin="03:01:45.601" end="03:01:51.721" style="s2">criticism like any other books and then</p>
<p begin="03:01:49.800" end="03:01:53.851" style="s2">your this is a quick step to admitting</p>
<p begin="03:01:51.721" end="03:01:56.761" style="s2">that they&#39;re not even especially good</p>
<p begin="03:01:53.851" end="03:01:58.681" style="s2">books on very important topics most of</p>
<p begin="03:01:56.761" end="03:02:01.530" style="s2">the time right and so then you&#39;re then</p>
<p begin="03:01:58.681" end="03:02:04.351" style="s2">your left finding these you know</p>

<p begin="03:07:00.581" end="03:07:08.980" style="s2">a variable right and what we need is a</p>

<p begin="03:07:22.061" end="03:07:34.081" style="s2">on the table then we can track it your</p>
<p begin="03:07:26.860" end="03:07:37.241" style="s2">claim was that the basically my position</p>
<p begin="03:07:34.081" end="03:07:39.400" style="s2">that these things are ancient</p>
<p begin="03:07:37.241" end="03:07:43.411" style="s2">compendiums of wisdom and that we are in</p>

<p begin="03:07:52.360" end="03:07:59.831" style="s2">to move wisely forward it&#39;s not fair yep</p>
<p begin="03:07:55.391" end="03:08:01.900" style="s2">yeah okay I actually think the opposite</p>
<p begin="03:07:59.831" end="03:08:04.961" style="s2">we&#39;ll just imagine if we did that in</p>
<p begin="03:08:01.900" end="03:08:07.391" style="s2">with anything else that was of</p>
<p begin="03:08:04.961" end="03:08:10.631" style="s2">importance to us like just technology</p>
<p begin="03:08:07.391" end="03:08:13.931" style="s2">like imagine with you know if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:08:10.631" end="03:08:18.830" style="s2">trying to invent a</p>
<p begin="03:08:13.931" end="03:08:20.320" style="s2">you know a way to fly to the moon and in</p>
<p begin="03:08:18.830" end="03:08:22.880" style="s2">a world where we only have propellers</p>
<p begin="03:08:20.320" end="03:08:26.630" style="s2">right and if what if we had this sense</p>
<p begin="03:08:22.880" end="03:08:30.920" style="s2">that listen whatever we do it&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="03:08:26.630" end="03:08:37.490" style="s2">be propeller based otherwise you know we</p>
<p begin="03:08:30.920" end="03:08:41.870" style="s2">will have we will have I mean we would</p>
<p begin="03:08:37.490" end="03:08:44.450" style="s2">will have falsified all the sacrifices</p>
<p begin="03:08:41.870" end="03:08:46.340" style="s2">of our ancestors yeah I get it and of</p>
<p begin="03:08:44.450" end="03:08:49.011" style="s2">course I would never make that point I</p>
<p begin="03:08:46.340" end="03:08:51.561" style="s2">believe I&#39;m not even a strong</p>
<p begin="03:08:49.011" end="03:08:54.590" style="s2">emergentist I believe the scientific</p>
<p begin="03:08:51.561" end="03:08:57.950" style="s2">story to the extent that we can discover</p>
<p begin="03:08:54.590" end="03:09:00.380" style="s2">it will ultimately allow us to get the</p>

<p begin="03:09:00.380" end="03:09:06.740" style="s2">hmm we&#39;re not there yet for sure the</p>
<p begin="03:09:04.040" end="03:09:10.130" style="s2">question really is what opens the door</p>
<p begin="03:09:06.740" end="03:09:13.641" style="s2">and I believe and you know I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="03:09:10.130" end="03:09:16.670" style="s2">one hell of an anecdotal run here but my</p>
<p begin="03:09:13.641" end="03:09:18.830" style="s2">interaction with people of faith who are</p>
<p begin="03:09:16.670" end="03:09:21.590" style="s2">in a position to at least listen to what</p>
<p begin="03:09:18.830" end="03:09:26.620" style="s2">I have to say on this topic is that it</p>
<p begin="03:09:21.590" end="03:09:30.051" style="s2">is opening a door to considering what a</p>
<p begin="03:09:26.620" end="03:09:31.221" style="s2">rational shared worldview might be I</p>
<p begin="03:09:30.051" end="03:09:35.780" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s opening the door very</p>
<p begin="03:09:31.221" end="03:09:37.971" style="s2">wide but I do think the door was closed</p>
<p begin="03:09:35.780" end="03:09:40.690" style="s2">in a sense by what religious people</p>
<p begin="03:09:37.971" end="03:09:44.271" style="s2">perceived and sometimes was hostility</p>
<p begin="03:09:40.690" end="03:09:47.120" style="s2">from the Atheist community that</p>
<p begin="03:09:44.271" end="03:09:49.221" style="s2">caricatured by not acknowledging that</p>
<p begin="03:09:47.120" end="03:09:52.400" style="s2">the religion ever had any content by</p>
<p begin="03:09:49.221" end="03:09:56.360" style="s2">portraying it as a pathology inherently</p>
<p begin="03:09:52.400" end="03:09:58.070" style="s2">a pathology that of course caused an</p>
<p begin="03:09:56.360" end="03:10:00.561" style="s2">offensive right but that&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="03:09:58.070" end="03:10:02.840" style="s2">I mean I I&#39;ve received as much defensive</p>
<p begin="03:10:00.561" end="03:10:05.210" style="s2">nough seni one but that&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="03:10:02.840" end="03:10:07.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever done I&#39;ve always been in touch</p>
<p begin="03:10:05.210" end="03:10:09.380" style="s2">with the experience that you know that</p>
<p begin="03:10:07.400" end="03:10:11.240" style="s2">is the baby in the bath water that that</p>
<p begin="03:10:09.380" end="03:10:14.570" style="s2">you know I think people anyone should</p>
<p begin="03:10:11.240" end="03:10:17.601" style="s2">want to conserve and yet I&#39;ve met the</p>
<p begin="03:10:14.570" end="03:10:20.301" style="s2">same hostility and the reason several</p>
<p begin="03:10:17.601" end="03:10:23.150" style="s2">reasons for that but one is that most</p>
<p begin="03:10:20.301" end="03:10:26.721" style="s2">religious people aren&#39;t actually mystics</p>
<p begin="03:10:23.150" end="03:10:29.421" style="s2">or aspiring mystics or contemplatives</p>
<p begin="03:10:26.721" end="03:10:32.841" style="s2">they&#39;re not about becoming like Jesus or</p>
<p begin="03:10:29.421" end="03:10:34.790" style="s2">like mr meister eckhart right or you</p>
<p begin="03:10:32.841" end="03:10:37.131" style="s2">know st. seraphim of sarov i mean these</p>
<p begin="03:10:34.790" end="03:10:41.421" style="s2">are not they&#39;re not that&#39;s not the game</p>
<p begin="03:10:37.131" end="03:10:44.150" style="s2">they&#39;re playing they&#39;re terrified normal</p>
<p begin="03:10:41.421" end="03:10:46.641" style="s2">neurotic people who are worried about</p>
<p begin="03:10:44.150" end="03:10:51.141" style="s2">death and suffering so it was a version</p>
<p begin="03:10:46.641" end="03:10:57.080" style="s2">of Pascal&#39;s wager and I if you&#39;ll accept</p>
<p begin="03:10:51.141" end="03:11:00.200" style="s2">that as a label for this point I do</p>
<p begin="03:10:57.080" end="03:11:02.990" style="s2">believe part of what we run into is that</p>
<p begin="03:11:00.200" end="03:11:05.330" style="s2">it is potentially given the calculus</p>
<p begin="03:11:02.990" end="03:11:07.870" style="s2">that has been divinely handed down as</p>
<p begin="03:11:05.330" end="03:11:12.021" style="s2">far as these people are concerned it is</p>
<p begin="03:11:07.870" end="03:11:16.091" style="s2">very dangerous to traffic in skepticism</p>
<p begin="03:11:12.021" end="03:11:18.980" style="s2">and when a somebody comes to you</p>
<p begin="03:11:16.091" end="03:11:22.641" style="s2">challenging the divinity of Jesus for</p>
<p begin="03:11:18.980" end="03:11:24.200" style="s2">example it&#39;s very cheap to fight back in</p>
<p begin="03:11:22.641" end="03:11:25.790" style="s2">fact in the calculus of getting into</p>
<p begin="03:11:24.200" end="03:11:28.820" style="s2">heaven probably that counts for a lot</p>
<p begin="03:11:25.790" end="03:11:32.960" style="s2">and so I do think there&#39;s a distortion</p>
<p begin="03:11:28.820" end="03:11:37.641" style="s2">in how resistant people are and what I</p>
<p begin="03:11:32.960" end="03:11:39.410" style="s2">think needs to happen is we need to both</p>
<p begin="03:11:37.641" end="03:11:41.990" style="s2">sides of the conversation actually need</p>
<p begin="03:11:39.410" end="03:11:44.540" style="s2">to move and I must say I listened</p>
<p begin="03:11:41.990" end="03:11:46.910" style="s2">carefully to your podcast with Richard</p>
<p begin="03:11:44.540" end="03:11:48.561" style="s2">Dawkins mm-hmm and I do have the sense</p>
<p begin="03:11:46.910" end="03:11:51.740" style="s2">that Richard Dawkins is actually in</p>
<p begin="03:11:48.561" end="03:11:55.820" style="s2">motion on a time scale that&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="03:11:51.740" end="03:11:57.710" style="s2">see and that I think you&#39;d you you know</p>
<p begin="03:11:55.820" end="03:11:59.841" style="s2">you did important work with him on your</p>
<p begin="03:11:57.710" end="03:12:02.030" style="s2">podcast and actually you can see exactly</p>
<p begin="03:11:59.841" end="03:12:06.040" style="s2">where it is that he&#39;s hung up in this</p>
<p begin="03:12:02.030" end="03:12:08.690" style="s2">argument where he makes the point that</p>
<p begin="03:12:06.040" end="03:12:10.551" style="s2">he sees the competition between</p>
<p begin="03:12:08.690" end="03:12:12.830" style="s2">religions something like he sees the</p>
<p begin="03:12:10.551" end="03:12:15.080" style="s2">competition between species and he uses</p>
<p begin="03:12:12.830" end="03:12:19.790" style="s2">the example of squirrels in Europe where</p>
<p begin="03:12:15.080" end="03:12:22.011" style="s2">a new world squirrel drives a old world</p>
<p begin="03:12:19.790" end="03:12:26.841" style="s2">squirrel to extinction upon being</p>
<p begin="03:12:22.011" end="03:12:29.990" style="s2">introduced but in any case the slow</p>
<p begin="03:12:26.841" end="03:12:32.000" style="s2">motion that each of us experience in our</p>
<p begin="03:12:29.990" end="03:12:34.370" style="s2">position as we are exposed to higher</p>
<p begin="03:12:32.000" end="03:12:37.221" style="s2">quality versions of what&#39;s on the other</p>
<p begin="03:12:34.370" end="03:12:39.860" style="s2">side is actually I hope going to result</p>
<p begin="03:12:37.221" end="03:12:41.060" style="s2">in us converging where we can do two</p>
<p begin="03:12:39.860" end="03:12:43.550" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="03:12:41.060" end="03:12:49.100" style="s2">we can talk about why it is necessary</p>
<p begin="03:12:43.550" end="03:12:51.310" style="s2">that we at least create a space where we</p>
<p begin="03:12:49.100" end="03:12:57.590" style="s2">have only the rational and we are not</p>
<p begin="03:12:51.310" end="03:13:02.779" style="s2">forced to kowtow to unprovable mystical</p>
<p begin="03:12:57.590" end="03:13:06.079" style="s2">beliefs and the other thing is it would</p>
<p begin="03:13:02.779" end="03:13:08.959" style="s2">be really important if religious people</p>
<p begin="03:13:06.079" end="03:13:13.069" style="s2">would start separating between the</p>
<p begin="03:13:08.959" end="03:13:15.499" style="s2">traditions that they hold dear and the</p>
<p begin="03:13:13.069" end="03:13:18.169" style="s2">mechanisms that prevent those things</p>
<p begin="03:13:15.499" end="03:13:20.919" style="s2">from being scrutinized the very pushback</p>
<p begin="03:13:18.169" end="03:13:25.369" style="s2">that you and I have received is</p>
<p begin="03:13:20.919" end="03:13:28.729" style="s2">turbocharged because what has made it</p>
<p begin="03:13:25.369" end="03:13:30.829" style="s2">durable over time is a mechanism it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="03:13:28.729" end="03:13:34.640" style="s2">immune system that fights that which</p>
<p begin="03:13:30.829" end="03:13:36.800" style="s2">would challenge some of those beliefs my</p>
<p begin="03:13:34.640" end="03:13:39.560" style="s2">point is at this moment in history we</p>
<p begin="03:13:36.800" end="03:13:41.689" style="s2">actually have to open up things that may</p>
<p begin="03:13:39.560" end="03:13:43.369" style="s2">be needed an immune system to prevent</p>
<p begin="03:13:41.689" end="03:13:46.550" style="s2">them from being opened up in the past</p>
<p begin="03:13:43.369" end="03:13:49.550" style="s2">and that means religious people in some</p>
<p begin="03:13:46.550" end="03:13:51.859" style="s2">sense have to you know turn off the</p>
<p begin="03:13:49.550" end="03:13:53.060" style="s2">burglar alarm on those things so that we</p>
<p begin="03:13:51.859" end="03:13:55.310" style="s2">can talk about what role they&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="03:13:53.060" end="03:13:58.399" style="s2">and that that&#39;s going to require their</p>
<p begin="03:13:55.310" end="03:14:00.560" style="s2">participation well it&#39;s a thing they</p>
<p begin="03:13:58.399" end="03:14:03.050" style="s2">naturally do to every other religion</p>
<p begin="03:14:00.560" end="03:14:06.350" style="s2">today it&#39;s the reason why a Christian</p>
<p begin="03:14:03.050" end="03:14:09.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t convert to Islam tonight right</p>
<p begin="03:14:06.350" end="03:14:11.499" style="s2">like just even just the benign neglect I</p>
<p begin="03:14:09.260" end="03:14:13.850" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s the way most atheists</p>
<p begin="03:14:11.499" end="03:14:17.919" style="s2">treat religion most of the time anyway</p>
<p begin="03:14:13.850" end="03:14:20.930" style="s2">it&#39;s not like atheism is predicated on</p>

<p begin="03:14:20.930" end="03:14:24.560" style="s2">trying to update it or trying to find</p>

<p begin="03:14:24.560" end="03:14:29.119" style="s2">just there&#39;s no reason to pay attention</p>
<p begin="03:14:26.779" end="03:14:32.029" style="s2">to it because it is it&#39;s not justified</p>
<p begin="03:14:29.119" end="03:14:34.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what every religious</p>

<p begin="03:14:34.220" end="03:14:44.029" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s actually just</p>
<p begin="03:14:38.649" end="03:14:45.829" style="s2">it&#39;s asking for a coherence in the kind</p>
<p begin="03:14:44.029" end="03:14:50.329" style="s2">of evidentiary tests you would apply to</p>
<p begin="03:14:45.829" end="03:14:52.801" style="s2">any belief that didn&#39;t get smuggled in</p>

<p begin="03:16:16.440" end="03:16:22.200" style="s2">actually it was necessary here given</p>

<p begin="03:16:27.391" end="03:16:32.271" style="s2">optimal given we had it we had a sort of</p>
<p begin="03:16:29.761" end="03:16:35.101" style="s2">bottleneck to get through or you know a</p>

<p begin="03:16:43.740" end="03:16:48.780" style="s2">now when you don&#39;t want to it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="03:16:45.540" end="03:16:53.551" style="s2">when you think of the fact that there</p>
<p begin="03:16:48.780" end="03:16:55.230" style="s2">are kids you know being taught that</p>

<p begin="03:22:23.370" end="03:22:28.200" style="s2">that I mean this is why I&#39;m often</p>
<p begin="03:22:24.630" end="03:22:33.110" style="s2">accused of Islamophobia right I think</p>
<p begin="03:22:28.200" end="03:22:36.630" style="s2">jihadism as a set of ideas just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:22:33.110" end="03:22:39.270" style="s2">the the gloves have to be off with</p>
<p begin="03:22:36.630" end="03:22:42.180" style="s2">respect to how bad this set of ideas is</p>
<p begin="03:22:39.270" end="03:22:44.190" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like do you have to</p>
<p begin="03:22:42.180" end="03:22:44.730" style="s2">pretend to respect Islam as much as you</p>
<p begin="03:22:44.190" end="03:22:46.590" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="03:22:44.730" end="03:22:50.820" style="s2">Anglicanism or to be as patient with it</p>
<p begin="03:22:46.590" end="03:22:54.360" style="s2">no you really don&#39;t because Islam is too</p>
<p begin="03:22:50.820" end="03:22:57.470" style="s2">busy respecting jihadism right and so I</p>
<p begin="03:22:54.360" end="03:22:59.580" style="s2">like it we have to ram this through</p>
<p begin="03:22:57.470" end="03:23:01.260" style="s2">unapologetically right and this is where</p>
<p begin="03:22:59.580" end="03:23:03.480" style="s2">and this politically this becomes</p>
<p begin="03:23:01.260" end="03:23:05.130" style="s2">inconvenient and this is where you know</p>
<p begin="03:23:03.480" end="03:23:07.410" style="s2">you get into circumstances where people</p>
<p begin="03:23:05.130" end="03:23:08.670" style="s2">are criticism criticized in Islam for</p>
<p begin="03:23:07.410" end="03:23:11.010" style="s2">the wrong reasons because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:23:08.670" end="03:23:13.320" style="s2">actually xenophobes and bigots and you</p>
<p begin="03:23:11.010" end="03:23:15.750" style="s2">know neo-nazis and you want to have</p>
<p begin="03:23:13.320" end="03:23:18.510" style="s2">nothing to do with those people but in a</p>
<p begin="03:23:15.750" end="03:23:21.000" style="s2">space where no one left of center will</p>
<p begin="03:23:18.510" end="03:23:24.630" style="s2">say an honest word about the differences</p>
<p begin="03:23:21.000" end="03:23:27.150" style="s2">among religions you know this is this is</p>
<p begin="03:23:24.630" end="03:23:31.230" style="s2">not the time to be mincing words with</p>
<p begin="03:23:27.150" end="03:23:37.020" style="s2">what we know to be true jihadism is not</p>
<p begin="03:23:31.230" end="03:23:39.810" style="s2">the same thing as any other strand of</p>
<p begin="03:23:37.020" end="03:23:44.760" style="s2">mainstream religion now and it is it is</p>
<p begin="03:23:39.810" end="03:23:48.689" style="s2">not the jihadists do not stand to to</p>
<p begin="03:23:44.760" end="03:23:50.760" style="s2">Islam the way the Branch Davidians</p>
<p begin="03:23:48.689" end="03:23:53.010" style="s2">stands stood to Christianity or the</p>
<p begin="03:23:50.760" end="03:23:54.239" style="s2">Westboro Baptist Church stands to</p>
<p begin="03:23:53.010" end="03:23:56.489" style="s2">Christianity I mean this is just that</p>
<p begin="03:23:54.239" end="03:24:00.090" style="s2">these are false analogies it&#39;s a far</p>
<p begin="03:23:56.489" end="03:24:02.880" style="s2">bigger problem as is Islamism you know</p>
<p begin="03:24:00.090" end="03:24:06.989" style="s2">&#39;men to in which mean with with which</p>
<p begin="03:24:02.880" end="03:24:08.760" style="s2">jihadism is wrapped and so again this is</p>
<p begin="03:24:06.989" end="03:24:13.109" style="s2">just a this is a place where I think we</p>
<p begin="03:24:08.760" end="03:24:14.249" style="s2">have to I mean that I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="03:24:13.109" end="03:24:17.670" style="s2">acknowledged there&#39;s a role for</p>
<p begin="03:24:14.249" end="03:24:21.090" style="s2">different voices here but I think we are</p>
<p begin="03:24:17.670" end="03:24:22.800" style="s2">more in the position of you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="03:24:21.090" end="03:24:24.659" style="s2">got a pandemic and unacknowledged</p>
<p begin="03:24:22.800" end="03:24:28.020" style="s2">pandemic and we&#39;ve got these people who</p>
<p begin="03:24:24.659" end="03:24:30.779" style="s2">have a a taboo around even talking about</p>
<p begin="03:24:28.020" end="03:24:33.749" style="s2">the utility of vaccination right and so</p>
<p begin="03:24:30.779" end="03:24:35.670" style="s2">we have to we we have to have it we had</p>
<p begin="03:24:33.749" end="03:24:37.949" style="s2">to do philosophy on a deadline here you</p>
<p begin="03:24:35.670" end="03:24:41.069" style="s2">know this is I agree and I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="03:24:37.949" end="03:24:43.380" style="s2">important one I would only add that I</p>
<p begin="03:24:41.069" end="03:24:48.420" style="s2">want to do that analysis when it comes</p>
<p begin="03:24:43.380" end="03:24:50.189" style="s2">time to it in the proper geopolitical</p>
<p begin="03:24:48.420" end="03:24:51.959" style="s2">context because although I find the</p>
<p begin="03:24:50.189" end="03:24:55.279" style="s2">analysis compelling that there is</p>
<p begin="03:24:51.959" end="03:24:58.350" style="s2">something especially frightening in</p>
<p begin="03:24:55.279" end="03:25:00.899" style="s2">jihadist Islam there&#39;s also a context in</p>
<p begin="03:24:58.350" end="03:25:02.939" style="s2">which it caught fire which I think we</p>
<p begin="03:25:00.899" end="03:25:04.859" style="s2">have to be honest about but anyway</p>
<p begin="03:25:02.939" end="03:25:07.020" style="s2">that&#39;s not no let&#39;s not go down that</p>
<p begin="03:25:04.859" end="03:25:09.180" style="s2">we&#39;re going to our fourth hour what</p>
<p begin="03:25:07.020" end="03:25:10.739" style="s2">we&#39;ll be going into our fourth hour on</p>
<p begin="03:25:09.180" end="03:25:14.939" style="s2">tackle another topic that we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="03:25:10.739" end="03:25:19.770" style="s2">that so Sam let me say this has been a</p>
<p begin="03:25:14.939" end="03:25:23.010" style="s2">great pleasure and an honor and I should</p>
<p begin="03:25:19.770" end="03:25:26.130" style="s2">say often I ask guests where they can</p>
<p begin="03:25:23.010" end="03:25:27.539" style="s2">find you my listeners know exactly where</p>
<p begin="03:25:26.130" end="03:25:30.869" style="s2">they can find you and I will say to them</p>
<p begin="03:25:27.539" end="03:25:35.609" style="s2">that I signed up for your podcast this</p>
<p begin="03:25:30.869" end="03:25:37.800" style="s2">morning and I suggest they do the same</p>
<p begin="03:25:35.609" end="03:25:40.739" style="s2">it actually feels quite good to sign up</p>
<p begin="03:25:37.800" end="03:25:44.399" style="s2">for your podcast it feels like a weight</p>
<p begin="03:25:40.739" end="03:25:46.050" style="s2">off the shoulders and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:25:44.399" end="03:25:48.420" style="s2">something they should certainly consider</p>
<p begin="03:25:46.050" end="03:25:49.829" style="s2">oh nice nice well let&#39;s see how you feel</p>
<p begin="03:25:48.420" end="03:25:53.640" style="s2">when I start reading your mattress ads</p>
<p begin="03:25:49.829" end="03:25:56.630" style="s2">after all right says it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="03:25:53.640" end="03:25:56.630" style="s2">pleasure thanks so much</p>
