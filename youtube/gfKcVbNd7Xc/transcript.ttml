<p begin="00:00:43.540" end="00:00:48.630" style="s2">realization and I made the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.630" end="00:00:50.950" style="s2">we cannot have a scientific theory of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.630" end="00:00:53.739" style="s2">relevance precisely because of a lack of</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.549" end="00:02:21.100" style="s2">trying to argue that the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.310" end="00:02:23.709" style="s2">that operates we saw that what needs to</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.709" end="00:02:27.340" style="s2">system and then the way that operates</p>

<p begin="00:03:00.310" end="00:03:07.239" style="s2">that we could look for the kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:03:28.299" end="00:03:33.400" style="s2">our efficiency and resiliency and then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.269" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">made an argument that they would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.400" end="00:03:37.900" style="s2">susceptible to opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">precisely because they are in a</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:50.170" style="s2">and that if we could get a a cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:04:45.340" end="00:04:51.220" style="s2">more specific and make some suggestions</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.990" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">when I say internal I don&#39;t mean</p>

<p begin="00:17:33.649" end="00:17:38.450" style="s2">want to be right adaptive we</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.860" end="00:17:42.080" style="s2">said you want to be a general problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.450" end="00:17:45.460" style="s2">solver and that&#39;s important but notice</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.080" end="00:17:47.480" style="s2">that that means there&#39;s two kinds of and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.460" end="00:17:51.019" style="s2">people don&#39;t like when I use this word</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.480" end="00:17:52.760" style="s2">but I don&#39;t have an alternative word but</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.019" end="00:17:54.830" style="s2">so I&#39;m just going to use it just if</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.760" end="00:17:57.919" style="s2">there&#39;s two kinds of machines you can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.830" end="00:18:00.529" style="s2">by that what I mean by that is a system</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.919" end="00:18:04.700" style="s2">right that is capable of solving</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.529" end="00:18:12.649" style="s2">problems and pursuing goals in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.700" end="00:18:14.690" style="s2">fashion if I want to be adaptive what do</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.649" end="00:18:18.649" style="s2">i what do i what do i what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.690" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">machine do I want to be well I might</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.649" end="00:18:24.350" style="s2">want to be a general-purpose machine now</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.029" style="s2">these terms are always when I keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.350" end="00:18:27.889" style="s2">showing you that are always relative</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.029" end="00:18:30.019" style="s2">they&#39;re comparative terms in relative I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.889" end="00:18:32.090" style="s2">don&#39;t think anything is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.019" end="00:18:34.929" style="s2">general or absolutely special-purpose</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.090" end="00:18:39.769" style="s2">it&#39;s always a comparative term alright</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.929" end="00:18:43.429" style="s2">but let me give you an example my hand</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.769" end="00:18:46.940" style="s2">is a general-purpose machine right my</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.429" end="00:18:49.789" style="s2">hand is such that it can be used in many</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.940" end="00:18:52.010" style="s2">many different contexts for many many</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.789" end="00:18:54.440" style="s2">different tasks so it&#39;s very general</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.010" end="00:18:56.600" style="s2">purpose all right now the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.440" end="00:18:59.539" style="s2">being a jack-of-all-trades is that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.600" end="00:19:01.490" style="s2">are master of none so the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.539" end="00:19:04.580" style="s2">my hand being general purpose is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.490" end="00:19:07.220" style="s2">for specific tasks it can be out</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.580" end="00:19:09.740" style="s2">competed by a special purpose machine so</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.220" end="00:19:12.529" style="s2">right although this is a good general</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.740" end="00:19:14.210" style="s2">purpose machine it is nowhere you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.529" end="00:19:16.760" style="s2">as good as a hammer for driving in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.210" end="00:19:19.429" style="s2">nail no good as a nowhere as good as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.760" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">screwdriver for removing a screw etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.429" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">so right in some contexts special</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:28.519" style="s2">purpose machines outperform general</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">purpose machines but you wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.519" end="00:19:32.299" style="s2">the following you wouldn&#39;t want you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:34.940" style="s2">I you&#39;re gonna be stranded on a desert</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.299" end="00:19:37.429" style="s2">island like maybe Tom Hanks and castaway</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.940" end="00:19:38.870" style="s2">and he lost all of his special purpose</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.429" end="00:19:41.409" style="s2">tools they sink to the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.870" end="00:19:43.190" style="s2">ocean that causes them a lot of distress</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.409" end="00:19:44.929" style="s2">literally what he starts with that first</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.190" end="00:19:47.299" style="s2">is his hands the general purpose</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.929" end="00:19:50.030" style="s2">machines and the problem you see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.299" end="00:19:53.230" style="s2">wow they&#39;re not doing very good</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.030" end="00:19:57.560" style="s2">just if I just had a good knife right</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.230" end="00:19:59.150" style="s2">but the problem is I wouldn&#39;t want well</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.560" end="00:19:59.990" style="s2">not Tom Hanks but his character forget</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.150" end="00:20:02.360" style="s2">the character&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.990" end="00:20:04.550" style="s2">I think it&#39;s Jack you wouldn&#39;t have Jack</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.360" end="00:20:07.160" style="s2">Jack I&#39;m going to cut off your hands and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.550" end="00:20:08.990" style="s2">you know that I can attach a knife here</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.160" end="00:20:10.340" style="s2">and you know a hammer here and now you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.990" end="00:20:11.930" style="s2">have a hammer a knife it&#39;s like no no no</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.340" end="00:20:14.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t want that either</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.930" end="00:20:21.010" style="s2">I don&#39;t want just a motley collection of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.840" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">special purpose machines okay so</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.010" end="00:20:30.050" style="s2">sometimes your adaptive by being a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:33.980" style="s2">general-purpose machine sometimes your</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.050" end="00:20:40.100" style="s2">adoptive by being a special purpose</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.980" end="00:20:42.050" style="s2">machine so general purpose machine you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.100" end="00:20:46.040" style="s2">use the same thing over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.050" end="00:20:47.930" style="s2">sometimes we make a joke about somebody</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.040" end="00:20:50.990" style="s2">using a special purpose machine as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.930" end="00:20:52.430" style="s2">general purpose machine right when all</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.990" end="00:20:55.460" style="s2">you have is a hammer everything looks</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.430" end="00:20:57.740" style="s2">like a nail right and the joke there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.460" end="00:20:58.790" style="s2">right and it strikes us as a joke</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.740" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">because we know that hammers are</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.790" end="00:21:01.940" style="s2">special-purpose things and everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t a nail it&#39;s not so much a joke if</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.940" end="00:21:06.050" style="s2">I say you know sometimes when all you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.820" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">have is a hand everything looks</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.050" end="00:21:13.340" style="s2">graspable that&#39;s not so weird okay so</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:15.740" style="s2">what are we what am I trying to get you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.340" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">to see what I&#39;m trying to get you to see</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.740" end="00:21:25.040" style="s2">is you want to be able to move between</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:27.980" style="s2">these this is very efficient why because</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.040" end="00:21:30.620" style="s2">I&#39;m using the same thing over and over</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.980" end="00:21:33.770" style="s2">again the same function over and over</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.620" end="00:21:37.130" style="s2">again or at least the state this same</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.770" end="00:21:39.260" style="s2">set of tightly bound functions right the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.130" end="00:21:41.450" style="s2">thing about special purpose right is I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.260" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">won&#39;t use it there you know I don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.450" end="00:21:45.620" style="s2">it that often I use my hammer sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:47.240" style="s2">and my saw sometimes and my screwdriver</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.620" end="00:21:48.920" style="s2">Center and I have to carry around the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.240" end="00:21:51.080" style="s2">toolbox now the problem with that is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.920" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">gets very inefficient because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.080" end="00:21:54.860" style="s2">the times I&#39;m carrying my hammer around</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:57.470" style="s2">and I&#39;m not using it so I have to bear</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.860" end="00:21:59.780" style="s2">the cost of carrying it around and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.470" end="00:22:01.160" style="s2">not using it so it&#39;s very inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.780" end="00:22:03.530" style="s2">but you know what it makes me it makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.160" end="00:22:07.450" style="s2">me Trent tremendously resilient</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.530" end="00:22:11.750" style="s2">because when there&#39;s a lot of new things</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.450" end="00:22:13.400" style="s2">unexpected specific issues that my</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.750" end="00:22:14.300" style="s2">general purpose thing can&#39;t handle I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.400" end="00:22:16.730" style="s2">ready for them</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.300" end="00:22:19.490" style="s2">I have resiliency I&#39;ve got differences</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.730" end="00:22:22.070" style="s2">within my tool box kit that allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.490" end="00:22:23.420" style="s2">deal with these special circumstances so</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.070" end="00:22:25.090" style="s2">notice what I want to do I want</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.420" end="00:22:28.070" style="s2">something want to constantly trade</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.090" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">between them I wants to cook I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.070" end="00:22:32.180" style="s2">constantly trade between them now what</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:34.490" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do I did that to show you this</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.180" end="00:22:37.220" style="s2">I&#39;m then now going to reorganize it this</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.490" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">way because when I&#39;m going to show you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.220" end="00:22:45.170" style="s2">what I&#39;m arguing is general purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">more efficient special purpose is making</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.170" end="00:22:51.500" style="s2">you more resilient and you want to trade</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.720" end="00:22:52.910" style="s2">between them okay so okay now those are</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.500" end="00:22:54.830" style="s2">interactional properties and you said I</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.910" end="00:22:57.790" style="s2">sort of get the analogy what does that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.830" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">have to do with the brain and Bioeconomy</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.790" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">right so how would you try to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:10.700" style="s2">information processing more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:13.850" style="s2">well what I want to do is I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.700" end="00:23:15.740" style="s2">and make the process I&#39;m using the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.850" end="00:23:17.750" style="s2">functions I&#39;m using to be as</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.740" end="00:23:19.550" style="s2">generalizable as possible that will get</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.750" end="00:23:22.940" style="s2">me general purpose because I can use the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.550" end="00:23:28.790" style="s2">same function in many places then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.940" end="00:23:31.730" style="s2">very efficient how do you do that how do</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.790" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">you do that well here&#39;s what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.730" end="00:23:35.180" style="s2">pause and I want to introduce just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:37.700" style="s2">tiny bit of narrative in here when I was</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.230" end="00:24:40.180" style="s2">of the strategies are going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:43.030" style="s2">about here are strategies that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.180" end="00:24:44.050" style="s2">already being developed now I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.030" end="00:24:47.110" style="s2">have to talk about this at a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.050" end="00:24:49.660" style="s2">abstract level because which one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.110" end="00:24:51.670" style="s2">particular architecture is a particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.660" end="00:24:53.650" style="s2">application is going to turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.670" end="00:24:56.770" style="s2">the right one we don&#39;t know yet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.650" end="00:24:58.840" style="s2">still something in progress but I I</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.770" end="00:25:01.660" style="s2">think Tim&#39;s point is very well taken</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:05.050" style="s2">that we shouldn&#39;t be talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.660" end="00:25:07.660" style="s2">in a vacuum we should also see that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.050" end="00:25:10.120" style="s2">people who are trying to make artificial</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.660" end="00:25:11.740" style="s2">intelligence are already implementing</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.120" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">some of these strategies that I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.740" end="00:25:15.070" style="s2">to point out and I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:20.560" style="s2">telling the fact that we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.070" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">convergent argument that way ok so how</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.560" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">do I make a information processing</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">function more generalizable how do I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:35.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">well I want to I mean you know how we do</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.920" end="00:25:40.690" style="s2">it and because you we&#39;ve talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:42.580" style="s2">before but you do it in science all</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.690" end="00:25:46.300" style="s2">right so here&#39;s two variables for</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.580" end="00:25:50.470" style="s2">example it&#39;s not limited to two right</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.300" end="00:25:52.360" style="s2">right and so right I have a scatter plot</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.470" end="00:25:55.750" style="s2">and what they taught you to do right was</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.360" end="00:25:58.900" style="s2">a line of best fit all right this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.750" end="00:26:01.300" style="s2">standard move in Cartesian graphing now</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.900" end="00:26:03.130" style="s2">why do you do a line of best fit you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.300" end="00:26:04.900" style="s2">know and my line of best fit might</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.130" end="00:26:07.270" style="s2">actually touch none of my data points</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.900" end="00:26:10.690" style="s2">does that mean I&#39;m being ridiculously</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.270" end="00:26:13.540" style="s2">irresponsible to the data I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.690" end="00:26:15.160" style="s2">gauging an arm trust population no why</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.540" end="00:26:18.100" style="s2">do we do this why do we do a line of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.160" end="00:26:20.770" style="s2">best fit all right well while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.100" end="00:26:23.710" style="s2">doing this is because it allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.770" end="00:26:27.370" style="s2">interpolate and extrapolate it allows us</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.710" end="00:26:29.260" style="s2">to go beyond the data now we&#39;re taking a</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.370" end="00:26:30.790" style="s2">chance and of course all good science</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.260" end="00:26:31.300" style="s2">and this is this was the great insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.790" end="00:26:33.930" style="s2">of popper</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.300" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">all good science takes good chances</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.930" end="00:26:41.080" style="s2">right but here&#39;s the thing I do this so</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:44.110" style="s2">that I can make predictions right what</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.080" end="00:26:45.400" style="s2">the value of y will be when I have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.110" end="00:26:47.920" style="s2">certain value of x that I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.400" end="00:26:51.120" style="s2">obtained I can interpolate and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.920" end="00:26:55.240" style="s2">extrapolate that means I can generalize</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.120" end="00:27:01.300" style="s2">the function so this is data compression</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.240" end="00:27:05.320" style="s2">this is data compression what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.300" end="00:27:07.690" style="s2">to do is basically pick up on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.320" end="00:27:10.150" style="s2">invariant the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.690" end="00:27:11.740" style="s2">information always contains noise and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.150" end="00:27:15.820" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to pick up on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.740" end="00:27:17.530" style="s2">invariant and extend that and of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.820" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">that&#39;s part and parcel of why we do this</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.530" end="00:27:21.430" style="s2">because in science we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:24.820" style="s2">the inductive generalizations etc etc so</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.430" end="00:27:28.750" style="s2">the way in which I make my functionality</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.820" end="00:27:37.330" style="s2">more general more general purpose is if</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.750" end="00:27:40.180" style="s2">I can do a lot of data compression so if</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.330" end="00:27:41.950" style="s2">the data compression allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.180" end="00:27:43.840" style="s2">generalize my function and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.950" end="00:27:45.990" style="s2">generalization is feeding through the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:49.180" style="s2">sensorimotor loop in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.990" end="00:27:55.570" style="s2">protecting and promoting my autopoietic</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.180" end="00:28:00.850" style="s2">goals it&#39;s going to be reinforced but</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.570" end="00:28:02.530" style="s2">what about the opposite what was</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.850" end="00:28:03.880" style="s2">interesting at the time I think this</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.530" end="00:28:05.230" style="s2">meant some people have picked this up on</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.880" end="00:28:07.030" style="s2">a term we didn&#39;t have a term for this</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.230" end="00:28:08.350" style="s2">and I remember there was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.030" end="00:28:10.120" style="s2">afternoon where Tim and I were just</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.350" end="00:28:14.020" style="s2">trying to come up with what do we want</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.120" end="00:28:15.700" style="s2">for the trade-off so this is making your</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.020" end="00:28:17.170" style="s2">information processing more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.700" end="00:28:19.150" style="s2">more general-purpose</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.170" end="00:28:20.680" style="s2">what makes it more special purpose more</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.150" end="00:28:23.670" style="s2">resilient and so we came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.680" end="00:28:23.670" style="s2">term particularization</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:31.390" style="s2">and tim&#39;s point and i&#39;m not going to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:33.160" style="s2">into detail here tim&#39;s point is this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.390" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">the general strategy that&#39;s at working</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.160" end="00:28:36.970" style="s2">things like the wake-sleep algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">that is at the heart of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.970" end="00:28:42.680" style="s2">learning promoted by Geoffrey Hinton who</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.990" style="s2">was at U of T and Tim</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.680" end="00:28:49.460" style="s2">was a very significant student of Jeff&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.990" end="00:28:52.250" style="s2">and so this is the abstract explanation</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.460" end="00:28:55.010" style="s2">of how that strategy that&#39;s at work in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.250" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">lot of the deep learning of that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.010" end="00:29:00.020" style="s2">the core of a lot of successful they are</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.860" end="00:29:03.410" style="s2">what particular ization is is right as</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.020" end="00:29:05.060" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to keep more in track with</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.410" end="00:29:08.030" style="s2">the data I&#39;m trying to create a function</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.060" end="00:29:11.390" style="s2">that over fits in some sense to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.030" end="00:29:14.560" style="s2">data that will get me more specifically</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.390" end="00:29:17.620" style="s2">in contact with this particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.560" end="00:29:21.830" style="s2">situation so this tends to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.620" end="00:29:30.170" style="s2">what is invariant this tends to get the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.830" end="00:29:33.290" style="s2">system to pick up on more variations so</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.170" end="00:29:36.290" style="s2">this will make the system more cross</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.290" end="00:29:38.270" style="s2">contextual it can move across contexts</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.290" end="00:29:39.370" style="s2">because it can generalize this will tend</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.270" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">to make the system more</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.370" end="00:29:46.190" style="s2">context-sensitive and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:49.210" style="s2">don&#39;t want to maximize any one of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.190" end="00:29:52.250" style="s2">you want them dynamically trading and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.210" end="00:29:54.950" style="s2">notice how they are is this the right</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.250" end="00:29:56.510" style="s2">word I hope so obeying it sounds so</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.950" end="00:30:00.620" style="s2">anthropomorphic notice how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.510" end="00:30:02.510" style="s2">obeying the logistical normativity</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.620" end="00:30:06.290" style="s2">trading between efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.510" end="00:30:08.980" style="s2">resiliency and though there&#39;s various</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.290" end="00:30:12.020" style="s2">ways of doing this right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.980" end="00:30:15.410" style="s2">lots of interesting ways of engineering</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.020" end="00:30:18.440" style="s2">this into but that&#39;s creating a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.410" end="00:30:20.120" style="s2">engine engineering this creating sets of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.440" end="00:30:22.760" style="s2">constraints on this so this will</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.120" end="00:30:27.050" style="s2">oscillate in the right way and optimize</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.760" end="00:30:30.260" style="s2">that way and so the idea is when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.050" end="00:30:34.250" style="s2">got this as something that&#39;s following</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.260" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">the completely internal bio economic</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.250" end="00:30:40.100" style="s2">logistical norms it will result in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.640" end="00:30:43.100" style="s2">evolution of sensorimotor interaction</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.100" end="00:30:46.070" style="s2">that is going to make a system core an</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.100" end="00:30:48.020" style="s2">organism constantly adaptively</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.070" end="00:30:49.580" style="s2">like moving between being</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.020" end="00:30:51.710" style="s2">general-purpose and being</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.580" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">special-purpose it will become very</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.710" end="00:30:55.250" style="s2">adaptive now different organisms will be</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:57.650" style="s2">biologically skewed one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.250" end="00:31:01.100" style="s2">even individuals will be biologically</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.650" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">skewed so there are people now proposing</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.100" end="00:31:06.260" style="s2">for example right that we might</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">understand certain psychopathologies in</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.260" end="00:31:12.710" style="s2">terms of some people are more biased</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:15.320" style="s2">towards overfitting to particular izing</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.710" end="00:31:18.530" style="s2">and some people are more biased towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.320" end="00:31:21.560" style="s2">compressing and generalizing they these</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.530" end="00:31:22.790" style="s2">people tend towards right see many</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.560" end="00:31:25.460" style="s2">connections where there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.790" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">connections right and these people tend</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.460" end="00:31:39.920" style="s2">to be very feature ly bound okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:42.560" style="s2">what&#39;s another one another oh so this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.920" end="00:31:49.810" style="s2">compression particularization right we</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.560" end="00:31:54.500" style="s2">called we call this cognitive scope and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.810" end="00:31:59.350" style="s2">we called this applicability how much</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.500" end="00:31:59.350" style="s2">you can apply your function or functions</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.860" end="00:32:11.390" style="s2">and the idea is if you you can get scope</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:12.890" style="s2">going the right way it will it will and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.390" end="00:32:14.750" style="s2">there&#39;s no other way of it will attach</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.890" end="00:32:17.000" style="s2">to it will get coupled to it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.750" end="00:32:20.090" style="s2">representing it will get coupled to</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.000" end="00:32:22.820" style="s2">right this pattern of interaction which</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.090" end="00:32:39.280" style="s2">a lot of people are talking about this</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.280" end="00:32:44.220" style="s2">this in AI very significantly</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.860" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">question should I stay here and try and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.860" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">get as much as I can out of here</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:23.350" style="s2">or should that&#39;s exploiting or should I</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.900" end="00:33:33.220" style="s2">because the longer I stay here the more</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.599" end="00:37:38.109" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.130" end="00:37:43.059" style="s2">processing right so playing between the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.109" end="00:37:47.880" style="s2">costs and benefits of these etc but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.059" end="00:37:54.849" style="s2">might also need to play between these</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.880" end="00:37:58.349" style="s2">alright so it&#39;s also possible that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.849" end="00:38:05.950" style="s2">have right what we call cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.349" end="00:38:08.470" style="s2">prioritization in which you have cost</p>

<p begin="00:38:26.650" end="00:38:29.470" style="s2">called signal detection theory and other</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.049" end="00:38:39.369" style="s2">you may decide right that you will try</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.099" end="00:38:42.999" style="s2">and sort of hedge your bets and activate</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.570" end="00:42:39.190" style="s2">it makes you integrate it makes you</p>

<p begin="00:43:11.320" end="00:43:14.770" style="s2">because it&#39;s very efficient why do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.150" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">have to do this because if we just</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.459" end="00:44:24.729" style="s2">can do many different things but if I do</p>

<p begin="00:44:26.889" end="00:44:30.159" style="s2">so I need to be both highly</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.499" end="00:48:33.239" style="s2">get into that right now right what</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.259" end="00:48:34.440" style="s2">Spearman found was right that how kids</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.239" end="00:48:35.579" style="s2">were doing in math was actually</p>

<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:14.069" style="s2">many people would argue and I would</p>

<p begin="00:49:35.240" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">Leo showed me we made a good argument is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:45.600" style="s2">that the things we study when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:47.400" style="s2">studying right like when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.600" end="00:49:49.820" style="s2">something like the Wechsler test or</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.400" end="00:49:53.780" style="s2">something that psychometric test right</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.820" end="00:49:56.430" style="s2">so you will test things like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.780" end="00:50:00.660" style="s2">comprehension the comprehension subset</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.430" end="00:50:03.510" style="s2">and of course you&#39;ll concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.660" end="00:50:06.450" style="s2">similarity judgments right you&#39;ll also</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.510" end="00:50:09.570" style="s2">do what right the similarities of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.450" end="00:50:11.180" style="s2">pictures other people have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.570" end="00:50:14.430" style="s2">your ability to adapt to unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.180" end="00:50:16.320" style="s2">environments there&#39;s other work by</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.430" end="00:50:19.290" style="s2">governments and in others the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.320" end="00:50:22.200" style="s2">deal with complex workplaces what I call</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.290" end="00:50:25.290" style="s2">G loaded that require a lot now when you</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.200" end="00:50:27.210" style="s2">trace these back right what this points</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.290" end="00:50:30.210" style="s2">to is your capacity for problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.210" end="00:50:31.650" style="s2">formulation the similarity judgments in</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.210" end="00:50:35.780" style="s2">what are called the adduction abilities</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.650" end="00:50:38.970" style="s2">the ability to draw out latent patterns</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.780" end="00:50:40.890" style="s2">right this of course is similarity</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.970" end="00:50:51.890" style="s2">judgment this is a similarity judgment</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.890" end="00:50:51.890" style="s2">and pattern finding pattern finding</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.800" end="00:51:01.310" style="s2">right the complex you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.860" end="00:51:04.970" style="s2">basically dealing with very ill-defined</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.310" end="00:51:04.970" style="s2">dynamic situations</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.770" end="00:51:20.540" style="s2">the thing is right and adapting to</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.540" style="s2">complex environments</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.930" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">so this is general intelligence this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.760" end="00:51:35.849" style="s2">how we generally tempted to general</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:38.700" style="s2">intelligence we test people across all</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.849" end="00:51:40.500" style="s2">these different kinds of tasks and what</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.700" end="00:51:41.880" style="s2">we find is a strong predictive manifold</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.500" end="00:51:43.829" style="s2">there&#39;s some general ability behind us</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.880" end="00:51:46.380" style="s2">but notice these problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.829" end="00:51:47.970" style="s2">similarity simply you know similarity</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.380" end="00:51:50.130" style="s2">judgments pattern finding dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.970" end="00:51:52.380" style="s2">ill-defined dynamic situations adapting</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.130" end="00:51:55.740" style="s2">to complex environments that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.380" end="00:52:01.020" style="s2">all the places that I&#39;ve argued we need</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.740" end="00:52:02.369" style="s2">relevance realization relevance</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.020" end="00:52:06.839" style="s2">realization what I would argue is</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.369" end="00:52:09.270" style="s2">actually the underlying ability of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.839" end="00:52:13.460" style="s2">general intelligence that&#39;s how we test</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.270" end="00:52:15.690" style="s2">for it this is the things that came out</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.460" end="00:52:18.539" style="s2">right and you can even see you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.690" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">comprehension aspects in here all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.539" end="00:52:24.930" style="s2">of things so relevance realization I</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:29.069" style="s2">think is a very good candidate for your</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.930" end="00:52:31.980" style="s2">general intelligence and so insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.069" end="00:52:35.220" style="s2">general intelligence is a unified thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.980" end="00:52:36.539" style="s2">and we have this is this look this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.220" end="00:52:40.529" style="s2">one of the most robust findings in</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.539" end="00:52:42.329" style="s2">psychology it&#39;s it just keeps happening</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.529" end="00:52:44.099" style="s2">though there&#39;s always debates about it</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.329" end="00:52:45.900" style="s2">ba bla bla ba and people don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.099" end="00:52:46.920" style="s2">psychometric measures of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.900" end="00:52:48.539" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.920" end="00:52:50.069" style="s2">confusing intelligence and relevance and</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.539" end="00:52:52.680" style="s2">wisdom we&#39;ll come back to that they the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.069" end="00:52:55.289" style="s2">thing is this is a very powerful measure</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.680" end="00:52:56.190" style="s2">if I it it&#39;s reliable this is from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.289" end="00:52:59.160" style="s2">1920s</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.190" end="00:53:00.900" style="s2">then this keeps getting replicated this</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.160" end="00:53:04.049" style="s2">is not going through a replication</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.900" end="00:53:06.000" style="s2">crisis and if I had to know one thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.049" end="00:53:08.940" style="s2">about you in order to try and predict</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.000" end="00:53:12.750" style="s2">you the one thing that outperforms</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.940" end="00:53:14.160" style="s2">anything else is knowing this this will</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.750" end="00:53:15.690" style="s2">tell me how you do in school how you do</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:17.849" style="s2">in your relationships how well you treat</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.690" end="00:53:20.880" style="s2">your health how long right you&#39;re likely</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.849" end="00:53:24.150" style="s2">to live whether or not you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:29.069" style="s2">get a job this crushes how well you do</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.150" end="00:53:31.400" style="s2">in a in an interview in predicting</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.069" end="00:53:33.690" style="s2">whether or not you&#39;ll get and keep a job</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.400" end="00:53:35.339" style="s2">is this the only thing that&#39;s predictive</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.690" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">of you know and I&#39;m going to argue later</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.339" end="00:53:39.960" style="s2">that intelligence and rationality are</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2">not identical but is this a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.960" end="00:53:44.520" style="s2">and is it a unified thing yes and can we</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:47.580" style="s2">make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.520" end="00:53:49.200" style="s2">this as relevance realization yes is</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.580" end="00:53:51.390" style="s2">well of its realization there for a</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.200" end="00:53:54.690" style="s2">unified thing yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.390" end="00:53:56.820" style="s2">so relevance realization is your general</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.690" end="00:53:58.440" style="s2">intelligence and what I&#39;m arguing at</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.820" end="00:54:00.060" style="s2">least that&#39;s what I&#39;m arguing and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.440" end="00:54:03.480" style="s2">your general intelligence can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.060" end="00:54:07.800" style="s2">understood as a dynamic developmental</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.480" end="00:54:08.340" style="s2">evolution of your sensory motor fitted</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.800" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">miss</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.340" end="00:54:16.260" style="s2">is regulated by virtual engines that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:18.630" style="s2">ultimately regulated by the logistical</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.260" end="00:54:22.610" style="s2">normativity of the opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.630" end="00:54:22.610" style="s2">between efficiency and resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.280" end="00:54:41.770" style="s2">so we&#39;ve already integrated a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.130" end="00:54:45.020" style="s2">psychology and the beginnings of biology</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.770" end="00:54:46.670" style="s2">in neuroscience I want to next and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.020" end="00:54:48.290" style="s2">definitely integrated with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.670" end="00:54:50.810" style="s2">best insights from artificial</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.290" end="00:54:53.360" style="s2">intelligence what I want to do next time</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.810" end="00:54:56.770" style="s2">to finish off this argument is to show</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.360" end="00:55:00.320" style="s2">how this might be realized in dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.770" end="00:55:02.420" style="s2">processes within the brain and how that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.320" end="00:55:05.600" style="s2">is lining up with some of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.420" end="00:55:09.740" style="s2">cutting-edge ideas I&#39;m spending so much</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.600" end="00:55:12.020" style="s2">time on this because this is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.740" end="00:55:17.210" style="s2">linchpin argument of the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.020" end="00:55:21.790" style="s2">science side of the whole series try to</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.210" end="00:55:27.050" style="s2">show you how everything feeds in to</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.790" end="00:55:30.320" style="s2">relevance realization if I can give you</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.050" end="00:55:33.020" style="s2">a good scientific explanation of this in</p>
