<p begin="00:19:27.770" end="00:19:33.800" style="s2">Othman is it normal to see colors and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.720" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">abstract faces yes that&#39;s very normal so</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.800" end="00:19:40.700" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is some of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:42.950" style="s2">machinery that starts to kick in when we</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.700" end="00:19:47.090" style="s2">might be moving toward sleep visual</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.950" end="00:19:49.970" style="s2">machineries PN seeing cars faces are</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.090" end="00:19:51.650" style="s2">also very powerful because you need sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.970" end="00:19:53.480" style="s2">of internal noise in your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.650" end="00:19:55.670" style="s2">can be interpreted it can often be</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.480" end="00:19:58.430" style="s2">resolved into a face this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.670" end="00:20:00.650" style="s2">normal thing to happen in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.430" end="00:20:02.900" style="s2">just note it try not to get fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.650" end="00:20:04.550" style="s2">by it these inner colors and these</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.900" end="00:20:06.470" style="s2">interfaces can be very fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.550" end="00:20:08.570" style="s2">they&#39;ll tend to lead you into sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.470" end="00:20:11.330" style="s2">hypnagogic state and that could</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.570" end="00:20:14.260" style="s2">potentially lead into you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.330" end="00:20:17.180" style="s2">dreaming while you&#39;re still sitting so</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.260" end="00:20:20.870" style="s2">it&#39;s normal try to note it and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.180" end="00:20:22.520" style="s2">return to the breath I find my most</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.870" end="00:20:23.270" style="s2">common distraction is storytelling this</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.870" end="00:20:37.990" style="s2">the most frequent forms of distraction</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.750" end="00:20:41.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why I recommend not watching</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.990" end="00:20:43.400" style="s2">movies listening to the radio listening</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.240" end="00:20:44.810" style="s2">to music or talking especially having an</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:03.139" style="s2">distractions so that&#39;s coming right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.190" end="00:21:05.570" style="s2">I know this is a little bit sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.139" end="00:21:06.289" style="s2">right but if you could just keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.570" end="00:21:08.899" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.289" end="00:21:10.970" style="s2">labeling the distraction and returning</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.899" end="00:21:12.919" style="s2">to your breath labeling the destruction</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.970" end="00:21:15.139" style="s2">returning she&#39;d rather just keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.919" end="00:21:17.269" style="s2">that and then next Monday and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.139" end="00:21:19.340" style="s2">following Monday those two lessons will</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.269" end="00:21:21.380" style="s2">be dedicated to how do we work with</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.340" end="00:21:24.260" style="s2">distractions and one of the things we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.380" end="00:21:26.630" style="s2">talk about is how do you deal with with</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.260" end="00:21:29.659" style="s2">something like that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.630" end="00:21:31.820" style="s2">incessant the monkey mind that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.659" end="00:21:34.070" style="s2">basically that inner chattering speaking</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.820" end="00:21:35.870" style="s2">line storytelling on running scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.070" end="00:21:38.690" style="s2">what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.870" end="00:21:40.460" style="s2">your brain is when you go into this</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.690" end="00:21:42.830" style="s2">state now you&#39;re going into what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.460" end="00:21:45.019" style="s2">called the default mode Network and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.830" end="00:21:47.149" style="s2">is the network we do when we do is for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.019" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">mental time travel and we run scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.149" end="00:21:52.970" style="s2">in our heads and have conversations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:55.399" style="s2">sort of it&#39;s at the core of mine water</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.970" end="00:21:57.559" style="s2">and normally these two networks the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.399" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">network that is involved with being task</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.559" end="00:22:01.789" style="s2">focused and concentrating and being</p>

<p begin="00:22:01.789" end="00:22:07.039" style="s2">default mode they they sort of switch on</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.039" end="00:22:11.179" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do and it takes that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.929" end="00:22:15.049" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit of a you know it takes some</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.269" end="00:22:21.470" style="s2">to have all that internal awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.370" end="00:22:25.010" style="s2">goes with the default of network but</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.470" end="00:22:27.260" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to activate the task focus</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.010" end="00:22:30.110" style="s2">network so you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.260" end="00:22:32.120" style="s2">mind-wandering because it looks like if</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.110" end="00:22:34.429" style="s2">you could Co activate these that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.120" end="00:22:36.679" style="s2">actually forced the most and greatest</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.429" end="00:22:42.070" style="s2">potential for transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.679" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">profound insight next one but suka</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.070" end="00:22:46.820" style="s2">should we find the focus for some time I</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">am or could you raise the questions</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.820" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">please I can&#39;t see them all on my screen</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.169" end="00:22:58.130" style="s2">suka is asking should we find a focus</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.360" end="00:23:01.340" style="s2">for some time after finding the flow and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.130" end="00:23:02.809" style="s2">then go back to noting only in and out</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.340" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">with each breath that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.809" end="00:23:07.460" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right so once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:08.540" style="s2">found your focus by counting the breath</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.460" end="00:23:11.450" style="s2">to get that set</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.540" end="00:23:15.830" style="s2">or momentum of mindfulness a constant</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.450" end="00:23:18.260" style="s2">renewal of interest you then just go</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.830" end="00:23:19.930" style="s2">back then don&#39;t you following the breath</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.260" end="00:23:23.050" style="s2">just with Internet that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.930" end="00:23:26.540" style="s2">Lin Slater hi Lin it&#39;s a it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.050" end="00:23:28.250" style="s2">see you again when I can&#39;t breath I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.540" end="00:23:30.230" style="s2">a tendency to force it and I have to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.250" end="00:23:33.110" style="s2">back to and I have to go back to just</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.230" end="00:23:36.200" style="s2">focusing on the breath yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.110" end="00:23:37.700" style="s2">so perhaps Lin if you could do if</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.200" end="00:23:40.790" style="s2">there&#39;s something else you could do</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.700" end="00:23:43.070" style="s2">instead of counting the breath to try</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.790" end="00:23:45.560" style="s2">and notice when you&#39;ve had some</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.070" end="00:23:46.160" style="s2">continuity some people I don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.560" end="00:23:48.500" style="s2">this works</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.160" end="00:23:54.800" style="s2">some people recite the alphabet ABCD</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.500" end="00:23:57.650" style="s2">that seems to be to be different or just</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.800" end="00:24:00.430" style="s2">by following the breath and maybe trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.650" end="00:24:04.280" style="s2">to note right when you&#39;re distracted</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.430" end="00:24:07.880" style="s2">right spontaneously oh I was I was with</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.280" end="00:24:10.520" style="s2">my breath for you know the last minute</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.880" end="00:24:12.830" style="s2">or two maybe try that as a maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.520" end="00:24:19.460" style="s2">will get you out of that tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.830" end="00:24:22.130" style="s2">control the breath Victoria my ex</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.460" end="00:24:27.380" style="s2">student at Caen John explains such an or</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.130" end="00:24:30.020" style="s2">detail yes such this is when you come in</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.380" end="00:24:32.660" style="s2">to think about the think about the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.020" end="00:24:35.180" style="s2">being mode so right now you know I just</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.660" end="00:24:36.890" style="s2">have I just have this in my pocket but</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.180" end="00:24:40.250" style="s2">if I step back and I start to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.890" end="00:24:42.610" style="s2">this as like a work of art I start to</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.250" end="00:24:47.720" style="s2">open up and I start to become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.610" end="00:24:49.580" style="s2">how it has a presencing that is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.720" end="00:24:52.910" style="s2">categorical and the nature the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.580" end="00:24:55.850" style="s2">is the inexhaustible nosov this beyond</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.910" end="00:24:59.030" style="s2">any of the categories by which i try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.850" end="00:25:01.730" style="s2">capture it so as i start to unfold right</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.030" end="00:25:03.980" style="s2">that the depths of all of this all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.730" end="00:25:05.900" style="s2">its features all of its properties all</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.980" end="00:25:08.360" style="s2">of those are categorical but I get a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.900" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">sense I get a sense of the suchness I</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.360" end="00:25:13.130" style="s2">get a sense of that about this that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:15.170" style="s2">transcends all of my identities that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.130" end="00:25:18.260" style="s2">all the identities I assigned to it all</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.170" end="00:25:20.900" style="s2">of the categories that I that I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.260" end="00:25:23.540" style="s2">for in which I place it in order to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.900" end="00:25:26.210" style="s2">cognitively control and consume it like</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.540" end="00:25:27.770" style="s2">bringing it into a category so when</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.210" end="00:25:30.820" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to open up to the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.770" end="00:25:34.850" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to open up to what this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.820" end="00:25:37.070" style="s2">here now and in its we&#39;re the fullness</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.850" end="00:25:41.330" style="s2">of its presence in and of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.070" end="00:25:46.700" style="s2">everything has such nice and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.330" end="00:25:51.650" style="s2">a sense in which the suchness is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.700" end="00:25:55.520" style="s2">a focal awareness of the more Ness of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.650" end="00:25:58.160" style="s2">particular thing so I hope that was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.520" end="00:25:59.990" style="s2">little too abstract for you but so what</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.160" end="00:26:02.900" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do is which one right</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.990" end="00:26:06.710" style="s2">and and notice again how you do have</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.900" end="00:26:08.750" style="s2">that moments of profound love when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.710" end="00:26:12.470" style="s2">realize that you&#39;re seeing your beloved</p>

<p begin="00:26:28.790" end="00:26:35.270" style="s2">something that&#39;s to try and relate to it</p>
