<p begin="00:00:00.230" end="00:00:05.549" style="s2">hi there and so in the first video I</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.240" end="00:00:08.130" style="s2">identified three things that I was going</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.549" end="00:00:11.030" style="s2">to focus on in these videos namely rival</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">ristmas the broadcast modality of</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.030" end="00:00:16.289" style="s2">decision making and the complex versus</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:19.199" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.289" end="00:00:20.970" style="s2">the reason it&#39;s those three things the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">reason those those are the three</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.970" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">subjects of these videos are that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">every iteration of game a it is some</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:31.260" style="s2">combination of those three dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">which have eventually caused the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.260" end="00:00:38.700" style="s2">collapse of the civilization and so it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">is those three areas in particular that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:44.460" style="s2">game B is focused on trying to find a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:46.550" style="s2">way to overturn these dynamics so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.460" end="00:00:48.420" style="s2">the civilization is long-term</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.550" end="00:00:49.649" style="s2">sustainable you know not just for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.420" end="00:00:52.620" style="s2">couple of hundred years but you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:54.660" style="s2">over many millennia and continues to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.620" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">evolve and continues to grow so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.660" end="00:01:00.629" style="s2">the that&#39;s the vision for game B so this</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">video is focused on the rival risk and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.629" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">the anti rivalries and just before I get</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">into definitions I would like to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:10.229" style="s2">warning that it is sometimes the case I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">will try to give these warnings whenever</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">this happens that the language that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">used is not used in the everyday sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">of the word and so rival wrists nurse is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">not the same thing as rivalry so rivalry</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.540" style="s2">in the sense of you know two squash</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:29.850" style="s2">players getting together evenly matched</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:32.490" style="s2">have a really really hard game one wins</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">one loses but actually in a broader</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">sense both people at one they&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">really good time they&#39;ve played better</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">than they&#39;ve ever played before you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">so they both both are winners in that in</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">that grander sense in a similar way if</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:47.369" style="s2">you&#39;re having an argument with someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:48.869" style="s2">in order to refine and strengthen the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.369" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">proposition that they&#39;re offering you</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.869" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">know it&#39;s noisy again it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">collaborative effort you&#39;re arguing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:01:59.909" style="s2">exhibiting rivalry but it is not rival</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">risk because you&#39;re not seeking to beat</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.909" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">the other person right you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">seeking to win at their expense and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">is the crucial difference between</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">rivalry which can be constructive and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:11.380" style="s2">even generative and rival risk which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:13.510" style="s2">win</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.380" end="00:02:15.700" style="s2">you know one person gains at the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.510" end="00:02:18.520" style="s2">person&#39;s expense it&#39;s a it&#39;s a crucial</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.700" end="00:02:20.740" style="s2">difference to understand okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.520" end="00:02:23.140" style="s2">said let&#39;s move on and look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.740" end="00:02:25.180" style="s2">definitions of the rival risk and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.140" end="00:02:27.790" style="s2">non rival risk as I am using them in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.180" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">this video so the domain of the rivalry</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.790" end="00:02:33.580" style="s2">spaces recovers any kind of physical</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:35.950" style="s2">item right where I have it somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.580" end="00:02:38.740" style="s2">can&#39;t have it and and and so that win</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.950" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">lose dynamic is perpetuated so anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.740" end="00:02:43.630" style="s2">at all food water even air</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:46.510" style="s2">I mean air is a good example is at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.630" end="00:02:48.070" style="s2">moment air is basically clean right we</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.510" end="00:02:49.510" style="s2">just breathe it it&#39;s completely abundant</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.070" end="00:02:52.300" style="s2">so we don&#39;t compete for it right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.510" end="00:02:55.210" style="s2">no rival risk dynamics surrounding air</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.300" end="00:02:57.130" style="s2">if however in the future the air gets</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.210" end="00:03:00.100" style="s2">yucky and smelly and we can&#39;t breathe it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.130" end="00:03:01.930" style="s2">anymore then clean air will become a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.100" end="00:03:03.820" style="s2">rival risk commodity right some people</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.930" end="00:03:05.110" style="s2">will have it and some people won&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.820" end="00:03:07.090" style="s2">the people that have it have it at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.110" end="00:03:10.050" style="s2">expense of the people that don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.090" end="00:03:12.790" style="s2">so you know even things which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.050" end="00:03:14.890" style="s2">completely non rival risk that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.790" end="00:03:16.630" style="s2">that&#39;s the end of the spectrum where you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.890" end="00:03:18.160" style="s2">have complete abundance so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.630" end="00:03:20.050" style="s2">need to compete for it even things which</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.160" end="00:03:22.600" style="s2">are non rivals can become rivals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.050" end="00:03:25.510" style="s2">vice versa things which are highly rival</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.600" end="00:03:27.700" style="s2">risk by being made more available can</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.510" end="00:03:31.690" style="s2">become less rival s so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.700" end="00:03:34.600" style="s2">pretty straightforward the anti rival</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.690" end="00:03:36.820" style="s2">risk domain and these are things which</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.600" end="00:03:38.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of strands to this so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.820" end="00:03:41.260" style="s2">the first thing is that the more people</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.830" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">have it it does not become depleted in</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.260" end="00:03:45.310" style="s2">any way right so this applies to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">non-physical things good examples of non</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.310" end="00:03:51.100" style="s2">rival risk things are what ideas broadly</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">in general but more specific examples</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.100" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">the Internet is an excellent example</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:57.300" style="s2">mathematics is an excellent example</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:00.070" style="s2">languages are an excellent example</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.300" end="00:04:01.690" style="s2">Facebook is a really good example so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.070" end="00:04:04.810" style="s2">within all of these things the more</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.690" end="00:04:06.430" style="s2">people that use them the better they are</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.810" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">right the more powerful they are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.430" end="00:04:12.190" style="s2">more useful they are and it doesn&#39;t cost</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:13.720" style="s2">the people that already have it it costs</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.190" end="00:04:16.209" style="s2">them nothing for more people to have it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.720" end="00:04:18.459" style="s2">right so that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing it does</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.209" end="00:04:20.710" style="s2">not get depleted it gets stronger as</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.459" end="00:04:23.020" style="s2">more people use it and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.710" end="00:04:24.540" style="s2">is that it&#39;s generative right so anti</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.020" end="00:04:27.030" style="s2">rivalries things allow</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.540" end="00:04:28.290" style="s2">all things to come on top of them again</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.030" end="00:04:30.950" style="s2">the Internet is an excellent example</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.290" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">right so once the internet was invented</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.950" end="00:04:37.410" style="s2">then a whole bunch of new technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:39.210" style="s2">were possible as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.410" end="00:04:40.770" style="s2">invention of the internet and then once</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.210" end="00:04:43.170" style="s2">those were layered on top and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.770" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">prepared the ground for another layer of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.170" end="00:04:46.650" style="s2">innovation to come on top of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.660" style="s2">on and so on and so on and so just to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.650" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2">sum up one more time the anti rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.660" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">is not depleted the more people but have</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:55.470" style="s2">it in fact it&#39;s more useful stronger</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:04:58.290" style="s2">better the more people that have it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.470" end="00:05:01.970" style="s2">is generative allows new innovation to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.290" end="00:05:01.970" style="s2">be built on top of the old innovation</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.300" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">okay so now that the definitions are out</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.030" end="00:05:14.510" style="s2">of the way it&#39;s worth making the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:17.540" style="s2">that we have existed in rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.510" end="00:05:20.150" style="s2">dynamics for every iteration of game a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.540" end="00:05:22.250" style="s2">for 12,000 years because for the very</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.150" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">large majority that there was genuine</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.250" end="00:05:27.380" style="s2">scarcity and so to have a mindset of I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:28.820" style="s2">need to protect this because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.380" end="00:05:30.050" style="s2">someone else can take it and then I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.820" end="00:05:31.370" style="s2">don&#39;t have it and there&#39;s not enough to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.050" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">go around you know that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.370" end="00:05:36.710" style="s2">mindset was largely justified but that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:38.270" style="s2">is no longer the case right the world we</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.710" end="00:05:41.810" style="s2">live in now the technology available to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.270" end="00:05:45.110" style="s2">us now scarcity in a huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.810" end="00:05:47.390" style="s2">physical items could be simply</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.110" end="00:05:49.580" style="s2">alleviated right and therefore reducing</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.390" end="00:05:52.450" style="s2">the degree to which we need to be rival</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.580" end="00:05:55.340" style="s2">Burress over these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.450" end="00:05:57.650" style="s2">the ultimate evolution of rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.340" end="00:06:00.110" style="s2">dynamics is war and this is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.650" end="00:06:02.660" style="s2">such a crucial thing to tackle because</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.110" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">as I said in the first video our ability</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.660" end="00:06:09.290" style="s2">to do war now is such that we could wipe</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">us entirely out and not to mention a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.290" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">great deal of the rest of the stuff on</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:17.030" style="s2">the planet so the need to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">rivalries dynamics is crucial the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.030" end="00:06:21.650" style="s2">really ugly part of this is because we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:23.540" style="s2">have this rival risk mindset right this</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.650" end="00:06:25.400" style="s2">is the lens through which we see the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.540" end="00:06:26.900" style="s2">world we evaluate everything in these</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.400" end="00:06:30.020" style="s2">terms even things which are</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.900" end="00:06:33.230" style="s2">fundamentally anti rivals get dragged</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.020" end="00:06:35.270" style="s2">into the rival risk domain so using</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.230" end="00:06:37.370" style="s2">Facebook again as an example right I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.270" end="00:06:38.870" style="s2">mean Facebook is a fundamentally anti</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.370" end="00:06:41.180" style="s2">rival risk thing the more people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.870" end="00:06:45.350" style="s2">have it them more useful it becomes its</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.180" end="00:06:47.900" style="s2">generative all sorts of groups and idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.350" end="00:06:49.640" style="s2">tanks and so on start forming within the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.900" end="00:06:51.410" style="s2">context of that right so it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.640" end="00:06:54.860" style="s2">absolutely an anti rivalries thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.410" end="00:06:57.880" style="s2">however because it exists in a rival</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.860" end="00:07:00.380" style="s2">risk environment it is forced to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.880" end="00:07:02.900" style="s2">generate revenue for itself how does it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.380" end="00:07:05.090" style="s2">do that through advertising what gets</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.900" end="00:07:07.700" style="s2">more advertising revenue well more time</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.090" end="00:07:09.080" style="s2">on site was sticky you are the more time</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.700" end="00:07:10.820" style="s2">you can get people to spend on your site</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.080" end="00:07:14.990" style="s2">the bigger advertising revenues will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.820" end="00:07:18.260" style="s2">and so Facebook is strongly incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.990" end="00:07:19.249" style="s2">to use whatever means it can to attract</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.260" end="00:07:21.079" style="s2">people to excite</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.249" end="00:07:23.149" style="s2">and to keep them there right is there</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.079" end="00:07:26.149" style="s2">they&#39;re essentially competing for your</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.149" end="00:07:28.069" style="s2">attention they&#39;re competing with you for</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.149" end="00:07:30.469" style="s2">your attention and for your time and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.069" end="00:07:32.239" style="s2">you are now in a rival risk relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.469" end="00:07:35.359" style="s2">with Facebook because this is unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.239" end="00:07:37.339" style="s2">to be in your best interest writer to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.359" end="00:07:40.069" style="s2">spend hours and hours a day on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.339" end="00:07:42.699" style="s2">as they would like you to so you are now</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.069" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">in rival risk relationship with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.699" end="00:07:47.329" style="s2">fundamentally anti rival hrus thing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:49.069" style="s2">so if we go back to the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.329" end="00:07:52.839" style="s2">the anti rival is that it is generative</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.069" end="00:07:55.699" style="s2">by trapping it in the rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.839" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">environment you are restricting its</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.699" end="00:08:00.079" style="s2">ability to be generative the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:03.139" style="s2">intellectual property patent laws these</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.079" end="00:08:05.119" style="s2">things serve to restrict the number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.139" end="00:08:07.669" style="s2">people who can work on any given idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.119" end="00:08:10.849" style="s2">and so the generative nature of the anti</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.669" end="00:08:14.089" style="s2">rivalries is forever stifled and stymied</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.849" end="00:08:16.219" style="s2">by its existence in a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.089" end="00:08:20.409" style="s2">rivalries environment and this to me is</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.219" end="00:08:23.749" style="s2">the most important aspect of the game be</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.409" end="00:08:25.989" style="s2">ideal of transmuting the rival risk into</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.749" end="00:08:28.459" style="s2">the anti rivalry signing apart from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.989" end="00:08:30.169" style="s2">avoidance of war which is I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.459" end="00:08:32.509" style="s2">mentioned is crucial because you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.169" end="00:08:34.550" style="s2">our ability to make war is so</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.509" end="00:08:36.949" style="s2">self-destructive now but you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.550" end="00:08:39.319" style="s2">can picture for a moment a global</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.949" end="00:08:42.829" style="s2">completely anti rival replying field</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.319" end="00:08:45.019" style="s2">right where every single contribution</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.829" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">that everybody makes every innovation</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.019" end="00:08:49.309" style="s2">every new idea that anybody has is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:51.709" style="s2">accessible to everyone right it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.309" end="00:08:54.019" style="s2">the property of the commons collectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.709" end="00:08:55.459" style="s2">owned by everyone and so I make my</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.019" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">contributions in the good faith</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.459" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">knowledge and understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:00.470" style="s2">everybody else is making their</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:03.290" style="s2">contributions and we all have access to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.470" end="00:09:05.959" style="s2">all contributions via the common pool</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.290" end="00:09:08.059" style="s2">and so this is the anti ultimate anti</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.959" end="00:09:10.550" style="s2">rival risk environment because this you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.059" end="00:09:12.139" style="s2">know the the generative nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.550" end="00:09:13.790" style="s2">ability to build on everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.139" end="00:09:14.899" style="s2">contributions at any given moment would</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.790" end="00:09:17.959" style="s2">just mean that the rate of progress</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.899" end="00:09:21.589" style="s2">would be would be staggering ok so just</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.959" end="00:09:24.490" style="s2">a summer the rivalries dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.589" end="00:09:28.429" style="s2">have always existed in game a have torn</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.490" end="00:09:31.129" style="s2">civilizations apart in the past you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.429" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">rivalries and rivalries leads to things</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.129" end="00:09:36.050" style="s2">like corruption</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:38.569" style="s2">defection and hoarding and so on which</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.050" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">is hugely detrimental to the society as</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.569" end="00:09:44.689" style="s2">a whole and so tackling rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:47.959" style="s2">dynamics is one of the key features of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.689" end="00:09:49.459" style="s2">the game be project and this broadly</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.959" end="00:09:51.319" style="s2">happens in two ways number one</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.459" end="00:09:53.420" style="s2">alleviating scarcity so that things</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.319" end="00:09:55.220" style="s2">which have the potential to be rival as</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.420" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">are made as non rival risk as possible</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.220" end="00:10:01.430" style="s2">and the second part of it more</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:04.689" style="s2">importantly it might you is unshackling</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.430" end="00:10:08.029" style="s2">the anti rival risk from the restrictive</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.689" end="00:10:10.009" style="s2">environment of the rival bus so I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.029" end="00:10:12.439" style="s2">that pretty much covers it next one is</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.009" end="00:10:15.589" style="s2">going to be on broadcast modality versus</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.439" end="00:10:17.420" style="s2">decentralized since making networks and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.589" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">they kind of link together because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.420" end="00:10:22.639" style="s2">know this problem of rival richness has</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:26.329" style="s2">never been solved before so the creation</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.639" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">of new sense making and decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.329" end="00:10:30.769" style="s2">networks may have the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:32.509" style="s2">solving that which has not been solved</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.769" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">before so I look forward to seeing you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.509" end="00:10:35.949" style="s2">next time thank you very much for</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:35.949" style="s2">watching</p>
