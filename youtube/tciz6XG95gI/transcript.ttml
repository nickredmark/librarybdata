<p begin="00:00:00.120" end="00:00:04.350" style="s2">why were one of the points that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.860" end="00:00:05.910" style="s2">mentioned that I thought was so</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.350" end="00:00:07.109" style="s2">important even though you only mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.910" end="00:00:08.970" style="s2">it briefly as you said we&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.109" end="00:00:11.309" style="s2">last turn on the spiral right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.970" end="00:00:14.070" style="s2">this universal human and future stages</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.309" end="00:00:15.870" style="s2">predicted and implicit in the way you</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">were talking about it was this parental</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.870" end="00:00:21.539" style="s2">energy this birthing the future that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">talked about so often it really comes</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.539" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">through the reclaiming of your</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:34.620" style="s2">motherhood Parenthood in global humanity</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.679" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">wide kind of fashion mm-hm and as we</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.620" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">were talking about in the last session</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">part of becoming fully human is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:42.270" style="s2">fully adult which includes</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:43.739" style="s2">this parental energy extending beyond</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.270" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">whether it includes our biological</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.739" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">children or not extending to the future</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:50.940" style="s2">of humanity as a whole and how to really</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">engage that fully take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.940" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">for it which extends back to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">thinking seven generations ahead kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">concept and taking responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:01.109" style="s2">wanting our kids just like with our</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">biological kids wanting them to not just</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.109" end="00:01:05.580" style="s2">have everything we had but to have more</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.629" end="00:01:07.590" style="s2">to transcend us to go beyond and to set</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.580" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">up a situation for that and to now</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">really be thinking about that globally</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:12.689" style="s2">for the first time ever because seven</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">generations ahead was tribal in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.689" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">previously and we get to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">globally and that requires for them to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">have that opportunity not just to care</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">for them but for the Commons that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">supports them that&#39;s such a huge topic</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">it is and you know we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:30.390" style="s2">feminine co-creator and one of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">about the feminist she gives loves to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.390" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">give birth and when the birth is</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">happening it&#39;s a mess but she has this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:42.210" style="s2">innate hope for what&#39;s coming when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">would look at the world right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.210" end="00:01:46.890" style="s2">not so hard to have innate hope if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">think of what&#39;s being created it really</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.890" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">is an amazing slight flip of attention</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">because we&#39;re almost always noticing</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">what&#39;s not working so I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:00.869" style="s2">not even thinking seven generations</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">ahead the way I feel about it it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.869" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">generation because we&#39;re all here and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have seven generations to go like</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:12.610" style="s2">we&#39;re going therefore it&#39;s very similar</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:16.270" style="s2">to her birth when the time is</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.610" end="00:02:18.070" style="s2">the birth it&#39;s going to be born what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.270" end="00:02:20.710" style="s2">going to happen it&#39;s going to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.070" end="00:02:23.380" style="s2">the next 10 to 15 years it&#39;s not many</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.710" end="00:02:25.270" style="s2">many generations ahead so I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.380" end="00:02:28.270" style="s2">of the fastest thing that could be done</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.270" end="00:02:31.480" style="s2">that would make this shift the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.270" end="00:02:34.780" style="s2">gentle birth possible and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.480" end="00:02:39.220" style="s2">connecting what&#39;s creative but you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.780" end="00:02:41.500" style="s2">this generation yeah connecting there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.220" end="00:02:43.209" style="s2">kind of two pieces here and that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.500" end="00:02:45.370" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about one down there</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.209" end="00:02:48.040" style="s2">talking about the other and in your</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.370" end="00:02:50.530" style="s2">presentation which was so wonderful you</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.040" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">focused on the kind of the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.530" end="00:02:55.150" style="s2">social synergy that&#39;s here right now I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:57.400" style="s2">did right and Daniel you&#39;re pointing</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.150" end="00:02:58.450" style="s2">kind of towards the future right and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.400" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">know I&#39;m gonna start with the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.450" end="00:03:01.720" style="s2">then go into into kind of our unique</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:03.910" style="s2">self book and the socials with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.720" end="00:03:06.820" style="s2">social synergy there&#39;s there&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.910" end="00:03:09.370" style="s2">text which is one of those elusive</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.820" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">Aramaic text that you know when I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.370" end="00:03:13.959" style="s2">fall asleep I I look for you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:16.900" style="s2">instead of Prozac kind of helps you get</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.959" end="00:03:19.750" style="s2">through the day yeah which talks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.900" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">why Abraham is the first covenant apart</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.750" end="00:03:24.250" style="s2">nur right in the kind of classical you</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:26.110" style="s2">know biblical story you know cuz after</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.250" end="00:03:28.090" style="s2">Noah was a competitor and Adam was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.110" end="00:03:29.830" style="s2">competitor and Abram gets the job mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.090" end="00:03:31.870" style="s2">and and the elusive tech suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.830" end="00:03:34.600" style="s2">he gets the job because he has the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.870" end="00:03:36.370" style="s2">person have a grandchild right right</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.600" end="00:03:38.950" style="s2">that he&#39;s actually able to transmit his</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.370" end="00:03:41.110" style="s2">values to generations which is this very</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.950" end="00:03:42.549" style="s2">powerful ability you know he creates the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.110" end="00:03:45.430" style="s2">beginning of this kind of covenantal</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.549" end="00:03:47.769" style="s2">community that actually moves through</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.430" end="00:03:49.180" style="s2">the generations yes so that&#39;s one kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.769" end="00:03:51.640" style="s2">of movement one kind of covenant that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.180" end="00:03:53.140" style="s2">moves across the generations and in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.640" end="00:03:55.510" style="s2">sense the only we could think of right</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.140" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">was how to how to cross generations how</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.510" end="00:03:59.890" style="s2">to link generations now the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:02.200" style="s2">looking you&#39;re talking about has that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.890" end="00:04:05.380" style="s2">old linking of generations but then it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.200" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">has this linking right now between all</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.380" end="00:04:09.489" style="s2">the different dimensions that exist in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:11.410" style="s2">earth today right right between all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.489" end="00:04:13.480" style="s2">different creative forces whether they</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.410" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">exist and how do we bring right the kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.480" end="00:04:20.049" style="s2">of leading-edge you know creative</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:22.630" style="s2">emergent you know minds hearts right</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.049" end="00:04:24.370" style="s2">together in this new higher synergy yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.630" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">so that&#39;s those are two to two pieces</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.370" end="00:04:26.970" style="s2">and they need</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:28.170" style="s2">each other and they need each other and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.970" end="00:04:30.330" style="s2">they need each other and they need each</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.170" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">other so I&#39;m gonna cuz maybe suggest a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.330" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">third piece of the matrix and we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:36.540" style="s2">a Holy Trinity you know going and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:39.300" style="s2">think this pieces is critical because</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.540" end="00:04:42.870" style="s2">without it I can&#39;t quite see how it will</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.300" end="00:04:45.180" style="s2">happen which is we also need to link</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.870" end="00:04:46.440" style="s2">together it used to be that in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.180" end="00:04:48.390" style="s2">different generations you at different</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.440" end="00:04:50.010" style="s2">levels of consciousness right see if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.390" end="00:04:51.720" style="s2">use like Kepler&#39;s model you know you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.010" end="00:04:53.130" style="s2">kind of move through different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.720" end="00:04:55.470" style="s2">consciousness throughout as history</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.130" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">emerges and cultural evolution but today</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.470" end="00:04:59.130" style="s2">around the globe we have all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:01.980" style="s2">different levels of consciousness around</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.130" end="00:05:03.720" style="s2">the globe right now yes right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.980" end="00:05:05.580" style="s2">actually have to link those different</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.720" end="00:05:06.870" style="s2">levels of consciousness that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.580" end="00:05:08.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s part of what we try we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.870" end="00:05:12.270" style="s2">trying to do here in these weeks we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.580" end="00:05:15.510" style="s2">to create a story in which the the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.270" end="00:05:18.480" style="s2">biblical right thinker has a place the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.510" end="00:05:20.790" style="s2">person in Islam has a place right the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.480" end="00:05:23.370" style="s2">Christian has a place the agnostic has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.790" end="00:05:25.350" style="s2">place we need to create a story which</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.370" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t pander to we don&#39;t to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.350" end="00:05:27.780" style="s2">backwards we&#39;re not gonna be regressive</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna be homophobic we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.780" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">gonna be up no eccentric but for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">we&#39;ll find what are the common deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:35.850" style="s2">structures that allow us all have a seat</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:37.950" style="s2">at the table so for example taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.850" end="00:05:39.030" style="s2">sacred texts seriously that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.950" end="00:05:40.920" style="s2">that we can do and you&#39;re doing such</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.030" end="00:05:42.900" style="s2">important work about how we can from an</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.920" end="00:05:44.700" style="s2">evolutionary perspective evolve sacred</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.900" end="00:05:49.140" style="s2">texts yeah taking sacred texts seriously</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.700" end="00:05:50.700" style="s2">ritual notions of obligation right how</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.140" end="00:05:54.120" style="s2">do we actually reclaim obligation</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.700" end="00:05:55.740" style="s2">reclaim ritual right reclaim right we</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.120" end="00:05:57.870" style="s2">have got to actually reclaim the core</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.740" end="00:05:59.550" style="s2">structures right that actually are</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.870" end="00:06:03.000" style="s2">emergent and actually transcend that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.550" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">include because otherwise we risk right</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.000" end="00:06:05.970" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s definitely not what</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.260" end="00:06:07.470" style="s2">we&#39;re doing but I think it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.970" end="00:06:09.240" style="s2">what our human potential movement does</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.470" end="00:06:11.700" style="s2">is it transcends and excludes</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.240" end="00:06:13.770" style="s2">right it kind of it kind of it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.700" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">recognize what comes before it which</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.770" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">both lacks humility and reverence which</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:19.950" style="s2">is always a bad idea but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:22.380" style="s2">inaccurate and you can&#39;t actually build</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.950" end="00:06:24.630" style="s2">a synergistic structure unless everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.380" end="00:06:27.780" style="s2">can find a way to have a seat at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.630" end="00:06:29.760" style="s2">table I think this is very true and what</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.780" end="00:06:32.180" style="s2">I discovered in doing the twenty five</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.760" end="00:06:35.820" style="s2">synergistic convergence conferences and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.180" end="00:06:38.669" style="s2">inviting people that were specifically</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.820" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">of different levels right</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.669" end="00:06:43.409" style="s2">from welfare mothers and gang leaders to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:47.400" style="s2">police officers and gene roddenberry</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.409" end="00:06:49.800" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m all up but what I found was</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.400" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">something that almost everybody had no</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.800" end="00:06:54.749" style="s2">matter what level they might be in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:57.479" style="s2">terms of the evolution of the spiral</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.749" end="00:07:00.900" style="s2">dynamics is they had something they</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.479" end="00:07:04.590" style="s2">wanted to create mmm and when that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:07.289" style="s2">as honestly and legitimately from them</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.590" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">and they needed to give something and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.289" end="00:07:14.250" style="s2">they were recognized as people rather</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:15.900" style="s2">than categories or organizations you did</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.250" end="00:07:19.860" style="s2">not come in as a category or</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.900" end="00:07:21.060" style="s2">inauguration you really came in I to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.860" end="00:07:23.879" style="s2">are you satisfied with the way things</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:26.219" style="s2">are going for you okay no he said yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.879" end="00:07:28.770" style="s2">they got in because they said no not</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.219" end="00:07:30.389" style="s2">satisfied right so then would you like</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.770" end="00:07:33.629" style="s2">to be more satisfied with the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.389" end="00:07:35.490" style="s2">they&#39;re going yes how about trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.629" end="00:07:38.039" style="s2">something new what do you want to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.490" end="00:07:40.050" style="s2">and what do you need to create it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.039" end="00:07:43.020" style="s2">there was one labor leader in Los</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.050" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">Angeles who was really a tough guy mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.020" end="00:07:49.110" style="s2">nasty didn&#39;t it was rude to me does the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">idea of doing anything like this and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.110" end="00:07:55.110" style="s2">I asked him if he was sad no it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:57.779" style="s2">but he said if I would tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.110" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">they&#39;d think I was a communist so I said</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.779" end="00:08:02.729" style="s2">well what is the truth for you Wow I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:06.180" style="s2">have these great ideas he started to</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.729" end="00:08:08.430" style="s2">tell me his ideas of creation they were</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.180" end="00:08:11.159" style="s2">so much different than that personality</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.430" end="00:08:14.099" style="s2">so I&#39;m very loath to judge people by</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.159" end="00:08:16.259" style="s2">being part of the category as long as</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.099" end="00:08:18.029" style="s2">you get them in the game of what do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.259" end="00:08:20.189" style="s2">want to create what do you need and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.029" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">do you want to give it&#39;s a special</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.189" end="00:08:26.789" style="s2">talent and I wonder I mean I will just</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">ask this whether we can jump over some</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.789" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">of these differences by asking people a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:35.729" style="s2">question of their creativity rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:37.380" style="s2">their their interests or who they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.729" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">thinking look think they are or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.380" end="00:08:41.849" style="s2">values they&#39;re espousing I think it may</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:44.670" style="s2">be a new question that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.849" end="00:08:46.290" style="s2">difference maybe it&#39;s a play with us for</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.670" end="00:08:49.019" style="s2">a second - Daniel right in other words</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.290" end="00:08:52.350" style="s2">when a person wants to create right the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.019" end="00:08:55.320" style="s2">the movement to creativity which is so</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:57.660" style="s2">deeply shared across you know all levels</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.320" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">of consciousness nonetheless that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.660" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">movement to creativity is interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:04.620" style="s2">through right just like love is but love</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:07.590" style="s2">is it interpret through a prism of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.620" end="00:09:09.900" style="s2">consciousness and so we need to invite</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.590" end="00:09:11.430" style="s2">people always from wherever we are to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.900" end="00:09:13.290" style="s2">evolve consciousness and make evolve in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.430" end="00:09:14.760" style="s2">consciousness the name of the game and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.290" end="00:09:15.930" style="s2">think the word you said is the key which</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.760" end="00:09:17.700" style="s2">is dissatisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.930" end="00:09:20.070" style="s2">it&#39;s always the place that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.700" end="00:09:22.650" style="s2">dissatisfied which is the technology of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.070" end="00:09:25.560" style="s2">growing up you only grow up when when</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.650" end="00:09:26.850" style="s2">your worldview right is dissatisfying</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.560" end="00:09:28.380" style="s2">either your own experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.850" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2">alive in the world or your own</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.380" end="00:09:31.620" style="s2">experience of the larger world being</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:34.650" style="s2">functional so to actually address</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.620" end="00:09:36.780" style="s2">people&#39;s dissatisfaction and then invite</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.650" end="00:09:39.180" style="s2">them to kind of jump a level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.780" end="00:09:40.920" style="s2">consciousness I think we can do that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.180" end="00:09:44.790" style="s2">I think creativity is the starting point</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.920" end="00:09:46.290" style="s2">if we create a vision in which people</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.790" end="00:09:48.390" style="s2">can find a place at the table that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:50.340" style="s2">right like that yeah that those things</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.390" end="00:09:53.340" style="s2">together does that make sense it does it</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.340" end="00:09:57.030" style="s2">does and the vision is really a question</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.340" end="00:10:00.030" style="s2">to write what would it be like if what</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.030" end="00:10:03.300" style="s2">you want to create we&#39;re further created</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.030" end="00:10:06.300" style="s2">and asking other people for what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.300" end="00:10:09.630" style="s2">need in order to do it a vision emerges</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.300" end="00:10:12.350" style="s2">right Piru what&#39;s exciting to me about</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.630" end="00:10:15.330" style="s2">this question you asked and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.350" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">happened in those sim cons as a result</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.330" end="00:10:20.280" style="s2">of it is that not only is really asking</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:22.020" style="s2">about people&#39;s creative impulse</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.280" end="00:10:23.430" style="s2">something that&#39;s kind of missing from</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.020" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">almost any system of personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.430" end="00:10:27.870" style="s2">development being adequately emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:31.020" style="s2">but it really does have the potential to</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.870" end="00:10:33.030" style="s2">if not leapfrog at least accelerate some</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.020" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">really significant kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.030" end="00:10:37.110" style="s2">synergy and just stages of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:40.290" style="s2">accelerates a good word here I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.110" end="00:10:42.780" style="s2">it&#39;s an accelerator I think it also</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.290" end="00:10:45.210" style="s2">fills in missing pieces cuz therapy as</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.780" end="00:10:47.220" style="s2">critical as it is that focuses on our</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.210" end="00:10:49.560" style="s2">broken parts if that&#39;s not going toward</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.220" end="00:10:52.110" style="s2">something it&#39;s missing something huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.560" end="00:10:54.090" style="s2">right and meditation if it&#39;s a system of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.110" end="00:10:56.400" style="s2">focusing on being present is important</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.090" end="00:10:58.110" style="s2">but it&#39;s still missing that incarnated</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.400" end="00:11:03.840" style="s2">as the creative impulse and personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.110" end="00:11:04.819" style="s2">development education is creative keeps</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.840" end="00:11:07.489" style="s2">being emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.819" end="00:11:09.139" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like if you make that first</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.489" end="00:11:11.419" style="s2">you actually make that primary and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.139" end="00:11:12.410" style="s2">you do therapy where you have issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.419" end="00:11:14.149" style="s2">that are getting in the way of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.410" end="00:11:15.619" style="s2">creativity you do education and personal</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.149" end="00:11:17.899" style="s2">development to get the skills necessary</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.619" end="00:11:19.819" style="s2">for your creativity and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.899" end="00:11:21.679" style="s2">historically we want to own all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.819" end="00:11:22.910" style="s2">beautiful parts of it of our history</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.679" end="00:11:25.069" style="s2">that marks talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.910" end="00:11:26.419" style="s2">historically we&#39;ve been separate right</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.069" end="00:11:28.609" style="s2">been separate we&#39;re moving towards more</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.419" end="00:11:30.410" style="s2">integration and when you ask the forward</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.609" end="00:11:33.199" style="s2">oriented question in a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.410" end="00:11:35.720" style="s2">disown the past but also emphasizes the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.199" end="00:11:38.299" style="s2">future direction it&#39;s it moves us away</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.720" end="00:11:41.539" style="s2">from the context of separate and into</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.299" end="00:11:43.999" style="s2">the context of it when people are ready</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.539" end="00:11:46.249" style="s2">to go when they&#39;re dissatisfied and now</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.999" end="00:11:48.499" style="s2">we have a super dissatisfaction which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.249" end="00:11:49.789" style="s2">collective you see we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.499" end="00:11:52.579" style="s2">forget it&#39;s different than when I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.789" end="00:11:55.069" style="s2">doing the sin cons in the 70s now there</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.579" end="00:11:57.829" style="s2">is a global dissatisfaction that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.069" end="00:12:00.679" style="s2">might not survive this we can&#39;t forget</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.829" end="00:12:02.179" style="s2">that and our spiral dynamics right right</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.679" end="00:12:03.410" style="s2">right no no no I think that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.179" end="00:12:05.179" style="s2">mean it just it&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.410" end="00:12:07.100" style="s2">clarifying to me now actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.179" end="00:12:09.139" style="s2">in this conversation I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.100" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">for a long time and we talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.139" end="00:12:13.999" style="s2">off offline yesterday but what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:15.679" style="s2">technologies of growing up we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.999" end="00:12:18.139" style="s2">about waking up growing up showing up</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.259" end="00:12:55.759" style="s2">maybe really critical here what moves a</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.029" end="00:13:27.830" style="s2">party is called science democracy third</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.580" end="00:13:30.170" style="s2">person so it&#39;s that new party in town</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.830" end="00:13:32.270" style="s2">that is so intoxicating that it moves</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.170" end="00:13:33.980" style="s2">you out so what we&#39;re suggesting in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.270" end="00:13:35.930" style="s2">effect is that the new party in town</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.980" end="00:13:37.550" style="s2">right is the unique self in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.930" end="00:13:40.010" style="s2">evolutionary impulse yes that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.550" end="00:13:42.470" style="s2">intoxication of that real party becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.010" end="00:13:47.300" style="s2">that right that joining becomes becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.470" end="00:13:48.529" style="s2">the the technology of growing up so</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.300" end="00:13:50.089" style="s2">we&#39;re growing up not just because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.529" end="00:13:51.220" style="s2">dissatisfied with yesterday which we</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.089" end="00:13:54.100" style="s2">were but we&#39;re actually being attracted</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.220" end="00:13:55.820" style="s2">just like democracy and science</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.100" end="00:13:58.130" style="s2">attracted us to move from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.820" end="00:13:59.930" style="s2">mythological to the rational so now to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.130" end="00:14:01.490" style="s2">move from kind of pluralistic human</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.930" end="00:14:03.560" style="s2">potential to a deep integral</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.490" end="00:14:05.570" style="s2">consciousness right this this new vision</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.560" end="00:14:08.839" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about all week the strange</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.570" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">attractor again becomes unique self in</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.839" end="00:14:12.589" style="s2">the evolutionary impulse and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:15.350" style="s2">excitement of it the excitement and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.589" end="00:14:17.480" style="s2">innate passion to express innate passion</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.350" end="00:14:20.410" style="s2">expression that&#39;s as innate as sexual</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.480" end="00:14:22.790" style="s2">attraction you know that goes via all</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.410" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">categories yeah well I think the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.790" end="00:14:29.900" style="s2">attraction to create is going to be as</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">as ubiquitous as the sexual attraction</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.900" end="00:14:33.560" style="s2">to procreate</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:34.310" style="s2">now that&#39;s a big statement but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.560" end="00:14:37.150" style="s2">who we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.310" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">ya know it&#39;s who we are it&#39;s who we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.150" end="00:14:42.470" style="s2">implicit when you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">social synergy engine it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.470" end="00:14:46.370" style="s2">interesting that as much as synergy</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:48.110" style="s2">seems like a communion principle in</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.370" end="00:14:50.570" style="s2">terms of agency and communion communion</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.110" end="00:14:52.010" style="s2">without differentiation is totally</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.570" end="00:14:53.720" style="s2">uninteresting you don&#39;t get synergy</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.010" end="00:14:55.010" style="s2">right right because to bring a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.720" end="00:14:56.450" style="s2">homogeneous things together it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.010" end="00:14:58.070" style="s2">same as they were separate you only get</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.450" end="00:15:00.170" style="s2">synergy when you&#39;ve differentiated and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.070" end="00:15:01.640" style="s2">then integrated so synergy actually is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.170" end="00:15:03.110" style="s2">word that includes both which Marc</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.640" end="00:15:04.820" style="s2">always points out about uniqueness right</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.110" end="00:15:07.730" style="s2">that uniqueness is not just an agency</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.820" end="00:15:10.970" style="s2">side of the word that it only emerges</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.730" end="00:15:12.650" style="s2">out of a communion context and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.970" end="00:15:14.510" style="s2">meaningful in the communion context so</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.650" end="00:15:17.029" style="s2">we all have this deep impulse to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.510" end="00:15:20.360" style="s2">something unique to offer and unique to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.029" end="00:15:22.970" style="s2">offer somebody and with other somebodies</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.360" end="00:15:24.589" style="s2">and so this is looking at how do we you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.970" end="00:15:26.450" style="s2">and implicit in that new structure is</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.589" end="00:15:27.650" style="s2">how do we get clear on what we uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.450" end="00:15:30.530" style="s2">have to offer and then how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.650" end="00:15:31.310" style="s2">clear on what the other uniqueness is</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.530" end="00:15:32.960" style="s2">are that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.310" end="00:15:34.370" style="s2">to come together in this a social</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.960" end="00:15:36.110" style="s2">synergy so it&#39;s both of those together</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.370" end="00:15:39.110" style="s2">and it&#39;s not interesting with either</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.110" end="00:15:41.690" style="s2">side of it alone it&#39;s both end and and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.110" end="00:15:44.750" style="s2">discovered that social synergy is a form</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.690" end="00:15:46.970" style="s2">of social love it actually turns into a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.750" end="00:15:49.400" style="s2">love affair I mean it doesn&#39;t matter how</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.970" end="00:15:51.980" style="s2">they start out if the person is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.400" end="00:15:54.200" style="s2">discovering that what he or she wants to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.980" end="00:15:56.930" style="s2">give and create is needed by others and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.200" end="00:15:59.750" style="s2">others need them they turn on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.930" end="00:16:03.350" style="s2">different energy and I really believe</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.750" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">the psychology of synergy has not really</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.350" end="00:16:08.420" style="s2">been explored which really no I&#39;m that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:11.029" style="s2">that really brings us I mean to</p>
