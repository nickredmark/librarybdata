<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">chapter three of your book uh the global</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">crisis of measurements</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">absolutely fascinating you paint this</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">picture of measurements and standards</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">as generating a background justice or</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">injustice as the case may be</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">where changing what and and how we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">measure changes what and how we see the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">and measuring intelligence indeed</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">measuring anything allows for complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">and processes to be reduced to simple</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:54.799" style="s2">numbers which can often act as</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">vectors for the marketization of uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.799" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">human life towards economic ends</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">so as an example university graduates as</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">inputs for the job economy</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">you yourself are working on redesigning</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">standardized testing infrastructures</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">with your non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">lactica so my question is might there be</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">things that we as a society ought not to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">measure</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">in other words a realm of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">unmeasurable we ought not to venture</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">until such time as our individual and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">organizational sovereignty reaches a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">threshold of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">and integrity should intelligence be off</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">limits to measurements</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">and if so how can we even have that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">conversation in this hegemonic</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">neoliberal world</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">of instrumental reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">well that&#39;s a hell of a question uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">so but peter was correct that i actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">prepared some stuff specifically on</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">and had thought about the four</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">weeks as a continuous experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">educationally</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">so basically i&#39;m had a song and dance</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">prepared i&#39;m happy to switch</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">completely to q a if this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">want but my plan for the four sessions</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">was actually to be lecture heavy in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">first two</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">and then leave the final two completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">open as question and answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">but i don&#39;t have to do that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">question and answer is more engaging</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">and that question in particular i&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">to sink my teeth in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:23.919" style="s2">to extemporaneously so</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">what&#39;s our sense okay i&#39;m seeing people</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">forcing function of my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">theorizing and work uh because i had</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:47.199" style="s2">been thinking about these topics of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">metapsychology for an extremely long</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.199" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">uh and in fact when i first read charles</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">sanders purse who i&#39;ll get into in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">lecture today</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">and his kind of dp was one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">people to have a deep evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">and it was based on this triple of first</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">and secondness thirdness</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">as soon as i saw how all of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">the so-called field of psychology which</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">vexed as a field is very problematic as</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">greg hendricks speaks to a lot i&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">that you could actually start to deal</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">with the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">as such by</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">working metaphysically first and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">moving into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">various branches of psychology so um</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">so recently i started first speaking</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.600" style="s2">with daniel thorsen about the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.600" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">some time ago in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">civilizational collapse</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:44.479" style="s2">and saying listen if there&#39;s anything we</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">need to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">it&#39;s to speak to the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:52.560" style="s2">in the context of collapse which is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">say how do we manage</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">the psychological dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">collapse existential risk catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">risk things of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">and so that was the one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">places that i brought the metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">down was in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">conversation with daniel thorson and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">since then a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">has unfolded in my thinking so i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">to use this as an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">synthesize a bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:18.160" style="s2">and then engage with you guys around</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">like what&#39;s wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.160" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">um or what&#39;s good about it uh so this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">this is my hope so i&#39;m gonna share</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">screen here</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">i hate powerpoint presentations but</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">there are some things that they&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">for so i&#39;m to try to make use of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">in order to kind of front end load a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:38.240" style="s2">thinking about metapsychology and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">that will</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.240" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">serve as a scaffold for a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">questions and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">and in the last two sessions that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">actually make them more like practicums</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">where we think about a concrete problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">say in the world or in our lives and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">use the prior theorizing to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">to work on it things of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">so as i&#39;m lecturing if you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">questions please write them down</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">and then my sense is before those last</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">two sessions i&#39;ll be kind of gathering</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">questions through email and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">uh and then try to work on those last</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">two sessions as kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">hands-on application kind of stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">that&#39;s where we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">let&#39;s see here all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.879" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">all right so i think you guys can see</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">so i&#39;m gonna apply these</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">so this is the place to start this is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">uh aeros delivering psyche also</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">cupid delivering psyche also a more</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">delivering psyche</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s a myth in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">psyche is the hero a heroine actually a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">female lead character in this myth who</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">gets entangled with all of these gods</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">and you know i i start with an image for</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">a couple reasons</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">when you&#39;re when you&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">life of the mind or</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at the psyche uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">according to my metapsychology i lay out</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">three areas symbol image and language</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">and image is the language</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">of insolent images the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">way that the deeper layers of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">uh and in particular the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">personality and character</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:33.279" style="s2">it&#39;s conversant in image images have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.279" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">setting a certain emotion and context</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">symbols are universal abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">language is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">omniscient so the image here is of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">basically arrows in psyche</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">entwined in the revivification of psyche</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">so there&#39;s a dynamic that&#39;s pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">in the myth</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">of the impossibility of the isolation of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">the psyche from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">all the different dynamisms of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:11.440" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">and in particular uh eros</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">or love which i write about as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">dynamic that&#39;s entwined with the field</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">of psychology itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">so this is a way of lifting the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">conversation immediately out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">psychology of the science and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">the languages and images and symbols</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">that the psyche uses to be in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">conversation with itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">second part of this myth this is psyche</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">and pan</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">right so another image setting a mood a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.000" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">context psyche&#39;s so distraught at one</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">point during the love affair that she</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">tries to kill herself so she drowned</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">herself in a stream</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">the stream will not kill psyche the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">stream saves psyche puts her on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">shore</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">and who&#39;s there but pan and pan again</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.760" style="s2">resuscitates so the great god of nature</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">resuscitates psyche from death</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:12.839" style="s2">right so love resuscitates the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">nature resuscitates the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.839" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a i find both of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">images a little eerie</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">and a little creepy uh in in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">psyche is about to die like psyche is on</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">the brink</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">can&#39;t take it what are the images</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">languages symbols</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">gestures of speech that can be used to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">bring the psyche back from</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">the edge right this is the motivating</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">point of the metapsychology it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">uh</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">what&#39;s the case with the mind although</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s to be able to have</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">of the psyche and to do that it means</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">meta on all the various logos of psyche</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">which means like there&#39;s a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:18.079" style="s2">of work being done under the rubric of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.079" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">you know some of it is directly helpful</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">to that question</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">some of it is not all of it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">important in the sense of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">and sense making</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">around that question so</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:34.639" style="s2">metapsychology is i hold it this is my</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:36.079" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.639" end="00:12:37.880" style="s2">kind of definition which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.079" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">distinct from some other scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.880" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">metapsychologies</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">you know the metapsychology is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">trying to resolve debates within</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">psychology as a field</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not attempting to be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">better scientific understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">mind although</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">it does lay some claim to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">critique science</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">right so if you if you&#39;re critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">science then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">technically not science you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">something else right you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">something often in the realm</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">of philosophy um so meta psychology is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">more like philosophy uh it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">in a habermasian sense it&#39;s blending the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">types of basic validity claims making</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">scientific ethical and aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">validity claims</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:30.639" style="s2">this is the attempt with the work</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:32.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s what allows it to be i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.639" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">a little bit more evocative</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.839" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">than other approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">to the field of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">so again i&#39;m saying it you know the goal</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:47.600" style="s2">here is to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">to find and clarify these specific</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.600" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">languages and images</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">and symbols of the psyche which is to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">say their language&#39;s image symbol about</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">for the psyche used by the psyche so</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">but this is the way you have to hold it</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">epistemologically</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s a domain in which</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">we operate</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">where we&#39;re creating images and symbols</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">and language about our selves and our</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">own minds</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">and our own emotions in our own</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">and some of those are</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">so important for the continuity</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2">and survival of the species that when</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">you&#39;re in a situation like ours of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">radical cultural disruption</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">civilizational decay</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">you run the risk of losing essential</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">languages images or symbols that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">psyche has</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">created to sustain itself right</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">so one of the reasons to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">metapsychology now and the reason i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">attracted to it is that the psyche is</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">root in all its dimensionality the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">psyche is root doesn&#39;t mean psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">is the root right it doesn&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">things we think psychology is about is</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">the root but psyche</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">is actually root to the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s these forms of language image</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">and symbol</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:11.440" style="s2">and i&#39;ll bring some of these to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">front so you can see what i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">that are in fact like our most precious</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">or endangered resource</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">and this is that notion that nicholas</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">began with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">human development human potential again</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:32.639" style="s2">the remembrance and amnesis recovery</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">healing of the psyche these dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">at the level of consciousness uh this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">the frontier that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">concerned about immediately</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">it includes the sense making ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.839" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">the media social media other things</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:53.839" style="s2">and so metapsychology is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:55.759" style="s2">provide some kind of framework that can</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.839" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">be useful across</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.759" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">uh that whole kind of realm</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:03.279" style="s2">uh so i already mentioned the plan like</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">i&#39;d like to give some framing</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.279" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">and it&#39;ll be loose and it&#39;ll be a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">bit abstract</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">and then i&#39;d like to move in the second</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">two weeks into application q a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">there would totally at the end of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">today they&#39;ll definitely be q a because</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">i&#39;ll just probably say some stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">confusing as hell that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">clarify before</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">we move on but my sense is also that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">i&#39;d love to take those last two sessions</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">and make it so that i&#39;d do a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">less speaking</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">and that we have a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">engagement and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">people bringing problems to the table</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">and then we use</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:37.519" style="s2">some of the frames from the meta</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">psychology to think about them</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.519" end="00:16:42.639" style="s2">so that&#39;s my that&#39;s my sense of how i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">like to proceed</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.639" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">so so what i&#39;m going to do now is just</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">go into a little bit of my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">about the history of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">topics because i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">both intrinsically interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">important to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">kind of get the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">uh you know we&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">these things for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">some of these topics and there have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">certain moves fairly recently</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">in the history of ideas uh which have</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">put us where we are today</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">that there were some paths not taken</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">especially in the history of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">um uh anyway so we&#39;ll explore some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">so this is actually the place to start</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">at least for me anyway uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">you know so you can begin psychology</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">early 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">but it really picks up speed more</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">towards the end of the 19th century when</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">you get the founding</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">especially in the united states of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:43.200" style="s2">system of journals and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">graduate departments in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.200" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">psychology as a science there was a lot</p>

<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">for a very long time but this science of</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">uh and incidentally people don&#39;t realize</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">who&#39;ll figure prominently throughout</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">the psychologist like the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.679" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">psychology was</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">the textbook in those times which put</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">psychology on the map</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">thing here that i want to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">historical incident which actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">reveals some of what is at stake</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">when you think about metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">so purse was a metaphysician first</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">and was concerned about basic issues</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">in what we would now call the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">of mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">and the study of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">james was a medical doctor who had</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">studied with the german</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:18:58.120" style="s2">neurophysiologists</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">and approached it through a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.120" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">experimentalistic</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">and in some ways empiricist</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">modality and so james publishes his</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">famous</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">principles of psychology 1890 it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">a worldwide sensation and the dominant</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">decades charleston purse writes a review</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.559" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">and destroys it very fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">basically around</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">precisely this issue of listen there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">more than</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">one modality of psychology psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:35.919" style="s2">not just about</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">explaining the mind as if it was an</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">object to be looked at</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">that there&#39;s a whole branch of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">psychology that involves</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:48.240" style="s2">basically first person reflection</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">of phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.240" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">even deeper than that normativity which</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">is to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">purse was trying to save</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:20:02.880" style="s2">the laws of logic and ethics</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:05.760" style="s2">from being reduced to causal laws</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">within the central nervous system so</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">purse was</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">saying you can&#39;t reduce choice to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">causality</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">and he was saying you can&#39;t reduce</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">entailment which is a normative property</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">this entails that you can&#39;t reduce that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">causality either and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">deep and this is something that i took</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">from first early on in graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">it made me</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">uh kind of like very concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">directions of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">most forms of psychology because what</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">it&#39;s saying is that yes there&#39;s a realm</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:42.000" style="s2">of scientific explanation</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">where you can look at the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.000" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">system as a causal system and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">make explanations but there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">equally primordial perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">on the same phenomenon which is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">about the normativity of mine</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">sapience the presence</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">both of the awareness and self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">but then also the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">norm following rule following</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">normativity that&#39;s part and parcel of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">human kind of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">so so it&#39;s a quite abstract move but</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">what it shows is that there&#39;s a rift</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">early on in the study of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:20.799" style="s2">uh in a sense between those looking for</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">the broader</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.799" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">metapsychological frame which includes</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">the reflexivity and normativity</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">and those seeking to make psychology</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">more like another</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">scientific discipline like physics or</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">so around the same time james mark</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">baldwin</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">uh basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">began the took purse seriously</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">and basically began the attempt to build</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:56.240" style="s2">kind of like fully tripartite</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">developmental metapsychology so his work</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.240" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">thought in things uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">is like one of these sleeping giants</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">in terms of like no one&#39;s aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">work but even people like kohlberg and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">piaget</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">giants in their own right would</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">basically say well baldwin it was all in</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">baldwin</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">so so he took part seriously enough to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">realize that you had to take up</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:24.080" style="s2">different route perspectives on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.679" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">psyche as a phenomenon and that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.080" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">couldn&#39;t seek to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">simply have it be a discipline of</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">that you also needed to be a discipline</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">and so this this is a root distinction</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">in the social sciences that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">eventually elaborated but</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">again explanations about causality uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">prediction uh correlation things of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">nature mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">uh understanding is about trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.799" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">in the norms being used by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">psychological subject which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">basically participating in</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">the field of agreements and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">rules that constitute the life of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.799" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">human mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">not as the next not as it can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">explained but as it</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.720" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">as it in its lived experience the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">life world itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">um and so and so this was a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:24.799" style="s2">difficult kind of set of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">things to bring together in one</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">discipline and i think baldwin</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">you know did an admirable job uh and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">later on i&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">more deeply into his work um and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">carl jung who</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">later saw the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">problem from a different angle from a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">psycho</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">analytical angle and of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">you could give whole lectures on jung</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">you could give whole lectures on any of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">the guys i just</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">went through what i&#39;m doing is moving</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">through this list of old white guys and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">basically saying that there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.919" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">long discourse</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">about the the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">of working with the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">because you you are psyche</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">right so the the entwinement of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">the consciousness that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">kind of working on itself working on</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">others like itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">um in lived experience that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">and is different from let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">laboratory experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">of psychology so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">the deepest question then is you know is</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">psychology like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">scientific discipline or a psychology</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">like a humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:41.279" style="s2">pursuit right and so the guys i listed</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">here especially jung here</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.279" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">but baldwin also</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">and people like james hillman and others</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">more recent in this vein</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">would say no psychology is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">it&#39;s humanistic it&#39;s like um it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">like it&#39;s intended actually to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">ennobling</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:04.080" style="s2">healing and uplifting uh almost more so</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">than it&#39;s intended to be technically</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.080" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">true from a scientific perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">right like there&#39;s stuff that jung would</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">get into he&#39;s like i have no idea how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">explain this scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">he&#39;s like but it happened like the dream</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">happened right</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">and there the synchronicity happened uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">one of the components of psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">actually to find a way again to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">resuscitate psyche to ennoble psyche</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">um and that the goal is humanistic um</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">but of course we know that it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">there are other people other</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">theorists and this is the probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">dominant tradition at this point</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">in the science of psychology see</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">psychology primarily as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">like another science with the intention</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">of just saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">things that are true and often things</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">undermined or or contradict common sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">about one&#39;s own mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">um this is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">shift um so like i was saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">uh you know there&#39;s lots of ways to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.760" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">slice it um</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">so you you can try to locate it</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:09.279" style="s2">which is part of the explanatory work in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">biology culture genetics neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.279" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">right so that needs to be accounted for</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">like i&#39;m not saying this work is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">i&#39;m saying that&#39;s one basic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">massively complex phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">and then you can also dislocate the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">psyche so you can locate it in matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">and i&#39;m saying that&#39;s a correct way to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">go you can also dislocate it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">which is also a correct way to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">putting it in the collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">spirit cosmos or myth right</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">radically depersonalizing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">and of course you can completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">dispense with it</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:49.279" style="s2">so that means either reducing</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">fragmenting</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.279" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">or explaining things in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:56.720" style="s2">cannot be brought back in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:26:58.080" style="s2">with the life world</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.720" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">so you can turn psychology into</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.080" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">something that alienates the psyche from</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:04.080" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:05.039" style="s2">if you go strictly towards it being a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.039" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">discipline</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">so basically this is like i recounted a</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">little bit of my</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:18.399" style="s2">like existential angst in graduate</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">and when i when i met gray hendricks it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">was the same thing where we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">oh jesus this field of psychology this</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:30.559" style="s2">science of psychology it&#39;s a mess</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:32.399" style="s2">like most of the deepest questions are</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.559" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">actually philosophical and cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.399" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">retrieved from the philosophical and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">purified and made strictly scientific</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">that these questions remain deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">philosophical questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">including questions in ethics questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">and aesthetics um</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">and if you get into young and trans</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">personal psychologists questions in</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">uh theology cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">so you just can&#39;t contain psychology</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">as a scientific field you just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:06.640" style="s2">contain it</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.200" style="s2">within a simple scientific frame so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.200" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">find a way to handle this</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:13.919" style="s2">rich and the key word for me in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">slide would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.919" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">polysemy polysemi it means the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">having multiple meanings right so like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:26.399" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">like justice</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.399" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">hell of a word</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.520" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">justice has many meanings depending</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">who you ask uh so similar</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">your psyche my psyche the end of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">moondi the psyche collective</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:45.919" style="s2">when it does something makes an image</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">makes a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.919" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">speaks right uh always multiple meanings</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">you can explain it neurocognitively you</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">can actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">show how you know it was here in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:00.159" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:02.000" style="s2">that the word came from if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">think about that way but you can also</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">the meaning of the word uh what it means</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">to say it in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">social context what it says about their</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">psychology their neurosis</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">right um or you can attach it to an</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">archetypal pattern</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">from the collective unconscious so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">polysemi the multiplicity of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">that is basically intrinsic to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">psyche</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">and in terms of the way you can approach</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">to understand or explain it so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">lot on our hands</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">uh and the goal is not to actually say</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">specific forms of psychology like</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">studying</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">the way the eyeball works or the way the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:47.279" style="s2">neocortex works it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.360" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s so important please keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">that but at the same time we need people</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">reflecting on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">field again to try to make it so that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">language and image and symbol to feed</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">back into the life world</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">so that the psyche can stay sane</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">so that it knows what it&#39;s about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">happening in the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">what it means to be a human those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">you know again the existential accident</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">graduate school when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">seeing psychology as fragmented as it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">then you realize that basically we run</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">that risk which i&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:28.240" style="s2">of a rift in intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">transmission where the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">multiplying of scientific fields</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">has created so much fragmentation in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">way the psyche makes sense of itself to</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">itself if i can say that that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">culture starts to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">insane that we don&#39;t know what the human</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what a person is worth</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">what people</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">are what they&#39;re capable of who i am the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">languages symbols</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">images that we can use to bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">coherence there</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:03.679" style="s2">become intractably kind of like complex</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">and confusing</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.679" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">so we need a second simplicity we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">some kind of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">on the other side of the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">the multiplying sciences of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">so this is the the kind of goal of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">and then of course ken wilbur was one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">the people who basically resolved my</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">existential angst graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.519" end="00:31:28.880" style="s2">because he was like yup kid that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">correct it is a mess</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">here are some very large orienting</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">generalizations</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">that can allow you to bring some</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">coherence to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">this is a drawing by alex gray who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">incredible artist</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">um talk about image symbol</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">uh it also includes magistri</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">who is a bodhisattva from tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">holding a sword with a book</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">and so again we have an image here</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:11.760" style="s2">with symbolism pointing to this deeper</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">thing which again already mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">disentangle psychology of the science</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:22.960" style="s2">philosophy you also can&#39;t disentangle it</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">from religion and the thing is typically</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">classed under</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">religious concern so it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">giving some explanation of human</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">behavior human motivation</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">identity construction ethics as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">and religion doesn&#39;t somehow factor</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">what have you done what have you</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">explained religion is one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:51.679" style="s2">and religiosity which gets into like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">ubiquity of image and symbol</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">with religious quality even if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">quote technically a religion</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">right this bards like everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">religion religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:05.120" style="s2">is also one of the main events</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:06.399" style="s2">and so another thing psychology if it</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.120" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.399" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">serious needs to do is understand that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">there was a transition</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">with modernity in which</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">psychology began to sit on the pulpit</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">and psychology began to sit in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">confessional</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">and that the psychologist began to stand</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">in for</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">those members of the social system who</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">used to be kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">stewards of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">right and so that is hugely important</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">in terms of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">responsibility we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">when we speak of the psyche to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">psyche</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">all right so like evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">cognitive neuroscientists like ease up</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">like what are the languages you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">that people will use to describe</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">it&#39;s important to think about it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">that the research is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;s that the way it gets articulated</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">and the meaning that congeals around it</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:13.599" style="s2">and how it gets into the cell system is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">all part of what it means to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.599" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">and so the notion that yes there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a branch of the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">that&#39;s related to this broader function</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">and that broader function is something</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:36.000" style="s2">steward of the soul and it&#39;s a rich</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:39.679" style="s2">educational function um</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.000" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">so all of that with the can wilbur image</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">so i mentioned orienting generalizations</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">this is where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">i mentioned liberation healing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">amnesis</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:54.720" style="s2">recovery reconstitution</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:56.960" style="s2">all of these ways you can frame or try</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.720" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">to put language around</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.960" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">what what the goal is and return to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">original images</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">right eros saving psyche</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">right the suicidal psyche resuscitated</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">the god of nature all right like</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">how can we find the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">resources as people</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">to move through such a complex world</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:27.200" style="s2">where the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">wants to kill itself where the psyche is</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">despondent</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">distraught in a literally in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">tragically structured myth</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:38.160" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">yeah so this is the motivating interest</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.160" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">find those languages that can be used in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">those contexts</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">right the language that pan spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">psyche</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">after the suicide attempt the language</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">arrows spoke to psyche to resuscitate</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:57.920" style="s2">her from actually looking in</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">persephone&#39;s box persephone queen of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">underworld</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">gave psyche a box to bring to aphrodite</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated the goddesses are not</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">nice to one another</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">and uh she looked at it and almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.880" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">killed her</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">so here&#39;s we&#39;ll get super abstract</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">quickly um</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">so following purse and his critical move</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">and especially his isolation of an</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">entailment from causality</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">and firstness secondness thirdness early</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">on i started working</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">every time i was reading psychology with</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">this meta frame</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">of which i came to call after reading</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">landry</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">transcendence and solvent development so</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">the basic</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">these are the the largest categories</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">which can function together to organize</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">both the science of psychology and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">other host of concerns that i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">ethics normativity religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">all of that stuff life death um love</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">sex like anything that the psyche deals</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:02.560" style="s2">with has to be handled</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">uh it&#39;s gonna fall in one of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">buckets and then it&#39;s gonna fall within</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">certain positions and it allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">look at it all</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">and then in particular to find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">to move it back through into the life</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">for the sake of basically education</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know how many metatheorists</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">in the crowd but if you know purse</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:27.839" style="s2">um or landry or even the wilbarian slash</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">baldwinian</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.839" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">i we it um then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:35.119" style="s2">immediately start to orient to both the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">level of the generality of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.119" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">and kind of roughly what&#39;s in them</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">kind of simmer on this slide i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">going to talk through it</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:49.599" style="s2">because again this slide is like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">lecture in itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.599" end="00:37:54.480" style="s2">but i will move to discuss the three</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">transcendence and someone development</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.480" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">this is the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">the metapsychology and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">hopefully by the end of this lecture and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">the next one</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">has set a pretty interesting set of kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:12.560" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">languages images and symbols and ways to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.560" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">work with them</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">so that we can begin to try to do some</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">work with the psyche on the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">right that kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">so i already kind of went through this</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">um but it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">talking here uh in more detail about</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">you know at the most general level</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">how can we think about the the different</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">parts of the psyche um and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">you know the one of the classic ways it</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">was talked about in the medieval</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">kind of school masters was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">willing and feeling and this was taken</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:38:58.400" style="s2">up by</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:39:01.520" style="s2">uh rudolf steiner</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.400" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">and others and eventually kant um</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.520" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">who put it into you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">three critiques which end up being</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:11.440" style="s2">something like truth goodness</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">beauty um</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:14.640" style="s2">what we&#39;re looking at here is basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">if we take it from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.640" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">right and we start with development</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">cognition right that&#39;s the middle one</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">cognition uses language cognition over</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">time becomes capacity</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">so the development of the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:33.839" style="s2">basically what&#39;s usually the field of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">developmental psychology</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.839" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">but it&#39;s a ton of cognitive science goes</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">it&#39;s about how does the nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">and the reflective consciousness of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:45.920" style="s2">come to be able to work with the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.920" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">a basically a place where</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">rules and causality applies so</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:59.119" style="s2">development is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">you know as we&#39;ll get into what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">tracked by piaget</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s tracked by uh the model of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:11.680" style="s2">complexity um elliott jackson&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.400" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">and you work on perception any work on</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">language processing look at it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">developmental context</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">so and i think language cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:26.400" style="s2">capacity are actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">transparent as words so my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.400" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">when i say language you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">by language but we could define that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:34.400" style="s2">cognition as i said is about relating to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">the world in terms of object</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.400" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">capacity is about a an ability to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">basically operate</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">consistently at a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">cognitive complexity</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:50.839" style="s2">so insolent uh deals with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">completely different kind of repertoire</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.839" end="00:40:55.440" style="s2">of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">psychic phenomenon and psychodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.440" end="00:40:59.599" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">um so the main thing analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.599" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.960" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">but different uh is imagination</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">uh now you don&#39;t get cognition without</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">and you don&#39;t get either of them without</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">attention right so it&#39;s all related but</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">if we look at imagination</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:17.599" style="s2">uh it ends up being a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">different process</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.599" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">dream being the best example because</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">everything that is relevant to cognition</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">which is to say relating with capacity</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:30.880" style="s2">to the world doesn&#39;t exist in dream</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:33.359" style="s2">because you&#39;re not in the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.880" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">in the dream you have created entirely</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.359" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">from the faculty of imagination if i can</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">use that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve created entirely a different</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.640" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">world an imaginal world</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">so in the domain of installment you end</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">up getting all of these things like</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">psychodynamic projection right where</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:53.359" style="s2">you&#39;re not mad but my imagination sure</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">makes you look mad</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.359" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">because another process more basic than</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">is actually running the show so insolent</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">is that domain where</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">imagination is primary image</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">is the equivalent of language or image</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">is the very stuff through which meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">is conveyed</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">and then personality is the let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">front-facing or public-facing output of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">sub-component now they&#39;re related and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">i&#39;ll get to the relations</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">but you can see like this is different</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">many of the tools applied</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">to study development to study language</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:34.800" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">building capacity that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.800" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">those tools don&#39;t work if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">to study</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">processes in the domain of installment</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">character structure</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">personality development neurosis dream</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">imagery that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">right like these are just</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">methodologically they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">so what do we do to keep them all in</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">you have to go up a step so the third</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">is kind of where we start to get the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">religious uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">things really impinging upon psychology</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">this is where you&#39;re starting to find</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">research on</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:15.520" style="s2">meditation things of that nature uh so</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">transcendence deals with attention</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:20.560" style="s2">as the primary so attention imagination</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">cognition these are</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.560" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">kind of these three images excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">perspectives let&#39;s say on even a single</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">psychological event</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">but attention attention has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:42.160" style="s2">the self-control of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">psychic system so when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">meditation research when you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">research done in union psychology on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:54.240" style="s2">phenomenology of engagement with symbol</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">and particularly when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.240" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">work in phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:02.880" style="s2">um like uh evan steiner</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:04.720" style="s2">uh no evan</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.880" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">evan thompson&#39;s work that&#39;s right evan</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.720" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">thompson&#39;s work on</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">phenomenology of living systems</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to see that uh outside</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">of language</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">and outside of image there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">much different and much</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">simpler form of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:24.160" style="s2">psychological dynamic which i put under</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.160" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">it&#39;s the one that&#39;s most difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">speak to almost by definition</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s also the one where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">getting again</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">uh religious</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">symbol and uh language and semantics</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">like yeah so i&#39;m gonna keep deepening</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">these but i&#39;m trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">an overview so we can continue to</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">proceed um</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">and so for you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:56.720" style="s2">the best way to you know you can look</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">across them and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.720" end="00:45:02.880" style="s2">things that are looking similar right uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:05.119" style="s2">and so in development we have stages and</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.880" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">everyone kind of knows about stages</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.119" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">um you know i had ken wilbur on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:11.440" style="s2">screen i&#39;ve already mentioned psja</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot to say about how</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.440" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">development works and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">one of the places i have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">expertise as a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">but despite what some developmentalists</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">the entire mind which is to say psyche</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t only move through stages</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">parts do and stages are important stages</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">of capacity in particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:44.079" style="s2">but there are other kind of dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">growth sequences evolutionary patterns</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.079" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">which are not best captured at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:51.040" style="s2">in terms of thinking of stages but they</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.040" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">uh rhythmic they are often</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">sequential uh and they are often</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">transformative but they&#39;re not stages</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">so in installment i call them stations</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:08.960" style="s2">and we&#39;ll look at a couple of these one</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:12.839" style="s2">of the ones i&#39;ve spoken about here</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.960" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">in my last visit was pre-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.839" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">tragic and post-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">these being stations of insolent</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">not stages of development but stations</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">of insolent so stations is a different</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">kind of phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">more similar to let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">ericssonian</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:37.359" style="s2">crisis life phases than the piagetian</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">or the hierarchical complexity models</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.359" end="00:46:39.920" style="s2">and then in the domain of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">phases and so these are actually phase</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">transitions</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">between different emotional and states</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.319" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">and states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">right so when you begin meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">everyday consciousness then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:46:58.400" style="s2">phase</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">shift into some kind of joint attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.400" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">or into a peripheral awareness but you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">move states you actually in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">transcend the state you are in and</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:09.839" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.440" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">a different you know modality of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.839" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">like a distinct also from waking to</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:16.960" style="s2">as an example more subtly you get phase</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">shifts</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:23.839" style="s2">from depressive out of depressive or</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">vice versa but again you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.839" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">rhythms and patterns within those phase</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:29.599" style="s2">shifts in the domain of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.000" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">the domain of working with consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.599" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">to control itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">um which you don&#39;t want to model like</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">stages and you don&#39;t want to model them</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">like stations but you do need to model</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">them with some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">rhythm and some kind of pattern so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">start to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">phases basically so</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">some of this seems like semantics but if</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">in a field where people write books like</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">integral psychology and greg hendricks</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">books like you need to get the right</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">setting of kind of conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">armature before you move forward so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:05.440" style="s2">just trying to lay this out</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">and a lot of it probably is problematic</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.440" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">and could be refigured</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">but i&#39;m trying to paint kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">general picture here</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">and so as i mentioned there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">a move between</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">these which is i think one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">important things to get so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">development which is this whole area of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">skill building building cognition</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">cognitive capacity becoming smarter</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:29.119" style="s2">becoming more capable</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve got installment which is this</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.119" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">like area deepening of the personality</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">enriching the character structure</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">orienting to death and the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">values and things of that nature and</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">they&#39;ve got transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">which is this ability basically to put</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">all of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">in front and to work with consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">as consciousness and particularly to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">regulate</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">the emotional system uh through the will</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">and then extracting from image and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.559" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">extracting from cognition</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">symbol which moves the personal to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">and so there&#39;s these three distinct</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:11.599" style="s2">but there&#39;s a rhythm to the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.599" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">and this is the one i would propose and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:17.520" style="s2">i would propose that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">it can run in other directions and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">dysfunction and so with this before</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">beginning to speak to the rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">i&#39;ll speak to the fact that if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:31.680" style="s2">and a movement between the triple it</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">means that there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.680" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">some actual bigger thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">happening so i don&#39;t know what to call</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:37.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">right when all three of these are moving</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.920" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">together right when the installment</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:45.440" style="s2">changes the personality and then that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">personality builds more skill</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">in some area and then that ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">looked at</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:53.119" style="s2">from a transgender perspective in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:54.800" style="s2">of choice making which then cycles back</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">into the deepening of the personality</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.800" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">like when this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">working then you have what</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what to call it i want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:04.559" style="s2">say like evolution you have the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">evolution of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">right but that&#39;s a very specific way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">using the term evolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">so you could say it&#39;s the the growth of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">but so we&#39;ll see but the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">although there are these three</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">components</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">and each of them are rich and whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">areas of things and work is done</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">uh they are related intimately and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">you need to be almost as concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">or am i getting the right rhythm of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">their interrelation</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">um both theoretically and practically</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.760" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">as about how am i doing so called in</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">each of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">right or what&#39;s going on in each of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">so i so i spoke to a little bit but you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">can actually boil it down</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:52.720" style="s2">to again the origins of psychology the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">circular reaction</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">and so the circular reaction is very</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">similar to what is called in these</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">circles the ooda loop</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">all right so this is actually a basic</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">ooda loop or basic circular reaction</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">where the uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">personality the installment factor</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">something like sees a problem builds the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">skill</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">to try to build just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">actualize the image of the person</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">you build skill uh and then kick it over</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.520" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">to transcendence when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">hold skill and choose basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">you choose and then that creates a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">context in which personality</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">deepens and so it&#39;s a basic thing where</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">framing of the problem and attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">solve the problem through cognition</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:45.839" style="s2">of witnessing through choice of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:49.119" style="s2">what happened and then on again</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.839" end="00:51:50.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s basically like saying in</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.119" end="00:51:53.119" style="s2">learning theory</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.240" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">um you know if you&#39;re trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.119" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">child to learn</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:52:01.760" style="s2">a math problem or language like</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">grammar if you don&#39;t get the motivation</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.760" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">correct which is to say if you don&#39;t set</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">the personality</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">in the right image of what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">if you don&#39;t get the basically the soul</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:15.599" style="s2">involved then the skill development is</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.599" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">right and in fact this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:21.839" style="s2">biggest barriers</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">to learning it&#39;s not the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">linguistic impairment</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">um it&#39;s often an emotional mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">between the task</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">that the teacher&#39;s setting and the like</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">mood of the child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">psyche the image what&#39;s the image of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">situation that they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.520" end="00:52:41.280" style="s2">and so you need to set the parameter of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.280" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">first then move into skill development</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:48.240" style="s2">and then move into choice which is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">what do you do to actualize it</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">through things that transcend your own</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:53:03.119" style="s2">basically what&#39;s the alter that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">sacrifice self and skill on uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.119" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">for what end like with what attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:13.040" style="s2">so so this is the proposed dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">like i said there&#39;s probably many other</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.040" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">routes between these three and many</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">other rhythms</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">but this one i found to be most</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to keep staying extremely</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">abstract here</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">in part because i want to get it out um</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.760" style="s2">so when you&#39;re thinking about these</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.119" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">three uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.760" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">think about all of them as having</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">implications with all four quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:43.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">which is to say that installment is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:49.200" style="s2">process that involves</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">the world and other people and my own</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.200" end="00:53:53.680" style="s2">and my own self right and development</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">similarly development involves the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.680" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">and other people</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:58.480" style="s2">and my own self transcendence likewise</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:00.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re meditating</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.480" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a context there&#39;s a tradition</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.720" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">each of these is extremely complex in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">and of</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">itself that personal personality</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">development in particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:16.000" style="s2">is so radically contingent upon</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">culture family upbringing socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.000" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">status</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">like all of that stuff is entwined with</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">insolent and development but with a</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:28.319" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:30.079" style="s2">kind of slice of causal implication</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.319" end="00:54:32.000" style="s2">and then they all shouldn&#39;t be thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.079" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">of in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.000" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">symbol essences or structure</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:41.599" style="s2">that they all have chaos and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">dynamics which is to say that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.599" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">building skill</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">in the domain of development let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:51.359" style="s2">and you&#39;re in context with a teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:55.040" style="s2">you&#39;re working on a technical problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.359" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">it&#39;s possible for you to basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.040" end="00:54:59.119" style="s2">uh have the context disrupted and lose</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">the skill entirely</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:02.559" style="s2">right it&#39;s also possible to have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">context improved and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">go up like three notches of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">understanding for an hour and then lose</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:08.240" style="s2">that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">right so when i get into speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.240" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">development there&#39;s fluctuations</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">and uh true kind of complexity dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">within just skill acquisition in terms</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:24.319" style="s2">of model of hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">but there is also similarly in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.319" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">kind of like in soulman world that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:36.319" style="s2">is also held in kind of a full quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:38.880" style="s2">uh embrace and just as susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">changes in context changes in diet other</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.880" end="00:55:42.520" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">altering personality rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.520" end="00:55:49.680" style="s2">non-linearly that the personality</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">will move through various uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.680" end="00:55:53.200" style="s2">various dynamics um so that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">note</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.200" end="00:55:56.799" style="s2">necklace you&#39;re jumping in yeah yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">just want to jump in and say that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.799" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">coming up on the hour mark</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:04.319" style="s2">oh wow yeah so um i&#39;m wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">have an extra 20 or 30 minutes to devote</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.319" end="00:56:08.079" style="s2">to i do</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">okay amazing too yeah okay so i&#39;d invite</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.079" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">start asking their questions in the uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:14.640" style="s2">in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">um proceed with with uh questions that i</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.640" end="00:56:19.680" style="s2">know that it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.319" end="00:56:20.960" style="s2">and then um you can answer them so</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.680" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">i i have a i have a question for you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.960" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">start things off great</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">um so you mentioned that language</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.480" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">um image and symbol feed back into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">life world</p>

<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">in some sense semiotics aesthetics and</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">language permit the gelling of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">fluid psychic</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.760" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">through the adjacent possible depends on</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.400" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">a certain ontological</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">and semiotic flexibility a courage to</p>

<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">into the desert and navigate against the</p>

<p begin="00:57:07.440" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t cut it</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.200" end="00:57:14.880" style="s2">so my question is what is sanity</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:14.880" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">it was like a long preamble and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">question was like okay what is sanity uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s a difficult question i mean my</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:30.720" style="s2">first response is actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:31.680" style="s2">like more like foucault like that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.720" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">first response it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.680" end="00:57:38.640" style="s2">like well sanity is this</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">thing that civilization creates</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.640" end="00:57:42.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a category um which has been</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">shifting socioculturally</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.480" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">for a long time that a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">we do now would be considered completely</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2">insane</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">to and then what they do is like totally</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.640" end="00:57:56.000" style="s2">nuts</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">so so there&#39;s that first notion of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.000" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">the word is it&#39;s complicated so my first</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.000" end="00:58:00.319" style="s2">reaction is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:02.160" style="s2">a little bit post-modern a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.319" end="00:58:03.440" style="s2">like sanity is kind of the social</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.160" end="00:58:05.920" style="s2">construct</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.440" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">mostly used to get social coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.920" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">then to oppress</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:12.640" style="s2">people and stuff like that but if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">take a step back from that and try to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.640" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">think well</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:20.640" style="s2">if i&#39;m encountering someone and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">i see them in a state of distress</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.640" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">and i&#39;m trying to figure out kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">like what&#39;s the root</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:29.040" style="s2">of that distress um and then they start</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:32.640" style="s2">to tell me something</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:35.680" style="s2">that uh is</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.640" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say completely irrational</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.680" end="00:58:38.799" style="s2">like so just in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.799" end="00:58:41.880" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about what you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">about is basically what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.880" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">non-pathological</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">human behavior is how i&#39;m re</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">interpreting the question</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.920" end="00:58:52.319" style="s2">so in the domain of development</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">non-pathological human behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.319" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">behavior that is accurate true</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:59:00.559" style="s2">effective right and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:02.400" style="s2">one of the classic signs of quote</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.559" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">unquote insanity</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.400" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">is people seeing things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:07.520" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.839" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">right classic right like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.520" end="00:59:10.000" style="s2">serious breakdown in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:11.200" style="s2">development thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.000" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">because you&#39;re supposed to be getting</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:14.000" style="s2">better at dealing with the world through</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:16.720" style="s2">understanding the world through</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.000" end="00:59:18.640" style="s2">cognition and language so if you start</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.720" end="00:59:20.319" style="s2">having a cognitive apparatus that starts</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.640" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">to see things that&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.319" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a sign of quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:27.920" style="s2">insanity um</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">so but in the domain of insolent</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.920" end="00:59:32.559" style="s2">this is where things are much more</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">complicated you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.559" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">um because the soul</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">and images of the soul and especially if</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:42.640" style="s2">you look at those myths</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:44.960" style="s2">like um the soul basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.640" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">is insane if i can put it that way like</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.960" end="00:59:49.040" style="s2">the soul is</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:53.760" style="s2">is pathological um</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.040" end="00:59:56.799" style="s2">because it orients almost entirely to</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.760" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">death and a few other dimensions that</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.799" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">make it</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:03.680" style="s2">such that um you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:05.599" style="s2">if you have your life together in terms</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">of your skills and capacities and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.599" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">even have some good emotional</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">self-regulation and</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:12.240" style="s2">a sense of transcendence through like a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:14.799" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:16.480" style="s2">uh it&#39;s in the domain of installment</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.799" end="01:00:17.760" style="s2">this is why psychoanalysis was so</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.480" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">important it&#39;s in the domain of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.760" end="01:00:20.559" style="s2">installment</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">and a personality structure and in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.559" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">basic images</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.160" end="01:00:26.880" style="s2">that the soul ends up hungering for or</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:30.240" style="s2">that disturbed the soul</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.880" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">right the images of self and other</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.240" end="01:00:37.359" style="s2">um that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to get the</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">normal genesis of pathology</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.359" end="01:00:42.160" style="s2">and so in those cases what you have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">look at and this i take this from from</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.160" end="01:00:46.400" style="s2">hillman</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">you basically have to look at what is</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.400" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">the archetype</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">in the pathology such that</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:54.880" style="s2">it is sane right it&#39;s a weird thing to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.880" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">but it&#39;s like basically like you have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">find the god</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:03.280" style="s2">hidden in the pathology that is trying</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">to be freed</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.280" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">and find a way for it to do that</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">so and then in transcendence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">pathological behavior a lot of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:16.880" style="s2">religious fundamentalist cults</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:17.839" style="s2">and that kind of stuff is that would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.880" end="01:01:20.559" style="s2">pathology of</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.839" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">the transcendent function right where</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.559" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">it&#39;s overriding the installment and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">in interest of basically</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">exiting so yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:34.319" style="s2">roughly speaking i&#39;m not answering your</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">question but i am saying that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.319" end="01:01:37.680" style="s2">you can find psychological disturbance</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:41.200" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.680" end="01:01:43.839" style="s2">all three of these and you have to know</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.200" end="01:01:46.880" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking at in order to help</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.839" end="01:01:49.920" style="s2">people who are struggling you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.880" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.920" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">in a very basic way our civilization is</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">insane across all three</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:02:00.640" style="s2">vectors unfortunately um</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:03.440" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a simple way</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:07.039" style="s2">in which from a capacity standpoint</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.440" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">we have a obviously self-terminating</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.039" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">kind of like system of structures of</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">extraction</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">and exploitation and from a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:19.200" style="s2">standpoint similarly</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:23.520" style="s2">you know we are deeply</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.200" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">deeply captured by images that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.520" end="01:02:28.720" style="s2">are distracting us out of healthy</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:31.680" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.720" end="01:02:32.799" style="s2">so and transcendence we can get into but</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:36.119" style="s2">the iconography</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.799" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">and especially the resurgence of um</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.119" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">techno-optimist religious cults like</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">transhumanism</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">uh and good old fashion fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:46.400" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:48.319" style="s2">is the transcendent running roughshod</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.400" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">over the life world um</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.319" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">and what we know about the world so</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:02:55.680" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s kind of a complicated</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.680" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">um your last your last bit about the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:03.039" style="s2">um the three domains of metapsychology</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:06.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.039" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">that um where we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.079" end="01:03:11.200" style="s2">our society can be considered insane</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:14.400" style="s2">across all three reminded me of the um</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">the nine planetary boundaries uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.400" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">past which beyond whose thresholds we</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">are uh are slated to to</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:24.720" style="s2">cause the world to become unstable um</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:27.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.720" end="01:03:28.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s more like a metapsychological uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.680" end="01:03:31.839" style="s2">planetary boundary</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.960" end="01:03:31.839" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:37.119" style="s2">um so so most most of us here are aware</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:38.240" style="s2">of the magnitude and scope of the medic</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.119" end="01:03:39.680" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.240" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">and i get the impression that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.680" end="01:03:43.119" style="s2">race going on between</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:44.720" style="s2">the exploration of new educational</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.119" end="01:03:46.160" style="s2">modality modalities</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.720" end="01:03:48.720" style="s2">and the harnessing of tech towards</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.160" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">rethinking the current systems</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.720" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">and upskilling humans on the one hand</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:56.240" style="s2">and the radical downscaling</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:58.319" style="s2">of humans in the absolute sense due to</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.240" end="01:04:00.000" style="s2">the homogenizing effects of of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.319" end="01:04:02.640" style="s2">current schooling system</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.000" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">and uh the the forcings of the libidinal</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.640" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">attention economy that we&#39;re all subject</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:08.880" style="s2">um and both both forces are gunning for</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:11.680" style="s2">a certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.880" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">hegemony and how do you see this playing</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.680" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">out over the next decade</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:17.200" style="s2">uh and how do you see insolment as being</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:21.440" style="s2">implemented</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.200" end="01:04:21.440" style="s2">in uh new educational modalities</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.200" end="01:04:30.400" style="s2">yeah i mean what to say here</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.960" end="01:04:31.680" style="s2">the digital like in like a marshall</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.400" end="01:04:33.039" style="s2">mcluhan kind of sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.680" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">you know like the printing press and</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">then the radio and television and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.960" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">the digital</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:43.839" style="s2">the digital is so profoundly</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">powerful educationally potentially</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.839" end="01:04:47.760" style="s2">educationally massively powerful so we</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:48.640" style="s2">this is one of the themes in my book</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.760" end="01:04:51.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like we actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.640" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">do stand on the brink of something like</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">a major revolution in education</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">but it sure as hell not has not happened</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.720" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">yet with the state of the digital</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:02.960" style="s2">so we&#39;ve confused the potentialities of</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:05.520" style="s2">the digital</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.960" end="01:05:06.319" style="s2">with what we&#39;re calling the internet</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.520" end="01:05:09.760" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:12.559" style="s2">which is mostly toxic</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.760" end="01:05:13.520" style="s2">advertisement laden uh surveillance</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:17.039" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.520" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">mechanism uh and</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.039" end="01:05:21.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s just one thing to get it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:22.480" style="s2">like you know in the race what is the</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.200" end="01:05:25.520" style="s2">race for</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.480" end="01:05:29.119" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a race basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.520" end="01:05:32.400" style="s2">for human attention and</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.119" end="01:05:34.799" style="s2">the placement of</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.400" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">i think image is where they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.799" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">going the hardest</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:39.200" style="s2">like the dynamics of the advertising is</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:42.160" style="s2">mostly</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:44.480" style="s2">that and if you look at the major shifts</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.160" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">especially in adolescent mental health</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.480" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">it was both first when facebook got on</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">the phone</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:52.799" style="s2">but then more when the scroll</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:55.760" style="s2">of twitter and facebook was such that</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.799" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">the brief video began to play before you</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.760" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">even pressed it</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">right so the capture of</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">soul through fascination with image</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:07.280" style="s2">i mean this is why you had so long ago</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">with like the vatican they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.280" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">outlawing images right because the image</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">is actually the</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">the most seductive thing that the human</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:17.599" style="s2">can create is</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">this image uh there&#39;s a bunch of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.599" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">for that and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:24.319" style="s2">next week i&#39;ll talk about in more detail</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">the difference between image and symbol</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.319" end="01:06:26.720" style="s2">and language</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">and you get to play a little bit with</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.720" end="01:06:29.760" style="s2">the notion of what is an image and why</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.319" end="01:06:31.599" style="s2">is it so powerful</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.760" end="01:06:33.599" style="s2">but most of what we&#39;re seeing in social</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.599" end="01:06:36.079" style="s2">media and advertisements</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.599" end="01:06:38.559" style="s2">on the internet and even now with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.079" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">media like news sources</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.559" end="01:06:43.520" style="s2">uh is not the equivalent of like a clear</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:44.720" style="s2">story in the domain of cognition</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.520" end="01:06:47.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s not like they&#39;re laying it</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:49.440" style="s2">all out to in clear language and</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.440" end="01:06:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not like that uh and it&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.440" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">like they&#39;re framing it all in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.960" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">some universal transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:57.599" style="s2">thing that would be weird but it is very</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.000" end="01:07:01.520" style="s2">much like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.599" end="01:07:04.319" style="s2">free play of captivating images</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.520" end="01:07:05.760" style="s2">and so what that means is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.319" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">we&#39;re confused as hell</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.760" end="01:07:08.960" style="s2">cognitively in terms of the domain of</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.359" end="01:07:10.000" style="s2">development and we don&#39;t know like what</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.960" end="01:07:12.400" style="s2">it all means</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.000" end="01:07:13.280" style="s2">in terms of the transcendent or how to</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.400" end="01:07:15.119" style="s2">even kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.280" end="01:07:16.559" style="s2">look at it all and be comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.119" end="01:07:19.760" style="s2">it all</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.559" end="01:07:23.280" style="s2">that&#39;s all happening but we&#39;re also like</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.760" end="01:07:25.359" style="s2">the personality and character structure</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.280" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">and the processes of installment the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.359" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">capture of that through</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:30.880" style="s2">intoxication by image that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">main events that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.880" end="01:07:34.559" style="s2">adolescent</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:35.440" style="s2">mental health crisis is going rampant</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.559" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.440" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not from cognitive dissonance about</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">what really is going on</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.960" end="01:07:44.240" style="s2">with those lizard aliens and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:46.400" style="s2">chip in the vaccine like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.240" end="01:07:49.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.400" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s literally the kind of hypnotic</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.160" end="01:07:53.440" style="s2">kaleidoscopic</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:54.799" style="s2">kind of like insolent process that</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.440" end="01:08:00.480" style="s2">they&#39;re that they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.799" end="01:08:03.359" style="s2">which is very historically unprecedented</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.480" end="01:08:05.440" style="s2">in terms of the forms of image you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.359" end="01:08:07.440" style="s2">place your identity into</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.440" end="01:08:08.839" style="s2">and the ways you can use the imagination</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.440" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">to regulate your</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.839" end="01:08:13.520" style="s2">self-esteem um it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:15.520" style="s2">so that would be a little bit speaking</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.520" end="01:08:17.279" style="s2">into that that space so we have to fight</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.520" end="01:08:19.120" style="s2">at the realm of image</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.279" end="01:08:21.759" style="s2">and then we also have to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.120" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">to show what the digital can actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.759" end="01:08:26.799" style="s2">do that&#39;s not that that that is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">educational power that it has</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.799" end="01:08:29.920" style="s2">because that that&#39;s basically our only</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">way forward</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:35.759" style="s2">um thank you</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">so uh david sweadlow has a question i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.759" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">love for you to ask it</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">david</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.319" end="01:08:58.400" style="s2">dave you got to unmute yourself we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:09:00.319" style="s2">all right all right yes i was uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.400" end="01:09:02.000" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a lot of interest in</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.319" end="01:09:04.400" style="s2">the meta psychotic</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.000" end="01:09:05.279" style="s2">meta psychology um this this</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.400" end="01:09:07.520" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.279" end="01:09:09.359" style="s2">um we were talking about the future</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.520" end="01:09:12.080" style="s2">fossils podcast recently</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.359" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">um there are a lot of topics along this</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.080" end="01:09:15.759" style="s2">line that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:17.679" style="s2">i&#39;m surprised at how rich this</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.759" end="01:09:18.080" style="s2">conversation is and how complex it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.679" end="01:09:21.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.080" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a new recent depth to it um and</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.279" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:25.679" style="s2">seems to have uh a lot of consequence to</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:27.359" style="s2">the possible development of</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.679" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">the ecology of practices that john</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.359" end="01:09:31.359" style="s2">verveigh talks about</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:33.279" style="s2">how do we actually engage in this and</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.359" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">i&#39;m curious if you have insights on</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.279" end="01:09:39.679" style="s2">how the collective can coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:40.319" style="s2">the exploration of the of the ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.679" end="01:09:42.239" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.319" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">rather than just relying on that being</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.239" end="01:09:45.759" style="s2">delivered to us actually participate in</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.000" end="01:09:48.080" style="s2">the development of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.759" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">ecology of practices to help get into</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.080" end="01:09:52.480" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:54.400" style="s2">does that make sense it does it does i</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.480" end="01:09:58.080" style="s2">mean i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.400" end="01:09:59.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to prescribe ways to</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.080" end="01:10:00.480" style="s2">start things that need to start</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.520" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">organically</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:05.040" style="s2">so what i can say is that something like</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:06.400" style="s2">that somehow needs to start organically</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.040" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">but it&#39;s also one of those things that</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.400" end="01:10:10.400" style="s2">if you try too hard to start it</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:13.040" style="s2">then you&#39;ve just found it a religion and</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.400" end="01:10:16.640" style="s2">now you&#39;re a sitting duck</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.040" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">so this question of how to basically get</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.640" end="01:10:20.880" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.840" end="01:10:23.600" style="s2">moving such that if it um</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.880" end="01:10:25.120" style="s2">it takes on a life of its own and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.600" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to answer</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.120" end="01:10:28.560" style="s2">or even ask that question right now i</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:29.199" style="s2">think we&#39;re asking the question because</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.560" end="01:10:32.239" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.199" end="01:10:34.400" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to imagine something that</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.239" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">would be this profound of a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.400" end="01:10:39.040" style="s2">change not propagating out from some</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:42.880" style="s2">kind of more centralized</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.040" end="01:10:42.880" style="s2">kind of like well-organized thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">so i yeah i certainly don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.560" end="01:10:50.880" style="s2">intention of</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.320" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">trying to to build anything like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.880" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:58.159" style="s2">my metapsychology my sense is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">because there&#39;s so much reflection about</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.159" end="01:11:01.199" style="s2">the psyche</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">for the psyche and that&#39;s just saying on</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.199" end="01:11:04.239" style="s2">future thinkers like what are we doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:06.159" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make sense of ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.239" end="01:11:08.159" style="s2">in the midst of crisis and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.159" end="01:11:10.080" style="s2">innovating new languages</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.159" end="01:11:12.880" style="s2">to help understand our own minds and our</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.080" end="01:11:16.000" style="s2">own hearts and souls so enough of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.880" end="01:11:16.400" style="s2">is going on and then the context is</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.000" end="01:11:18.400" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.400" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">increasingly create pressure where i</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:21.199" style="s2">think there&#39;s going to be no choice but</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:23.120" style="s2">for people to get innovative</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.199" end="01:11:24.560" style="s2">like that&#39;s what&#39;s interesting like</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.120" end="01:11:25.840" style="s2">before there was psychology</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.560" end="01:11:27.679" style="s2">and probably even before there was</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.840" end="01:11:29.040" style="s2">philosophy there were people doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.679" end="01:11:31.679" style="s2">metapsychology</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.040" end="01:11:33.280" style="s2">in these contexts right like which is to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.679" end="01:11:34.719" style="s2">say you&#39;re with a group of people you</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:37.840" style="s2">love all these people</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.719" end="01:11:39.520" style="s2"> just hit the fan how do you say</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.840" end="01:11:42.320" style="s2">something to get this group</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.520" end="01:11:43.679" style="s2">coherent to stop the people from crying</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.320" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">or to help them cry</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.679" end="01:11:48.000" style="s2">right how do we what do we say to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:49.920" style="s2">that to answer that question</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.000" end="01:11:52.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to have a pretty complex</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.920" end="01:11:53.920" style="s2">model of what people are like</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.400" end="01:11:55.679" style="s2">right what are they like what are the</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.920" end="01:11:57.360" style="s2">images that capture their attention</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.679" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">what are the practices or rituals we can</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.360" end="01:12:00.719" style="s2">do to get to the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:02.560" style="s2">what are the things we can say to help</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.719" end="01:12:05.840" style="s2">us understand the situation better</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.560" end="01:12:08.000" style="s2">in the developmental so my sense is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.840" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a species-specific trait</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.000" end="01:12:13.520" style="s2">for this kind of for the psyche by the</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:17.440" style="s2">psyche to the psyche</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.520" end="01:12:18.880" style="s2">language symbol image creation and that</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.440" end="01:12:20.560" style="s2">we&#39;re going to just start to have to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.880" end="01:12:22.239" style="s2">that and like my intention is just to</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.560" end="01:12:24.320" style="s2">throw a bunch of stuff out there</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.239" end="01:12:25.679" style="s2">that people find useful so they can do</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.320" end="01:12:28.719" style="s2">it when they need to do it</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.679" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">themselves um and</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.719" end="01:12:32.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the main goal like influencing</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">debates in psychology</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.800" end="01:12:36.640" style="s2">nope i can do that like it&#39;s cost so</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">much money to get time on an fmri</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.640" end="01:12:40.320" style="s2">scanner it&#39;s like 30 000</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:42.000" style="s2">an hour it&#39;s like you just can&#39;t compete</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.320" end="01:12:42.960" style="s2">so you have to find a way to go directly</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.000" end="01:12:44.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.960" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">uh you know the quote unquote the people</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.560" end="01:12:47.440" style="s2">and try to synthesize the best of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:53.199" style="s2">to provide enough clarity of framework</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:54.320" style="s2">so that in a tough situation you can be</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:55.760" style="s2">like okay is this an issue with</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.320" end="01:12:57.199" style="s2">development or is this an issue with</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.760" end="01:12:58.480" style="s2">their image of the soul</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.199" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">or is this an issue they just need to</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.480" end="01:13:02.719" style="s2">figure out how to transcend this</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:04.560" style="s2">just framing someone who comes to you</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.719" end="01:13:05.679" style="s2">with an issue in terms of those three</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.560" end="01:13:07.360" style="s2">because sometimes the best thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.679" end="01:13:08.400" style="s2">is like all right let&#39;s breathe just</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.360" end="01:13:10.560" style="s2">breathe and</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.400" end="01:13:12.560" style="s2">imagine clear open space and just come</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.560" end="01:13:13.679" style="s2">like just move the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.560" end="01:13:15.280" style="s2">and sometimes you&#39;ll be like okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.679" end="01:13:16.080" style="s2">going to get the list we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.280" end="01:13:17.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:19.360" style="s2">pros and cons list we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.520" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">cognitive behavioral and so we do the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.360" end="01:13:22.320" style="s2">development thing build the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.120" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">beat the problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.320" end="01:13:25.600" style="s2">and then sometimes you need to be like</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">well what did you dream last night right</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.600" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">like what&#39;s the most frightening image</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:31.440" style="s2">you can tell me about what might happen</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:33.360" style="s2">all right work in the domain of</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.440" end="01:13:36.080" style="s2">installment those three</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.360" end="01:13:37.520" style="s2">techniques um those are the three that</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.080" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">i&#39;m pointing to here</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.520" end="01:13:41.600" style="s2">which can emerge spontaneously in</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:42.719" style="s2">practice but with that framing</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.600" end="01:13:46.159" style="s2">and then with the stuff i&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.719" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">to get into in the coming weeks um more</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.159" end="01:13:49.679" style="s2">and more</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:50.880" style="s2">so that we can innovate because it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.679" end="01:13:52.080" style="s2">absolutely have to innovate</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.880" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">because humans have never been in this</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.080" end="01:13:57.600" style="s2">situation before</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:57.600" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a mess</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:04.320" style="s2">thank you david it sounds like we need a</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.239" end="01:14:07.120" style="s2">meta psychological bardic</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.320" end="01:14:08.080" style="s2">tradition to weave together these</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.120" end="01:14:10.640" style="s2">symbols and images</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.080" end="01:14:12.400" style="s2">in ways that uh that can begin the</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.640" end="01:14:16.159" style="s2">process of healing and</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.400" end="01:14:19.040" style="s2">clearing the air um question</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.800" end="01:14:52.159" style="s2">okay even though it&#39;s boring and</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:54.800" style="s2">abstract i know but i just want to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.159" end="01:14:56.880" style="s2">it on the table</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.800" end="01:14:58.000" style="s2">um i asked because i i&#39;m very curious</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.880" end="01:15:01.760" style="s2">for the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.000" end="01:15:04.640" style="s2">um my second question was</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.760" end="01:15:05.600" style="s2">how did this framework come to be like</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.640" end="01:15:07.679" style="s2">what was the</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.600" end="01:15:09.360" style="s2">process of finally starting to write it</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.679" end="01:15:10.960" style="s2">down and like</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.360" end="01:15:12.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious of the story like what</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.960" end="01:15:14.400" style="s2">was the first draft and</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.560" end="01:15:16.400" style="s2">how did it evolve into the thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.400" end="01:15:18.560" style="s2">showing us</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.400" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">yeah i mean i i told a little bit of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.560" end="01:15:22.640" style="s2">it started in</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:24.159" style="s2">graduate school when i was</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.640" end="01:15:25.840" style="s2">forced to basically reckon with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.159" end="01:15:28.480" style="s2">state of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.840" end="01:15:30.159" style="s2">uh and deal with an addiction to reading</p>

<p begin="01:15:30.159" end="01:15:36.800" style="s2">and basically i have notes</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.760" end="01:15:38.480" style="s2">from back then where i start to organize</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.800" end="01:15:39.520" style="s2">the stuff i was seeing</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.480" end="01:15:41.679" style="s2">from all the different fields of</p>

<p begin="01:15:45.120" end="01:15:50.560" style="s2">in the persian framework and then that</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.760" end="01:15:53.360" style="s2">just kind of sat there</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.560" end="01:15:54.880" style="s2">and i kind of drilled super down hard</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.360" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">into the development bit</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.880" end="01:15:58.400" style="s2">became uh this is you know at the</p>

<p begin="01:16:02.080" end="01:16:05.920" style="s2">after being involved operationally for</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.760" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">some time you know just focusing on</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.840" end="01:16:16.320" style="s2">really got that</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.199" end="01:16:17.520" style="s2">nailed in um i&#39;ve been working since my</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.320" end="01:16:19.840" style="s2">20s</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.520" end="01:16:21.840" style="s2">with various kind of meditation</p>

<p begin="01:16:21.840" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">kind of an interest in certain forms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:29.520" style="s2">metacognition and kind of like crossed</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:30.560" style="s2">cross tradition which is to say east and</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.520" end="01:16:33.360" style="s2">west</p>

<p begin="01:16:33.360" end="01:16:35.760" style="s2">i&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.159" end="01:16:36.960" style="s2">independently kind of working on that</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.760" end="01:16:37.600" style="s2">and then the thing that really brought</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.960" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.600" end="01:16:40.960" style="s2">together to allow me to flush it out</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.040" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">fully was a more recent engagement with</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.960" end="01:16:45.040" style="s2">the work of</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:47.920" style="s2">james hellman which kind of crystallized</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.920" end="01:16:51.679" style="s2">of be like freud and jung and a few</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.159" end="01:16:52.560" style="s2">things kind of like hanging around in</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.679" end="01:16:54.880" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.560" end="01:16:56.159" style="s2">um and then it was just there and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.880" end="01:16:58.640" style="s2">just sat there and i was just</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.159" end="01:17:00.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what i was thinking in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.640" end="01:17:01.120" style="s2">having read forest landry&#39;s imminent</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.159" end="01:17:04.239" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:05.920" style="s2">and seeing his triplicate model of basic</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.239" end="01:17:07.760" style="s2">metaphysic categories</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.920" end="01:17:10.480" style="s2">perfectly interdigitating with the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.760" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">persian triple</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.480" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">which itself nested with other</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:15.280" style="s2">metapsychologies</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:17.280" style="s2">excuse me other meta theories and</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.280" end="01:17:18.239" style="s2">metaphysics gave me a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.280" end="01:17:20.080" style="s2">confidence that</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.239" end="01:17:22.239" style="s2">there was something quite deep with the</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.080" end="01:17:24.800" style="s2">triple and it gave me more</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.239" end="01:17:25.360" style="s2">um impetus to kind of really start to</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.800" end="01:17:28.000" style="s2">lay out</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.360" end="01:17:30.080" style="s2">lay it out so i spoke on thorson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.000" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">podcast a couple times</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.080" end="01:17:35.040" style="s2">and uh but i haven&#39;t written it out</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:35.840" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m doing this in part</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.040" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">because i&#39;m going to get this</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.840" end="01:17:40.080" style="s2">transcribed</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.760" end="01:17:41.760" style="s2">and then try to try to basically work it</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.080" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">up into something that could be</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.760" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">a written a written version of it</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.120" end="01:17:51.120" style="s2">so yeah but it is in a sense an oral</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">tradition too</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.120" end="01:17:54.560" style="s2">as i&#39;m saying books can be healing but</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:57.600" style="s2">we need to know</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.560" end="01:18:01.679" style="s2">how to speak and what to say and how to</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.600" end="01:18:03.440" style="s2">paint an image so that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.679" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">a little bit more of it but i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.440" end="01:18:09.120" style="s2">in the next year or so get a book out</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">probably based on these lectures where i</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.120" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">expanded and get the framework much more</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.199" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">thank you auntie now dylan&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.760" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">question</p>

<p begin="01:18:28.560" end="01:18:35.360" style="s2">um my question was about</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.239" end="01:18:36.560" style="s2">childhood adolescent education in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.360" end="01:18:38.400" style="s2">context of this</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.560" end="01:18:39.679" style="s2">surveillance capitalism economy that</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.400" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.679" end="01:18:43.199" style="s2">do you are there any symbols available</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:45.600" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.199" end="01:18:46.560" style="s2">that are psyche integrating or psyche</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.600" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">healing</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.560" end="01:18:50.159" style="s2">within this framework that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:50.159" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.679" end="01:18:59.360" style="s2">i mean usually the image</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.239" end="01:19:02.400" style="s2">that is healing for the psyche is</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.360" end="01:19:06.080" style="s2">created by the psyche who needs it</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.400" end="01:19:09.199" style="s2">so like the image work is mostly about</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.080" end="01:19:11.760" style="s2">deciphering the imagination and dream</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.199" end="01:19:13.360" style="s2">rather than and this is the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.760" end="01:19:15.120" style="s2">our culture rather than</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.360" end="01:19:17.360" style="s2">throwing a bunch of images that are not</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.120" end="01:19:19.360" style="s2">endogenous to the system</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.360" end="01:19:21.840" style="s2">that are exogenous to the system and</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.360" end="01:19:23.760" style="s2">confusing the imagination with what is</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.840" end="01:19:25.760" style="s2">native to the imagination</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.760" end="01:19:27.440" style="s2">right the image that&#39;s primordial to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.760" end="01:19:28.320" style="s2">imagination which is the image that you</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.440" end="01:19:31.280" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.320" end="01:19:31.760" style="s2">help but imagine which is why often it</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.280" end="01:19:34.840" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.760" end="01:19:38.640" style="s2">plague you uh it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.840" end="01:19:41.120" style="s2">recurring uh imaginal cycles</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.640" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">of personality development so that in</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.120" end="01:19:44.239" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:46.320" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking for in the world of</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.239" end="01:19:48.560" style="s2">image is a way to recapture what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.320" end="01:19:50.880" style="s2">native to the imagination</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.560" end="01:19:52.320" style="s2">which like the prime mortality of</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.880" end="01:19:54.960" style="s2">certain archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.320" end="01:19:56.800" style="s2">imaginations um so in that sense you</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.960" end="01:20:00.080" style="s2">want to find a way to</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.800" end="01:20:03.760" style="s2">engage young people in</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.080" end="01:20:07.280" style="s2">um first of all holidays from</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.760" end="01:20:10.000" style="s2">exogenous image saturation</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.280" end="01:20:11.120" style="s2">so can we find a way to get free from</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.000" end="01:20:13.280" style="s2">the images for</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.120" end="01:20:15.760" style="s2">periods of time and then things like</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.280" end="01:20:19.679" style="s2">dreamwork</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.760" end="01:20:23.280" style="s2">and uh um</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.679" end="01:20:26.000" style="s2">joint imaginal exercises uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.280" end="01:20:27.600" style="s2">that&#39;s where you&#39;re go hunting for the</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.000" end="01:20:29.280" style="s2">symbol that we can&#39;t even imagine excuse</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.600" end="01:20:30.880" style="s2">me the image right now</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.280" end="01:20:33.360" style="s2">that we can&#39;t even really construct we</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.880" end="01:20:35.199" style="s2">have to find we have to help them find</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.360" end="01:20:37.120" style="s2">it this is a lot of what happens in</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.199" end="01:20:38.800" style="s2">like jungian psychotherapy and other</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.120" end="01:20:41.760" style="s2">forms of psychotherapy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.800" end="01:20:42.960" style="s2">helping the person clarify the image of</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.760" end="01:20:46.719" style="s2">the self</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.960" end="01:20:49.679" style="s2">and that also clarifies right</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.719" end="01:20:50.560" style="s2">who am i what&#39;s the context scene and</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.679" end="01:20:54.000" style="s2">setting</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.560" end="01:20:57.120" style="s2">that is kind of recorded the unique self</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.000" end="01:21:00.320" style="s2">um and then that allows for</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.120" end="01:21:02.719" style="s2">clarity basically so yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.320" end="01:21:04.080" style="s2">you know which superhero do you identify</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.719" end="01:21:05.280" style="s2">with like</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.080" end="01:21:07.199" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s what the culture is</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.280" end="01:21:09.920" style="s2">sucking us into you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.199" end="01:21:10.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like what&#39;s the superhero in</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.920" end="01:21:12.320" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.560" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">that&#39;s actually keeping putting this one</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.320" end="01:21:17.920" style="s2">image in front of your</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:20.320" style="s2">face so there&#39;s a lot more to say about</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.920" end="01:21:20.960" style="s2">image but it starts with image that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.320" end="01:21:22.800" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.960" end="01:21:24.000" style="s2">like if you go with a land drain</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.800" end="01:21:27.440" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.000" end="01:21:30.560" style="s2">then the insolent is</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.440" end="01:21:34.239" style="s2">primary and the transient tran</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.560" end="01:21:36.960" style="s2">transcendent and developmental are</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.239" end="01:21:38.880" style="s2">conjugate right which is to say that if</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.960" end="01:21:41.760" style="s2">you&#39;re starting you start with</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.880" end="01:21:42.000" style="s2">with image so you&#39;re right to look in</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.760" end="01:21:45.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.000" end="01:21:46.239" style="s2">direction and uh yeah like that&#39;s as an</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.520" end="01:21:49.679" style="s2">educator it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.239" end="01:21:53.679" style="s2">the most worrisome thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.679" end="01:21:56.000" style="s2">overwhelming exogenous just like</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.679" end="01:21:58.320" style="s2">way way way too many images thrown at</p>
