<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">this project is so important to me is I</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.909" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">have a lot of reasons why it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">difficult for me to leave the house and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:21.780" style="s2">I want to have connection within my own</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">space and creating a platform for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">where I can say hey I want it right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">I&#39;m discussing in Black Mirror with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">bunch of other a bunch of other two</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">other moms on Wednesday night we watch</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">don&#39;t know who they are once I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">them in person then that means something</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">to me and in person I mean also on video</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:55.350" style="s2">chat feels like I&#39;ve met them in person</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">and so there is an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.350" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">ways to use that service but as people</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.060" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like seek out a support group well</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:22.500" style="s2">that&#39;s easier said than done when one it</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.180" end="00:02:55.260" style="s2">can start with something a lot simpler</p>

<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:43.980" style="s2">whatever whatever happens to be and have</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:46.769" style="s2">guiding questions and ways to because</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.980" end="00:03:48.930" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a formal support group</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.769" end="00:03:50.190" style="s2">there&#39;s not a therapist or it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">people getting together and discussing</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.190" end="00:03:56.160" style="s2">their story and how and talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">and just that act helps having someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.160" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">listen who&#39;s in the same boat or has</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">been in the same boat it&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:04.830" style="s2">and so the one of the reasons I want</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:08.120" style="s2">this to be the first project that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.830" end="00:04:11.880" style="s2">actually created is I believe that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.120" end="00:04:13.640" style="s2">becomes the other projects as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.880" end="00:04:15.630" style="s2">able to because it&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.640" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">support groups the more you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.630" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">say hey I would like to discuss global</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:24.050" style="s2">hunger my own family&#39;s hunger poverty</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:25.490" style="s2">whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.050" end="00:04:27.800" style="s2">you then have a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.490" end="00:04:31.759" style="s2">discussing it then I think very</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.800" end="00:04:33.699" style="s2">organically grows into how do we solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.759" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">these problems how do we collectively</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.699" end="00:04:43.990" style="s2">discuss them and I can very much see</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">using an online group chat platform to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.990" end="00:04:49.849" style="s2">create the other ideas because you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:52.009" style="s2">people who care about an idea and can</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.849" end="00:04:55.550" style="s2">therefore start a chat group on how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.009" end="00:04:57.530" style="s2">make it actually happen and it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.550" end="00:04:58.639" style="s2">the ones that has a direct impact on my</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.530" end="00:04:59.960" style="s2">life right away because as I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:02.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of reasons I can&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.960" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">the home my house I have a disability</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.090" end="00:05:06.979" style="s2">that keeps me in the house a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">time it&#39;s hard for me to go up for many</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.979" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">hours</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:12.469" style="s2">it&#39;s very fatiguing it&#39;s also on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:14.719" style="s2">single mom so I have a lot of time with</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.469" end="00:05:16.129" style="s2">my child home asleep or I can&#39;t go out</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.719" end="00:05:18.319" style="s2">but I can have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.129" end="00:05:21.460" style="s2">someone or when she&#39;s in daycare I could</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.319" end="00:05:24.319" style="s2">have a conversation with someone and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.460" end="00:05:25.639" style="s2">yeah so by and just by personality I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.319" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">kind of like chatting with people online</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.639" end="00:05:32.300" style="s2">more so than going out to a to allow a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:33.529" style="s2">coffee shop and meeting someone and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.300" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">works for me it makes me feel connected</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.529" end="00:05:38.180" style="s2">in a way that talking on the phone or</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:39.500" style="s2">typing doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t make me feel and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.180" end="00:05:43.370" style="s2">a lot of the services that are already</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.500" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">out there don&#39;t do what this is doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.370" end="00:05:49.460" style="s2">that I want this to be like Meetup</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:51.770" style="s2">but online so meetup is all about</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.460" end="00:05:53.240" style="s2">meeting offline through online and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.770" end="00:05:55.400" style="s2">is about meeting online through online</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.240" end="00:05:56.509" style="s2">so saying here is the link to where</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.400" end="00:05:57.560" style="s2">we&#39;re discussing on here&#39;s the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.509" end="00:05:58.699" style="s2">here&#39;s the language here&#39;s what were</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.560" end="00:06:02.620" style="s2">discussing and here&#39;s the group we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.699" end="00:06:04.879" style="s2">discussing it with people can be added</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.620" end="00:06:06.289" style="s2">it&#39;s a fairly simple program because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.879" end="00:06:07.460" style="s2">not going to create the video chat</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.289" end="00:06:09.469" style="s2">itself I&#39;m going to use the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.460" end="00:06:11.020" style="s2">are available on skype except to add</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.469" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2">people but there&#39;s one called up here in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.020" end="00:06:16.270" style="s2">there seems to work it&#39;s not perfect but</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:19.909" style="s2">these are my work with what you got</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.270" end="00:06:22.759" style="s2">so that is Apple number two which will</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.909" end="00:06:23.990" style="s2">end up being actual Apple number one or</p>
