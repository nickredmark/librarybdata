<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">these groups one of them being stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">toronto</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">which quickly became one of the largest</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">practitioning stoic or at least i like</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">to think i am</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">and the other group was another</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">group um called intellectual explorers</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">club at the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">and uh and through both these groups uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">i got some reputation in these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">like sense making game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">type circles because i was writing about</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">the culture war and the medic tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:33.519" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">invited john to my podcast first time i</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen him or spoke to him in a while</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">uh when we got lunch and i told him</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">about all these kind of conversational</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">modalities that i&#39;ve been engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">like circling</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">and whatnot and he just got so excited</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:46.080" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">because he there&#39;s an intuition there</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.080" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">that there was something there</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">and uh so went on a research project</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">started researching a lot of these kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">of conversational modalities like</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">circling</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.840" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">insight dialogue um restorative circles</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">empty circles</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">i introduced john to a lot of players in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">this space like a guy</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">and then they just freaking hit it off</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s kind of how i know</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">john and before covet happened we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">part of a bi-weekly circling group here</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">in toronto with taylor</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">um i&#39;m authentically i think he was on</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">his on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">show um so that&#39;s that&#39;s how i know uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">john and so when when covet happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">my my philosophy groups i couldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">meet in person anymore uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">because you know you couldn&#39;t uh get me</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">to do social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">and i always had a desire to uh for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">long while now to open up a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:37.680" style="s2">philosophical coffee shop to house</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">these groups so you know our wisdom gym</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.680" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">ecology of practices could have uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">could be done in the physical location</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">um so like you know what fuck it let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">just uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">launch this online so i launched the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">stoa</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">which is basically combining that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">more jazzy philosophical group</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">intellectual sports club and this dose</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">in toronto i combined them together</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">called the stoa and it became an online</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">event space</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">we have something uh like a college of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">practice in our wisdom gym that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">emerging</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">and we have i call it a communal podcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">it&#39;s basically like like this you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">you interview someone and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">collective intelligence uh asks</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">questions to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">speaker which is great by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">because it saves you from doing research</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">on your speakers you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">everyone else to do that i i love that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">you know podcasting much better</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">uh but ultimately i don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">what it is or where it&#39;s going either</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">too which kind of makes it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">exciting</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve described yourself as a stoic so</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">maybe just for for those who don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">i think john talked about it in his</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">meaning crisis series so you can refer</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">in episode 20 or something like that um</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">it was an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">philosophy that started in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">greece and then migrated to ancient rome</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">um and it actually started in uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">like a the stoic okayly it was a painted</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">porch</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">that&#39;s how they got the name they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">hanging out with the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">and uh yeah that&#39;s what they got done in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">the stoix and zeno was the original</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">stoic</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">uh but they&#39;re known more they had like</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">their whole cosmology that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">kind of philosophy but they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">known uh today</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">for the the kind of the three roman</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">stoics marcus aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">seneca and epictetus um</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">and and because they they</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">really put emphasis on ethics roman and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">the stoic ethics</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">and it maps over like beautifully to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">lot of uh psychological principles today</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">uh and i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">the axiomatic core of stoicism is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">they call live in accordance with nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">um and how to do that as you follow the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:18.960" style="s2">cardinal virtues uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">prudence practical reason um</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">courage uh temperance and injustice</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">and if you double click on the practical</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">reason there is they have this i&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">them uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">lived heuristics uh like focus on</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">what&#39;s in your control the dichotomy of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">control radically focus on what you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">control and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">and do not concern yourself what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">in your control uh more fact they love</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">thy fate</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">um voluntary hardship you know like lean</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">into uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">um obstacles so they have this famous</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">line the obstacle is the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">um so i don&#39;t know if i did justice</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">explaining</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">stoicism but that&#39;s it in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s known to be like</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">hyper practical when i uh i took</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">in university they didn&#39;t discuss</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:03.039" style="s2">stoicism at all because it was too</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">practical they just had like one mention</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.039" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">in like the 101 class um a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">from the group that i was running in</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">toronto people who tend to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">uh work or operate environments with</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">high uncertainty like military doctors</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">entrepreneurs they tend to gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:20.000" style="s2">towards stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">because they&#39;re like you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">already doing this philosophy this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">this is putting a name to it</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">um so that i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">encapsulates what stoicism is and i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">i guess i&#39;m a little bit weird stoic um</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">if you read some of my journals and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">writings but</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of the core of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">actually that that&#39;s the question i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">going to ask next uh that you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">brought up you i think i&#39;ve seen you</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">describe yourself as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">unconventional stoic so what is what</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">does that mean to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:50.960" style="s2">yeah maybe it&#39;s like a sloppy stoic</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.960" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">uh someone who um is not always</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">congruent with principles um that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">not true that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">let me let me think i guess like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">proselytizers of stoicism they call them</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">the modern stoicism movement and guys</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">like donald robinson</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">uh massimo uh ryan holiday</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">um they don&#39;t really kind of play in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:18.440" style="s2">sandbox that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">a lot of us play in with uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.440" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">metamodernism the meaning crisis game b</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">and so i guess i&#39;m like i have a foot</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:28.639" style="s2">and strong resonance in this world uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">and then i have a foot the stoic world</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.639" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">too but most people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">talk or write about social have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here so i guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:36.959" style="s2">i&#39;m sort of like the black sheep of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">modern stoic community because they</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.959" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">don&#39;t the fuck i&#39;m talking about half</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">the time when i&#39;m talking about like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">know game b</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">your meaning crisis and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">um so that&#39;s why i kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">self-describe myself as a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">stoic weirdo but yeah and then the one</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">thing too</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">this the you know there&#39;s like a lower</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">case statism</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">or like the dictionary definition of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">stoicism where you like repress your</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">emotions you don&#39;t you don&#39;t you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">like you don&#39;t share</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">what&#39;s really what&#39;s really bothering</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">you and then there&#39;s like stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">you know the uppercase sources and which</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">is the actual philosophy of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">and a lot of people have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:15.920" style="s2">misunderstanding i think it&#39;s very fair</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">why they have this is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.920" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">you know stoics are these emotionless</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">you know like they don&#39;t express</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">anything but it&#39;s like if you read</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">journals or if you interact with me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">like a fucking emotional basket case i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">just articulating</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">what i i feel is most alive for me and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">these conversational modalities that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">know john and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">guy the guy has developed circling it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">all about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.519" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">um and i think what&#39;s really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">about stoicism is uh there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">something called cognitive diffusion</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">acceptance commitment therapy talks</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">about it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">like creating distance between you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">your emotional realities</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">uh so you don&#39;t get like a mesh with</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">them so you&#39;re not hijacked by them so</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">you&#39;re not reacting</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">from them stoicism is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">operating system</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">if you follow it uh loyally they create</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:06.480" style="s2">that cognitive diffusion um</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s just step one in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.480" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">step two is like turning around looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">at the emotions and then building a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">relationship with them learning from</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:13.600" style="s2">them what are they trying to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">treat them as friends giving you advice</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.600" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">and friends always give the best advice</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:22.079" style="s2">but you can learn something from them um</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s sort of stoicism that i like</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">doing it which is kind of like a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">bit weird because you know other people</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">are reading it i don&#39;t know who exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:12.079" style="s2">is reading it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">but i do get myself in a state where i</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.079" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">am writing to myself in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">remind myself of these these truths that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">i hold</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">and and what what so you&#39;ve done this</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">now for a hundred days</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">have you noticed any transformative</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">effects in yourself from doing this what</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">what does it afford to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">would you say um</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">yeah it was really good man</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;s really really been good uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">actually my favorite part of the day</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:42.560" style="s2">waking up being an espresso just pumping</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">up the journal</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">um and it&#39;s an it&#39;s an exercise to just</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">be radically truthful too that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">um because that&#39;s what the stoics and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">lot of other people believe is that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">better off of philosophy before you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">to all the nitty gritties is</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">is the capacity to be truthful mapping</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">over your work to what you believe to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">true in reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">and this is just another form of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">and it helps slow down my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">uh and it helps process like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">emotional realities the pains the hurts</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:10.959" style="s2">the confusions that i&#39;m going through</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">it&#39;s been really really helpful to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.959" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been privately journaling i</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">gotta have probably over like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">thousand hours of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">private journaling uh they used to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">like the artist uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:23.279" style="s2">way morning pages exercises you just</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.279" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">just write to yourself reassociation</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">style in the morning that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">really helps kind of processing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">like circling what i really like about</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">circling</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">is you&#39;re mapping your words to your</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">reality your felt sense reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">uh and so you can kind of like separate</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">what your thoughts are what your story</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">your narrative is</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">despite my better judgment i invited him</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">on to do a session</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">uh friday nights the dark stoa and</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.240" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">best to start with the first one</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know if that answers your</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.919" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">question kyra but i really like the guy</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">dangerous but i like him i guess maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">the follow-up question would be how did</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">like how do you now that you&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">to know him how do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">where would you put him because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">that i had encountered him like a year</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">and a half ago</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">and so when he started showing up on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">dark so i was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">okay like my he had been on my radar too</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">for the same reason and so i was just</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">curious where</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">where he fits in in your map now</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">um yes he definitely has a reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.399" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">um fight to him uh for sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">um temperamentally and uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s the the he&#39;s into</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:36.860" style="s2">which is a more sophisticated way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">saying conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.860" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">from a very first principle approach</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s that kind of like that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">constellation going on there</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">uh but he&#39;s also plugged into the game b</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">space he was danish market burger he</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">um talked to alexander bard</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">but yeah he&#39;s uh he&#39;s a very collective</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">thinker</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">but he is more more reactionary at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">temperamentally i would say</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">thanks on the subject of the dark story</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:18.799" style="s2">little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">what you mean by that and the importance</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">of that concept</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">yeah um so the daemon or the diamond</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">i really want to pronounce it i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">know uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">i got it from like socrates essentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">he said that uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">it is daemon is his guiding spirit um</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">you know and the way i hold it if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">want to like articulate it in secular</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">it&#39;s uh like a certain quality of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">intuition that says go here</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know why it&#39;s saying go</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">here but when you listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">there&#39;s like no guarantee either if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2">go there um so this is gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">victory but if you go there</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">like delicious things happen um so</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">for example like me wanting to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:57.279" style="s2">peterson as a client</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">befriending john he started the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.279" end="00:29:00.399" style="s2">we started the stoa you write that white</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">paper all these are like daemon</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:03.840" style="s2">kind of like impulses they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">didn&#39;t come from first principle</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.840" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">you know they got like the the prudence</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">check after the fact but</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">what kind of like nudged me there was a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">certain quality of intuition that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">quite different</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">than other intuitions is not like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">hedonistic thing it&#39;s not like um</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">desire to dominate or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">that&#39;s how i personally hold uh the demo</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">and then the you know the greeks they</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">have something called eudemonia which a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">modernists translate into happiness but</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:31.039" style="s2">if you just unpack the word it means</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">being in right relationship with your</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.039" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">demon</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">being right relationship with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:38.880" style="s2">guiding spirit that quality of intuition</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s how i</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.880" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">uh hold the dame on and then i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">you you</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">you i think you created this discord</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">passion</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">well a passion project i imagine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">some demonic kind of energy going on</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">yeah as you were as you were describing</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:56.720" style="s2">it it felt very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">to what was going on with me well as i</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.720" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">john&#39;s awakening from the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">and and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">the instinct that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">important going on here that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">know if it&#39;ll work</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.279" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">but i think there&#39;s something worth</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">trying and worth and i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">to be a part of it to help make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">happen uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">so now now now of course the would you</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.799" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">say i mean our instincts can lead us in</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">the wrong direction too would you say</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">that&#39;s different than our daemon that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">the daemon is our the good instincts and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">the but then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.039" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">the not so good instincts and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">tell the how do you tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">then how do you tell when it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">demon versus</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">leading you in the wrong direction and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">you&#39;re stray</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">right um yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:42.399" style="s2">uh i can just speak for myself when i</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.919" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">live in such a way where i&#39;m listening</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">and following</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">this um kind of intuitive instinct</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">uh it leads to good places uh but you</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">can interpret it</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">you know what it&#39;s telling you um and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:01.760" style="s2">you can do your ego can get in the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">you can have narcissistic qualities and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">kind of like bachelor eyes like</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.279" end="00:32:40.960" style="s2">different practices that can be you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">reported on a zoom channel and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.960" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">could be replicated and scaled up</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">mark you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">yeah peter i was wondering about you</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">know you&#39;re talking about the stoic as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">place to</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">sort of explore and uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">uh go into detail with these ecologies</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">of practices</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">and i was curious as to what those were</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">and if you&#39;re sort of taking any</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">ecologies</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">from stoicism uh just because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">unfamiliar with</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">you know what they had in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">ecologies of practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">right it seems to be all mine stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">and and how that plays into your</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">to your mission with the stoa mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">uh as i mentioned to brett earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">modern stoic authors they teased out</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">because first of all</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">there was still a text like i think 90</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">of them went missing so we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">know much</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">about like a lot of the details the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">nitty-gritty of the stoics and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">lineage as dead like there was no like</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">living stoics that kind of like existed</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">from ancient rome to now um so</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">the ecology of practices that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">the modern stoics mention</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">like you know voluntary hardship uh the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">journaling</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">um the view from above they&#39;re just sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">of teasing them out</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">of the text and there&#39;s there&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">a consensus or a complete agreement of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">what they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">so i&#39;m not really concerned about uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">about that and kind of bringing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">forth to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">the stoa and it&#39;s sort of a bait and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">switch like the stoa is is stewarded or</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">run by a stoic but</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">the majority of our events like 90 99 of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">them are not above stoicism i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">really i don&#39;t before</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:22.240" style="s2">talking about stoicism um that being</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.240" end="00:34:27.679" style="s2">uh how to discover an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">practices within the wisdom gym</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">right now i&#39;m just being um a total</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">cowboy to be quite frank</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:35.280" style="s2">about it i&#39;m just listening to my dame</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">on what kind of practices i want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.280" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">experiment test out and want to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">reoccurring</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">in the gym and people are reaching out</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">invented that practice and it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">circling-esque</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">practice a wee space type practice she</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">um we have a few other reefs-based</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">practitioners coming in</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if people are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">space but it&#39;s an integral theory term</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">these conversation authentic</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.119" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">the hope is is once we do all these</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">experimentations we can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">legitimate studies on this</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great okay so so you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:39.599" style="s2">uh as well and this is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">experiment sort of in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.599" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">while involving other people</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">yeah 100 like you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">uh practice and experiment</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.960" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">uh wildly in in this space</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">and i kind of like this this term vince</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:02.400" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:23.119" style="s2">and it essentially um a place where</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:24.960" style="s2">kind of multiple ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.119" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">can exist so you can have like you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">a dui approach that calls you practices</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.960" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">but that was the experiment of doing a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">community sprayer and oddly enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">a lot of people that were practitioners</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:39.680" style="s2">modifications on it with kind of a stoic</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">framing and</p>

<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">it&#39;s more about encouraging people to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">have an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">of practice you know you know for him</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing group lectio divina</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">for the meeting crisis and in his</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">meditation series he taught sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:16.240" style="s2">version of lectio divina you know this</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:19.599" style="s2">uh sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.240" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">meditative uh embodiment style reading</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">uh that we&#39;ve been doing as a group uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">uh i mean we have we have people uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">doing circling type authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">type events as well</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">uh so so basically trying to hit hit</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">all of the uh the bases we we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">we&#39;re experimenting with ecstatic dance</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">which i think i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">you guys doing on on your on your group</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">as well so i think there&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">lot of overlap in the i</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">i i&#39;ve noticed uh what i&#39;ve looked at</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">your list</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">a lot of things you&#39;re doing are similar</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">to things we&#39;re doing but you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">different takes on them which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">contrast</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s pretty cool man um and i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">ideas can be fully explored</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">here with the community that actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">watched all 50 videos</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">on um what brett was mentioning about</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">uh the differences or the similarities</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on here and just</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">as an observer having participated in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">bunch of storm events previously</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">and like i i think what i&#39;ve realized</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">doa is there&#39;s something specifically</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">sacred in it in the way that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:17.359" style="s2">shrined up in a zoom call it has a</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">specific time</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.359" end="00:52:21.440" style="s2">nobody you know you don&#39;t know ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">the zoom call who&#39;s going to be in there</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.440" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:25.839" style="s2">as part of the audience and then uh you</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">know boom you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.839" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s very intense and then and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">and then you know it&#39;s it&#39;s over and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">then you&#39;re out and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:39.760" style="s2">um uh there&#39;s no reception to</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:41.200" style="s2">mingle with the with the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.760" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean it as a criticism but i</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.200" end="00:52:47.200" style="s2">think one of the reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:50.720" style="s2">things like the discord to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">um is partly in response for this</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.720" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">this feeling of wanting to commune with</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">the community the audience</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:52:59.359" style="s2">in in various ways both you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">formally</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">by being able to rehearse or practice or</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">develop these psycho technologies or</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">these ecology practices but also just to</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:09.440" style="s2">shoot the shit</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">and just to figure out who we are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.440" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:16.240" style="s2">um so i i guess that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">just a comment but also to pose a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.240" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">to maybe both of you guys is</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">are there specific um</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.720" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">outcomes that you guys are noticing</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">based on the structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:35.839" style="s2">of the technology for so for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">peter you mentioned that you had a stoic</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.839" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">group in toronto you guys met</p>

<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:43.040" style="s2">specifically different about</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">what the stillweb platform on zoom is</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:46.000" style="s2">affording is there something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">hacking</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.000" end="00:53:49.280" style="s2">in the zoom feature that that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">affording you something and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:52.319" style="s2">and likewise to bread is there something</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">about the discord</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.319" end="00:53:55.680" style="s2">format the structure of it that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">affording</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.680" end="00:53:59.040" style="s2">something particular that we&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">we&#39;re after</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.040" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">and and i&#39;m assuming that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">difference between zoom and discord</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">and and and i keep wanting to know</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:09.440" style="s2">you know what what is that difference</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.440" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">so thanks</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">this guy has so much good questions i</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:19.359" style="s2">love uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">um when it comes to the store want me to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.359" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">go first right</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">uh i mean uh with with discord and</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:28.400" style="s2">one thing well first that this that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">distinguishes discord from say</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.400" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">twitter or facebook is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:37.280" style="s2">video and voice seamless with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">chatting and i think that it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">little more personal a little more real</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">that you&#39;re not just chatting it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:47.440" style="s2">uh fairly toxic you know when when all</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.440" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">talking through text but once you add</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:53.520" style="s2">video and voice</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">it makes the other person much more real</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.520" end="00:54:56.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s similar to zoom</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2">uh you know the fact that people can go</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.559" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">in and out uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.079" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">of discord is something i really like</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.880" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">discords uh too you know you you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">the coffee house discord you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">weinstein&#39;s discord you know there</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:12.319" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of overlap so</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:12.720" style="s2">people can sort of see what what they</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.720" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">they can sort of be in in a similar area</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">and they can see what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">their discords and come in and out</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">and you can just pop on you know one</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:25.359" style="s2">advantage discord has over</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">over say zoom is you know you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.359" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">lot more of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">the casual conversations that just pop</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:30.559" style="s2">up where people just want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:32.799" style="s2">conversation so they</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.559" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">pop into a voice channel and just talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.799" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">where zoom</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:36.960" style="s2">is more more you have to have a planned</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.440" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">event with an invite</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.960" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">uh uh and whatnot but but zoom is great</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">i mean for example for psyc</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">for doing things like deal logos where</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">you can just</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">have all your people and then divide</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:50.559" style="s2">them into however many rooms you want</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">with a click of a button that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.559" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">big advantage</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:54.720" style="s2">that zoom has over discord just a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.680" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">harder</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.720" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">you really have to just manually create</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">a bunch of rooms to do that here on</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:02.240" style="s2">discord</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:03.920" style="s2">so so and we view zoom two sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.240" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">so we sort of meet here and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.920" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">sometimes move to zoom so depending on</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">so uh yeah i&#39;ll answer this question</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.799" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">i have to have to go but uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.799" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll size that the zoom discord</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">thing but uh i think i&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">into the question the spirit of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get at there</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">um so when i started the store i</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">had a like a policy like no social media</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:36.720" style="s2">there&#39;s no discord</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">no facebook no reddit uh disabled all</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.720" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">youtube comments yeah i threw up the q a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.280" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">the podcast that i just they got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">everything and she&#39;s on the zoom channel</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:47.359" style="s2">it&#39;s people can private message</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">um and there is like you&#39;re gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:49.920" style="s2">towards there&#39;s kind of like that almost</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">like a sacred quality there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.920" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">like a weird silence</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s that maybe that lack of kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">of like shooting the shit element</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">um that uh discord could afford um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s the wrong move maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:02.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll start at discord eventually and do</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.000" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">but i am there&#39;s a distrust i have</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">towards it</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">um these type of formats</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.280" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">in the sense that it can turn into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">shit show uh it can get</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:16.000" style="s2">medically hijacked by certain romantic</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.839" end="00:57:17.680" style="s2">tribes um</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.000" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">you see that in the game b forums on</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.680" end="00:57:20.480" style="s2">facebook uh and maybe this one is</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">protected because it has good</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.480" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">stewardship</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:24.720" style="s2">or it&#39;s like so localized around john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">stuff you&#39;re only gonna get geeky super</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.720" end="00:57:27.440" style="s2">users that like</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">know about the thing so it may be cool</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.440" end="00:57:31.599" style="s2">here but but the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">is much broader in its scope and</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:33.839" style="s2">especially the project of memetic</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.960" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">mediation</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">where we&#39;re inviting people from we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:38.480" style="s2">writing like queer anarchists to like</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.480" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">jack murphy to pat ryan like we have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">slew</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:44.799" style="s2">of people come in here at the stowa and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:45.599" style="s2">then they&#39;re going to bring their</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.799" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">audiences</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.599" end="00:57:51.119" style="s2">in and if um i just</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">when i have a just thought of having a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">space on it i just think it will get</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">kind of a medically messy</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:57.280" style="s2">and when that cultural noise will come</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">in especially if the project is</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.280" end="00:58:00.480" style="s2">pneumatic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve been hesitant about doing it so far</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.480" end="00:58:02.960" style="s2">maybe for that reason that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2">the reason why i disabled all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.960" end="00:58:09.119" style="s2">comments um</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:10.079" style="s2">and also another uh tyranny of</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.119" end="00:58:11.839" style="s2">structuralism</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this term as a feminist term</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.839" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">where it can like group things can just</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">hijack a space</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">and um yeah so i&#39;m cautious about having</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">that there even though there&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.760" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">much benefits like these things are</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">again at the emerging um but with the</p>
