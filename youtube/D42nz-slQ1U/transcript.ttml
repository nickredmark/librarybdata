<p begin="00:00:02.810" end="00:00:10.260" style="s2">one of the people who I reached out to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.660" end="00:00:11.429" style="s2">help me communicate the idea was asking</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.260" end="00:00:13.230" style="s2">this for I&#39;m her from her like a week</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.429" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">she was like wait it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.230" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">communism could you explain how it is it</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:22.289" style="s2">is it was like well this idea is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:26.150" style="s2">best of capitalism and communism without</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.289" end="00:00:26.150" style="s2">the downside clearly in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.380" end="00:00:38.030" style="s2">in part that draws people in but then</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.480" end="00:00:40.550" style="s2">when you look at communism throughout</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.030" end="00:00:43.700" style="s2">history and the atrocities that happen I</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.550" end="00:00:45.830" style="s2">mean I some degree understand how they</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.700" end="00:00:48.230" style="s2">happen like I don&#39;t understand why Pol</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.830" end="00:00:50.210" style="s2">Pot kill all the intellectuals like if</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.230" end="00:00:53.450" style="s2">you knew how to read if you wore glasses</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.210" end="00:00:55.730" style="s2">you removed like that to me is so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.450" end="00:00:57.500" style="s2">clearly unethical but like how does that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.730" end="00:00:59.480" style="s2">help you at all how does it help and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.500" end="00:01:01.370" style="s2">also in communist and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.480" end="00:01:03.200" style="s2">favorite things on there like and cab</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.370" end="00:01:05.510" style="s2">and calm sight that I&#39;m part of on</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.200" end="00:01:07.640" style="s2">Facebook is like the idea that communist</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.510" end="00:01:10.520" style="s2">like communist equal starvation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.640" end="00:01:12.740" style="s2">like okay not necessarily but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.520" end="00:01:16.040" style="s2">understand we actually kind of do suck</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.740" end="00:01:19.310" style="s2">at central planning as a species and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.040" end="00:01:20.990" style="s2">to me explaining that the system is like</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.310" end="00:01:22.850" style="s2">the best of capitalism communism was</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.990" end="00:01:25.100" style="s2">like well what what is the good part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.850" end="00:01:28.460" style="s2">communism I think there&#39;s a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.100" end="00:01:31.659" style="s2">I think that people helping one another</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.460" end="00:01:34.549" style="s2">and giving kind of what you can is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.659" end="00:01:37.400" style="s2">positive but then the downside is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.549" end="00:01:40.220" style="s2">big and the idea that communism goes</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.400" end="00:01:42.380" style="s2">through this in-between period that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.220" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">never been gotten out of we&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.380" end="00:01:46.670" style="s2">well this this elite group will take</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:48.980" style="s2">ownership I guess well like wheel</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:50.540" style="s2">century essentially plan everything and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.980" end="00:01:52.310" style="s2">we&#39;ll be like the new elite but like</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.540" end="00:01:54.800" style="s2">will give the power back when it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.310" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">and of course spoiler alert they never</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.800" end="00:02:01.250" style="s2">do and what I&#39;m proposing has not about</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:05.990" style="s2">because there is no us in them there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.250" end="00:02:07.970" style="s2">no hierarchy there is no central system</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.990" end="00:02:09.410" style="s2">that&#39;s like we&#39;re gonna take over power</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.970" end="00:02:12.530" style="s2">and then and then give it out the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.410" end="00:02:14.629" style="s2">closest thing we do have that is we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.530" end="00:02:16.730" style="s2">only be as transparent and democratic as</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.629" end="00:02:18.830" style="s2">technology allow I was well we create</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.730" end="00:02:20.209" style="s2">that technology and so that is a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.830" end="00:02:21.500" style="s2">a gray area where it&#39;s like I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.209" end="00:02:23.269" style="s2">worried I can&#39;t be honest and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.500" end="00:02:23.870" style="s2">transparent about like every thought in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.269" end="00:02:26.269" style="s2">my head</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.870" end="00:02:29.989" style="s2">clearly I&#39;m trying but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.269" end="00:02:32.150" style="s2">maybe not the best communicator but that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.989" end="00:02:34.430" style="s2">there is no transition period it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.150" end="00:02:37.310" style="s2">then there is no central planning in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.430" end="00:02:39.050" style="s2">same way like we&#39;re not taking down all</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.310" end="00:02:40.550" style="s2">of the economy and then being like oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.050" end="00:02:41.960" style="s2">great how what do we do so how many</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.550" end="00:02:44.660" style="s2">loaves of bread is it that we need in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.960" end="00:02:47.690" style="s2">who who who grows the wheat up</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.660" end="00:02:51.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the opposite it&#39;s we live</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.690" end="00:02:52.760" style="s2">within a capitalist society which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.050" end="00:02:54.500" style="s2">also like and she was like well they</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.760" end="00:02:56.120" style="s2">much and so explained to communism part</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.500" end="00:02:57.560" style="s2">like the best part of calm you know how</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.120" end="00:02:58.970" style="s2">it is the best part of communism she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.560" end="00:03:01.190" style="s2">like well great but what&#39;s the best part</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.970" end="00:03:03.290" style="s2">of capitalism like that&#39;s so much harder</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.190" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">for me to answer and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.290" end="00:03:10.490" style="s2">similar to like I was raised Christian</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:13.300" style="s2">and it very much influences Who I am but</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.490" end="00:03:15.650" style="s2">at the same time very critical of it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.300" end="00:03:17.030" style="s2">in a way that I&#39;m not critical about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.650" end="00:03:18.530" style="s2">religions because I wasn&#39;t raised that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.030" end="00:03:22.100" style="s2">way and at the same time like I live in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">a very Christian society like when we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.100" end="00:03:26.390" style="s2">celebrate Christmas and Easter and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:28.820" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s similar to that where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.390" end="00:03:31.580" style="s2">like capitalism is our water that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.820" end="00:03:33.020" style="s2">live in it&#39;s what like this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.580" end="00:03:35.990" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to have innovation if</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.020" end="00:03:38.300" style="s2">innovation isn&#39;t done for money I get it</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.990" end="00:03:39.530" style="s2">it&#39;s so pervasive and I&#39;m like oh how</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.300" end="00:03:42.110" style="s2">are people gonna innovate I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.530" end="00:03:44.570" style="s2">people aren&#39;t innovating for money very</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.110" end="00:03:46.100" style="s2">few people want money they want what</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.570" end="00:03:50.030" style="s2">money will get them they want connection</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.100" end="00:03:51.140" style="s2">they want they want um power they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.030" end="00:03:53.450" style="s2">like there&#39;s certain things that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.140" end="00:03:54.530" style="s2">people want and that&#39;s there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.450" end="00:03:56.030" style="s2">necessarily anything inherently wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.530" end="00:03:58.960" style="s2">with that like the fact we exist along</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.030" end="00:04:02.420" style="s2">the spectrum of cooperative to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.960" end="00:04:04.820" style="s2">competitive nothing wrong about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.420" end="00:04:07.250" style="s2">issue as capitalism only kind of rewards</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.820" end="00:04:11.300" style="s2">the uber competitive and everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.250" end="00:04:13.400" style="s2">is not able to be out and not like so</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.300" end="00:04:15.740" style="s2">anyway so having what is the best side</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.400" end="00:04:17.390" style="s2">of capitalism that it has I do think it</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.740" end="00:04:20.570" style="s2">has innovation when you unleash the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.390" end="00:04:23.030" style="s2">genius in people it&#39;s its own reward to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.570" end="00:04:26.120" style="s2">create like scientists don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.030" end="00:04:27.470" style="s2">the ones that are the reason people get</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.120" end="00:04:31.270" style="s2">into science is because they want that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.470" end="00:04:34.640" style="s2">aha moment they want to like years of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.270" end="00:04:36.020" style="s2">putting in all of this time to get that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.640" end="00:04:37.910" style="s2">aha moment is what&#39;s worth it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.020" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">not necessarily the paycheck they need</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.910" end="00:04:42.260" style="s2">the paycheck but it&#39;s not um it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:44.780" style="s2">the incentive and I would say the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.260" end="00:04:47.060" style="s2">is true for inventions and art and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.780" end="00:04:48.860" style="s2">everything else I mean do people only do</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.060" end="00:04:51.410" style="s2">art because they could make it rich and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.860" end="00:04:52.610" style="s2">and it&#39;s big one day I don&#39;t think so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.410" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">think it&#39;s something that calls from</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.610" end="00:04:56.510" style="s2">with and it makes at least the good ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:58.009" style="s2">right where it doesn&#39;t matter if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.510" end="00:05:00.199" style="s2">have like ten fans</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.009" end="00:05:04.309" style="s2">million fans if it&#39;s Colleen from video</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.199" end="00:05:06.529" style="s2">and so yeah the best part the capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.309" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">is very ad hoc solutions and uber</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.529" end="00:05:11.029" style="s2">competitive and communism like uber</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:15.770" style="s2">cooperative like to the point of forcing</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.029" end="00:05:18.139" style="s2">people to cooperate and is central</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.770" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">planning and I think we suck at both of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.139" end="00:05:20.479" style="s2">those things and so we need the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:22.460" style="s2">world roads and this person also</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:24.649" style="s2">introduced me to someone called Mac</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.460" end="00:05:26.569" style="s2">Ridley who wrote a book who have not</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.649" end="00:05:29.210" style="s2">read yet because I&#39;m just introduced to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.569" end="00:05:31.699" style="s2">it today but I did look up one of his</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.210" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">speeches he went even had a talk at</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.699" end="00:05:35.960" style="s2">Google and him was listening to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:39.379" style="s2">did I say the name Matt Ridley it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.960" end="00:05:41.749" style="s2">a evolution of everything and how this</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.379" end="00:05:42.710" style="s2">concept of like what I&#39;m gonna call them</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.749" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">cuz he doesn&#39;t call that but like</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.710" end="00:05:45.620" style="s2">top-down approaches versus bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:48.169" style="s2">approaches and I&#39;m very much about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.620" end="00:05:50.589" style="s2">bottom-up approaches and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.169" end="00:05:54.430" style="s2">evolution which is my my background so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.589" end="00:05:54.430" style="s2">I&#39;m just getting into all of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.990" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">capitalism and communism how he talks</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.809" end="00:06:06.709" style="s2">about how innovation is very bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:07.909" style="s2">and we&#39;re like a bunch of people created</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.709" end="00:06:11.389" style="s2">lightbulb at the same time it was like</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.909" end="00:06:13.309" style="s2">ripe for the creation and evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.389" end="00:06:14.809" style="s2">calculus and the theory of relativity</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.309" end="00:06:18.199" style="s2">and all these things where even if the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.809" end="00:06:19.969" style="s2">person had died who was the founder of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.199" end="00:06:22.939" style="s2">it who we attribute to being the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.969" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">person who discovered it we&#39;d still have</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.939" end="00:06:28.789" style="s2">it we just wouldn&#39;t know like we&#39;d still</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:31.279" style="s2">know the DNA is a double helix even if</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.789" end="00:06:34.939" style="s2">let&#39;s say Walla secret that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.279" end="00:06:36.610" style="s2">I should know this I&#39;m a geneticist an</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.939" end="00:06:39.199" style="s2">ecologist and I just heard it too</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:41.539" style="s2">whatever that&#39;s not gonna come to me if</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.199" end="00:06:43.969" style="s2">it&#39;s not there now but the two people</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.539" end="00:06:45.949" style="s2">who discovered the double helix and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.969" end="00:06:47.509" style="s2">know there was another person the exact</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.949" end="00:06:49.659" style="s2">same time actually who also was</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.509" end="00:06:52.279" style="s2">discovering double helix</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.659" end="00:06:55.939" style="s2">how many wait there wouldn&#39;t there would</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.279" end="00:06:58.399" style="s2">still be the the innovation just on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.939" end="00:07:00.050" style="s2">way and how we kind of like remix stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.399" end="00:07:01.849" style="s2">and I&#39;m like yeah that&#39;s what I&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.050" end="00:07:03.349" style="s2">about that&#39;s kind of the system he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.849" end="00:07:04.580" style="s2">kind of talking about but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.349" end="00:07:06.079" style="s2">necessarily in the system we suck of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.580" end="00:07:08.120" style="s2">system and I think we can have both we</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.079" end="00:07:10.399" style="s2">can have like the internet is all</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.120" end="00:07:11.420" style="s2">information and that&#39;s awesome but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.399" end="00:07:13.820" style="s2">also over well</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.420" end="00:07:15.710" style="s2">chaotic and we can&#39;t trust it so how do</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.820" end="00:07:18.020" style="s2">we create the system where we can trust</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.710" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">it i think wikipedia is similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.020" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">like it&#39;s like okay at least we can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:26.690" style="s2">down how much we trust it and even</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:28.940" style="s2">better I think if Wikipedia if the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.690" end="00:07:31.790" style="s2">policies were crowd-sourced the same as</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.940" end="00:07:33.980" style="s2">articles were crowd-sourced then we</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.790" end="00:07:35.600" style="s2">could the people the crowd could come up</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.980" end="00:07:39.110" style="s2">with solutions to things like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.600" end="00:07:40.550" style="s2">corporation or a celebrity doing their</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.110" end="00:07:41.540" style="s2">own page right I don&#39;t know if the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.550" end="00:07:42.830" style="s2">solution to that is what about you</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.540" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">someone in the crowd knows what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:47.560" style="s2">solution to that is and when things are</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">done in a transparent democratic manner</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.560" end="00:07:54.170" style="s2">everyone can have access to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:55.640" style="s2">information and so yeah do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.170" end="00:07:58.430" style="s2">can have the best of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.640" end="00:08:00.440" style="s2">communism my worry is that like my what</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.430" end="00:08:03.320" style="s2">I do have the gift I have in this world</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.440" end="00:08:05.960" style="s2">to give part of it is based on my</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.320" end="00:08:07.670" style="s2">personality I&#39;m a Barry you spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.960" end="00:08:10.700" style="s2">of my life with this struggle between</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.670" end="00:08:13.520" style="s2">these two dichotomies right of masculine</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.700" end="00:08:14.990" style="s2">and feminine and I mean I&#39;m a middle</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.520" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">child don&#39;t think that&#39;s a dichotomy no</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.990" end="00:08:20.570" style="s2">it sounds like I&#39;m not the oldest no not</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:22.310" style="s2">the youngest and I&#39;m like the funny</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.570" end="00:08:23.780" style="s2">thing is the more I embrace my dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.310" end="00:08:25.340" style="s2">the more I do go if I don&#39;t go inside</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.780" end="00:08:27.260" style="s2">I&#39;m like I&#39;m like to you hip you for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.340" end="00:08:29.180" style="s2">cabin to capitalist for the hippies like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.260" end="00:08:30.770" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I&#39;m too careless for</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.180" end="00:08:33.290" style="s2">anyone now</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.770" end="00:08:35.330" style="s2">I very much I can see the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.290" end="00:08:37.250" style="s2">parts of capitalism I can I do</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.330" end="00:08:40.010" style="s2">understand economics for them I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.250" end="00:08:41.630" style="s2">the regular population you can just</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.010" end="00:08:43.040" style="s2">ignore it you can&#39;t ignore supply and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.630" end="00:08:45.140" style="s2">demand that&#39;s what happens in Venezuela</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.040" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">I can&#39;t why don&#39;t you say that word and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.140" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">I know I get that country that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:49.730" style="s2">to horrible times and I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:53.450" style="s2">making a joke because I can&#39;t say the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.730" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">freakin word and that is a central</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.450" end="00:08:56.090" style="s2">planning nightmare because you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.760" style="s2">someone at the top who thinks they have</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.090" end="00:09:01.460" style="s2">all of the solutions and the ego</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.760" end="00:09:02.390" style="s2">involved and like no no like people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.460" end="00:09:04.190" style="s2">sorry I know you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.390" end="00:09:06.590" style="s2">finally it&#39;s like oh don&#39;t people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.190" end="00:09:08.680" style="s2">starving we have failed and I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.590" end="00:09:11.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the the highest point of failure</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.680" end="00:09:12.980" style="s2">in society but then we also are like</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.150" end="00:09:16.900" style="s2">look at all these communist countries</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.980" end="00:09:19.430" style="s2">failing her socialist countries when</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.900" end="00:09:20.930" style="s2">capitalism is also failing in a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.430" end="00:09:24.200" style="s2">different way it&#39;s destroying our planet</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.930" end="00:09:25.550" style="s2">in our social structure and we&#39;re in it</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.200" end="00:09:28.220" style="s2">so we can&#39;t really see that it&#39;s Bailey</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.550" end="00:09:30.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s like we are Rome collapsing we</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.220" end="00:09:32.650" style="s2">can and our scientists are saying it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.050" end="00:09:35.150" style="s2">even our politicians understand that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.650" end="00:09:37.160" style="s2">they need to do something but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.150" end="00:09:39.410" style="s2">not really designed to change the system</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.160" end="00:09:40.760" style="s2">because they are only in for four years</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.410" end="00:09:42.650" style="s2">and some of these things are ten-year</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.760" end="00:09:45.650" style="s2">plans right like we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.650" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">have every day people agreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.650" end="00:09:49.700" style="s2">something because they helped create it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:52.010" style="s2">and even if they didn&#39;t help create it</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.700" end="00:09:53.180" style="s2">they were invited to like you coulda if</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.010" end="00:09:56.120" style="s2">you&#39;d heard about this six months ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.180" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">you could have come help come with our</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.120" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">climate change policy whatever it is but</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have that central</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:11.840" style="s2">centrally plan like I think my dad&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:14.150" style="s2">libertarian the happiness few laws as</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.840" end="00:10:15.740" style="s2">possible especially when we already have</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.150" end="00:10:19.430" style="s2">the greater law system right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.740" end="00:10:20.930" style="s2">the beauty of greater losses them having</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.430" end="00:10:24.020" style="s2">as few laws as possible where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.930" end="00:10:25.910" style="s2">like just very obvious like don&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.020" end="00:10:27.770" style="s2">people you know like maybe Ten</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.910" end="00:10:30.110" style="s2">Commandment type stuff but not the ten</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.770" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">commandments because those are not okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.110" end="00:10:36.410" style="s2">but they don&#39;t kill part of it die down</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:40.940" style="s2">with no rape and murder and violence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.410" end="00:10:43.370" style="s2">any kind and no something else to talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.940" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">about but I wanted to connect our God so</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.370" end="00:10:50.390" style="s2">10 minutes but am I to say hotel bed but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:52.070" style="s2">that that&#39;s what I was that my I&#39;m able</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.390" end="00:10:53.570" style="s2">to see the dichotomy like I&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.070" end="00:10:55.240" style="s2">see the beauty in both and bring them</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.570" end="00:10:58.510" style="s2">together and where there&#39;s a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.240" end="00:11:01.400" style="s2">have as little trade-off as possible um</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.510" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">that also to some degree means I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.400" end="00:11:05.330" style="s2">oh god I gotta convince the Communists</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:06.770" style="s2">that like capitalism is still a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.330" end="00:11:09.380" style="s2">bit okay and I&#39;ve to convince the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.770" end="00:11:11.330" style="s2">capitalist a little bit okay especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.380" end="00:11:14.330" style="s2">when there is these like uber words like</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.330" end="00:11:15.590" style="s2">is this calm you know which I&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.330" end="00:11:18.680" style="s2">a tone of voice you may have been like</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.590" end="00:11:25.790" style="s2">Louis is communism so I love the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.680" end="00:11:27.410" style="s2">communist that having that that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.790" end="00:11:28.700" style="s2">that I have to kind of convince both</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.410" end="00:11:30.470" style="s2">people it&#39;s I got to convince the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.700" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">hippies the capitalism or like business</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.619" end="00:11:45.079" style="s2">is that we&#39;re gonna start from a culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.389" end="00:11:46.970" style="s2">of cooperation so people like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.079" end="00:11:48.410" style="s2">understand I asked the question like</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.970" end="00:11:50.569" style="s2">innovation like how are people gonna</p>
