<p begin="00:00:14.519" end="00:00:19.140" style="s2">our world&#39;s problems so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.410" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">intro I&#39;m gonna walk you through on why</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">we need one why we need a solution at</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:26.939" style="s2">all what that solution is in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:29.310" style="s2">how we implement that solution what that</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.939" end="00:00:33.210" style="s2">looks like to co-create together who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.310" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">involved in the whole project where the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.210" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">project will be taking place which is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">bit of a throwaway question but I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">to answer all of them and it&#39;s when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">happening into the phases and what it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:47.309" style="s2">looks like now versus what its gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:49.170" style="s2">look like in the utopian future no if I</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.309" end="00:00:52.500" style="s2">did that the one phase it walks you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:54.989" style="s2">through some phases and then the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.500" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">why why would I just talked about is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.989" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">solution why it&#39;s better than what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">currently have why it solves so many of</p>

<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2">I will also wrap that up with a ending</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:27.820" style="s2">to look like we are going to build</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:30.910" style="s2">projects and so those projects look like</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.820" end="00:05:32.860" style="s2">taking back our knowledge of politicians</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.910" end="00:05:34.930" style="s2">and sharing what their voting record is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.860" end="00:05:37.180" style="s2">organize the information in a usable way</p>

<p begin="00:05:49.479" end="00:05:53.979" style="s2">just ensure your knowledge we can share</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.390" end="00:06:41.250" style="s2">counting on I&#39;m counting on that we make</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.540" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">sense to do so</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.240" end="00:06:55.650" style="s2">take over it&#39;ll eventually be what</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.790" end="00:06:58.170" style="s2">capitalism currently is and we will own</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.650" end="00:07:00.810" style="s2">everything together and our world will</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.170" end="00:07:03.750" style="s2">be much more sane and based on actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.810" end="00:07:05.850" style="s2">laws of physics and not based on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.750" end="00:07:08.010" style="s2">emotions of the person in power at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.850" end="00:07:10.710" style="s2">at that moment in time we get to share</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.010" end="00:07:13.860" style="s2">knowledge and share it in the ownership</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.710" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">and running of this operative that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.860" end="00:07:18.180" style="s2">what we are creating all of it platform</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:21.750" style="s2">all of the projects and the global</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.180" end="00:07:23.370" style="s2">cooperative itself and we&#39;re designing</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.750" end="00:07:27.419" style="s2">it so that everyone can give their own</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.370" end="00:07:30.360" style="s2">unique piece how do we create this</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.419" end="00:07:32.190" style="s2">together one of the big questions is how</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.360" end="00:07:34.010" style="s2">we fund it it&#39;s a pretty important</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.190" end="00:07:35.970" style="s2">question in our current society and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.010" end="00:07:38.030" style="s2">although there are different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.970" end="00:07:41.580" style="s2">fund it at different stages and phases</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.030" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">which is the same thing um there are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.580" end="00:07:46.830" style="s2">main idea is that there is a membership</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.919" end="00:07:48.180" style="s2">fee of $10 per month and that enables</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.830" end="00:07:50.100" style="s2">our members to be able to vote on things</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.180" end="00:07:53.729" style="s2">to discuss stuff to be as involved as</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.100" end="00:07:55.590" style="s2">they want to be and the beauty is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.729" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">the $10 is pooled together if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.590" end="00:08:00.570" style="s2">million members and that&#39;s ten million</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:04.700" style="s2">dollars a month that we get to vote on</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.570" end="00:08:07.350" style="s2">what to do with that money right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.700" end="00:08:10.190" style="s2">Netflix for social change you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.350" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">subscribing to be a part of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.190" end="00:08:15.540" style="s2">you&#39;re so membership dues of $10 per</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:17.460" style="s2">month which is low enough that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.540" end="00:08:19.590" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be a barrier to people but</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.460" end="00:08:21.300" style="s2">it&#39;s still that you have to want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.590" end="00:08:22.890" style="s2">part of this you have to want to create</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.300" end="00:08:25.470" style="s2">a better world together and to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.890" end="00:08:27.450" style="s2">and the $10 a month is enough the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.470" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">barrier that like we&#39;re probably not</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.450" end="00:08:30.840" style="s2">gonna get as many trolls as he wants to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">pay $10 a month to come in to annoy</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.840" end="00:08:37.710" style="s2">people some people probably will figure</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:40.620" style="s2">we have created the platform to be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.710" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">to have the conversation that was what</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.620" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">the what was what was in the last video</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">and with the platform were able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:52.140" style="s2">create project so what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:52.769" style="s2">is more of a contest so we create the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.140" end="00:08:54.420" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.769" end="00:08:56.699" style="s2">allows us to have the conversations on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.420" end="00:08:59.939" style="s2">massive scale so a million people having</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.699" end="00:09:01.709" style="s2">a conversation can be difficult as I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.939" end="00:09:04.259" style="s2">learned in the Occupy movement it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.709" end="00:09:05.670" style="s2">really it was beautiful I loved it there</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.259" end="00:09:07.649" style="s2">was so much about it that I loved but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.670" end="00:09:09.660" style="s2">didn&#39;t like was the inefficiency of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.649" end="00:09:11.459" style="s2">meetings and I don&#39;t even know how they</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.660" end="00:09:14.220" style="s2">would run them better in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.459" end="00:09:15.989" style="s2">state that it was they had to a day I</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.220" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">was like okay well how do we wrap how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.989" end="00:09:19.739" style="s2">we have anything in less than a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:21.209" style="s2">five-hour conversation when you want</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.739" end="00:09:22.799" style="s2">everyone&#39;s voice heard and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.209" end="00:09:25.499" style="s2">be able to vote on stuff and move things</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.799" end="00:09:27.179" style="s2">forward and there&#39;s trade-offs with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.499" end="00:09:30.420" style="s2">but with technology I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.179" end="00:09:32.999" style="s2">need to have this many trade-offs we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.420" end="00:09:34.529" style="s2">have win-win situations where people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.999" end="00:09:37.769" style="s2">able to be in smaller groups to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.529" end="00:09:40.410" style="s2">their voice heard and we&#39;re able to vote</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.769" end="00:09:42.540" style="s2">up the things they&#39;re most important so</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.410" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">the more people the more important an</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.540" end="00:09:46.920" style="s2">idea is an issue that someone&#39;s arising</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.540" end="00:09:47.730" style="s2">where people are like oh yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.920" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">that way too</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.730" end="00:09:54.929" style="s2">then those things are floated to the top</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:57.509" style="s2">they get to the top through throughout</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.929" end="00:09:58.949" style="s2">the rhythms and people don&#39;t and we walk</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.509" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">through a project management system with</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.949" end="00:10:02.850" style="s2">the timeline so you can&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:04.740" style="s2">eight-hour conversation on a name it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.850" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">like you generate ideas people vote on</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.740" end="00:10:08.309" style="s2">which ones are the best the top three</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:10.290" style="s2">come out and then everyone votes on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.309" end="00:10:11.999" style="s2">top three and the winner is the name</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.290" end="00:10:13.290" style="s2">then you move forward with the next</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.999" end="00:10:16.259" style="s2">thing right like there was there was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.290" end="00:10:17.670" style="s2">process to it where if you come in at</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.259" end="00:10:19.350" style="s2">this point you don&#39;t get to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.670" end="00:10:20.850" style="s2">read I hate to say oh not then don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.350" end="00:10:24.179" style="s2">part of it like everything that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.850" end="00:10:25.379" style="s2">doing before has been done and you might</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.179" end="00:10:26.429" style="s2">be able to get involved in the next</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.379" end="00:10:27.809" style="s2">iteration right there&#39;s enough people</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.429" end="00:10:29.670" style="s2">like I don&#39;t like the name I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.809" end="00:10:31.559" style="s2">the name it can you can trigger a new</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.670" end="00:10:33.389" style="s2">vote after the project&#39;s all done right</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.559" end="00:10:35.429" style="s2">ten years on a year on six months on</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.389" end="00:10:40.139" style="s2">whatever the timeline is to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.429" end="00:10:41.399" style="s2">relook at this project and we also this</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.139" end="00:10:42.569" style="s2">is part of the howl though I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.399" end="00:10:44.970" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know which other video</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.569" end="00:10:47.879" style="s2">to put it in that the culture of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.970" end="00:10:49.799" style="s2">creating together it has to be fun has</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.879" end="00:10:52.799" style="s2">to be its own reward that if people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.799" end="00:10:54.389" style="s2">paying to contribute pain to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.799" end="00:10:56.339" style="s2">this it needs to be a place where people</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.389" end="00:10:59.369" style="s2">belong and that doesn&#39;t mean everyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.339" end="00:11:01.529" style="s2">belongs everywhere because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.369" end="00:11:03.240" style="s2">those people it means that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.529" end="00:11:04.769" style="s2">have a place and find it and we create</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.240" end="00:11:06.390" style="s2">the algorithms that allow them to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.769" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">that where when</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.390" end="00:11:10.710" style="s2">you work really well with a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">person you&#39;re more likely to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.710" end="00:11:14.670" style="s2">matched up with them if you have a group</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:17.520" style="s2">you work amazing with you can pick that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.670" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">group every time and I&#39;m already be in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.520" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">it and where you were maybe like me and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">you maybe find it hard to find a group</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s an awkward ceiling in</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:27.390" style="s2">situation it can put you in one and as</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.500" end="00:11:28.830" style="s2">you give feedback and other people give</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.390" end="00:11:30.630" style="s2">you feedback on what works and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.830" end="00:11:32.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s able to better find a group</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.630" end="00:11:34.350" style="s2">for you that works and the groups</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.790" end="00:11:35.880" style="s2">working together everyone&#39;s voices get</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.350" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">her the best ideas get filtered and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.880" end="00:11:38.850" style="s2">unfiltered as the word I was leave for</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:40.680" style="s2">more than floating filtered up to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.850" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">top by people voting on though not</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.340" end="00:12:18.120" style="s2">don&#39;t throw it out because a piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.780" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work we figure out what will</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.120" end="00:12:21.060" style="s2">work if this doesn&#39;t work to create a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:24.570" style="s2">system it turns out the crowd is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.060" end="00:12:26.340" style="s2">horrible people to create a project with</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.570" end="00:12:28.980" style="s2">then we do it in smaller groups but</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.340" end="00:12:31.140" style="s2">transparently we have like Kodi groups</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.980" end="00:12:33.150" style="s2">deciding how to how to create this and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.140" end="00:12:34.740" style="s2">the best option gets funded and people</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.150" end="00:12:36.570" style="s2">vote on that there&#39;s so many there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.740" end="00:12:37.710" style="s2">million different iterations for this it</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.570" end="00:12:40.020" style="s2">isn&#39;t about what that one won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.710" end="00:12:41.430" style="s2">might not we&#39;re gonna figure it out the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.020" end="00:12:43.590" style="s2">whole point is we&#39;re putting the system</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.430" end="00:12:46.020" style="s2">in place to have the conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.590" end="00:12:47.510" style="s2">when troubles arise we can fix it way</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.020" end="00:12:50.010" style="s2">more easily than the current system does</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.510" end="00:12:51.420" style="s2">because the people who you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.010" end="00:12:53.280" style="s2">convince that it&#39;s a solution are</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.420" end="00:12:55.110" style="s2">involved into creating the solution and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.280" end="00:12:57.210" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to convince them there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.110" end="00:12:59.250" style="s2">so much beauty as to like why this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.210" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">solution that I will get into on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.250" end="00:13:03.090" style="s2">last video but that is the how we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.860" end="00:13:04.530" style="s2">created the platform to have the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.090" end="00:13:07.470" style="s2">conversations that enable us to work</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.530" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">through the projects and keep them going</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.470" end="00:13:09.900" style="s2">the different people who are way better</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:11.460" style="s2">at this stuff than I am are gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.900" end="00:13:14.520" style="s2">even better ideas that&#39;s the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.460" end="00:13:16.380" style="s2">we want people we want to enable people</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.520" end="00:13:17.430" style="s2">to be the best their best selves and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.380" end="00:13:18.870" style="s2">find their place</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.430" end="00:13:23.870" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna create the technology</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.870" end="00:13:23.870" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna do that who is invited and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.110" end="00:13:32.600" style="s2">everyone everyone is invited we need</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.180" end="00:13:35.670" style="s2">space for 7.5 billion people and growing</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.600" end="00:13:37.170" style="s2">if they want to come everyone is invited</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.670" end="00:13:40.200" style="s2">there needs to be space for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.170" end="00:13:42.870" style="s2">that being said we do not need 7.5</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.200" end="00:13:45.930" style="s2">billion people to make this work need a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.870" end="00:13:47.460" style="s2">fraction of that you consider 1 percent</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.930" end="00:13:51.510" style="s2">of the people on this planet currently</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.460" end="00:13:53.370" style="s2">own all the money and all the power we</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.510" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">can have 1 percent of people who truly</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.370" end="00:13:57.930" style="s2">unlocked their cooperative self that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.700" style="s2">they want to because when cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.930" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">people get together it benefits everyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.700" end="00:14:03.630" style="s2">the whole point is instead of one person</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:05.160" style="s2">pushing everyone else down to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.630" end="00:14:07.320" style="s2">top and this person like pulls this</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.160" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">person dance like ok one person is on</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.320" end="00:14:10.860" style="s2">the top that&#39;s one person is happy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:13.290" style="s2">everyone else who&#39;s not because they got</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.860" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">the gold they got this the highest point</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.290" end="00:14:17.750" style="s2">and even the second place is the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:20.940" style="s2">loser first is a cooperative system</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.750" end="00:14:23.070" style="s2">where you&#39;re helping each other out to</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.940" end="00:14:25.320" style="s2">see everyone can get to the top right</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.070" end="00:14:26.459" style="s2">and so which means you&#39;re pulling them</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.320" end="00:14:28.920" style="s2">up you&#39;re helping them up you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.459" end="00:14:31.140" style="s2">inviting them up and in a world that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.920" end="00:14:33.390" style="s2">even a tiny fraction of people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.140" end="00:14:35.070" style="s2">this it&#39;s helping everyone and this one</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.390" end="00:14:36.839" style="s2">looks more inspiring to most people than</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.070" end="00:14:38.820" style="s2">this one so this one is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.839" end="00:14:40.380" style="s2">understandably we fight against it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.820" end="00:14:41.580" style="s2">we don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s some people</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.380" end="00:14:43.140" style="s2">who really want to be at the top and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.580" end="00:14:45.750" style="s2">people strive to be there most of us</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.140" end="00:14:46.890" style="s2">don&#39;t feel this is a fair system so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.750" end="00:14:48.120" style="s2">create a cooperative one and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.890" end="00:14:50.610" style="s2">co-operative one is going to out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.120" end="00:14:52.470" style="s2">the competitive one I believe it at my</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.610" end="00:14:53.940" style="s2">core and I have so much evidence to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.470" end="00:14:57.570" style="s2">which I&#39;ll get into a bit of it in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.940" end="00:14:59.130" style="s2">why but the who is simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.570" end="00:15:01.830" style="s2">everyone&#39;s invited and yet we need a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.130" end="00:15:04.080" style="s2">tiny fraction of that for every position</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.830" end="00:15:06.300" style="s2">for every everyone&#39;s a puzzle piece with</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.080" end="00:15:08.310" style="s2">their own unique contribution there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.300" end="00:15:11.490" style="s2">you were not in competition with anyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.310" end="00:15:13.560" style="s2">cuz nobody is you and yet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.490" end="00:15:16.260" style="s2">nothing that you have no characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.560" end="00:15:18.870" style="s2">whether physical mental spiritual that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.260" end="00:15:21.200" style="s2">sets you apart from everyone right every</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.870" end="00:15:23.850" style="s2">no matter what the characteristic is</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.200" end="00:15:25.290" style="s2">somebody else has it right but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.850" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">unique combination of characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.290" end="00:15:29.130" style="s2">that makes you unique and so for every</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:31.000" style="s2">piece that we need a puzzle piece to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.130" end="00:15:33.670" style="s2">fill there&#39;s multiple puzzle pieces</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.000" end="00:15:35.980" style="s2">fill that but for every puzzle piece you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.670" end="00:15:37.810" style="s2">can find a spot so it&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.980" end="00:15:39.790" style="s2">hip it&#39;s we&#39;re unlocking true human</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.810" end="00:15:42.520" style="s2">potential so we&#39;re finding spaces for</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.790" end="00:15:44.500" style="s2">everyone we&#39;re with the power of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.520" end="00:15:45.640" style="s2">technology we&#39;re helping people find</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.500" end="00:15:47.530" style="s2">their space it&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.640" end="00:15:49.870" style="s2">comes easily to everyone it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.530" end="00:15:53.080" style="s2">life&#39;s missions and we don&#39;t write like</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.870" end="00:15:55.420" style="s2">why am I here Who am I where do I fit</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.080" end="00:15:56.920" style="s2">who loves me how do I feel seeing you</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.420" end="00:15:58.660" style="s2">know how do i we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.920" end="00:16:00.310" style="s2">maybe not fix that because it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.660" end="00:16:02.770" style="s2">lot of internal work but we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.310" end="00:16:05.800" style="s2">make that so much easier for people that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.770" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">all of the hurdles and blocks that stop</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.800" end="00:16:10.300" style="s2">us individually are going to be moved</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.470" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">aside by people who can see how to move</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.300" end="00:16:13.930" style="s2">that aside right what&#39;s hard for you is</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:16.810" style="s2">easy for me and vice versa so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.930" end="00:16:18.400" style="s2">gonna make it easy for everyone and in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.810" end="00:16:20.290" style="s2">doing so we&#39;re gonna untapped human</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.400" end="00:16:22.510" style="s2">potential which is gonna make it so much</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.290" end="00:16:24.190" style="s2">easier to solve every complex problem on</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.510" end="00:16:26.020" style="s2">this planet because there&#39;s someone who</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.190" end="00:16:27.250" style="s2">has the solution they just don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.020" end="00:16:29.170" style="s2">the voice they just don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.250" end="00:16:30.400" style="s2">personality to get it out there we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.170" end="00:16:33.370" style="s2">creating the system where they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.400" end="00:16:35.470" style="s2">need to have that so I think I got into</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.370" end="00:16:37.690" style="s2">a bunch of other answers to other</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.470" end="00:16:40.690" style="s2">questions but that in a nutshell is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.690" end="00:16:41.860" style="s2">who&#39;s invited everyone and how I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.690" end="00:16:43.540" style="s2">how we create the system to work</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.860" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">together as we create it to work</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.540" end="00:16:49.990" style="s2">together where it&#39;s a little bit weird</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:52.630" style="s2">for this project and projects but the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.990" end="00:16:54.550" style="s2">idea is I mean since eventually ideally</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.630" end="00:16:56.200" style="s2">we&#39;re owning everything the where is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.550" end="00:16:58.780" style="s2">everywhere but in the beginning its</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.200" end="00:17:02.080" style="s2">online because online is a lot easier to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.780" end="00:17:03.940" style="s2">have an added person without it having a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.080" end="00:17:05.110" style="s2">lot of added cost right if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.940" end="00:17:07.900" style="s2">comes on and they don&#39;t have money to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.110" end="00:17:09.939" style="s2">pay $10 a month and we still want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.900" end="00:17:11.560" style="s2">have scholarships for them so that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.939" end="00:17:14.199" style="s2">can still come on board and offer their</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.560" end="00:17:15.880" style="s2">their opinions and offer then we can do</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.199" end="00:17:17.319" style="s2">that because it&#39;s not costing us $10 a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.880" end="00:17:19.630" style="s2">month to add someone right that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.319" end="00:17:22.089" style="s2">threshold sorry the finance to add a new</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.630" end="00:17:23.650" style="s2">person is very low online online also is</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.089" end="00:17:26.910" style="s2">where the technology and tools are that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.650" end="00:17:30.100" style="s2">help us balance the unusual trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.910" end="00:17:33.670" style="s2">so online is the main answer but also</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.100" end="00:17:35.310" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea of probably if I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.670" end="00:17:37.900" style="s2">get into it you know why the last why</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.310" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">that part of the beauty of creating this</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.900" end="00:17:42.300" style="s2">way is it thresholds have to be met</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:44.470" style="s2">before you&#39;re taking a risk so and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.300" end="00:17:46.630" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a more</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.470" end="00:17:47.799" style="s2">a rule later on in the beginning is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.630" end="00:17:49.450" style="s2">beginning we can create with hundred</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.740" end="00:17:54.789" style="s2">if everyone put in divided the cost by a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.230" end="00:17:56.620" style="s2">hundred it would be astronomical</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.789" end="00:17:58.299" style="s2">but the idea is you&#39;re crowdfunding and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.620" end="00:17:59.860" style="s2">creating something that more people</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.299" end="00:18:01.270" style="s2">would use there&#39;s 100 it&#39;s designed for</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.789" end="00:18:11.770" style="s2">co-create a food app until we have a</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.799" end="00:18:28.059" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a concrete number right</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.990" end="00:18:29.470" style="s2">like once 10,000 people sign up you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.059" end="00:18:31.990" style="s2">walking through the system that helps</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.470" end="00:18:33.490" style="s2">your 10,000 people eat better and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.990" end="00:18:36.460" style="s2">there&#39;s thresholds to be made for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.490" end="00:18:38.860" style="s2">local if you&#39;re starting a makerspace or</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.460" end="00:18:40.299" style="s2">a cooperative lab if you just want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.860" end="00:18:42.190" style="s2">fund it with a thousand people and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.299" end="00:18:44.440" style="s2">everyone puts in $1,000 you cost a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.190" end="00:18:46.539" style="s2">million dollars cool you have it you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.440" end="00:18:48.309" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have our threshold made</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.539" end="00:18:51.159" style="s2">but if you&#39;re looking for community</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.309" end="00:18:52.510" style="s2">funds to pay for it we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.159" end="00:18:54.700" style="s2">those things in place where you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.510" end="00:18:55.960" style="s2">get 10,000 people signed up or you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.700" end="00:18:58.600" style="s2">to get a million people signed up but</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.960" end="00:18:59.710" style="s2">whatever happens to be or a percentage</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.600" end="00:19:01.809" style="s2">of your population because if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.710" end="00:19:02.950" style="s2">tiny town of a thousand people it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.809" end="00:19:04.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense for you to need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.950" end="00:19:07.140" style="s2">get 10,000 people right but but we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.750" end="00:19:10.299" style="s2">the metrics and the where is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.140" end="00:19:13.419" style="s2">simultaneous um nowhere and everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.299" end="00:19:14.860" style="s2">right like in the individual people one</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.419" end="00:19:17.740" style="s2">global food system isn&#39;t going to work</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.860" end="00:19:19.990" style="s2">having global food having systems that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.740" end="00:19:21.490" style="s2">are local and then having them connected</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.990" end="00:19:22.780" style="s2">in a way where when someone doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.490" end="00:19:24.840" style="s2">enough food or you want to trade that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.780" end="00:19:26.710" style="s2">those systems are in place so</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.840" end="00:19:29.950" style="s2">simultaneously the where is you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.710" end="00:19:32.530" style="s2">we&#39;re online and everywhere all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.950" end="00:19:35.740" style="s2">when we do these things what is the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.530" end="00:19:38.740" style="s2">line and I see this unfolding in phases</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.740" end="00:19:40.900" style="s2">right now this phase is me trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.740" end="00:19:43.210" style="s2">communicate this idea and grow</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.900" end="00:19:45.400" style="s2">membership to a point where I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.210" end="00:19:47.559" style="s2">trust having a democracy and so to me I</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.400" end="00:19:49.090" style="s2">feel like 100 members is a good starting</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.559" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">point for like we can name it we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.090" end="00:19:52.419" style="s2">decide on our vision and values we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:56.200" style="s2">pick a first project figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.419" end="00:19:57.610" style="s2">crowd fund it and even if we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.200" end="00:19:58.029" style="s2">together and we probably will have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.610" end="00:20:01.599" style="s2">get together</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.029" end="00:20:03.279" style="s2">person to create it we&#39;re doing it with</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.599" end="00:20:04.539" style="s2">the understanding that it makes the next</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.279" end="00:20:06.369" style="s2">project easier in the next project</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.539" end="00:20:07.989" style="s2">easier and then once we get a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.369" end="00:20:10.059" style="s2">projects under our belt and we know how</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.989" end="00:20:12.940" style="s2">to do it we create the platform the beta</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.059" end="00:20:15.340" style="s2">that allows us to have the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.940" end="00:20:17.169" style="s2">online and then we improve that system</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.340" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">with a few projects once we have that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.169" end="00:20:22.899" style="s2">platform in place we&#39;re and our</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:24.940" style="s2">membership has grown enough that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.899" end="00:20:27.820" style="s2">enough money to fund multiple projects</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.940" end="00:20:30.669" style="s2">so we&#39;re funding one at a time with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.820" end="00:20:31.809" style="s2">pool of money and then it&#39;s like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.669" end="00:20:33.489" style="s2">but the money is growing faster than</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.809" end="00:20:35.409" style="s2">we&#39;re spending it by like threefold</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.489" end="00:20:37.419" style="s2">right then oh look we could maybe a fund</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.409" end="00:20:41.349" style="s2">a second project also in our membership</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.419" end="00:20:43.210" style="s2">grows it&#39;s gonna unlock more like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.349" end="00:20:46.779" style="s2">have a million people working on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.210" end="00:20:48.969" style="s2">project and a tiny fraction of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.779" end="00:20:50.619" style="s2">wanted be super involved in their space</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.969" end="00:20:54.460" style="s2">for them great but as you unlock more</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.619" end="00:20:56.139" style="s2">people people want to want to be as</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.460" end="00:21:00.070" style="s2">involved as they want to be right as you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.139" end="00:21:01.749" style="s2">have more people than work for them you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.070" end="00:21:03.789" style="s2">can unlock simultaneous projects right</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.749" end="00:21:06.580" style="s2">if you are breaking this down into into</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.789" end="00:21:08.529" style="s2">piecemeal and there&#39;s way more pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.580" end="00:21:10.629" style="s2">work to do than people we need to grow</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.529" end="00:21:12.489" style="s2">people and as there&#39;s way more people</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.629" end="00:21:14.919" style="s2">than pieces to do we want to unlock more</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.489" end="00:21:17.019" style="s2">projects so there&#39;s an organic growth to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.919" end="00:21:19.809" style="s2">it that bit fell as long as when we get</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.019" end="00:21:22.599" style="s2">to the phase where we have the platform</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.809" end="00:21:25.899" style="s2">at least the beta in place and we&#39;ve run</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.599" end="00:21:28.269" style="s2">and we&#39;ve unlocked simultaneous projects</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.899" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">so we have more than one going at a time</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.269" end="00:21:32.169" style="s2">once we even get to two projects</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:34.059" style="s2">especially three projects that&#39;s when we</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.169" end="00:21:36.519" style="s2">go from the funding model of 10 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.059" end="00:21:37.419" style="s2">per project to 10 dollars per month</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.519" end="00:21:40.029" style="s2">because then when you&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.419" end="00:21:41.739" style="s2">multiple projects you have all of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.029" end="00:21:43.899" style="s2">pool of money and you can have more</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.739" end="00:21:45.729" style="s2">niche based projects that people want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.899" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">work on because you can find one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.729" end="00:21:49.859" style="s2">three and eventually we unlock unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:51.759" style="s2">projects where anyone can start one</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.859" end="00:21:53.499" style="s2">people vote on whether it gets funded</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.759" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">but anyone can start one expression of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.499" end="00:21:57.789" style="s2">yourself one unit and so that&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.960" end="00:21:59.529" style="s2">the the phases and timeline a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.789" end="00:22:00.789" style="s2">hard to explain in video or easy to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.529" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">explain I got a piece of paper with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.789" end="00:22:08.109" style="s2">pen and paper concentric circles but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:09.470" style="s2">timeline on the phases and where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.109" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.470" end="00:22:14.670" style="s2">right now the last Y which is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:17.340" style="s2">to wrap it all up but I could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.670" end="00:22:18.780" style="s2">this again for several hours so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.340" end="00:22:19.860" style="s2">see how much I can get in in like a 10</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.780" end="00:22:23.220" style="s2">minute son</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.860" end="00:22:24.870" style="s2">I believe that when we co-create</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.220" end="00:22:26.790" style="s2">together on a system based on</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.870" end="00:22:28.740" style="s2">cooperation instead of competition it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.790" end="00:22:32.310" style="s2">solves so much of the issues that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.740" end="00:22:33.810" style="s2">capitalism has caused and I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.310" end="00:22:37.110" style="s2">know how to convey all of that but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.810" end="00:22:38.610" style="s2">want to start with a parable of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.110" end="00:22:39.630" style="s2">which I realize is supposed to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.610" end="00:22:44.310" style="s2">Bible but I can&#39;t make up the word</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.630" end="00:22:48.270" style="s2">that&#39;s anyway it&#39;s not a Bible story but</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.310" end="00:22:49.320" style="s2">if you have two groups of people for</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.270" end="00:22:53.610" style="s2">some reason I&#39;ve decided they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.320" end="00:22:55.410" style="s2">10,000 people they both get $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.610" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">reward for getting to the top but they</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.410" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">have different motivating factors so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:01.860" style="s2">first group is just whoever gets to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:03.960" style="s2">top first gets the million dollars so</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.860" end="00:23:06.630" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be so much incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.960" end="00:23:08.310" style="s2">cheat to get to push other people down</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.630" end="00:23:10.200" style="s2">or to work together in small groups and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.310" end="00:23:12.270" style="s2">then split it but you&#39;re still not</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.200" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">concerned that you want it out compete</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.270" end="00:23:15.150" style="s2">everyone else you want to be the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:17.400" style="s2">for the first tiny group to get up to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.150" end="00:23:19.140" style="s2">the top of the mountain and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.400" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be your solo focus just</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.140" end="00:23:24.390" style="s2">like get to the top it is efficient way</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:27.990" style="s2">as possible everybody else right</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.390" end="00:23:30.450" style="s2">the others team of 10,000 people same</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.990" end="00:23:33.090" style="s2">million-dollar prize but their goal is</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.090" end="00:23:39.000" style="s2">top of the mountain that group is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.900" end="00:23:42.810" style="s2">is 10,000 they each get $100 that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.000" end="00:23:44.490" style="s2">really incentive enough to like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.810" end="00:23:46.170" style="s2">almost too much of an incentive yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.490" end="00:23:49.950" style="s2">bless when I did it was ten thousand ten</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.170" end="00:23:52.410" style="s2">thousand sperm gets a dollar but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.950" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">going to be trying to find a way to help</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.410" end="00:23:56.970" style="s2">the slowest and weakest amongst them get</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:23:58.620" style="s2">to the top because they all have to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.970" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">to the top to get that get that million</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.620" end="00:24:03.630" style="s2">dollar prize and in order for that to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:07.560" style="s2">happen they&#39;re going to be more</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.630" end="00:24:09.150" style="s2">cooperative they&#39;re going to since it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.560" end="00:24:10.470" style="s2">not as much of an incentive right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.150" end="00:24:12.210" style="s2">not necessarily going to push people</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.470" end="00:24:13.590" style="s2">down for $100 you&#39;re not gonna like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.210" end="00:24:14.940" style="s2">can&#39;t find you&#39;re out of yours because</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.590" end="00:24:16.650" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to have to carry you to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.940" end="00:24:19.320" style="s2">the top it might happen hundred all is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.650" end="00:24:20.670" style="s2">still an incentive but it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.320" end="00:24:22.860" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be enjoying the journey</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.670" end="00:24:24.779" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.860" end="00:24:26.309" style="s2">looking around see you nature enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.779" end="00:24:28.620" style="s2">the people you&#39;re with figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.309" end="00:24:31.110" style="s2">together how to best best get yourselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.620" end="00:24:33.510" style="s2">to the top of the mountain so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.110" end="00:24:34.679" style="s2">better on all fronts and of course if I</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.510" end="00:24:37.500" style="s2">felt the opposite way I&#39;m sure I could</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.679" end="00:24:39.029" style="s2">think of a of a metaphor the other way</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.500" end="00:24:42.840" style="s2">around right that shows competition but</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.029" end="00:24:45.149" style="s2">the point is competition isn&#39;t bad in</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.840" end="00:24:46.769" style="s2">and of itself but the incentive means</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.149" end="00:24:48.029" style="s2">we&#39;re pushing other people down and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.769" end="00:24:49.559" style="s2">we&#39;re just trying to stop other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.029" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">from getting to where we are and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.559" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">definitely surpassing us whereas</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:56.429" style="s2">innovation on this side we all get to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:58.529" style="s2">benefit from it when someone has an idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.429" end="00:25:00.600" style="s2">that will work we can be like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.529" end="00:25:02.669" style="s2">and implement it and push it forward and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.600" end="00:25:05.010" style="s2">that is pretty much a nutshell what the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.669" end="00:25:07.529" style="s2">why of why we want to be cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.010" end="00:25:09.179" style="s2">instead of competitive and the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.529" end="00:25:10.590" style="s2">we&#39;re still competing in a competitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.179" end="00:25:14.340" style="s2">system we&#39;re still in the greater</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.590" end="00:25:16.200" style="s2">capitalist global system and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.340" end="00:25:19.470" style="s2">out-compete them we weren&#39;t kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.200" end="00:25:21.269" style="s2">meant to be like when something goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.470" end="00:25:23.429" style="s2">wrong we have all of us to troubleshoot</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.269" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">oh shoot it all of us to implement it if</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.429" end="00:25:28.380" style="s2">we can&#39;t out-compete the competitors and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:29.190" style="s2">within that system we weren&#39;t supposed</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.380" end="00:25:32.399" style="s2">to be here</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.190" end="00:25:34.260" style="s2">we&#39;re losing we&#39;re lost but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.399" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">think that&#39;s the case I think compa</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.260" end="00:25:38.490" style="s2">cooperation oates competes competition</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:40.220" style="s2">hands down because here you have one</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.490" end="00:25:44.250" style="s2">person even if it&#39;s the gold medal</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.220" end="00:25:46.529" style="s2">mountain climber yeah they&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.250" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">to the top first before this group but</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.529" end="00:25:50.100" style="s2">the mountain climbers have you having to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:52.440" style="s2">get everyone to the top having the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.100" end="00:25:53.940" style="s2">rule these people are gonna get there</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.440" end="00:25:56.279" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have more fun along the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.940" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">way everyone&#39;s gonna get to win and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.279" end="00:26:05.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not one winner 9 9999 losers the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:08.730" style="s2">other big piece of the why I&#39;m creating</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.159" end="00:26:11.519" style="s2">this is or we are creating it I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.730" end="00:26:14.490" style="s2">catalyst is that the solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.519" end="00:26:16.110" style="s2">offered right now I see is like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.490" end="00:26:18.510" style="s2">falling into two camps both of which</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.110" end="00:26:20.820" style="s2">aren&#39;t great one of which is that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.510" end="00:26:24.419" style="s2">devolve into chaos and then like from</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.820" end="00:26:26.970" style="s2">revolution or we like from the ashes we</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.419" end="00:26:28.860" style="s2">will rise and I don&#39;t want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.970" end="00:26:30.840" style="s2">ashes I don&#39;t want my world to burn down</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.860" end="00:26:35.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t want the chaos and violence that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.840" end="00:26:36.570" style="s2">comes from revolution in that way I want</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.460" end="00:26:37.769" style="s2">peace I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.570" end="00:26:39.539" style="s2">it&#39;s live in peace I want every person</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.769" end="00:26:42.029" style="s2">on this planet to live in peace so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.539" end="00:26:44.850" style="s2">would like to not have chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.029" end="00:26:47.309" style="s2">Armageddon just personally the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.850" end="00:26:49.049" style="s2">issue is people take the system as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.309" end="00:26:51.299" style="s2">whole and try to tinker with it so try</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.049" end="00:26:52.919" style="s2">to fix like this just this tiny part but</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.299" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">since it&#39;s all interconnected like you</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.919" end="00:26:57.210" style="s2">can&#39;t really solve war without solving</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.679" end="00:26:58.860" style="s2">poverty you can&#39;t solve climate change</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.210" end="00:27:02.940" style="s2">without solving poverty like it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.860" end="00:27:04.380" style="s2">interconnected and the tinkerine just</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.940" end="00:27:06.419" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work we need to recreate the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.380" end="00:27:08.970" style="s2">system the system is so inefficient and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.419" end="00:27:10.289" style="s2">unfair that like transferring a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.970" end="00:27:11.850" style="s2">bit of wealth to the porridge doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.289" end="00:27:13.740" style="s2">work we need to like revamp the entire</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.850" end="00:27:15.990" style="s2">systems what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.740" end="00:27:18.269" style="s2">building the scaffolding under the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.990" end="00:27:20.129" style="s2">current system which is working in a way</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.269" end="00:27:22.169" style="s2">right there&#39;s food in the supermarket&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.129" end="00:27:24.450" style="s2">the roads mostly don&#39;t have potholes</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.169" end="00:27:25.889" style="s2">like it&#39;s like we&#39;re getting places</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.450" end="00:27:27.899" style="s2">things are happening and innovation is</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.889" end="00:27:29.490" style="s2">happening we don&#39;t bring that down to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.899" end="00:27:33.990" style="s2">zero because that&#39;s chaos people starve</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.490" end="00:27:35.309" style="s2">people die and a big piece so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.990" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">that&#39;s a big piece of the whys if this</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.309" end="00:27:39.960" style="s2">is an actual systemic solution that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.669" style="s2">designed to win it&#39;s designed for</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.960" end="00:27:43.769" style="s2">competition for cooperation to</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.669" end="00:27:45.389" style="s2">out-compete competition because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.769" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">designed to have the conversation design</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.389" end="00:27:48.809" style="s2">that anyone who sees a problem if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:50.580" style="s2">big enough problem we agree on it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.809" end="00:27:52.019" style="s2">implement a solution or can just point</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.580" end="00:27:54.750" style="s2">it out and other people can invent a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.019" end="00:27:56.879" style="s2">solution that we empower the individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.750" end="00:27:59.100" style="s2">and that&#39;s a big piece of the why that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.879" end="00:28:01.529" style="s2">we are empowering the individual we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.100" end="00:28:03.179" style="s2">giving like 99.9 percent of the people</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.179" end="00:28:09.570" style="s2">or 99.9 percent of their best life</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.360" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">possible and that&#39;s huge cuz that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.570" end="00:28:13.259" style="s2">unlocks human potential we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:15.389" style="s2">stressed by the day-to-day living of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.259" end="00:28:17.669" style="s2">life we get to unlock who we truly are</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.669" end="00:28:21.419" style="s2">gonna be different for everybody it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.769" end="00:28:22.830" style="s2">not about being carbon copies of each</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.419" end="00:28:26.009" style="s2">other that&#39;s why we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.830" end="00:28:28.200" style="s2">competition naturally we&#39;re in it we can</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:29.790" style="s2">healthy so if proper nutrition is going</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.660" end="00:29:32.580" style="s2">to help society be healthy there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.790" end="00:29:35.220" style="s2">incentive it not because that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.580" end="00:29:36.180" style="s2">hurt profit and not maximum it ends yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.220" end="00:29:37.830" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna hurt profit so who cares</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.180" end="00:29:39.810" style="s2">about the purpose whereas we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.830" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">flip that we&#39;re going to innovate for</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.810" end="00:29:43.560" style="s2">profit for purpose we&#39;re gonna say okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:45.930" style="s2">there&#39;s 10,000 was having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.560" end="00:29:47.850" style="s2">about how we how we eat what stops us</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.930" end="00:29:51.240" style="s2">from eating well how do we create a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.850" end="00:29:53.880" style="s2">better system of food then we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.240" end="00:29:56.220" style="s2">decisions for purpose now we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.880" end="00:29:58.380" style="s2">ignore profit we still need to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.220" end="00:30:00.690" style="s2">world especially right now with finance</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.380" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">and access to resources and access to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.690" end="00:30:05.820" style="s2">people who have the best innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:09.630" style="s2">the most talent and that comes at a cost</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.820" end="00:30:11.630" style="s2">currently so we need to be financially</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.630" end="00:30:14.130" style="s2">stable it&#39;s it&#39;s financially sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.630" end="00:30:15.420" style="s2">so we have to take finance into account</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.130" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2">but when it comes to what are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.420" end="00:30:18.810" style="s2">make another dollar or are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.950" end="00:30:21.660" style="s2">make another whatever the equivalent is</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.810" end="00:30:25.560" style="s2">the dollar value in purpose we pick</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.660" end="00:30:27.660" style="s2">purpose so that is is a huge thing so</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.560" end="00:30:30.030" style="s2">when we design it together I believe</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.660" end="00:30:31.050" style="s2">that we design much more efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.030" end="00:30:33.060" style="s2">we&#39;re much more efficient with our</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.050" end="00:30:35.580" style="s2">resources because we have the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.060" end="00:30:37.620" style="s2">to make things cheaper and truly cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.580" end="00:30:41.340" style="s2">to just make it with less resources and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.620" end="00:30:43.620" style="s2">make it with with less human involvement</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.340" end="00:30:45.150" style="s2">right to automate but we all get to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.620" end="00:30:47.310" style="s2">the benefit of that not just a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.150" end="00:30:49.470" style="s2">fraction at the top who gets to to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.310" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">all of all of that profit there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.470" end="00:30:52.380" style="s2">risk involved in creating together</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:55.920" style="s2">because there&#39;s more eyes to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.380" end="00:30:57.540" style="s2">problems more more brains to like think</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.920" end="00:30:59.040" style="s2">about solutions and more hands to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.540" end="00:31:01.470" style="s2">implement it like we&#39;re just we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.040" end="00:31:01.970" style="s2">better together and so I do believe in</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.470" end="00:31:03.680" style="s2">this newer</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.970" end="00:31:06.170" style="s2">system we will have more innovation but</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.680" end="00:31:10.820" style="s2">even if the competition is it like 100</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.170" end="00:31:13.190" style="s2">and this is 85 75 % it still up competes</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.820" end="00:31:15.620" style="s2">this because like this is one person or</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.190" end="00:31:18.620" style="s2">one tiny group of people and assuming</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.620" end="00:31:21.610" style="s2">this purple in this group or like 75% of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.620" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">smart 75% is efficient and innovative</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.610" end="00:31:29.060" style="s2">there&#39;s more of them working together so</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:31.130" style="s2">it like it exponentially grows and where</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.060" end="00:31:33.170" style="s2">I&#39;m not right on that I&#39;m wrong we will</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.130" end="00:31:34.610" style="s2">find the issues we will troubleshoot</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.170" end="00:31:37.100" style="s2">them together because we designed the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.610" end="00:31:39.230" style="s2">system to do it together and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.100" end="00:31:41.870" style="s2">the big buy and I did it in under 10</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.230" end="00:31:43.460" style="s2">minutes that&#39;s my wife sandwich so we&#39;ll</p>
