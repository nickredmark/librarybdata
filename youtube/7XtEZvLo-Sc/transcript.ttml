<p begin="00:04:12.540" end="00:04:19.020" style="s2">interested in that more particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.960" end="00:04:21.530" style="s2">question because when the Cold War was</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.020" end="00:04:24.060" style="s2">raging there were two ideological</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.060" end="00:04:27.030" style="s2">speaking there were of course more but</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.470" end="00:04:29.870" style="s2">we can simplify it for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.030" end="00:04:32.820" style="s2">argument down to two and one was</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.870" end="00:04:34.950" style="s2">predicated on the communitarian</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.820" end="00:04:38.590" style="s2">principles that were put forward by Marx</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.950" end="00:04:40.060" style="s2">and the other was a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.590" end="00:04:42.280" style="s2">the well I would say Western</p>

<p begin="00:04:44.830" end="00:04:47.860" style="s2">you might ask yourself well were those</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.180" end="00:04:50.680" style="s2">only it was that only a difference of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.860" end="00:04:52.630" style="s2">opinion right because that&#39;s the central</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.680" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">question it was just a difference of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:56.470" style="s2">opinion if what&#39;s underneath it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:05:00.730" style="s2">arbitrary then a it doesn&#39;t matter which</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.730" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">no right and wrong in the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.160" end="00:05:06.340" style="s2">right it&#39;s and that that would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:09.010" style="s2">something that would be more akin to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.340" end="00:05:10.570" style="s2">postmodern claim it&#39;s just Group a puts</p>

<p begin="00:05:10.570" end="00:05:14.620" style="s2">B puts form their claims to power and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.310" end="00:05:16.990" style="s2">they&#39;re both equally valid and well have</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.620" end="00:05:21.100" style="s2">adder fundamentally because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.990" end="00:05:23.590" style="s2">way of solving the problem but it struck</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.100" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">me that that I didn&#39;t think that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.590" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">should leap to that conclusion so</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:31.990" style="s2">rapidly and so I started to investigate</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:35.110" style="s2">I think I started to investigate the sub</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.990" end="00:05:37.000" style="s2">structure of Western thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.110" end="00:05:39.100" style="s2">not so much communist thought because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.000" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">thought of communism as an interloper on</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.100" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">the scene it was a system that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:48.220" style="s2">devised and formalized until the late</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:49.630" style="s2">1900s late 1800s and I didn&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.220" end="00:05:51.700" style="s2">part of what you might describe as</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.630" end="00:05:53.979" style="s2">organic development there&#39;s no mythology</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.700" end="00:05:55.720" style="s2">so to speak at the basis of of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.979" end="00:05:57.310" style="s2">communist perspective and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.720" end="00:05:59.289" style="s2">things that&#39;s very interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.310" end="00:06:01.210" style="s2">although those ideas were roundly</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.289" end="00:06:03.460" style="s2">defeated by the end of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.210" end="00:06:05.979" style="s2">they&#39;re making a comeback so rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.460" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s almost unbelievable you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.979" end="00:06:09.460" style="s2">got an email from a medical student</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:11.650" style="s2">yesterday at the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.460" end="00:06:13.240" style="s2">and now they&#39;re the course is that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.650" end="00:06:16.120" style="s2">have to take the mandatory these are</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.240" end="00:06:18.460" style="s2">social justice courses include modules</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.120" end="00:06:20.470" style="s2">on equity and equity is equality of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.460" end="00:06:23.080" style="s2">outcome it they&#39;re pushing people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.470" end="00:06:25.479" style="s2">having the equality of outcome notion</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.080" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">pushed on them in mandatory training in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.479" end="00:06:29.229" style="s2">universities everywhere again an equity</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.430" end="00:06:31.479" style="s2">isn&#39;t equality of opportunity its</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.229" end="00:06:33.610" style="s2">equality of outcome you know that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.479" end="00:06:35.410" style="s2">the central dictum of the communist</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.610" end="00:06:37.900" style="s2">states in the 20th century it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.410" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">what the hell how how did we get back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.900" end="00:06:43.660" style="s2">that again already so and the idea being</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:46.090" style="s2">is if there isn&#39;t absolute equality of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.660" end="00:06:47.530" style="s2">outcome within an organization that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.090" end="00:06:49.720" style="s2">thing is corrupt and needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.530" end="00:06:51.400" style="s2">restructured from the bottom up and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.720" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">the question of course is who decides</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.400" end="00:06:54.220" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:56.500" style="s2">outcomes are equal by what means and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.220" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">with what groups because you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.500" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">produce an infinite number of groups of</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.789" end="00:07:12.370" style="s2">technically possible unless everyone has</p>

<p begin="00:07:12.370" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">so anyways these are obviously very</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:20.380" style="s2">powerful ideas and the mere fact that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:21.759" style="s2">they killed a hundred million people</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.380" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">already or more in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.759" end="00:07:28.710" style="s2">wasn&#39;t enough to put them to rest</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:30.970" style="s2">anyways so back to the main theme is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.710" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">there something this is the main</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.970" end="00:07:36.460" style="s2">question is there something is there a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.550" end="00:07:39.729" style="s2">set of ideas that Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.460" end="00:07:43.259" style="s2">is predicated on that are more than just</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.729" end="00:07:47.500" style="s2">bloody opinion that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.259" end="00:07:49.060" style="s2">because if there isn&#39;t well then what do</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.500" end="00:07:51.490" style="s2">you what do you do about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.060" end="00:07:53.380" style="s2">arbitrary you&#39;re just holding it for no</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.490" end="00:07:55.389" style="s2">reason whatsoever it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.380" end="00:07:57.370" style="s2">different system there&#39;s no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.389" end="00:07:59.800" style="s2">stick with it all of those things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.370" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">it takes the it takes the core out of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.800" end="00:08:04.509" style="s2">when that was Nietzsche&#39;s claim right he</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:06.330" style="s2">said you take the core metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.509" end="00:08:09.550" style="s2">presupposition out from underneath</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.330" end="00:08:11.229" style="s2">western civilization or any civilization</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.550" end="00:08:12.969" style="s2">for that matter and the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.229" end="00:08:16.900" style="s2">loosens shake ins</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.969" end="00:08:19.620" style="s2">shakes and crumbles well for Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.900" end="00:08:22.030" style="s2">the metaphysical presupposition was God</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.620" end="00:08:25.539" style="s2">well and then the question of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.030" end="00:08:28.599" style="s2">well what even does that mean and in on</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.539" end="00:08:31.150" style="s2">one hand it means I suppose adherence to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.599" end="00:08:32.260" style="s2">a dogmatic set of beliefs but then you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.150" end="00:08:34.779" style="s2">might ask yourself well is there</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.260" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">something else that it means it means at</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.779" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">least the hypothesis of some</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:46.329" style="s2">transcendent value it means at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:48.670" style="s2">that so you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.329" end="00:08:50.500" style="s2">Nietzsche announced the death of God and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.670" end="00:08:52.329" style="s2">so one of the consequences of that note</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.500" end="00:08:54.279" style="s2">Dostoevsky was working on exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.329" end="00:08:56.470" style="s2">same set of ideas and in crime and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.279" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">punishment in particular which is a book</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.470" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">like it&#39;s a necessary book that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:01.930" style="s2">thing is there&#39;s a number of books that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:03.339" style="s2">were written in the last hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.930" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">twenty years that you really have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.339" end="00:09:06.010" style="s2">read and crime and punishment is one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:07.780" style="s2">them and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.010" end="00:09:09.490" style="s2">I think the Gulag Archipelago is another</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.780" end="00:09:11.710" style="s2">and probably beyond good and evil is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.490" end="00:09:13.210" style="s2">another but you know Dostoyevsky and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.710" end="00:09:16.360" style="s2">Nietzsche were writing in parallel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.210" end="00:09:18.040" style="s2">remarkable how much their their lives</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.360" end="00:09:21.490" style="s2">intertwined and Nietzsche knew more</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.040" end="00:09:22.660" style="s2">about Dostoyevsky then then is generally</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.490" end="00:09:25.000" style="s2">known there&#39;s been some recent</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.660" end="00:09:26.850" style="s2">scholarship indicating that but in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.000" end="00:09:31.110" style="s2">Dostoyevsky&#39;s book crime and punishment</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.850" end="00:09:33.010" style="s2">he has a his main character Raskolnikov</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.110" end="00:09:34.750" style="s2">decides that he&#39;s going to commit a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.010" end="00:09:35.980" style="s2">murder and he has very good</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.750" end="00:09:38.200" style="s2">justification for the murder and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.980" end="00:09:40.230" style="s2">Dostoyevsky is very good at this he he</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.200" end="00:09:43.480" style="s2">puts his characters into very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.230" end="00:09:45.730" style="s2">difficult moral situations and gives</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.480" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">them full justification for pursuing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.730" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.019" end="00:10:03.089" style="s2">pursuing the pathway that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.639" end="00:10:04.769" style="s2">pursuing and so Raskolnikov he&#39;s broke</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.089" end="00:10:06.629" style="s2">and starving he wants to go to law</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.769" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">school his sister&#39;s about to prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.629" end="00:10:10.079" style="s2">herself ruff roughly speaking by</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:12.119" style="s2">marrying a guy that that hates her that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.079" end="00:10:13.589" style="s2">she hates and that and he has contempt</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.119" end="00:10:15.629" style="s2">for her at least acts in that manner</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.589" end="00:10:18.629" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to rescue his mother as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.629" end="00:10:21.720" style="s2">who&#39;s also in dire financial straits he</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.629" end="00:10:23.670" style="s2">he goes to a pawn broker to pawn his</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.720" end="00:10:27.540" style="s2">meagre position so that he can continue</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.670" end="00:10:29.759" style="s2">to scrape by and she has this nice I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.540" end="00:10:31.799" style="s2">believe it&#39;s her niece that&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.759" end="00:10:34.769" style="s2">bright who she basically treats as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.799" end="00:10:37.259" style="s2">slave and is horrible too and and so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.769" end="00:10:40.110" style="s2">character the pawnbroker has this money</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.259" end="00:10:43.290" style="s2">Raskolnikov is in dire need he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.110" end="00:10:46.619" style="s2">look I&#39;ll just kill her because why the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.290" end="00:10:48.360" style="s2">hell not I&#39;ll take her money she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.619" end="00:10:50.100" style="s2">doing any good with it anyways I&#39;ll free</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.360" end="00:10:52.589" style="s2">your niece who&#39;s just lurking as a slave</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.100" end="00:10:55.079" style="s2">she&#39;s got all these other people tangled</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.589" end="00:10:56.369" style="s2">up in her pawnbroker schemes all that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.079" end="00:10:59.069" style="s2">happen is the world will be a better</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.369" end="00:11:01.949" style="s2">place and the only thing that&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.069" end="00:11:04.649" style="s2">me back is conventional moral cowardice</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.949" end="00:11:06.449" style="s2">and you know Dostoyevsky has his</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.649" end="00:11:09.809" style="s2">character in Crime and Punishment go</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.449" end="00:11:13.829" style="s2">through days hours hours and days and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.809" end="00:11:16.439" style="s2">weeks of intense imagination about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.829" end="00:11:18.929" style="s2">rationalization about this trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.439" end="00:11:21.779" style="s2">justify himself placing a male outside</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.929" end="00:11:23.939" style="s2">placing himself outside the law so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.779" end="00:11:26.399" style="s2">he can perpetrate this act and telling</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.939" end="00:11:28.049" style="s2">himself with all the best nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.399" end="00:11:30.059" style="s2">arguments that the only possible thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.049" end="00:11:32.639" style="s2">that could be holding him back is an an</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.059" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">arbitrary sense of indoctrinated</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.639" end="00:11:36.569" style="s2">morality and so Dostoyevsky explores</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:38.339" style="s2">that he does commit the murder and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.569" end="00:11:39.899" style="s2">of course all hell breaks loose because</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.339" end="00:11:41.279" style="s2">things don&#39;t necessarily turn out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.899" end="00:11:43.079" style="s2">way that you want he gets away with it</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:44.669" style="s2">however well he gets away with it</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.079" end="00:11:46.619" style="s2">technically because no one knows he did</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.669" end="00:11:48.559" style="s2">it but he doesn&#39;t get away with it in</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.619" end="00:11:51.119" style="s2">relationship to his own conscience and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.559" end="00:11:53.669" style="s2">so that the rest of the book explores</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.119" end="00:11:54.929" style="s2">that well Dostoyevsky I believe it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.669" end="00:11:56.879" style="s2">in crime and punishment although he</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.929" end="00:11:59.309" style="s2">makes the same point in many of his</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.879" end="00:12:01.679" style="s2">books he makes a very fundamental point</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.309" end="00:12:03.299" style="s2">and this is the kind of point that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.679" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">I think that people who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.299" end="00:12:08.579" style="s2">investigated these matters down this</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.829" style="s2">particularly little particular literary</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.579" end="00:12:11.610" style="s2">and philosophical pathway never grapple</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.829" end="00:12:14.130" style="s2">with dusty</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.610" end="00:12:16.470" style="s2">Sookie said straightforwardly if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.130" end="00:12:17.730" style="s2">no God so if there&#39;s no higher value</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.470" end="00:12:20.130" style="s2">let&#39;s say if there&#39;s no transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.730" end="00:12:22.740" style="s2">value then you can do whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.130" end="00:12:24.870" style="s2">and that&#39;s the question that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.740" end="00:12:27.089" style="s2">investigating and you see this is why I</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.870" end="00:12:28.860" style="s2">have such frustration say with people</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.089" end="00:12:31.290" style="s2">like Sam Harris this sort of radical</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.860" end="00:12:33.959" style="s2">atheists because they seem to think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.290" end="00:12:36.420" style="s2">once human beings abandoned their their</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.959" end="00:12:39.149" style="s2">grounding in the transcendent that the</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">attributes to other people equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.279" end="00:12:47.940" style="s2">value it&#39;s like I just don&#39;t understand</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.490" end="00:15:14.970" style="s2">then you can read Nietzsche because</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.840" end="00:15:17.100" style="s2">that&#39;s what he was trying to sort out</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.970" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t only Nietzsche he came to</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:22.640" style="s2">come to that conclusion but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.550" end="00:15:24.870" style="s2">two who&#39;ve outlined it most</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.640" end="00:15:28.220" style="s2">spectacularly were Nietzsche and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.870" end="00:15:30.510" style="s2">Dostoevsky and each is an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.220" end="00:15:31.860" style="s2">influential philosopher you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.510" end="00:15:37.080" style="s2">think there was any one that was more</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.860" end="00:15:39.780" style="s2">influential during the entire course of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.080" end="00:15:42.420" style="s2">the 20th century accepting a very very</p>

<p begin="00:15:43.740" end="00:15:47.250" style="s2">their with their discussion you could</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.240" end="00:15:50.130" style="s2">put Marx in that category you could put</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.250" end="00:15:51.930" style="s2">Freud in that category partly but after</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.130" end="00:15:54.390" style="s2">that the list starts to get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.930" end="00:15:57.300" style="s2">thinner you know so maybe there&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.390" end="00:16:00.080" style="s2">people up in that level and Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.300" end="00:16:03.060" style="s2">of course I think I mean if if you ever</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.080" end="00:16:05.430" style="s2">if anybody ever prepares a list of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.060" end="00:16:07.380" style="s2">top ten greatest literary figures in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.430" end="00:16:10.110" style="s2">world he would be in the top ten list</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.380" end="00:16:11.910" style="s2">you know I think he&#39;s perhaps second to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.110" end="00:16:14.640" style="s2">Shakespeare and maybe above Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.910" end="00:16:16.470" style="s2">in my estimation so these aren&#39;t trivial</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.640" end="00:16:21.510" style="s2">people we&#39;re talking about and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.470" end="00:16:23.730" style="s2">weren&#39;t dealing with trivial issues well</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.510" end="00:16:26.460" style="s2">so then the question might be what&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.730" end="00:16:29.880" style="s2">the bottom of the idea of a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.460" end="00:16:33.840" style="s2">value and I want to wanted to approach</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.880" end="00:16:37.140" style="s2">that staying out of the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.840" end="00:16:38.700" style="s2">domain as much as possible because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.140" end="00:16:39.080" style="s2">can claim anything you want from a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.700" end="00:16:40.490" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.080" end="00:16:42.680" style="s2">physical perspective and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.490" end="00:16:44.870" style="s2">problem and so people will say well why</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.680" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">come up with a hypothesis of God for</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.870" end="00:16:49.460" style="s2">example God could be anything there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:52.030" style="s2">satire the Flying Spaghetti Monster</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.460" end="00:16:53.990" style="s2">right is a classic satirical</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.030" end="00:16:55.790" style="s2">representation of a deity that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.990" end="00:16:58.010" style="s2">Atheist types used to buttress their</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.790" end="00:17:00.010" style="s2">arguments and fair enough you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.010" end="00:17:02.090" style="s2">satirical idea it&#39;s pretty damn funny</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.010" end="00:17:04.010" style="s2">but there&#39;s things about this that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.090" end="00:17:06.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t the least bit of music and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.010" end="00:17:09.339" style="s2">thing that&#39;s not amusing is well what if</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.560" end="00:17:12.290" style="s2">anything is our culture predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.339" end="00:17:14.300" style="s2">okay so what happened well Nietzsche and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.290" end="00:17:17.720" style="s2">Dostoevsky put this forth this set of</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.300" end="00:17:19.820" style="s2">propositions and out of Dostoyevsky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.720" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">line of thinking to some degree grew</p>

<p begin="00:17:33.230" end="00:17:36.890" style="s2">happened in the 20th century on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.940" end="00:17:38.690" style="s2">radical left end of the spectrum is not</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.850" end="00:17:50.930" style="s2">knows it&#39;s mystery to everyone when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.580" style="s2">talk about what happened in the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.930" end="00:17:54.290" style="s2">Union and that&#39;s absolutely appalling</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.580" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s to say nothing about what</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.290" end="00:18:03.350" style="s2">happened in China which was equally</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:05.240" style="s2">horrible the system didn&#39;t work it was</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.240" end="00:18:09.590" style="s2">you think that that sort of thing means</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.590" end="00:18:13.610" style="s2">define that as well but it collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:15.260" style="s2">under its own weight after it killed</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.610" end="00:18:16.700" style="s2">tens of millions of people that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.040" end="00:18:23.390" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good definition of worked</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.580" style="s2">now whatever we&#39;re doing in the West</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.390" end="00:18:27.590" style="s2">seems to work for all of its flaws and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.580" end="00:18:29.570" style="s2">the question is are we just deceiving</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.590" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">ourselves is it just arbitrary power</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:40.370" style="s2">something at the bottom of it so when</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.080" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn wrote The Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.370" end="00:18:44.060" style="s2">he believed that the Russians would have</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:46.190" style="s2">to return to Orthodox Christianity to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.060" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">find their pathway forward and that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.190" end="00:18:49.460" style="s2">course has made him into a reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:51.530" style="s2">in the eyes of many of his critics but</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.460" end="00:18:52.940" style="s2">that is perhaps what is happening in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.530" end="00:18:54.980" style="s2">Russia although it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.940" end="00:18:57.140" style="s2">tell because Putin also seems to be</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.140" end="00:19:00.470" style="s2">Christian Church as a means to</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.180" end="00:19:03.080" style="s2">consolidate power</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.470" end="00:19:05.090" style="s2">so the situation in Russia is unclear</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.080" end="00:19:06.860" style="s2">but a religious revival if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.090" end="00:19:08.540" style="s2">happening in Russia and perhaps it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.860" end="00:19:10.040" style="s2">but if it is happening is something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.540" end="00:19:12.290" style="s2">unfolds over decades and even centuries</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.040" end="00:19:16.610" style="s2">so it&#39;s not an easy thing to evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.290" end="00:19:18.350" style="s2">when it first starts to happen but</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.610" end="00:19:20.330" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn drew the same conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.350" end="00:19:22.550" style="s2">that Dostoevsky did fundamentally I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.330" end="00:19:24.680" style="s2">not not in exactly the same way but very</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.350" end="00:19:31.130" style="s2">adhere to some sort of transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.240" end="00:19:33.710" style="s2">value that they had no protection</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:41.060" style="s2">impulses that came along with them and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.900" end="00:19:43.370" style="s2">found his work in unbelievably I found</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.060" end="00:19:45.260" style="s2">his right incredible powerful incredible</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.370" end="00:19:47.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how you can read that book</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.260" end="00:19:49.340" style="s2">and not draw that kind of conclusion I</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.450" end="00:19:50.600" style="s2">think people who criticize soul</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.340" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">Janette&#39;s and have never read the damn</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.600" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">book because that book is like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">going into the ring with Muhammad Ali</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:58.130" style="s2">and being pummeled to death for half an</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:20:05.330" style="s2">hour you know you don&#39;t recover from it</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.130" end="00:20:08.270" style="s2">that easily so then Jung branched off of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.330" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">Nietzsche and so Nietzsche&#39;s idea was</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.270" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">that people would have to create their</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.440" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">own values roughly speaking and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">that&#39;s where Nietzsche&#39;s is.we is his</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:19.010" style="s2">weakest because it isn&#39;t obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:21.530" style="s2">that people can create their own values</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.010" end="00:20:23.630" style="s2">and I think he fell into and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.530" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">want to be a casual critic of Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.630" end="00:20:28.010" style="s2">because that&#39;s always dangerous given</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:29.150" style="s2">that he probably had an IQ of 260 you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:30.890" style="s2">know I mean he was way the hell out</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.150" end="00:20:32.060" style="s2">there in the stratosphere and just when</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.890" end="00:20:33.590" style="s2">you think you&#39;ve understood what he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.060" end="00:20:35.930" style="s2">talking about you can be bloody well</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.590" end="00:20:37.250" style="s2">sure that you didn&#39;t but it does seem to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.930" end="00:20:38.810" style="s2">me and he was running out of time he</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.250" end="00:20:40.580" style="s2">died young you know and he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.810" end="00:20:43.580" style="s2">solve this problem in a rush I would say</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.580" end="00:20:46.790" style="s2">and he hypothesized that people would</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.580" end="00:20:48.920" style="s2">have to become Superman over men roughly</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.790" end="00:20:50.870" style="s2">speaking in order to deal with the death</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.920" end="00:20:53.150" style="s2">of God and that idea sort of branched</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.870" end="00:20:54.860" style="s2">off into Nazi propaganda because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.150" end="00:20:57.170" style="s2">in some sense what the Nazis were trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.860" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">to do with their promotion of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.170" end="00:21:01.580" style="s2">perfect Aryan you know now it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:04.040" style="s2">mystery it&#39;s a missile of media in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.580" end="00:21:06.659" style="s2">estimation and it was partly because his</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.040" end="00:21:10.979" style="s2">sister who is a perverse creature</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.659" end="00:21:13.549" style="s2">um what would you say doctored his work</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.979" end="00:21:16.139" style="s2">in such a way so that it was more easily</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.549" end="00:21:17.970" style="s2">appropriated by the Nazis but there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.139" end="00:21:20.039" style="s2">some danger in what he said too because</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.970" end="00:21:22.379" style="s2">the question is well if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.039" end="00:21:24.599" style="s2">transform yourself into the into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.379" end="00:21:26.759" style="s2">giver of values what stops you from</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.599" end="00:21:29.639" style="s2">inflating yourself into something like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.759" end="00:21:32.009" style="s2">demigod and just pronouncing what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.639" end="00:21:33.799" style="s2">values are going to be so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.009" end="00:21:37.259" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.799" end="00:21:40.309" style="s2">you know you&#39;re gonna replace tradition</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.259" end="00:21:44.039" style="s2">with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.309" end="00:21:46.109" style="s2">well there&#39;s dangers in that because</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.039" end="00:21:47.879" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to keep you humble</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.109" end="00:21:49.470" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the most appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.879" end="00:21:51.509" style="s2">objection there&#39;s nothing to keep you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.470" end="00:21:53.849" style="s2">humble and those things can spiral out</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.509" end="00:21:55.649" style="s2">of control very rapidly and they did say</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.849" end="00:21:57.239" style="s2">in the case of Hitler I mean it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.649" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">to blame what happened in Germany on</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.239" end="00:22:01.109" style="s2">Hitler but that&#39;s a that&#39;s a big mistake</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:03.149" style="s2">because it was a dialogue between Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.109" end="00:22:04.379" style="s2">and the German people right Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.149" end="00:22:07.289" style="s2">didn&#39;t create himself</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.379" end="00:22:09.539" style="s2">it was co-creation he said things people</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.289" end="00:22:11.340" style="s2">listened and told him back what to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.539" end="00:22:13.109" style="s2">and then he said them and they listened</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.340" end="00:22:15.899" style="s2">and they told him back what to say and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.109" end="00:22:17.609" style="s2">it looped until he was the mouthpiece of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.899" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">their darkest desires</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.609" end="00:22:21.779" style="s2">now that&#39;s a that&#39;s a game he was</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:23.519" style="s2">willing to play but you can&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.779" end="00:22:26.729" style="s2">about that as it isn&#39;t like Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.519" end="00:22:29.700" style="s2">created Nazi Germany Hitler and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.729" end="00:22:33.119" style="s2">Germans co-created Nazi Germany you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.700" end="00:22:35.309" style="s2">when a leader gives articulation to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.119" end="00:22:38.340" style="s2">imagination of the population that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.309" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">what a leader does and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.340" end="00:22:42.330" style="s2">could say that while Hitler maybe Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:43.950" style="s2">filtered what the Germans were telling</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.330" end="00:22:45.779" style="s2">him through a particular lens because he</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.950" end="00:22:49.729" style="s2">had no shortage of resentment and desire</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.779" end="00:22:52.139" style="s2">for revenge in his own heart you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.729" end="00:22:54.509" style="s2">it&#39;s not like his life was a spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.139" end="00:22:56.369" style="s2">success before he became a political</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.509" end="00:22:58.470" style="s2">activist and he was brutalized very</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.369" end="00:23:00.690" style="s2">badly in World War one and he didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.470" end="00:23:03.479" style="s2">to pursue his primary dream which was to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.690" end="00:23:05.369" style="s2">be an art student in Vienna and he had</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.479" end="00:23:07.080" style="s2">applied three times and got rejected all</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.369" end="00:23:09.149" style="s2">three times and so he was bitter about</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.080" end="00:23:11.340" style="s2">that he was basically living on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.149" end="00:23:13.049" style="s2">streets after World War one it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.340" end="00:23:15.059" style="s2">the world&#39;s happiest person and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.049" end="00:23:17.070" style="s2">he carried a fair bit of resentment in</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.059" end="00:23:19.710" style="s2">his heart when he was in the trenches in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.070" end="00:23:21.480" style="s2">World War one in</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.710" end="00:23:23.370" style="s2">experience that he had all of his</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.480" end="00:23:25.529" style="s2">friends were killed by a mortar when he</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:28.110" style="s2">had wandered off to go do something else</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.529" end="00:23:29.730" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s hard to even imagine</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.110" end="00:23:31.500" style="s2">what something like that would do to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.730" end="00:23:33.690" style="s2">but I can tell you when you&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.500" end="00:23:36.029" style="s2">survivor out of 20 people that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.690" end="00:23:37.799" style="s2">going to give you an enhanced sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.029" end="00:23:39.390" style="s2">your own specialness because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.799" end="00:23:41.429" style="s2">alternative is just to think about how</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.390" end="00:23:48.539" style="s2">goddamn arbitrary the universe really is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.429" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">so so Jung studied Nietzsche in in great</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.539" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">detail and he was particularly</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:55.140" style="s2">interested because Jung had his finger</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:56.760" style="s2">on the central problems all the time</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.140" end="00:23:58.470" style="s2">right because he was a great</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.760" end="00:24:00.809" style="s2">psychologist and he was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.470" end="00:24:03.929" style="s2">what people said and he was a staggering</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.809" end="00:24:05.850" style="s2">genius as well and so like Nietzsche or</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.929" end="00:24:08.659" style="s2">Dostoevsky or Solzhenitsyn he was that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.850" end="00:24:12.270" style="s2">kind of prophetic type I would say and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.659" end="00:24:14.730" style="s2">he understood as well perhaps what was</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.270" end="00:24:16.470" style="s2">wrong with Nietzsche&#39;s formulation the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.730" end="00:24:18.450" style="s2">idea that people could only create their</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.470" end="00:24:21.630" style="s2">new their own values and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.450" end="00:24:23.220" style="s2">would replace the lacking fountain the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.630" end="00:24:26.159" style="s2">foundation that was now lacking under</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.220" end="00:24:28.260" style="s2">Western civilization itself and he came</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:31.940" style="s2">to his conclusion I would say through</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.260" end="00:24:37.320" style="s2">Freud because Freud started analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.940" end="00:24:39.240" style="s2">parts of the human cognitive process and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.320" end="00:24:41.370" style="s2">content that people hadn&#39;t attended to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.240" end="00:24:43.710" style="s2">before in any in any great detail and</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.370" end="00:24:45.990" style="s2">that was primarily dreams you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.710" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">idea of dream analysis I suppose is one</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.990" end="00:24:51.179" style="s2">of Freud&#39;s perhaps Freud&#39;s major</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:53.190" style="s2">contribution to modern Western thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.179" end="00:24:56.340" style="s2">the idea was there was something to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.190" end="00:24:58.620" style="s2">dreams and I suppose what but for I did</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.340" end="00:25:00.210" style="s2">has said hey look isn&#39;t it strange we</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.620" end="00:25:04.200" style="s2">have this whole other form of thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.210" end="00:25:06.059" style="s2">that we engage in at night it and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.200" end="00:25:09.000" style="s2">speaks in language that we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.059" end="00:25:11.549" style="s2">understand and so what the hell is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.000" end="00:25:13.529" style="s2">and you can say and many modern people</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.549" end="00:25:15.450" style="s2">do dreams are of no significance or even</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.529" end="00:25:17.399" style="s2">that they&#39;re random processes which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.450" end="00:25:19.140" style="s2">an absurd proposition obviously because</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.399" end="00:25:23.010" style="s2">they&#39;re by ferrell whatever they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.140" end="00:25:24.779" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously not random so so</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.010" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">Freud&#39;s idea was that there was some</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.779" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">something in dreams that was informative</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:32.549" style="s2">so that&#39;s as now he had a method for</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:33.560" style="s2">described for extracting out from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.549" end="00:25:37.220" style="s2">dream</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.560" end="00:25:39.740" style="s2">what the dream purported to represent</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.220" end="00:25:41.660" style="s2">and he outlined that in great detail in</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.740" end="00:25:43.820" style="s2">the interpretation of dreams and if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.660" end="00:25:45.230" style="s2">want to read one book by Freud I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.820" end="00:25:46.970" style="s2">highly recommend that when it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.230" end="00:25:48.650" style="s2">long book and it&#39;s very detailed but</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.970" end="00:25:50.600" style="s2">Freud does an extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.650" end="00:25:53.150" style="s2">comprehensive analysis of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.600" end="00:25:55.310" style="s2">dreams work now he made the because</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.150" end="00:25:57.710" style="s2">because he had brought a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.310" end="00:26:00.170" style="s2">framework to bear even on his</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.710" end="00:26:02.330" style="s2">investigation into dream structure he</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.170" end="00:26:05.090" style="s2">concluded that dreams were essentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.330" end="00:26:08.090" style="s2">wish fulfillment and that&#39;s where Jung</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.090" end="00:26:10.850" style="s2">and Freud disagreed he also believed</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.090" end="00:26:13.070" style="s2">that the primary motivating factor of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.850" end="00:26:15.860" style="s2">human beings was sexual and now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.070" end="00:26:18.200" style="s2">tougher one to toss aside because even</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.860" end="00:26:20.630" style="s2">if you&#39;re a Darwinian rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.200" end="00:26:23.300" style="s2">Freudian you&#39;re going to obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.630" end="00:26:25.430" style="s2">support the proposition that sexual</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.300" end="00:26:27.110" style="s2">motivation among any living creature is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.430" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">going to be one of the highest order</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.110" end="00:26:32.540" style="s2">motivations because otherwise creatures</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:34.790" style="s2">don&#39;t repre</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.540" end="00:26:36.830" style="s2">so the question is is that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.790" end="00:26:38.870" style="s2">ultimate source of motivation and in</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.830" end="00:26:41.510" style="s2">some sense the answer to that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.870" end="00:26:43.640" style="s2">yes well Freud wanted to make that in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.510" end="00:26:45.560" style="s2">some ways the sole source of motivation</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.640" end="00:26:47.210" style="s2">and I&#39;m oversimplifying and I hate to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.560" end="00:26:50.330" style="s2">that in relationship to Freud because he</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.210" end="00:26:52.580" style="s2">was not a simple-minded character Young</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.330" end="00:26:56.350" style="s2">had a dream once if I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.580" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">that Freud and you were excavating a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.350" end="00:27:00.830" style="s2">basement and so Freud had outlined in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">the Freud had already discovered the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.830" end="00:27:04.220" style="s2">basement let&#39;s say so that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:07.040" style="s2">unconscious structure of the psyche and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.220" end="00:27:09.440" style="s2">Jung broke through into another basement</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.040" end="00:27:13.130" style="s2">that was a multi-chambered place so many</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.440" end="00:27:15.140" style="s2">many many rooms and I suppose what drove</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.130" end="00:27:16.670" style="s2">Jung and Freud apart was Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.140" end="00:27:19.100" style="s2">proposition that there was a hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.670" end="00:27:21.020" style="s2">lot more going down going on down there</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.100" end="00:27:23.780" style="s2">than had already met the eye and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.020" end="00:27:25.790" style="s2">broke on the idea that the sexual</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.780" end="00:27:27.830" style="s2">impulse was primary roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.790" end="00:27:29.450" style="s2">they broke when Jung wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.830" end="00:27:31.700" style="s2">symbols of transformation which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.450" end="00:27:33.140" style="s2">actually there&#39;s there&#39;s three books</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.700" end="00:27:34.970" style="s2">that I know of that are sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.140" end="00:27:37.130" style="s2">maps of meaning one is symbols of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.970" end="00:27:38.870" style="s2">transformation one is a book by Eric</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.130" end="00:27:43.070" style="s2">Newman called the origins and history of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.870" end="00:27:44.330" style="s2">consciousness and the third and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.070" end="00:27:46.490" style="s2">third one while his maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.330" end="00:27:47.299" style="s2">they&#39;re the same book they&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.490" end="00:27:48.769" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to saw</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.299" end="00:27:50.659" style="s2">the same problem from three different</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.769" end="00:27:53.509" style="s2">directions they&#39;re all attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.659" end="00:27:55.190" style="s2">address the same problem and so symbols</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.509" end="00:27:56.629" style="s2">of transformation was a book that Jung</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.190" end="00:28:00.379" style="s2">wrote about the fantasies of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.629" end="00:28:02.869" style="s2">schizophrenic American woman and he was</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.379" end="00:28:05.239" style="s2">he was trying to relate her fantasies to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.869" end="00:28:07.519" style="s2">these old mythological ideas and Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.239" end="00:28:09.230" style="s2">idea essentially and this is an idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.519" end="00:28:11.330" style="s2">that was shared by people like Piaget so</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.230" end="00:28:12.889" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to say that you and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.330" end="00:28:17.480" style="s2">Laura Freud just pulled this idea out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.889" end="00:28:20.570" style="s2">the air was that the the birthplace of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.480" end="00:28:24.139" style="s2">myth mythology and literature for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.570" end="00:28:28.039" style="s2">matter was the dream that that that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.139" end="00:28:32.169" style="s2">share structural that they share they</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.039" end="00:28:35.749" style="s2">they share what mode of information</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.169" end="00:28:44.239" style="s2">presentation and it&#39;s a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.749" end="00:28:51.049" style="s2">radical hypothesis but but given that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.239" end="00:28:53.480" style="s2">they both they both represent dreams</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.049" end="00:28:55.609" style="s2">dreams and mythological representations</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.480" end="00:28:58.129" style="s2">share an essentially narrative structure</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.609" end="00:28:59.749" style="s2">and they use their literary like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.129" end="00:29:02.179" style="s2">know I mean it&#39;s not so unreasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.749" end="00:29:03.830" style="s2">notice that a dream at night is like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.179" end="00:29:06.230" style="s2">movie that you play in your head and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.830" end="00:29:07.759" style="s2">it&#39;s not unreasonable to note as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.230" end="00:29:09.980" style="s2">that the dreams that you have at night</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.759" end="00:29:12.049" style="s2">bear a relationship to the daydreams</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.980" end="00:29:13.369" style="s2">that you have during the day it&#39;s a form</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.049" end="00:29:15.409" style="s2">of cognition it seems like an</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.369" end="00:29:17.299" style="s2">involuntary form of cognition no and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.409" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a very strange thing so Jung</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.299" end="00:29:21.230" style="s2">thought about the dream as nature</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:24.109" style="s2">speaking of its own accord roughly</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.230" end="00:29:25.940" style="s2">speaking and so his idea was well when</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.109" end="00:29:28.190" style="s2">you when you sleep you dream but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:29.929" style="s2">dream happens to you it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.190" end="00:29:31.369" style="s2">that you create the way that and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.929" end="00:29:32.809" style="s2">don&#39;t even think about creating it</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.369" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">because I might say well what are you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.809" end="00:29:36.590" style="s2">thinking about and you&#39;ll say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:38.539" style="s2">thinking about whatever it is and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.590" end="00:29:40.039" style="s2">take credit in some sense for thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.539" end="00:29:42.289" style="s2">that because it seems like a voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.039" end="00:29:43.489" style="s2">activity but what happens at night is</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.289" end="00:29:45.889" style="s2">that you think but you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.489" end="00:29:47.869" style="s2">involuntarily and so what Jung would say</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.889" end="00:29:51.320" style="s2">is that means that something is thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.869" end="00:29:53.509" style="s2">in you and that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.320" end="00:29:55.100" style="s2">way of looking at it and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.509" end="00:29:57.109" style="s2">the things that&#39;s uncanny about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.100" end="00:29:58.970" style="s2">psychoanalysts is they they were willing</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.109" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">to take their observations to their</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.970" end="00:30:04.980" style="s2">logical conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:06.780" style="s2">there are things that think in you what</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.980" end="00:30:09.470" style="s2">are those things and what are they</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.780" end="00:30:13.890" style="s2">thinking and why are they thinking it</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.470" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">now if you do dream analysis and this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.890" end="00:30:17.970" style="s2">a tricky thing because who&#39;s to say if</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:20.130" style="s2">you&#39;re dam analysis is correct right</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.970" end="00:30:21.900" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.130" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">if you if you do dream analysis with</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.900" end="00:30:27.150" style="s2">someone you generally have them lay out</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.150" end="00:30:28.590" style="s2">their dream and then you ask them when</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.150" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">they&#39;re going through the dream a second</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.590" end="00:30:31.710" style="s2">time you lay out the dream and you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">kind of get a picture of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.710" end="00:30:35.730" style="s2">they lay out their dream a second time</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:37.620" style="s2">and as they go through it every time</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.730" end="00:30:39.929" style="s2">they mention a detail or character you</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.620" end="00:30:43.230" style="s2">ask them what that reminds them of and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.929" end="00:30:45.090" style="s2">the hypothesis is that the dream is</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.230" end="00:30:47.250" style="s2">presenting an image or an idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.090" end="00:30:49.590" style="s2">associated with a network of ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.250" end="00:30:51.480" style="s2">that if you can expand on the network of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.590" end="00:30:53.220" style="s2">ideas as you go through the dream you</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.480" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">can elaborate on the dream you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.220" end="00:30:58.860" style="s2">expand it upwards and you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:31:00.809" style="s2">see what it might be attempting to put</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.860" end="00:31:03.000" style="s2">forward now Freud&#39;s idea was that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.809" end="00:31:04.860" style="s2">dream knew what it was doing but that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.000" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">its content was being suppressed and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.860" end="00:31:09.330" style="s2">oppressed by an internal sensor so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:11.309" style="s2">dream had to be sneaky about what it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.330" end="00:31:13.350" style="s2">saying because it was going to deliver a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.309" end="00:31:16.140" style="s2">message that the person didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.350" end="00:31:18.840" style="s2">hear and that that was tied up with his</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.140" end="00:31:21.090" style="s2">idea of repression but that&#39;s not Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.840" end="00:31:23.910" style="s2">idea see Jung&#39;s idea was different he</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.090" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">said no no the dream is trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.910" end="00:31:28.950" style="s2">you what is trying to tell you as clear</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">as it can that&#39;s just the best it can do</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.950" end="00:31:33.270" style="s2">and so you could think of the dream and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:34.980" style="s2">this is I believe the right way to think</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.270" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">about it the dream is the birthplace of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.980" end="00:31:39.510" style="s2">thought the same way that artists are</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:41.400" style="s2">the birthplace of culture it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.510" end="00:31:44.070" style="s2">the same process it&#39;s that your mind is</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.400" end="00:31:46.950" style="s2">groping outward to try to comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.070" end="00:31:49.020" style="s2">what it has not yet comprehended and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.950" end="00:31:51.150" style="s2">does that first by trying to map it on</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.020" end="00:31:53.130" style="s2">to image and it&#39;s doing that in the</p>

<p begin="00:31:53.130" end="00:31:58.770" style="s2">and and well let&#39;s stick with incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.880" end="00:32:01.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s not yet a full-fledged</p>

<p begin="00:32:03.870" end="00:32:09.299" style="s2">then if you can grip the fantasy and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.250" end="00:32:12.059" style="s2">share it with other people then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.299" end="00:32:13.890" style="s2">they can elaborate upon it and bring it</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.059" end="00:32:14.400" style="s2">into being with more clarity than it</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.220" end="00:32:24.690" style="s2">Jung&#39;s idea too was ok you think you</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.100" end="00:32:26.550" style="s2">think in words where the hell do those</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.690" end="00:32:28.470" style="s2">thoughts come from well they just spring</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.550" end="00:32:30.660" style="s2">into my head well that&#39;s not much of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.470" end="00:32:33.060" style="s2">answer they just what pop out of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.660" end="00:32:34.950" style="s2">void is there some sort of precursor to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.060" end="00:32:37.290" style="s2">the development of the ideas is there a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.950" end="00:32:39.320" style="s2">developmental pathway so here&#39;s an image</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.290" end="00:32:43.410" style="s2">this is the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.320" end="00:32:45.030" style="s2">there&#39;s calm water there&#39;s a lotus the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.410" end="00:32:46.590" style="s2">roots go all the way down to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.030" end="00:32:49.770" style="s2">of the lake it&#39;s dark down there the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.590" end="00:32:51.870" style="s2">roots are embedded in the dark substrata</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.770" end="00:32:54.030" style="s2">at the bottom of the lake the plant</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.870" end="00:32:55.920" style="s2">moves upwards towards the light that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.030" end="00:32:59.780" style="s2">water gets lighter and lighter as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.920" end="00:33:02.040" style="s2">move upward with the root the flower</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.780" end="00:33:03.780" style="s2">manifests itself on the surface and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.040" end="00:33:05.670" style="s2">buddha sits in the middle that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.780" end="00:33:08.280" style="s2">image about how ideas develop they come</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.670" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">out from the bottom of reality and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.280" end="00:33:12.990" style="s2">push themselves up towards the light and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:14.610" style="s2">they blast forward and something emerges</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.990" end="00:33:17.310" style="s2">as a consequence that&#39;s what that image</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.610" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">means and it&#39;s an image the gold Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.310" end="00:33:20.670" style="s2">that&#39;s sitting in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:22.260" style="s2">Lotus is an image of the perfect person</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.670" end="00:33:24.120" style="s2">you could think about the gold Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.260" end="00:33:26.280" style="s2">who sits in a triangle as exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.120" end="00:33:28.290" style="s2">same thing that&#39;s the eye on the top of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.280" end="00:33:30.270" style="s2">the pyramid these are all the same ideas</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.290" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">there&#39;s and what&#39;s the idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.270" end="00:33:35.310" style="s2">trying to burst forward how to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.780" style="s2">world well what other idea would burst</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.310" end="00:33:39.000" style="s2">forward because it&#39;s the only problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.780" end="00:33:41.160" style="s2">that you really have right how should</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.000" end="00:33:43.620" style="s2">you manifest yourself properly in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.160" end="00:33:45.660" style="s2">world it&#39;s everyone&#39;s question it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.620" end="00:33:47.880" style="s2">ultimate question it&#39;s been the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.660" end="00:33:51.510" style="s2">question since the beginning of time and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.880" end="00:33:54.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve been working out that idea forever</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.510" end="00:33:56.190" style="s2">first of all merely by acting it out and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.270" end="00:33:58.440" style="s2">then by representing the actions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.190" end="00:34:02.220" style="s2">then by representing the representations</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.440" end="00:34:04.290" style="s2">and spiraling all that together so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.220" end="00:34:06.810" style="s2">started looking developmentally I</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.290" end="00:34:09.690" style="s2">thought okay maybe these idea have roots</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.810" end="00:34:12.090" style="s2">and this was partly predicated on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.690" end="00:34:14.340" style="s2">observation from Dostoyevsky and Neches</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.090" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">and and and so forth that there did seem</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.340" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">to be a necessary pattern in moral in in</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:22.409" style="s2">morality there seemed to be a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:25.110" style="s2">pattern it wasn&#39;t arbitrary it was a it</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.409" end="00:34:27.810" style="s2">was a representation of the specific</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.110" end="00:34:29.400" style="s2">mode of human being and it isn&#39;t some</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.810" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">that&#39;s just imposed on you by your</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.400" end="00:34:33.720" style="s2">cultures not something that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:36.030" style="s2">learned its intrinsic in you and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.720" end="00:34:37.950" style="s2">manifest in the culture at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.030" end="00:34:39.780" style="s2">and there&#39;s a dial and met and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.950" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a dialogue between those two</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.780" end="00:34:44.460" style="s2">things the culture in nature where both</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:47.730" style="s2">where the idea is embedded trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.460" end="00:34:49.950" style="s2">make make make the proper articulation</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.730" end="00:34:52.260" style="s2">of that spring forward in each</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.950" end="00:34:57.270" style="s2">individual and that&#39;s only to say these</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.260" end="00:34:59.670" style="s2">aren&#39;t these aren&#39;t radical propositions</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.270" end="00:35:01.290" style="s2">your nature strives so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.670" end="00:35:04.020" style="s2">manifest yourself properly in the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.290" end="00:35:06.330" style="s2">culture strives to aid you in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.020" end="00:35:08.370" style="s2">endeavor is that is there something</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.330" end="00:35:10.410" style="s2">about that that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.370" end="00:35:13.290" style="s2">dubious validity what else would it be</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.410" end="00:35:15.420" style="s2">doing working for your death hardly</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.290" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">working for your destruction well you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.420" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">could see that maybe when culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:21.120" style="s2">becomes pathologized but to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:23.610" style="s2">that it&#39;s able to maintain itself across</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.120" end="00:35:26.370" style="s2">long periods of time it obviously has to</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.610" end="00:35:28.260" style="s2">be striving in some way for the mana for</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.370" end="00:35:30.930" style="s2">your individual manifestation so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.260" end="00:35:33.420" style="s2">you can survive and flourish so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.930" end="00:35:36.090" style="s2">a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a co-creation of the</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.090" end="00:35:42.510" style="s2">through culture and well and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.980" end="00:35:44.820" style="s2">perhaps with your own with your own</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.510" end="00:35:46.410" style="s2">voluntary will participating whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.820" end="00:35:48.870" style="s2">the hell that is something we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:35:48.870" end="00:35:57.060" style="s2">dismiss because of that so then I</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.480" end="00:35:58.740" style="s2">learned about PHA and PHA had some very</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.060" end="00:36:01.200" style="s2">interesting ideas and I think I&#39;ve told</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.740" end="00:36:02.850" style="s2">you already what Piaget was up to he</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.200" end="00:36:03.990" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a developmental psychologist he</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.850" end="00:36:06.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t even regard himself as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.990" end="00:36:09.060" style="s2">psychologist he wanted to reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.780" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">science and religion that&#39;s what he was</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.060" end="00:36:13.290" style="s2">doing through his entire bloody life</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:15.210" style="s2">because it would drove him crazy when he</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.290" end="00:36:16.740" style="s2">was in adolescent and he didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.210" end="00:36:18.450" style="s2">that he would be able to survive unless</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.740" end="00:36:21.060" style="s2">he could bring those two things together</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.450" end="00:36:24.030" style="s2">so he&#39;s working on the same problem and</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.060" end="00:36:27.150" style="s2">so one of the things that Piaget who was</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.030" end="00:36:29.550" style="s2">very prone to observation he was an</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.150" end="00:36:31.220" style="s2">ethologist of human beings that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.550" end="00:36:33.240" style="s2">way of thinking about an ethologist is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.220" end="00:36:34.770" style="s2">scientist who studies animals by</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.240" end="00:36:35.700" style="s2">watching their behavior rather than</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.700" end="00:36:41.730" style="s2">conditions and he got very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.820" end="00:36:43.980" style="s2">the spontaneous emergence of morality in</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.730" end="00:36:46.590" style="s2">play of children that was so smart</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.590" end="00:36:50.700" style="s2">when kids come together and unify</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.750" end="00:36:53.400" style="s2">themselves towards a particular goal</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.700" end="00:36:55.740" style="s2">so in play that a morality emerges out</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.400" end="00:36:57.570" style="s2">of that and that that morality and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.740" end="00:36:59.850" style="s2">mentioned this before there&#39;s a morality</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.570" end="00:37:02.070" style="s2">in game one there&#39;s a morality in game</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.850" end="00:37:04.530" style="s2">two there&#39;s a morality in game three</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.070" end="00:37:07.080" style="s2">what&#39;s common across all those morality</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.530" end="00:37:09.270" style="s2">ziz a meta morality and so the meta</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.080" end="00:37:10.770" style="s2">morality emerges from the particular</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.200" end="00:39:44.550" style="s2">around you all the time and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.359" end="00:39:46.859" style="s2">question is is there a way of being that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.550" end="00:39:48.630" style="s2">increases the probability that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.859" end="00:39:50.670" style="s2">going to move up dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.630" end="00:39:52.940" style="s2">well that doesn&#39;t seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.670" end="00:39:54.990" style="s2">particularly provocative proposition</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.940" end="00:40:00.059" style="s2">unless you think that it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.990" end="00:40:01.500" style="s2">arbitrary and random and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.059" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">think that if you want but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.500" end="00:40:05.640" style="s2">there&#39;s any evidence for that whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:08.369" style="s2">I mean we certainly have even for sexual</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.640" end="00:40:13.170" style="s2">selection we impose criteria they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.369" end="00:40:15.990" style="s2">rammed random and arbitrary so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.170" end="00:40:19.890" style="s2">back to young so what was young trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.990" end="00:40:21.980" style="s2">to do well he was trying to see see</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.890" end="00:40:24.660" style="s2">young believed that once we had stopped</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.980" end="00:40:27.660" style="s2">populating the cosmos with gods that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.660" end="00:40:29.339" style="s2">they went inside that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.660" end="00:40:33.690" style="s2">thinking well think think about it this</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.339" end="00:40:37.109" style="s2">way you know mm-hmm an archaic person</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.690" end="00:40:39.390" style="s2">looks at the sky and uses his</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.109" end="00:40:42.030" style="s2">imagination to populate the sky</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.390" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">what&#39;s the sky well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.030" end="00:40:46.410" style="s2">constellations it&#39;s the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:48.750" style="s2">gods well why well because the gods are</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.410" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">what RB are out there beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.750" end="00:40:51.720" style="s2">understanding well that&#39;s what you see</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.400" end="00:40:53.430" style="s2">when you look up at the sky so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.720" end="00:40:56.369" style="s2">populate the night sky</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.430" end="00:40:58.260" style="s2">with figures of your imagination so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.369" end="00:41:01.230" style="s2">gods are the things that you broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.260" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">out of your imagination and see spread</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.230" end="00:41:05.160" style="s2">over the world it&#39;s like the contents of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:06.869" style="s2">your unconscious are manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.160" end="00:41:09.480" style="s2">themselves when you encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.869" end="00:41:12.990" style="s2">unknown it&#39;s exactly what it is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.480" end="00:41:15.210" style="s2">how how else could it be right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.990" end="00:41:17.100" style="s2">projecting your fantasy onto what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.210" end="00:41:18.960" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that&#39;s how you start to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.100" end="00:41:21.330" style="s2">cope with what you don&#39;t understand you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.960" end="00:41:23.070" style="s2">populate the unknown with deities where</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.330" end="00:41:25.109" style="s2">did they come from they came from your</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.070" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">imagination well what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.109" end="00:41:27.750" style="s2">take them out of the world do they</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:30.210" style="s2">disappear</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.750" end="00:41:32.700" style="s2">no they just go back into your</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.210" end="00:41:34.980" style="s2">imagination so that&#39;s where young dug</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.700" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">down to find them that&#39;s the same motif</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.980" end="00:41:39.510" style="s2">as rescuing your dead father from</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.340" style="s2">the-from or rescuing your father from</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.510" end="00:41:44.430" style="s2">the belly of the whale it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.340" end="00:41:47.310" style="s2">idea is that the corpses of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.430" end="00:41:49.530" style="s2">inhabit your imagination so where do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.310" end="00:41:51.810" style="s2">go if you need to revivify them you go</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.530" end="00:41:53.790" style="s2">into your imagination and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.810" end="00:41:56.310" style="s2">what Jung did and that mean it this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.790" end="00:41:57.930" style="s2">no secret if you read Jung he tells you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.310" end="00:42:00.420" style="s2">that&#39;s what he did he tells you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.930" end="00:42:03.600" style="s2">why he did it it&#39;s not an interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.420" end="00:42:06.060" style="s2">on my part well so then then the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.600" end="00:42:08.550" style="s2">question is what&#39;s down there is it just</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.060" end="00:42:11.010" style="s2">mass and catastrophe or is there</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.550" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">something in it that&#39;s patterned well</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.010" end="00:42:15.180" style="s2">Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:17.490" style="s2">proposition was that Yuri did you really</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.180" end="00:42:20.040" style="s2">discover the great archetypes that guide</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.490" end="00:42:22.260" style="s2">human being by investigating the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.040" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">structure of your imagination when he</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.260" end="00:42:25.080" style="s2">thought about the imagination in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:27.390" style="s2">sense at least in part as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.080" end="00:42:29.070" style="s2">manifestation of your of your biology</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.390" end="00:42:31.350" style="s2">well yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.070" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">what else would it be you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.350" end="00:42:35.910" style="s2">told you that story about my nephew I</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:38.040" style="s2">believe right about him running around</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.910" end="00:42:40.590" style="s2">as a knight and then going off to have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.040" end="00:42:42.060" style="s2">combat with the dwarves and the Dragons</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.590" end="00:42:44.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like well where did that come from</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.060" end="00:42:47.130" style="s2">well partly it came from his culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.460" end="00:42:49.260" style="s2">right because if he was a knight and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.130" end="00:42:50.940" style="s2">so obviously that&#39;s a cultural construct</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.260" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">but the thing is is that his imagination</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.940" end="00:42:56.730" style="s2">is it&#39;s this structure that&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:42:59.850" style="s2">for things to fill itself with just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.730" end="00:43:01.859" style="s2">your predisposition to language you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.850" end="00:43:04.230" style="s2">a predisposition to language what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.859" end="00:43:06.750" style="s2">that we don&#39;t know what does it do</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.230" end="00:43:10.020" style="s2">it looks for things in the world to fill</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.750" end="00:43:12.090" style="s2">itself with right and if you&#39;re if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.020" end="00:43:14.220" style="s2">first of all wouldn&#39;t you start to learn</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.090" end="00:43:15.900" style="s2">how to speak you babble every phoneme</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.220" end="00:43:18.210" style="s2">did you know that there&#39;s there&#39;s lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.900" end="00:43:20.040" style="s2">there&#39;s if I was learning to speak an</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.210" end="00:43:21.960" style="s2">Asian language there would be phonemes I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.040" end="00:43:23.160" style="s2">couldn&#39;t pronounce and vice-versa an</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.960" end="00:43:25.380" style="s2">infant all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.160" end="00:43:27.090" style="s2">they babble all the phonemes and then as</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.380" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">they start to learn the language they</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.090" end="00:43:30.900" style="s2">lose the ability to say a bunch of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:32.850" style="s2">and only retain the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.900" end="00:43:35.550" style="s2">relevant to that language so a baby</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.850" end="00:43:37.170" style="s2">babbles all laying all possible</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.550" end="00:43:40.350" style="s2">languages that&#39;s a way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.170" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">it and then loses the ability so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.350" end="00:43:44.520" style="s2">a man if that&#39;s you can see there so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:46.860" style="s2">could say well you manifest the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.520" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">potential to be possessed by all the set</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.860" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">of all possible archetypes it&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:54.570" style="s2">into your biology and then as your</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:56.790" style="s2">enculturated in your own culture the set</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.570" end="00:43:58.710" style="s2">of archetypes that manifest its manifest</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.790" end="00:44:01.220" style="s2">themselves in that culture are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.710" end="00:44:03.840" style="s2">that you pull in for your own use so my</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.850" end="00:46:49.890" style="s2">what constitutes acceptable sovereignty</p>

<p begin="00:47:05.390" end="00:47:09.900" style="s2">how could it be any other way well</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.130" end="00:47:11.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what human beings are like and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.900" end="00:47:15.300" style="s2">don&#39;t think that you can read the</p>

<p begin="00:47:50.490" end="00:47:54.660" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t we use the predator that lurks</p>

<p begin="00:47:54.660" end="00:48:00.450" style="s2">representative of the unknown why</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.510" end="00:48:02.910" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t we harness that circuitry we</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.910" end="00:48:08.580" style="s2">the point how could we do anything else</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.560" end="00:48:09.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it makes perfect sense well so then</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.580" end="00:48:11.220" style="s2">what you might say well what would you</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.960" end="00:48:13.470" style="s2">want to be king</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.220" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">you could say king of the world or king</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.470" end="00:48:17.970" style="s2">of your own soul what do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:20.070" style="s2">subordinate yourself to how about your</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.970" end="00:48:22.440" style="s2">heroic willingness to encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.070" end="00:48:23.220" style="s2">unknown and articulate it and share that</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.190" end="00:48:37.380" style="s2">because if you do that to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.470" end="00:48:40.230" style="s2">that you do that assuming your society</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.380" end="00:48:42.599" style="s2">isn&#39;t entirely corrupt you will be</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.359" end="00:49:02.490" style="s2">again unless you&#39;ve taken a detour into</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.450" end="00:49:04.080" style="s2">dark places and are possessed with</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.490" end="00:49:06.180" style="s2">admiration for people who are working</p>

<p begin="00:49:10.140" end="00:49:13.950" style="s2">out what&#39;s common across them and draw</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.210" end="00:49:16.200" style="s2">your own conclusions and you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.950" end="00:49:18.210" style="s2">yourself - when you&#39;re torturing</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.200" end="00:49:19.800" style="s2">yourself with your conscience because</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.210" end="00:49:20.670" style="s2">you&#39;re not doing what you should be and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.800" end="00:49:22.380" style="s2">you know it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.670" end="00:49:24.750" style="s2">what is it that you&#39;re torturing</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.380" end="00:49:27.780" style="s2">yourself in relationship to you have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.750" end="00:49:29.310" style="s2">vision of your own ideal and you torment</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.780" end="00:49:31.950" style="s2">yourself if you&#39;re not matching it</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.310" end="00:49:34.080" style="s2">what&#39;s the ideal well you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.950" end="00:49:36.540" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of incoherent and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.080" end="00:49:38.250" style="s2">and poorly articulated but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.540" end="00:49:41.460" style="s2">mean it isn&#39;t trying to manifest itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.250" end="00:49:42.839" style="s2">and and make itself known to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.460" end="00:49:45.060" style="s2">really the purpose of religious</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.839" end="00:49:49.770" style="s2">education is to make that ideal</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.060" end="00:49:53.190" style="s2">articulated well we&#39;ve lost that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.770" end="00:49:55.230" style="s2">not a good thing okay so I talked to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.190" end="00:49:56.609" style="s2">about the Mesopotamian story and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.230" end="00:49:58.260" style="s2">talked to you about the Egyptian story</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.609" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">and what I thought it meant and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.260" end="00:50:02.040" style="s2">bit of an elaboration on the same theme</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:04.290" style="s2">because it says well the hero isn&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.040" end="00:50:06.810" style="s2">the the deity</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.290" end="00:50:09.030" style="s2">transcendant pattern let&#39;s say that goes</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.810" end="00:50:11.430" style="s2">out into the unknown cuts it into pieces</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.030" end="00:50:13.710" style="s2">and makes the world that&#39;s not good</p>

<p begin="00:51:39.570" end="00:51:44.430" style="s2">Nietzsche Mik missed as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.850" end="00:51:46.950" style="s2">tell is he didn&#39;t he knew that he knew</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.430" end="00:51:48.740" style="s2">of the death of God perhaps he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.950" end="00:51:51.300" style="s2">know that it had happened many times</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.740" end="00:51:52.920" style="s2">Myrcella had documented that across many</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.300" end="00:51:55.890" style="s2">cultures but what Nietzsche didn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.920" end="00:51:58.410" style="s2">to lay out at least in his vision of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.890" end="00:52:00.450" style="s2">Superman or the over man was that it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.410" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">a responsibility of the person who wants</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.450" end="00:52:04.890" style="s2">to revivify the culture to go down and</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:05.970" style="s2">rescue the damn culture which is what</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.890" end="00:52:08.280" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to be doing in</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.970" end="00:52:10.980" style="s2">university because your father is lying</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.280" end="00:52:12.390" style="s2">dead in the libraries right so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.980" end="00:52:14.780" style="s2">supposed to be going in there and taking</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.390" end="00:52:17.310" style="s2">that spirit out of the books and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.780" end="00:52:18.210" style="s2">manifesting it in your own being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.310" end="00:52:20.849" style="s2">what the university&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.210" end="00:52:26.190" style="s2">were for although I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.849" end="00:52:28.410" style="s2">what they&#39;re for anymore so we talked</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.190" end="00:52:29.849" style="s2">about the Mesopotamians story and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.410" end="00:52:31.650" style="s2">talked about the Egyptian story and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.849" end="00:52:35.070" style="s2">other people have documented the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.650" end="00:52:36.900" style="s2">emergence of hero mythology in cultures</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.070" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">far more diverse than the ones that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.900" end="00:52:41.849" style="s2">exposing you to that was done most</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:43.619" style="s2">popularly by Joseph Campbell but</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.849" end="00:52:45.420" style="s2">Campbell&#39;s like I don&#39;t think Campbell</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.619" end="00:52:47.369" style="s2">had a single idea that he didn&#39;t derive</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.420" end="00:52:49.890" style="s2">from Jung and I&#39;m not saying that in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.369" end="00:52:52.170" style="s2">in a critical manner because Campbell</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.890" end="00:52:54.450" style="s2">was good at standing as a mediator</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.170" end="00:52:56.130" style="s2">between Union and a more general</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.450" end="00:52:59.730" style="s2">population he did and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.130" end="00:53:03.510" style="s2">non-trivial accomplishment seriously but</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.730" end="00:53:05.070" style="s2">but but Jung is still the source of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.510" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">those ideas and if you&#39;re serious about</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.070" end="00:53:10.470" style="s2">them that&#39;s the person that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:12.180" style="s2">go to for that kind of knowledge so now</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.470" end="00:53:13.859" style="s2">I wanted to tell you some other stories</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.180" end="00:53:15.960" style="s2">that are that are in some sense closer</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.859" end="00:53:17.640" style="s2">to Western culture they&#39;re the stories</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.960" end="00:53:20.130" style="s2">upon which Western cultures actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.640" end="00:53:22.650" style="s2">predicated so I&#39;m going to tell you well</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.130" end="00:53:24.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not only Western story today I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.650" end="00:53:26.190" style="s2">going to tell you a couple of stories</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.030" end="00:53:28.140" style="s2">from Genesis and I&#39;m going to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.190" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">about the story of the Buddha I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.140" end="00:53:32.040" style="s2">to do that at the same time because the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:34.500" style="s2">story of the Buddha is almost a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.040" end="00:53:36.750" style="s2">parallel structurally speaking to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.500" end="00:53:38.490" style="s2">story of Adam and Eve and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.750" end="00:53:41.190" style="s2">show you that we can you can decide for</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.490" end="00:53:43.710" style="s2">yourself if I&#39;m imposing a pattern on it</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.190" end="00:53:46.050" style="s2">because god only knows right or whether</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.710" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">or not once you have the key to</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.050" end="00:53:50.099" style="s2">understanding the stories which I hope I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:52.500" style="s2">provided you with with the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.099" end="00:53:54.060" style="s2">idea of the dragon of chaos and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.500" end="00:53:55.830" style="s2">great mother and the great father in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.060" end="00:53:59.030" style="s2">individual it gives you a schema that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.830" end="00:54:01.170" style="s2">you can use to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.030" end="00:54:03.270" style="s2">characterizations of great stories and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.170" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">as far as I can tell it works pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.270" end="00:54:08.310" style="s2">much universally across stories so so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:10.680" style="s2">want to read I want to walk you through</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.310" end="00:54:12.780" style="s2">those foundational stories and I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.680" end="00:54:14.160" style="s2">say one of the things to know about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.780" end="00:54:15.180" style="s2">way the Bible is structured there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:17.369" style="s2">couple of things you want to know about</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.180" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">it is that it was authored by multiple</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.369" end="00:54:23.339" style="s2">people across extraordinarily vast spans</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:25.980" style="s2">of time and then aggregated by other</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.339" end="00:54:28.109" style="s2">people and sorted into something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.980" end="00:54:30.869" style="s2">seemed to make sense and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.109" end="00:54:32.220" style="s2">really think about it as a because Bible</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.869" end="00:54:34.170" style="s2">is is a library it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.220" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">library of books it&#39;s not a book the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.170" end="00:54:38.460" style="s2">library is organized a certain way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:40.680" style="s2">makes a kind of sense but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.460" end="00:54:43.410" style="s2">exactly as if anyone decided what that</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.680" end="00:54:46.710" style="s2">sense would be it&#39;s the collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.410" end="00:54:49.410" style="s2">work of hundreds and thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.710" end="00:54:52.020" style="s2">across thousands of years attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.410" end="00:54:54.119" style="s2">organize a collective story into</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.020" end="00:54:58.250" style="s2">something that something out of which</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.119" end="00:55:01.530" style="s2">the sense emerges it&#39;s like human beings</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.250" end="00:55:03.840" style="s2">acted and then they dream dreamed about</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.530" end="00:55:06.090" style="s2">how they acted and then they wrote down</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.840" end="00:55:08.490" style="s2">what they dreamed about how they acted</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.090" end="00:55:10.710" style="s2">and then they organized what they wrote</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.490" end="00:55:12.720" style="s2">about how they dreamed they acted and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.710" end="00:55:15.270" style="s2">that&#39;s how that book came into being and</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.720" end="00:55:17.490" style="s2">the information that&#39;s within it emerged</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.270" end="00:55:19.619" style="s2">from the behavioral level upward right</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.490" end="00:55:21.630" style="s2">rather than being imposed top down no</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.619" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a feedback right</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.630" end="00:55:26.340" style="s2">because if you understand how you act</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:28.500" style="s2">and that changes how you act and so you</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.340" end="00:55:31.349" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t avoid the top-down</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.500" end="00:55:32.820" style="s2">feedback but a tremendous amount of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.349" end="00:55:34.980" style="s2">information in there and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.820" end="00:55:38.580" style="s2">it&#39;s revelatory information we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.980" end="00:55:40.050" style="s2">know it&#39;s in there because how we act is</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.580" end="00:55:42.990" style="s2">informative and then if you represent</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.050" end="00:55:45.270" style="s2">how we act that&#39;s informative but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.990" end="00:55:47.490" style="s2">information came from how we act not</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.270" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">from the representation of how we act</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.490" end="00:55:52.349" style="s2">and then you might think well how did we</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">learn how to act and the answer is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.349" end="00:55:58.320" style="s2">been trying to figure out how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:56:00.630" style="s2">for 3.5 billion years there&#39;s a lots of</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.320" end="00:56:03.089" style="s2">information encoded in our actions and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.630" end="00:56:05.880" style="s2">in our social interactions way more than</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.089" end="00:56:07.560" style="s2">we understand so we&#39;re acting something</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.880" end="00:56:08.970" style="s2">out we don&#39;t understand what it is but</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.560" end="00:56:10.859" style="s2">we&#39;re doing our best to pull that</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.970" end="00:56:12.540" style="s2">information upward partly by dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.859" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">about it that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing at</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.540" end="00:56:16.170" style="s2">night you&#39;re trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">the hell you&#39;re up to well you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.580" end="00:57:18.510" style="s2">without doing arbitrary editing and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:20.550" style="s2">part of the reason that the Bible is</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.510" end="00:57:22.230" style="s2">full of internal contradictions it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.550" end="00:57:24.420" style="s2">the same reason that a dream is full of</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.230" end="00:57:26.850" style="s2">internal contradictions is if you impose</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.420" end="00:57:32.210" style="s2">too much coherence on it you start</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.850" end="00:57:34.830" style="s2">losing the look imagine you have an</p>

<p begin="00:57:35.720" end="00:57:42.270" style="s2">well it&#39;s messy and and and the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.530" end="00:57:43.800" style="s2">image emerges and you might say well we</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.270" end="00:57:47.640" style="s2">could replace that with a nice clean</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.800" end="00:57:50.160" style="s2">line drawing or even a sequence of stick</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.640" end="00:57:51.810" style="s2">figures and get the basic point across</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.160" end="00:57:56.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like well you would but you&#39;d lose</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.460" end="00:58:02.910" style="s2">lost in the premature attempt to bring</p>

<p begin="00:58:02.910" end="00:58:06.420" style="s2">in fact we know already that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.650" end="00:58:09.350" style="s2">maybe the difference between dreams and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.420" end="00:58:12.890" style="s2">waking thought so waking thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.350" end="00:58:16.650" style="s2">sacrifices completeness for coherence</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.890" end="00:58:18.840" style="s2">right so whereas dream thought</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.650" end="00:58:21.210" style="s2">sacrifices coherence for completeness</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.840" end="00:58:22.830" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s not something</p>

<p begin="00:58:24.510" end="00:58:30.830" style="s2">who&#39;ve been thinking this sort of thing</p>

<p begin="00:58:31.190" end="00:58:38.100" style="s2">excludes too much an imprecise thought</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.550" end="00:58:40.460" style="s2">is not sufficiently coherent so we do</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.100" end="00:58:42.450" style="s2">both precise thought left-hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.460" end="00:58:46.980" style="s2">linguistically mediate it&#39;s sequential</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.450" end="00:58:49.530" style="s2">logical incoherent but complete thought</p>

<p begin="00:58:49.530" end="00:58:52.650" style="s2">the right hemisphere even has a more</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.760" end="00:58:54.060" style="s2">diffuse structure it&#39;s like the right</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.650" end="00:58:57.000" style="s2">hemisphere is trying to get a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.060" end="00:58:58.470" style="s2">everything now it&#39;s not going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.000" end="00:58:59.670" style="s2">very detailed picture because it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:58:59.670" end="00:59:03.600" style="s2">of contradictions but at least it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.710" end="00:59:04.920" style="s2">picture of everything and the left says</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.600" end="00:59:07.290" style="s2">that&#39;s not good enough for precise</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.920" end="00:59:09.330" style="s2">action and it&#39;s not so we&#39;ll narrow that</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.290" end="00:59:12.120" style="s2">to precision but we lose the richness</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.330" end="00:59:15.270" style="s2">but you need both so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.120" end="00:59:18.540" style="s2">interplay well the documents that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.270" end="00:59:22.110" style="s2">Bible is composed of are half dream and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.540" end="00:59:23.910" style="s2">half articulated thought and they have</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.110" end="00:59:26.040" style="s2">the advantages of articulated thought</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.910" end="00:59:28.920" style="s2">and the advantages of the dream but also</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.040" end="00:59:30.870" style="s2">the disadvantages of both so it&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.920" end="00:59:33.090" style="s2">to the degree that it&#39;s articulated it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:59:33.090" end="00:59:38.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a dream it&#39;s still incoherent but</p>

<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="01:00:03.380" style="s2">understand anything completely now</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.170" end="01:00:16.650" style="s2">ancient god only knows how old they are</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.650" end="01:00:19.290" style="s2">and the story of noah here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.650" end="01:00:22.770" style="s2">interesting thing I know this guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.290" end="01:00:26.100" style="s2">a he&#39;s a quak quak quak tribal member</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.770" end="01:00:29.250" style="s2">and an artist who lives on the tip of</p>

<p begin="01:00:29.250" end="01:00:32.790" style="s2">culture he comes from is about fourteen</p>

<p begin="01:00:32.790" end="01:00:36.360" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s not being unbroken for</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.380" end="01:00:39.540" style="s2">fourteen thousand years very long period</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.360" end="01:00:42.330" style="s2">of time and he he&#39;s not literate this</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.540" end="01:00:43.980" style="s2">guy although he&#39;s very intelligent has a</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.330" end="01:00:45.990" style="s2">great memory and is also a great artist</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.980" end="01:00:47.970" style="s2">and he&#39;s told me some of the stories</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.990" end="01:00:50.030" style="s2">that that have come down through the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.970" end="01:00:52.320" style="s2">quark Wacka Wacka tradition and he was</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.030" end="01:00:54.060" style="s2">educated by his grandparents who were</p>

<p begin="01:00:54.060" end="01:00:56.730" style="s2">original language speakers there are</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.320" end="01:00:58.500" style="s2">many people like that left to think</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.730" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">there&#39;s only 3,000 in his particular</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.500" end="01:01:03.900" style="s2">tribal group they have a story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:06.600" style="s2">the flood story that this except it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.900" end="01:01:08.730" style="s2">canoes and it isn&#39;t a dove it&#39;s a crow</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.600" end="01:01:10.470" style="s2">but the damn story is exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.730" end="01:01:12.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like well what the hell is up with</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.470" end="01:01:13.570" style="s2">that in fact at the end it&#39;s not a canoe</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.630" end="01:01:15.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a bunch of canoe</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.570" end="01:01:17.620" style="s2">that are tied together and at the end</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.790" end="01:01:18.910" style="s2">the canoes all break apart and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.620" end="01:01:20.920" style="s2">why there are people all over the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.910" end="01:01:22.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like the story of the Tower of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.920" end="01:01:29.950" style="s2">Babel which I&#39;m going to talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.360" end="01:01:32.020" style="s2">about today it&#39;s so the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.950" end="01:01:33.490" style="s2">telling you that is because the stories</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.020" end="01:01:36.070" style="s2">at the beginning of Genesis are</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.490" end="01:01:39.850" style="s2">extraordinarily old now so maybe he</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.070" end="01:01:42.910" style="s2">tells the same story that we tell you</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.850" end="01:01:44.830" style="s2">know making the presumption that we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.910" end="01:01:46.390" style="s2">the people who who are part of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.830" end="01:01:49.230" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition and I know</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.390" end="01:01:52.150" style="s2">that that&#39;s not the case for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.230" end="01:01:55.240" style="s2">either he&#39;s telling the same damn story</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.150" end="01:01:58.120" style="s2">and it emerged from a central point so</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.240" end="01:02:00.460" style="s2">long ago that it&#39;s 20,000 years or</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.120" end="01:02:02.110" style="s2">30,000 years or maybe 50,000 years since</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.460" end="01:02:04.330" style="s2">we moved out of Africa something like</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.110" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">that and this story has survived which</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.330" end="01:02:08.680" style="s2">is certainly possible because oral do</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:11.650" style="s2">you think can an oral traditions survive</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.680" end="01:02:14.070" style="s2">that long that&#39;s the wrong question oral</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.650" end="01:02:16.780" style="s2">traditions always survived that long</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.070" end="01:02:20.230" style="s2">what&#39;s radical is that they disappear</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.780" end="01:02:22.960" style="s2">were the radicals the oral tradition is</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.230" end="01:02:24.880" style="s2">something that stays the same generation</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.960" end="01:02:26.650" style="s2">after generation so how much innovation</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.880" end="01:02:29.860" style="s2">do you think there isn&#39;t a small tribal</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.650" end="01:02:32.260" style="s2">group none that&#39;s why they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.860" end="01:02:35.170" style="s2">advanced technologies they stay the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.260" end="01:02:37.450" style="s2">the stories stay the same so the idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.170" end="01:02:39.550" style="s2">that they can be transmitted unchanged</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.450" end="01:02:41.110" style="s2">over thousands and tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.550" end="01:02:44.140" style="s2">years is really not a debatable</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.110" end="01:02:46.840" style="s2">proposition it&#39;s the norm so either the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.140" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">stories emerge from a central source and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.840" end="01:02:50.050" style="s2">have never been lost so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:51.250" style="s2">pick them up everywhere or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.050" end="01:02:54.130" style="s2">something about the stories that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.250" end="01:02:56.020" style="s2">automatically regenerates themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.130" end="01:02:57.820" style="s2">I suppose it&#39;s a little bit of column a</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.020" end="01:03:01.570" style="s2">and a little bit of column B it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.820" end="01:03:03.790" style="s2">my my nephew when he perceived himself</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.570" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">as a dragon slaying Knight it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.790" end="01:03:07.540" style="s2">well was that the continuation of an</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:09.400" style="s2">oral tradition or was it something that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.540" end="01:03:11.500" style="s2">he spontaneously come up with and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.400" end="01:03:14.170" style="s2">answer is both</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.500" end="01:03:16.150" style="s2">both the pattern was there he just had</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.170" end="01:03:19.480" style="s2">to see it and he saw it and synthesized</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.150" end="01:03:21.820" style="s2">it and and encapsulated it in his own</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.480" end="01:03:23.530" style="s2">imagination well that&#39;s not much</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.820" end="01:03:25.930" style="s2">different than the oral tradition being</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.530" end="01:03:27.250" style="s2">unbroken it&#39;s it&#39;s just a variant of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.930" end="01:03:29.770" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.250" end="01:03:31.360" style="s2">I mean if you lose a story but everyone</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.770" end="01:03:34.000" style="s2">acts it out you can reconstruct the</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.360" end="01:03:35.530" style="s2">story right and if everyone doesn&#39;t act</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.000" end="01:03:37.180" style="s2">it out then the culture dies because</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.530" end="01:03:39.580" style="s2">there&#39;s some things about the story that</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.180" end="01:03:41.740" style="s2">you have to act out if your culture is</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.580" end="01:03:43.930" style="s2">going to survive that&#39;s the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.740" end="01:03:45.790" style="s2">and then that would be well that would</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.930" end="01:03:48.790" style="s2">be where you would search for ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.790" end="01:03:51.550" style="s2">values the stories that enable you as an</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.790" end="01:03:53.500" style="s2">individual to flourish in such a manner</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.550" end="01:03:55.750" style="s2">that your culture flourishes in a way to</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.500" end="01:03:57.190" style="s2">enhance your flourishing right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.750" end="01:03:58.780" style="s2">the right way that you want to organize</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.190" end="01:04:00.700" style="s2">things you know that&#39;s what you do</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.780" end="01:04:03.850" style="s2">inside a family if it&#39;s functioning well</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.700" end="01:04:06.130" style="s2">right the family functions so that every</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.850" end="01:04:08.440" style="s2">individual benefits from being in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.130" end="01:04:10.030" style="s2">family and that strengthens the family</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.440" end="01:04:12.070" style="s2">that&#39;s what Piaget called an</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.030" end="01:04:13.900" style="s2">equilibrated solution technically</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.070" end="01:04:16.480" style="s2">speaking when he was looking for the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.900" end="01:04:19.560" style="s2">origin of moral ideas he came up with</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.480" end="01:04:21.970" style="s2">the idea of equilibrate equilibrate &#39;add</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.560" end="01:04:23.800" style="s2">state and then equilibrated state is one</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.970" end="01:04:25.750" style="s2">the three of you are in an equilibrated</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.800" end="01:04:28.510" style="s2">state if you all want to be in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.750" end="01:04:30.580" style="s2">state and while you&#39;re in that state the</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.510" end="01:04:32.920" style="s2">things that you&#39;re doing together work</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.580" end="01:04:35.680" style="s2">better and they facilitate each of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.920" end="01:04:38.530" style="s2">development right so it&#39;s the stacking</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.680" end="01:04:41.560" style="s2">of an ethical of a set of ethical</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.530" end="01:04:43.090" style="s2">propositions so that the individual</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.560" end="01:04:44.830" style="s2">benefits at the same time as the group</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.090" end="01:04:46.750" style="s2">and you could you can increase that</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.830" end="01:04:49.360" style="s2">stacking we could say well it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.750" end="01:04:50.860" style="s2">that you want to organize yourself so</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.360" end="01:04:52.630" style="s2">that all three of you get what you want</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.860" end="01:04:55.510" style="s2">better than you would if you were alone</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.630" end="01:04:57.730" style="s2">and so that you&#39;re healthy and so the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.510" end="01:05:00.040" style="s2">stacking also occurs all the way down</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.730" end="01:05:01.930" style="s2">the physiological chain you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.040" end="01:05:03.640" style="s2">manifesting yourself in the world so</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.930" end="01:05:05.620" style="s2">that you remain as physiologically</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.640" end="01:05:07.570" style="s2">healthy as you possibly can so your</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.620" end="01:05:09.340" style="s2">stress responses are properly balanced</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.570" end="01:05:10.720" style="s2">and all of that and then maybe your</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.340" end="01:05:12.640" style="s2">equilibrate at state is well enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.720" end="01:05:15.340" style="s2">developed so it doesn&#39;t just include the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.640" end="01:05:16.930" style="s2">three of you it extends outward beyond</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.340" end="01:05:19.330" style="s2">you into the greater community and</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.930" end="01:05:21.550" style="s2">things stack like that and that&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.330" end="01:05:23.950" style="s2">they get if they all get stacked up</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.550" end="01:05:25.870" style="s2">every level it&#39;s stacked on top of each</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.950" end="01:05:27.700" style="s2">other properly you have an equilibrated</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.870" end="01:05:29.470" style="s2">state and I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.700" end="01:05:33.430" style="s2">different than a vision of paradise I</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.470" end="01:05:36.480" style="s2">think those are the same thing so now</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.430" end="01:05:38.620" style="s2">the question is well can that happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.480" end="01:05:40.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different story</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.620" end="01:05:42.610" style="s2">I mean it happens in</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.780" end="01:05:44.170" style="s2">your own life at those times where</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.610" end="01:05:45.970" style="s2">everything comes together for you you</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.170" end="01:05:47.500" style="s2">know it&#39;s chaotic and then everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.970" end="01:05:50.050" style="s2">snaps together and you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.500" end="01:05:52.330" style="s2">exactly right and it&#39;s unstable you</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.050" end="01:05:53.590" style="s2">can&#39;t maintain it it fragments again but</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.330" end="01:05:55.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.590" end="01:05:57.400" style="s2">working towards if you have any sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.780" end="01:05:59.220" style="s2">you&#39;re working towards that constantly</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.400" end="01:06:01.870" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what music represents</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.220" end="01:06:03.430" style="s2">it&#39;s this stacking of harmonious</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.870" end="01:06:05.290" style="s2">patterns right that are playing</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.430" end="01:06:08.350" style="s2">themselves out and being and you watch</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.290" end="01:06:10.870" style="s2">how people respond to music the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.350" end="01:06:13.330" style="s2">orchestra&#39;s led by the leader every</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.870" end="01:06:15.100" style="s2">different individual plays his or her</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.330" end="01:06:17.560" style="s2">part they&#39;re organized into string</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.100" end="01:06:20.280" style="s2">sections and horn sections and so on so</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.560" end="01:06:23.530" style="s2">you get individual sub group group</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.280" end="01:06:25.000" style="s2">orchestra leader then maybe you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.530" end="01:06:26.860" style="s2">people dancing well so what does that</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.000" end="01:06:28.510" style="s2">mean so maybe it&#39;s men and women dancing</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.860" end="01:06:31.450" style="s2">in front of that like a Viennese Waltz</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.510" end="01:06:33.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s the the harmonious stacking of</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.450" end="01:06:35.650" style="s2">pattern being in the background led by</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.880" end="01:06:37.960" style="s2">someone who&#39;s making sure that the time</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.650" end="01:06:39.490" style="s2">is in order and men and women arranging</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.960" end="01:06:41.440" style="s2">themselves according to the patterns</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.490" end="01:06:43.480" style="s2">right and everyone has a wonderful time</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.440" end="01:06:46.090" style="s2">when that&#39;s happening and it&#39;s acting</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.480" end="01:06:47.860" style="s2">out it&#39;s acting out the proposition that</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.090" end="01:06:49.780" style="s2">all of these levels of being can be</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.860" end="01:06:52.240" style="s2">stacked up harmoniously at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.780" end="01:06:53.050" style="s2">everybody has a tremendously fun time</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.240" end="01:06:54.820" style="s2">while they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.050" end="01:06:56.860" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s how you find a mate how to</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.820" end="01:06:59.470" style="s2">dance and for exactly the same reason</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.860" end="01:07:00.910" style="s2">it&#39;s an optimal place to do that you see</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.470" end="01:07:03.700" style="s2">if there&#39;s someone that you can be with</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.910" end="01:07:05.950" style="s2">with whom you can mutually act out the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.700" end="01:07:07.390" style="s2">patterns of being well we&#39;re all acting</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.950" end="01:07:08.830" style="s2">that out at a dance we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.390" end="01:07:11.230" style="s2">we&#39;re doing we&#39;re having a good time</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.830" end="01:07:13.690" style="s2">well yeah that&#39;s a little glimpse of</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.230" end="01:07:16.990" style="s2">paradise that&#39;s what that good time is</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.690" end="01:07:20.410" style="s2">now the Bible stories before what</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.990" end="01:07:22.570" style="s2">happens what seems to happen is that you</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.410" end="01:07:25.330" style="s2">can there&#39;s there&#39;s two cataclysmic</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.570" end="01:07:26.740" style="s2">events that the first part of at the end</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.330" end="01:07:29.410" style="s2">of the first part of Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.740" end="01:07:32.560" style="s2">there&#39;s the flood so the prehistoric</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.410" end="01:07:34.810" style="s2">world is wiped out by the flood and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.560" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">the idea there in some sense there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.810" end="01:07:39.130" style="s2">bunch of ideas but one of them is</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:41.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a place in history past which we</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.130" end="01:07:43.600" style="s2">cannot look and that&#39;s absolutely true</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.830" end="01:07:46.770" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.600" end="01:07:48.850" style="s2">about human beings is that are written</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.770" end="01:07:50.050" style="s2">civilizations the ones we have records</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.850" end="01:07:51.430" style="s2">have all seemed to have popped up</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.050" end="01:07:52.990" style="s2">somewhere in the neighborhood of five to</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.430" end="01:07:54.130" style="s2">six thousand years ago it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.990" end="01:07:58.829" style="s2">where you look right</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.130" end="01:08:01.749" style="s2">Central America China India Greece Egypt</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.829" end="01:08:02.829" style="s2">it&#39;s all the same 6,000 years ago poof</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.749" end="01:08:05.499" style="s2">there we were</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.829" end="01:08:08.049" style="s2">well what happened before that well the</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.499" end="01:08:10.569" style="s2">answer is we don&#39;t know everything is</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.049" end="01:08:12.549" style="s2">obscured by the chaos of history before</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.569" end="01:08:14.589" style="s2">that point and all that seemed urged out</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.549" end="01:08:16.659" style="s2">of it so to speak are these incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.589" end="01:08:18.339" style="s2">ancient stories and so we&#39;re gonna walk</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.659" end="01:08:19.869" style="s2">through the ancient stories and see what</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.339" end="01:08:22.150" style="s2">we can pull out of them we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.869" end="01:08:23.859" style="s2">done that with several so so there are</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.150" end="01:08:27.040" style="s2">some representations of the Garden of</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.859" end="01:08:28.810" style="s2">Eden so this is by Hieronymus Bosch I</p>

<p begin="01:08:28.810" end="01:08:32.230" style="s2">Bosch is but he&#39;s definitely worth</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.369" end="01:08:34.719" style="s2">looking up because he was one strange</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.230" end="01:08:36.369" style="s2">character he was like I think he painted</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.719" end="01:08:38.560" style="s2">in the 15th century if I remember</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.369" end="01:08:40.630" style="s2">correctly he was like this 15th century</p>

<p begin="01:08:40.630" end="01:08:45.730" style="s2">are so uncanny that that they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:47.230" style="s2">shocking to the modern eye which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.730" end="01:08:48.940" style="s2">really something because it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.230" end="01:08:50.679" style="s2">to shock a modern person with a visual</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.940" end="01:08:53.380" style="s2">image but Hieronymous Bosch will</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.679" end="01:08:55.330" style="s2">definitely do that and that&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.380" end="01:08:57.130" style="s2">representation of paradise there&#39;s some</p>

<p begin="01:09:00.190" end="01:09:06.369" style="s2">and there&#39;s Adam and Eve you know United</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.819" end="01:09:08.349" style="s2">by God so and there&#39;s one by peter paul</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.109" end="01:09:23.529" style="s2">landscape well white trees well we like</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.049" end="01:09:25.389" style="s2">fruit we lived in trees why not trees I</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.529" end="01:09:27.310" style="s2">mean even modern people have very</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.389" end="01:09:28.690" style="s2">powerful tendency to think about trees</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.310" end="01:09:31.330" style="s2">as sacred you wouldn&#39;t get</p>

<p begin="01:09:35.739" end="01:09:40.960" style="s2">sense within us that they&#39;re sacred</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.540" end="01:09:43.179" style="s2">whatever that means well trees are our</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.960" end="01:09:47.259" style="s2">home well that&#39;s as close to sacred as</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.179" end="01:09:50.170" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get so ok so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.259" end="01:09:54.699" style="s2">read you something from the book of Job</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.170" end="01:09:56.230" style="s2">and this is God harassing job so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.699" end="01:09:57.639" style="s2">know if you know the story of job but</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.230" end="01:09:59.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting story and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.639" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">basically what happens with job is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.550" end="01:10:04.239" style="s2">God and the devil have a bat which seems</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:07.960" style="s2">a little you know on the unreasonable</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.239" end="01:10:10.060" style="s2">side for God but</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.960" end="01:10:13.060" style="s2">he gets to do whatever he wants so he</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.060" end="01:10:16.780" style="s2">hasn&#39;t bet with Satan roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.060" end="01:10:18.550" style="s2">and says he says well job</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.780" end="01:10:20.920" style="s2">he tells Satan that job is a good guy</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.550" end="01:10:23.380" style="s2">and that he&#39;s faithful to God and Satan</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.920" end="01:10:25.060" style="s2">says yeah let me let me out him for a</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.380" end="01:10:27.580" style="s2">while I betcha we can do something about</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.060" end="01:10:30.010" style="s2">that and God says roughly speaking no</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.580" end="01:10:32.320" style="s2">you could touch him all you want he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.010" end="01:10:33.850" style="s2">gonna stay faithful and and and Satan</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.320" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">says well we&#39;ll have a bet on that and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.850" end="01:10:38.200" style="s2">so God hands him over and what happens</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:39.940" style="s2">to job it&#39;s like everything terrible</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.200" end="01:10:45.010" style="s2">that you can imagine then happens to job</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.940" end="01:10:48.820" style="s2">right his his all his family dies all</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.010" end="01:10:50.680" style="s2">his possessions are destroyed he gets a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.820" end="01:10:52.090" style="s2">horrible skin disease and so then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.680" end="01:10:53.890" style="s2">sitting there by the fire sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.090" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">scraping himself with bits of broken</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.890" end="01:10:58.150" style="s2">pots and all his friends come around and</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:10:59.710" style="s2">tell him that the reason all this</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.150" end="01:11:00.100" style="s2">happened to him was because he deserved</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.710" end="01:11:02.020" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.100" end="01:11:03.910" style="s2">so it&#39;s perfect right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.020" end="01:11:05.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like an ultimate suffering story</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.910" end="01:11:07.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a precursor to the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.650" end="01:11:11.739" style="s2">crucifix that&#39;s one way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.000" end="01:11:14.320" style="s2">about it so and Joe has a chat with God</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.739" end="01:11:17.410" style="s2">and asked some like Cain did roughly</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.320" end="01:11:19.090" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and God attempts to he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.410" end="01:11:21.489" style="s2">irritated that job would even dare to</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.090" end="01:11:22.900" style="s2">question him it&#39;s like he&#39;s God it gets</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.489" end="01:11:25.090" style="s2">to do whatever he wants it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.900" end="01:11:28.450" style="s2">strange book anyways this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.090" end="01:11:30.820" style="s2">things that God says to job well God is</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.450" end="01:11:32.650" style="s2">trying to justify himself I would say to</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.820" end="01:11:37.180" style="s2">job and it&#39;s the reason I&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.650" end="01:11:39.250" style="s2">this you see is because so imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.180" end="01:11:40.960" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to analyze a literary work</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.250" end="01:11:43.530" style="s2">you might say well where&#39;s the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.960" end="01:11:48.100" style="s2">in the literary work and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.530" end="01:11:51.010" style="s2">it&#39;s in the words word by word it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.100" end="01:11:53.260" style="s2">the phrases it&#39;s in the sentences it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.010" end="01:11:55.150" style="s2">in the relationship of the sentences to</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.260" end="01:11:57.219" style="s2">each other it&#39;s in the relationship of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.150" end="01:11:58.719" style="s2">the sentences within paragraphs it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.219" end="01:12:01.810" style="s2">the relationship of the paragraphs</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.719" end="01:12:03.580" style="s2">within the contexts of the chapters and</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.810" end="01:12:05.500" style="s2">it&#39;s in the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.580" end="01:12:08.290" style="s2">chapters and the whole book and then the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.500" end="01:12:10.660" style="s2">book in the whole culture so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.290" end="01:12:11.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy to localize the meaning it</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.660" end="01:12:13.780" style="s2">exists at all those levels</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.710" end="01:12:15.820" style="s2">simultaneously and they all inform one</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.780" end="01:12:17.739" style="s2">another and what that means and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.820" end="01:12:19.150" style="s2">even worse in a book like the Bible I</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.739" end="01:12:21.710" style="s2">want to show you a picture this is an</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.150" end="01:12:25.140" style="s2">amazing picture</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.710" end="01:12:26.940" style="s2">so let me tell you what this is so the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.140" end="01:12:28.650" style="s2">Bible is the world&#39;s first hyperlinked</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.940" end="01:12:31.650" style="s2">document that&#39;s a good way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.650" end="01:12:34.860" style="s2">about it so what you have here so what</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.650" end="01:12:36.780" style="s2">you see at the bottom there&#39;s a line</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.860" end="01:12:39.330" style="s2">along the bottom and then there&#39;s small</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.780" end="01:12:42.570" style="s2">lines coming down from it okay each of</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.330" end="01:12:46.650" style="s2">those the line has dots on at each jot</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.570" end="01:12:48.450" style="s2">is a is a verse okay and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.650" end="01:12:49.560" style="s2">line associated with the verse that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.450" end="01:12:52.110" style="s2">varying length and the length</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.560" end="01:12:54.300" style="s2">corresponds to how many times that verse</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.110" end="01:12:57.960" style="s2">is cross-reference somewhere else in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.300" end="01:13:02.340" style="s2">document and then these rainbow-colored</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.960" end="01:13:03.810" style="s2">lines are the cross references so now</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.340" end="01:13:05.450" style="s2">that&#39;s really worth thinking about so</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.810" end="01:13:08.490" style="s2">then you think well that book is deep</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.450" end="01:13:10.320" style="s2">well why is it deep well it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.490" end="01:13:12.000" style="s2">every single thing in it refers to every</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.320" end="01:13:13.410" style="s2">other thing it&#39;s connected like your</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.000" end="01:13:15.540" style="s2">brain is connected like it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.410" end="01:13:17.220" style="s2">linear document and the really the thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.540" end="01:13:19.530" style="s2">is a book is a very strange thing right</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.220" end="01:13:22.230" style="s2">because when you or even a story because</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.530" end="01:13:24.180" style="s2">when you lay out the story in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.230" end="01:13:25.920" style="s2">you&#39;re like god you&#39;re outside of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.180" end="01:13:28.320" style="s2">space and time of the story</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.920" end="01:13:30.510" style="s2">and so you can adjust the end to make</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.320" end="01:13:31.830" style="s2">the beginning different you know how if</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.510" end="01:13:33.570" style="s2">you watch a movie and then it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.830" end="01:13:34.890" style="s2">surprise ending it changes the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.570" end="01:13:36.870" style="s2">you thought the beginning was one thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.890" end="01:13:38.340" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t it&#39;s something else well</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.870" end="01:13:40.830" style="s2">when you lay out a story you can fiddle</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.340" end="01:13:44.190" style="s2">with the story anywhere in the story and</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.830" end="01:13:46.350" style="s2">so and you can also make something that</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.190" end="01:13:48.660" style="s2">happens before dependent on something</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.350" end="01:13:50.280" style="s2">that happens after which is very strange</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.660" end="01:13:51.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s happened with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.280" end="01:13:53.460" style="s2">Bible because people have worked on it</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.810" end="01:13:55.500" style="s2">worked on it worked on it worked on it</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.460" end="01:13:57.540" style="s2">trying to synthesize it and make it</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.500" end="01:13:58.800" style="s2">coherent and make it make sense and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.540" end="01:14:00.540" style="s2">they&#39;re continually connecting</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.800" end="01:14:02.550" style="s2">everything that&#39;s inside of it to</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.540" end="01:14:05.850" style="s2">everything else and so you end up with a</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.550" end="01:14:07.800" style="s2">document map that looks like that so now</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.850" end="01:14:09.540" style="s2">so you think about that everything is</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.800" end="01:14:11.940" style="s2">connected to everything in that document</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.540" end="01:14:13.470" style="s2">not chaotically but meaningfully just</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.940" end="01:14:15.060" style="s2">like your brain is connected in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.470" end="01:14:17.070" style="s2">meaningful way it&#39;s not everything isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.060" end="01:14:19.110" style="s2">connected to everything it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.070" end="01:14:22.410" style="s2">in a meaningful way and then you think</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.110" end="01:14:23.880" style="s2">well where what do the stories mean and</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.410" end="01:14:25.650" style="s2">then the answer is well that&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.880" end="01:14:27.300" style="s2">question because all of them are</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.650" end="01:14:28.860" style="s2">connected with each other and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.300" end="01:14:30.540" style="s2">there&#39;s all these different levels of</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.860" end="01:14:32.520" style="s2">analysis and so you can pull out</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.540" end="01:14:34.260" style="s2">meanings at one level of analysis that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.520" end="01:14:36.269" style="s2">aren&#39;t self-evident at another</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.260" end="01:14:37.769" style="s2">level of analysis just like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.269" end="01:14:39.449" style="s2">listening to a complex piece of</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.769" end="01:14:41.250" style="s2">symphonic music you can follow a</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.449" end="01:14:43.050" style="s2">bassline or you can follow the strings</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.250" end="01:14:45.420" style="s2">or you can follow the horns and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.050" end="01:14:48.989" style="s2">all harmoniously interrelated but</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.420" end="01:14:51.420" style="s2">they&#39;re also separable okay so there is</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.989" end="01:14:53.730" style="s2">an image that lurks in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.420" end="01:14:56.250" style="s2">and the image is the same image it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.730" end="01:14:59.070" style="s2">roughly the same image as the image of</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.250" end="01:15:02.820" style="s2">Marduk confronting Tiamat so for example</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.070" end="01:15:05.610" style="s2">at the at the beginning God makes here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.820" end="01:15:08.309" style="s2">here&#39;s how the beginning goes in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.610" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">beginning God created the heaven and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.309" end="01:15:12.960" style="s2">earth and the earth was without form and</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.280" end="01:15:15.030" style="s2">void and darkness was upon the face of</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.960" end="01:15:16.980" style="s2">the deep and the Spirit of God moved</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.030" end="01:15:18.420" style="s2">upon the face of the waters and God said</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.980" end="01:15:20.489" style="s2">let there be light and there was light</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.420" end="01:15:23.670" style="s2">okay so we got a look at the first few</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.489" end="01:15:26.670" style="s2">lines here so this is God justifying</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.670" end="01:15:29.039" style="s2">himself to job he says can you pull in</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.670" end="01:15:31.170" style="s2">Leviathan with a fishhook or tie down</p>

<p begin="01:16:04.039" end="01:16:11.150" style="s2">any hope of subduing it is false the</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.559" end="01:16:14.280" style="s2">mere sight of it is overpowering</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.150" end="01:16:17.400" style="s2">no one is fierce enough to rouse it who</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.280" end="01:16:19.170" style="s2">is then able to stand against me who has</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.400" end="01:16:23.449" style="s2">a claim against me that I must pay</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.840" end="01:19:26.980" style="s2">is because and the earth was what</p>

<p begin="01:19:26.980" end="01:19:30.040" style="s2">upon the face of the deep</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.480" end="01:19:40.450" style="s2">let me tell you a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.040" end="01:19:44.650" style="s2">those lines before God&#39;s God begins to</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.450" end="01:19:47.440" style="s2">create the world is Tohu Wabo who that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.650" end="01:19:50.440" style="s2">from the Hebrew the word Tohu by itself</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.440" end="01:19:52.240" style="s2">means emptiness or futility so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.440" end="01:19:54.850" style="s2">psychological element to that a-and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.240" end="01:19:56.200" style="s2">emptiness or futility in some sense is</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.850" end="01:19:59.350" style="s2">what you confront when you&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="01:20:10.330" end="01:20:15.130" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s the idea in the first</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.490" end="01:20:16.960" style="s2">verses that this initial chaos is being</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.130" end="01:20:19.360" style="s2">ordered and the order is what makes the</p>

<p begin="01:20:19.360" end="01:20:24.700" style="s2">cosmology order emerges out of chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.900" end="01:20:27.180" style="s2">the thing that makes it emerges the Word</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.700" end="01:20:30.010" style="s2">of God now</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.830" end="01:21:15.070" style="s2">are these allusions later saying job and</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.870" end="01:21:16.989" style="s2">in the Psalms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.070" end="01:21:18.820" style="s2">doing exactly that conquering a</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.989" end="01:21:20.380" style="s2">primordial monster and making the world</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.820" end="01:21:23.860" style="s2">out of its pieces well so what does that</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.380" end="01:21:27.159" style="s2">mean exactly well it means that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.860" end="01:21:28.869" style="s2">highest ordering principle is the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.159" end="01:21:31.659" style="s2">that goes out into the darkness or the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.869" end="01:21:33.849" style="s2">deep that encounters the dragon of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.659" end="01:21:36.429" style="s2">because of obviously Leviathan is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.849" end="01:21:38.469" style="s2">dragon and defeats it and feeds the</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.429" end="01:21:40.840" style="s2">people as a consequence while we are</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.469" end="01:21:42.460" style="s2">hunting creatures after all and in order</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.840" end="01:21:44.560" style="s2">to establish our place in the world we</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.460" end="01:21:45.940" style="s2">had to go out there and conquer the</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.560" end="01:21:48.540" style="s2">Dragons of the wilderness you might</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.940" end="01:21:51.070" style="s2">wonder why does it drag and breathe fire</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.540" end="01:21:52.170" style="s2">well there&#39;s a bunch of reasons as far</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.070" end="01:21:56.650" style="s2">as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.170" end="01:21:58.270" style="s2">fire is awe-inspiring so fire and a</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.650" end="01:22:00.340" style="s2">terrible predator are the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.270" end="01:22:01.420" style="s2">because they both inspire awe fire is</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.340" end="01:22:04.389" style="s2">transforming</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.420" end="01:22:06.310" style="s2">but credit like what&#39;s a good metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.389" end="01:22:08.349" style="s2">for being bitten by a poisonous snake</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.310" end="01:22:10.360" style="s2">well have you ever seen the wounds that</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.349" end="01:22:12.099" style="s2">a poisonous snake produces if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.360" end="01:22:14.500" style="s2">bitten by them it&#39;s like someone took</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.099" end="01:22:16.900" style="s2">your arm and incinerated it and so the</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.500" end="01:22:19.179" style="s2">idea that a snake has fiery breath is</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.900" end="01:22:22.210" style="s2">well let&#39;s call it close enough from a</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.179" end="01:22:24.849" style="s2">metaphorical perspective right now God</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.210" end="01:22:27.040" style="s2">is claiming to job that he&#39;s the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.849" end="01:22:28.989" style="s2">that Clee that clears the wilderness and</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.040" end="01:22:33.010" style="s2">then builds order out of chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.989" end="01:22:34.659" style="s2">because because because he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.010" end="01:22:37.960" style="s2">embodiment of that spirit in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.659" end="01:22:39.670" style="s2">job has no reason to ever question his</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.960" end="01:22:42.610" style="s2">moral decisions it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.670" end="01:22:44.860" style="s2">in the story of job but the point that</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.610" end="01:22:47.290" style="s2">that point will leave aside because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.860" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">a more complicated issue the point is</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.290" end="01:22:54.159" style="s2">that the writers of the Bible are trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:56.050" style="s2">to dream up a representation of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.159" end="01:22:57.340" style="s2">spirit of civilization that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.050" end="01:22:59.619" style="s2">way to think about it you can think of</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.340" end="01:23:01.750" style="s2">yahwah as the spirit of civilization and</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.619" end="01:23:03.310" style="s2">what is that well it&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.750" end="01:23:04.840" style="s2">encounters the wilderness and makes</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.310" end="01:23:07.090" style="s2">habitable order but then it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.840" end="01:23:08.530" style="s2">spirit of the order itself and that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.090" end="01:23:10.840" style="s2">think why in Christianity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.530" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">representation of God the Father because</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.840" end="01:23:15.909" style="s2">he&#39;s a representation of the the culture</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.360" end="01:23:17.619" style="s2">that&#39;s generated after the the chaos is</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.909" end="01:23:19.750" style="s2">ordered right you have the spirit that</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.619" end="01:23:21.520" style="s2">goes out into chaos and orders and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.750" end="01:23:23.230" style="s2">you have the spirit of the order and</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.520" end="01:23:25.210" style="s2">then the spirit of the order and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.230" end="01:23:26.920" style="s2">spirit of the ordering principle have to</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.210" end="01:23:28.329" style="s2">figure out how to coexist that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.920" end="01:23:28.809" style="s2">what the Egyptians were trying to figure</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.329" end="01:23:30.940" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.809" end="01:23:33.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a dynamic relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.940" end="01:23:35.110" style="s2">the culture and the spirit that</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.159" end="01:23:37.510" style="s2">generates the culture and then you might</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.110" end="01:23:39.699" style="s2">also ask should the culture be</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.510" end="01:23:41.920" style="s2">superordinate or should the spirit that</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.699" end="01:23:44.409" style="s2">generates the culture be superordinate</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.920" end="01:23:46.510" style="s2">and the answer seems to be the emergent</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.409" end="01:23:47.770" style="s2">answer seems to be that the spirit that</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.510" end="01:23:49.750" style="s2">generates the culture should be</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.770" end="01:23:51.610" style="s2">superordinate to the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.750" end="01:23:53.980" style="s2">culture it&#39;s something like that and</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.610" end="01:23:56.920" style="s2">that&#39;s also why I think that one of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.980" end="01:24:00.099" style="s2">brilliant discoveries let&#39;s say of</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.920" end="01:24:02.469" style="s2">Western individualistic civilization is</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.099" end="01:24:04.599" style="s2">that the group is there to serve the</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.469" end="01:24:06.550" style="s2">individual because the individual is the</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.599" end="01:24:09.400" style="s2">thing that revivify is the group so with</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.550" end="01:24:11.110" style="s2">each depend on the other integrally but</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.400" end="01:24:13.090" style="s2">if you subordinate the individual to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.110" end="01:24:15.219" style="s2">group then the group stagnates and dies</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.090" end="01:24:17.199" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a very bad long-term</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.219" end="01:24:18.909" style="s2">strategy even though the group and</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.199" end="01:24:20.739" style="s2">belonging to the group is clearly</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.909" end="01:24:22.510" style="s2">necessary you need to uphold the values</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.739" end="01:24:24.849" style="s2">of the group but the values of the group</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.510" end="01:24:26.500" style="s2">should be subordinated to producing the</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.849" end="01:24:28.989" style="s2">individual who gives the group vision</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.500" end="01:24:30.489" style="s2">and the Mesopotamians figure that out</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.989" end="01:24:31.989" style="s2">the Egyptians figured that out we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.489" end="01:24:34.869" style="s2">figured it out we just don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.989" end="01:24:40.770" style="s2">we figured it out and it&#39;s not a mere</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.869" end="01:24:43.559" style="s2">arbitrary supposition all right so I</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.770" end="01:24:57.400" style="s2">should show you because this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.559" end="01:24:59.949" style="s2">interesting I think perhaps good I want</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.400" end="01:25:01.900" style="s2">to show you what the cosmology what</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.949" end="01:25:03.880" style="s2">people considered to cause the the the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.900" end="01:25:05.469" style="s2">the the structure of the initial order</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.880" end="01:25:07.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of interesting and God</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.469" end="01:25:08.380" style="s2">said let there be a firmament in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.000" end="01:25:09.789" style="s2">midst of the waters and let it divide</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.380" end="01:25:12.070" style="s2">the waters from the waters</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.789" end="01:25:13.449" style="s2">and God made the firmament and divided</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.070" end="01:25:14.710" style="s2">the waters which were under the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.449" end="01:25:16.750" style="s2">firmament from the waters which were</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.710" end="01:25:18.849" style="s2">above the firmament and it was so and</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.750" end="01:25:20.260" style="s2">God called the firmament heaven and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.849" end="01:25:20.409" style="s2">evening in the morning were the second</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.260" end="01:25:21.909" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.409" end="01:25:24.039" style="s2">well so what are they thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.909" end="01:25:25.690" style="s2">well that&#39;s the sort of classical view</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.039" end="01:25:29.920" style="s2">of the world it&#39;s something like that is</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.690" end="01:25:32.829" style="s2">that there&#39;s a disc that&#39;s the disc we</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.920" end="01:25:34.449" style="s2">inhabit and there&#39;s land that&#39;s the disc</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.829" end="01:25:35.770" style="s2">and under the disc there&#39;s water fresh</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.449" end="01:25:38.139" style="s2">water and then under that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.770" end="01:25:39.400" style="s2">ocean and then on top of that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.139" end="01:25:41.050" style="s2">dome and that&#39;s the sky</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.400" end="01:25:42.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the firmament that&#39;s heaven and</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.050" end="01:25:44.590" style="s2">there&#39;s water above that</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.400" end="01:25:46.150" style="s2">well obviously because it rains so there</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.590" end="01:25:48.640" style="s2">has to be water up there so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.150" end="01:25:51.570" style="s2">way the cosmos was conceptualized just</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.640" end="01:25:53.469" style="s2">so you know now it&#39;s a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.570" end="01:25:55.360" style="s2">conceptualization because that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.469" end="01:25:58.350" style="s2">looks like right and you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.360" end="01:26:01.150" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong it&#39;s like well yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.350" end="01:26:02.949" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong in a functional sort of way</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.150" end="01:26:05.620" style="s2">it&#39;s right from a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.949" end="01:26:07.360" style="s2">perspective but it&#39;s wrong from a all</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.620" end="01:26:08.969" style="s2">from a scientific perspective was never</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.360" end="01:26:11.530" style="s2">designed to be a scientific perspective</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.969" end="01:26:17.080" style="s2">so all right so we won&#39;t bother with</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.530" end="01:26:19.390" style="s2">this part will we&#39;ll start here so God</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.080" end="01:26:21.010" style="s2">makes animals and plants and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.390" end="01:26:29.860" style="s2">and then at the end of it this is on</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.010" end="01:26:32.199" style="s2">which day sixth day God said let us make</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.860" end="01:26:33.790" style="s2">man in our image after our likeness and</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.199" end="01:26:35.380" style="s2">let them have dominion over the fish of</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.790" end="01:26:36.940" style="s2">the sea and the fowl of the air and over</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.380" end="01:26:39.040" style="s2">the cattle and all of the earth and over</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.940" end="01:26:39.730" style="s2">every creeping thing that creepeth upon</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.040" end="01:26:41.230" style="s2">the earth</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.730" end="01:26:43.960" style="s2">okay well the relevant there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.230" end="01:26:46.060" style="s2">relevant issues there one is let us make</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.960" end="01:26:48.159" style="s2">man in our image after our likeness well</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.060" end="01:26:51.250" style="s2">what exactly does that mean well we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.159" end="01:26:53.850" style="s2">already we&#39;ve already encountered that</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.250" end="01:26:56.560" style="s2">to some degree we&#39;ve already encountered</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.850" end="01:27:00.010" style="s2">what the nature of the Spirit of God is</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.560" end="01:27:01.510" style="s2">in this story the nature of the Spirit</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.010" end="01:27:03.520" style="s2">of God that creates order out of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.510" end="01:27:06.219" style="s2">is the thing that creates order out of</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.520" end="01:27:08.469" style="s2">chaos and so that the statement here is</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.219" end="01:27:13.750" style="s2">that there&#39;s something about human</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.469" end="01:27:16.030" style="s2">beings that partakes in that now when I</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.750" end="01:27:17.409" style="s2">started unpacking this I thought okay</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.030" end="01:27:18.640" style="s2">look there&#39;s an idea</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.409" end="01:27:21.400" style="s2">that&#39;s at the root of our legal system</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.640" end="01:27:24.489" style="s2">and so our legal system is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.400" end="01:27:27.100" style="s2">articulation of the patterns by which we</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.489" end="01:27:28.449" style="s2">live and to a fair degree it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.100" end="01:27:29.980" style="s2">evolved system it&#39;s a culturally</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.449" end="01:27:31.780" style="s2">constructed system but it&#39;s an evolved</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.980" end="01:27:33.520" style="s2">system as well and it&#39;s predicated on</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.780" end="01:27:35.320" style="s2">the idea that there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.520" end="01:27:37.960" style="s2">the individual that the law has to</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.320" end="01:27:40.330" style="s2">respect well so the question is well is</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.960" end="01:27:42.730" style="s2">that just an arbitrary supposition</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.330" end="01:27:44.710" style="s2">because that&#39;s really the question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.730" end="01:27:47.110" style="s2">the same question as is Western</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.710" end="01:27:48.820" style="s2">civilization founded on something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.110" end="01:27:50.590" style="s2">a rock or is it just founded on</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.820" end="01:27:52.060" style="s2">something that&#39;s an opinion well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.590" end="01:27:53.830" style="s2">the same question with regards to the</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.060" end="01:27:55.449" style="s2">law the law assumes that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.830" end="01:27:56.530" style="s2">something about you that&#39;s sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.449" end="01:27:58.720" style="s2">even if</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.530" end="01:28:01.180" style="s2">you&#39;re a murderer you have inalienable</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.720" end="01:28:03.520" style="s2">rights now you think that is a bloody</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.180" end="01:28:05.860" style="s2">weird thing for any sort of system to</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.520" end="01:28:08.940" style="s2">have come up with because the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.860" end="01:28:12.010" style="s2">if you&#39;re the ultimate in malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.940" end="01:28:13.960" style="s2">transgressors that you still have some</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.010" end="01:28:16.180" style="s2">sort of sovereign value it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.960" end="01:28:18.220" style="s2">is such an unlikely thing for people to</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.180" end="01:28:19.690" style="s2">think up that you really have to think a</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.220" end="01:28:22.270" style="s2">long time about how that might have come</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.690" end="01:28:24.310" style="s2">to be well there&#39;s an idea here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.270" end="01:28:27.100" style="s2">the idea is that there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.310" end="01:28:28.870" style="s2">human beings men and women you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.100" end="01:28:30.610" style="s2">because people often complain about the</p>

<p begin="01:28:30.610" end="01:28:33.940" style="s2">based on a misapprehension of</p>

<p begin="01:29:02.680" end="01:29:06.850" style="s2">made things a lot easier and that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.570" end="01:29:08.890" style="s2">what happened so both men and women have</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.850" end="01:29:10.300" style="s2">this image and what&#39;s the image well</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.890" end="01:29:13.300" style="s2">that&#39;s the image of the thing that can</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.300" end="01:29:16.620" style="s2">order chaos and so it&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.300" end="01:29:19.060" style="s2">treat you as if you have intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.620" end="01:29:20.980" style="s2">because the fact that you can partake in</p>

<p begin="01:29:20.980" end="01:29:26.200" style="s2">and chaos means that you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.350" end="01:29:29.350" style="s2">the salvation of society that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.200" end="01:29:32.170" style="s2">means and so society can&#39;t impose on you</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.350" end="01:29:35.890" style="s2">to to greater degree because you are too</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.170" end="01:29:38.800" style="s2">valuable for even the law to push</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.890" end="01:29:40.780" style="s2">arbitrarily past a certain point now</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.800" end="01:29:43.120" style="s2">then you have to think this and this is</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.780" end="01:29:45.280" style="s2">this is this is where you really have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.120" end="01:29:48.880" style="s2">think about what you believe do you</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.280" end="01:29:50.650" style="s2">believe that or not because there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.880" end="01:29:52.000" style="s2">much difference really technically</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.650" end="01:29:55.030" style="s2">speaking there&#39;s not much difference</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.000" end="01:29:56.740" style="s2">than that between that and believing</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.030" end="01:29:58.000" style="s2">these stories it depends bloody well</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.740" end="01:29:59.950" style="s2">what you mean by believe they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.000" end="01:30:02.050" style="s2">scientific representations of an</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.950" end="01:30:03.130" style="s2">evolutionary process obviously the</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.050" end="01:30:05.170" style="s2">people who came up with them words</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.130" end="01:30:06.760" style="s2">scientists so whatever they are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.170" end="01:30:08.920" style="s2">not that but they&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.760" end="01:30:10.360" style="s2">proposition that&#39;s not an accidental</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.920" end="01:30:11.889" style="s2">proposition and we</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.360" end="01:30:13.600" style="s2">that partly because it&#39;s rooted so</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.889" end="01:30:15.610" style="s2">deeply in these ancient stories we have</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.600" end="01:30:17.619" style="s2">no idea how old the Mesopotamian story</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.610" end="01:30:21.369" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s the oldest story we</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.619" end="01:30:23.739" style="s2">have in written form so we know that but</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.369" end="01:30:25.300" style="s2">god only knows how old it is it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.739" end="01:30:29.850" style="s2">of an oral tradition and these oral</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.300" end="01:30:34.389" style="s2">traditions can be look the same</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.850" end="01:30:36.580" style="s2">Carver gave me a big thing called a sea</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.389" end="01:30:39.070" style="s2">suit and it&#39;s a man in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.580" end="01:30:41.110" style="s2">double headed sea serpent right so there</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.070" end="01:30:43.780" style="s2">there that&#39;s 14,000 years old that came</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.110" end="01:30:45.219" style="s2">from Siberia it&#39;s the same bloody idea</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.780" end="01:30:48.670" style="s2">it&#39;s the same idea</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.219" end="01:30:51.639" style="s2">so these ideas aren&#39;t arbitrary so the</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.670" end="01:30:54.040" style="s2">question is well are they true well then</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.639" end="01:30:56.710" style="s2">the question is what the hell do you</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.040" end="01:30:59.949" style="s2">mean by true because it comes down to</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.710" end="01:31:02.170" style="s2">that is it true that habitable order is</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.949" end="01:31:04.510" style="s2">dependent on the spirit that moves into</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.170" end="01:31:06.460" style="s2">the unknown and takes the Leviathan and</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.510" end="01:31:08.260" style="s2">chops it into pieces and distributes it</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.460" end="01:31:11.139" style="s2">and the answer to that is yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.260" end="01:31:13.630" style="s2">true as far as I can tell and do you</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.139" end="01:31:15.670" style="s2">mean is it literally true well it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.630" end="01:31:17.619" style="s2">true as things get that&#39;s how we got</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.670" end="01:31:19.780" style="s2">here we got here because people went</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.619" end="01:31:22.389" style="s2">into the unknown they conquered what was</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.780" end="01:31:24.489" style="s2">out there they took what was of utility</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.389" end="01:31:26.320" style="s2">from that they brought it back and they</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.489" end="01:31:28.179" style="s2">shared it with the community that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.320" end="01:31:30.070" style="s2">we&#39;re here that is the central story of</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.179" end="01:31:32.619" style="s2">humankind and that&#39;s still what we do</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.070" end="01:31:36.550" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not exactly necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.619" end="01:31:38.110" style="s2">going out to conquer an embodied monster</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.550" end="01:31:40.360" style="s2">although we do that if we hunt for</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.110" end="01:31:41.830" style="s2">example but you know most of us don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.360" end="01:31:43.480" style="s2">that anymore but to the degree that</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.830" end="01:31:45.100" style="s2">you&#39;re an explorer in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.480" end="01:31:47.139" style="s2">intellectual realm you&#39;re still going</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.100" end="01:31:49.179" style="s2">out into the unknown and conquering</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.139" end="01:31:51.580" style="s2">what&#39;s out there looming like maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.179" end="01:31:53.290" style="s2">it&#39;s the cure for a disease you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.580" end="01:31:55.060" style="s2">looking that right in the face you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.290" end="01:31:57.040" style="s2">trying to decompose it and break it into</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.060" end="01:31:58.239" style="s2">its parts you&#39;re trying to understand</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.040" end="01:32:00.670" style="s2">and then you&#39;re trying to tell everybody</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.239" end="01:32:01.960" style="s2">what you found well and everybody Pat&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.670" end="01:32:04.210" style="s2">you on the back and says well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.960" end="01:32:06.730" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re a brave Explorer of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.210" end="01:32:08.650" style="s2">unknown well that is exactly the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.730" end="01:32:11.219" style="s2">thing that we should be fostering and</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.650" end="01:32:14.500" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that we all admire so</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.219" end="01:32:19.659" style="s2">okay so that happens on the sixth day</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.500" end="01:32:21.429" style="s2">and so now we know human beings are made</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.659" end="01:32:23.639" style="s2">in God&#39;s image well what does that mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.429" end="01:32:23.639" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.969" end="01:32:29.429" style="s2">I think I think what it means a</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.789" end="01:32:30.929" style="s2">reasonable way of thinking about it you</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.429" end="01:32:32.489" style="s2">can think about it like the genie the</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.929" end="01:32:34.229" style="s2">genie has this tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.489" end="01:32:36.960" style="s2">power that&#39;s constrained in a very small</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.229" end="01:32:39.929" style="s2">space and genie and genius are the same</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.960" end="01:32:41.880" style="s2">word roughly speaking so the genius is</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.929" end="01:32:44.550" style="s2">that your genius is the genie that</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.880" end="01:32:46.860" style="s2">inhabits you right it&#39;s this logo spirit</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.550" end="01:32:49.889" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s put in a very small</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.860" end="01:32:52.289" style="s2">container you see that idea represented</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.889" end="01:32:53.880" style="s2">in the Christian conception of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.289" end="01:32:56.130" style="s2">relationship between Christ and God</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.880" end="01:32:58.349" style="s2">because there&#39;s an idea that God had to</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.130" end="01:32:59.940" style="s2">empty himself out in order to fit into</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.349" end="01:33:01.979" style="s2">the body of Christ it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.940" end="01:33:04.409" style="s2">that they call that kenosis that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.979" end="01:33:07.409" style="s2">technical word and what it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.409" end="01:33:09.840" style="s2">the idea that you&#39;re a looks like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.409" end="01:33:12.090" style="s2">a low-resolution representation of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.840" end="01:33:13.860" style="s2">ultimate spirit that that encounters the</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.090" end="01:33:15.989" style="s2">unknown it&#39;s something like that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.860" end="01:33:17.489" style="s2">very smart idea and you could say maybe</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.989" end="01:33:19.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what human beings have in common</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.489" end="01:33:21.989" style="s2">is that that that we reach an embodiment</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.679" end="01:33:26.550" style="s2">of that spirit for lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.989" end="01:33:29.699" style="s2">so okay so then God makes the God makes</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.550" end="01:33:32.610" style="s2">human beings male and female makes them</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.699" end="01:33:34.079" style="s2">in his own image and is happy about them</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.610" end="01:33:36.690" style="s2">and says well you&#39;re gonna dominate the</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.079" end="01:33:39.510" style="s2">world which you know people like David</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.690" end="01:33:41.519" style="s2">Suzuki read that to say you should go</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.510" end="01:33:42.960" style="s2">out and dominate the world because they</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.519" end="01:33:44.940" style="s2">read that kind of patriarchal oppression</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.960" end="01:33:47.190" style="s2">into the text but this is more a</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.940" end="01:33:48.960" style="s2">description of how things are going to</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.190" end="01:33:52.829" style="s2">be then whether or not they should be</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.960" end="01:33:57.150" style="s2">that way so anyways that&#39;s the sixth day</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.829" end="01:33:58.889" style="s2">the seventh day God rests right so</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.150" end="01:34:03.499" style="s2">that&#39;s the origin of the week roughly</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.889" end="01:34:06.389" style="s2">speaking so okay that&#39;s one story</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.499" end="01:34:08.940" style="s2">there&#39;s two creation stories in Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.389" end="01:34:11.190" style="s2">and they actually don&#39;t match completely</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.940" end="01:34:13.110" style="s2">in their structure and what happened was</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.190" end="01:34:14.340" style="s2">someone they call the redactor maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.110" end="01:34:16.619" style="s2">was a bunch of people we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.340" end="01:34:18.239" style="s2">took creation story one and creation</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.619" end="01:34:19.800" style="s2">story two from different places and</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.239" end="01:34:21.659" style="s2">thought well these are sort of the same</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.800" end="01:34:23.340" style="s2">and they&#39;re sort of different and people</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.659" end="01:34:24.449" style="s2">are going to be unhappy if we dispense</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.340" end="01:34:26.429" style="s2">with this one and they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.449" end="01:34:28.499" style="s2">unhappy if we dispense this this one but</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.429" end="01:34:29.940" style="s2">they don&#39;t make sense together so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.499" end="01:34:32.309" style="s2">see if we can put them in some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.940" end="01:34:33.809" style="s2">order that makes a proximate sense and</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.309" end="01:34:36.749" style="s2">they took the newer one and put it</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.809" end="01:34:37.570" style="s2">second and took the sorry they took the</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.749" end="01:34:39.520" style="s2">older one</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.570" end="01:34:41.770" style="s2">at second and put took the newer one and</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.520" end="01:34:43.179" style="s2">put it first so Adam and Eve is an older</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.770" end="01:34:45.699" style="s2">story than the story that I just told</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.179" end="01:34:47.079" style="s2">you so but it&#39;s a different story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.699" end="01:34:50.739" style="s2">written in a different style but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.079" end="01:34:54.250" style="s2">been more or less brought into narrative</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.739" end="01:34:55.750" style="s2">coherence with the first story so and</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.250" end="01:34:58.270" style="s2">you could say at the level of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.750" end="01:35:00.250" style="s2">sentence there is paradoxes but at the</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.270" end="01:35:01.329" style="s2">level of the chapter let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.250" end="01:35:04.570" style="s2">stories make sense</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.329" end="01:35:06.790" style="s2">so okay so what happens up there went</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.570" end="01:35:08.290" style="s2">from the earth amidst and it watered the</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.790" end="01:35:10.000" style="s2">whole face of the ground and the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.290" end="01:35:11.679" style="s2">God formed man of the dust of the ground</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.000" end="01:35:13.690" style="s2">and breathed into his nostrils the</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.679" end="01:35:16.270" style="s2">breath of life and man became a living</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.690" end="01:35:17.710" style="s2">soul there&#39;s an identity in this archaic</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.270" end="01:35:20.520" style="s2">sort of thought between breath and</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.710" end="01:35:24.070" style="s2">spirit right respiration spirit</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.520" end="01:35:27.010" style="s2">inspiration spirit NUMA like pneumatic</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.070" end="01:35:28.989" style="s2">tire spirit the breath contains the</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.010" end="01:35:31.210" style="s2">spirit well why is that well because</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.989" end="01:35:33.040" style="s2">when people died the breath leaves their</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.210" end="01:35:35.079" style="s2">body and so it&#39;s an easy thing to</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.040" end="01:35:38.340" style="s2">identify that with the animating spirit</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.079" end="01:35:41.770" style="s2">right now anima means spirit as well so</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.340" end="01:35:43.780" style="s2">so that&#39;s the phenomenological reality</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.770" end="01:35:45.790" style="s2">of the story and Lord God planted a</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.780" end="01:35:48.190" style="s2">garden eastward in Eden and there he put</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.790" end="01:35:51.790" style="s2">the man whom he had formed Eden means</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.190" end="01:35:53.380" style="s2">well watered place well why well where</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.790" end="01:35:54.849" style="s2">do you want to live these are desert</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.380" end="01:35:56.409" style="s2">people right who are writing this well</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.849" end="01:35:58.329" style="s2">what do they want they want an oasis</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.409" end="01:35:59.860" style="s2">what&#39;s a know what&#39;s an oasis it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.329" end="01:36:01.389" style="s2">garden with water well you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.860" end="01:36:03.099" style="s2">gonna live somewhere it&#39;s not gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.389" end="01:36:05.320" style="s2">out in the middle of the damn desert you</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.099" end="01:36:06.820" style="s2">want to be in a garden that&#39;s watered</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.320" end="01:36:08.710" style="s2">and then you could say you also be in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.820" end="01:36:10.329" style="s2">walled garden that&#39;s protected and</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.710" end="01:36:13.210" style="s2">that&#39;s what paradise means Paradiso</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.329" end="01:36:15.869" style="s2">means walled garden so this initial</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.210" end="01:36:19.840" style="s2">paradise is a walled garden why walled</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.869" end="01:36:21.849" style="s2">order it&#39;s culture nature what does it</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.840" end="01:36:25.119" style="s2">mean well that&#39;s the natural environment</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.849" end="01:36:27.010" style="s2">of human beings it&#39;s a it&#39;s the optimal</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.119" end="01:36:28.840" style="s2">balance between culture and nature</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.010" end="01:36:32.050" style="s2">that&#39;s what a walled garden is with</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.840" end="01:36:34.090" style="s2">enough water flowing in it to keep it to</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.050" end="01:36:36.849" style="s2">keep it fertile and that water is also</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.090" end="01:36:39.340" style="s2">chaos right there has to be it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.849" end="01:36:41.320" style="s2">static and dry and solid and stale there</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.340" end="01:36:44.290" style="s2">has to be some living element to it so</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.320" end="01:36:49.659" style="s2">so it&#39;s a walled place that the water</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.290" end="01:36:51.429" style="s2">can still fructify and out of the ground</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.659" end="01:36:52.809" style="s2">made the Lord God to grow</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.429" end="01:36:54.699" style="s2">every tree that is pleasant to the sight</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.809" end="01:36:57.489" style="s2">so it&#39;s also full of trees this is our</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.699" end="01:36:59.619" style="s2">natural habitat and good for food The</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.489" end="01:37:00.969" style="s2">Tree of Life also in the midst of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.619" end="01:37:02.739" style="s2">garden and the tree of the knowledge of</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.969" end="01:37:04.749" style="s2">good and evil so these are two trees</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.739" end="01:37:06.579" style="s2">they bring forth fruit that produce</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.749" end="01:37:08.409" style="s2">something one produces the knowledge of</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.579" end="01:37:09.459" style="s2">good and evil and the other produces</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.409" end="01:37:14.739" style="s2">eternal life</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.459" end="01:37:16.300" style="s2">so why well I&#39;ll get to that Amit and a</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.739" end="01:37:17.860" style="s2">river went out of Eden to water the</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.300" end="01:37:21.489" style="s2">garden and from thence it was parted and</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.860" end="01:37:22.179" style="s2">became into four heads we won&#39;t bother</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.489" end="01:37:24.340" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.179" end="01:37:26.170" style="s2">so now God is having a little chat</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.340" end="01:37:28.659" style="s2">without him and he says look you can eat</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.170" end="01:37:30.249" style="s2">every tree of the garden except one of</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.659" end="01:37:32.800" style="s2">the tree of the knowledge of good and</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.249" end="01:37:35.320" style="s2">evil you you don&#39;t eat that because in</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.800" end="01:37:37.989" style="s2">the day you eat you&#39;ll surely die</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.320" end="01:37:40.150" style="s2">so you might ask well why is the tree</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.989" end="01:37:42.249" style="s2">put there to begin with and well the</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.150" end="01:37:44.229" style="s2">answer to that is who the hell knows</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.249" end="01:37:49.209" style="s2">that&#39;s how the story portrays it we</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.229" end="01:37:51.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know and the Lord God said it is</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.209" end="01:37:53.079" style="s2">not good that the man should be alone I</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.070" end="01:37:54.550" style="s2">will make help meet for him and out of</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.079" end="01:37:56.289" style="s2">the ground the Lord God formed every</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.550" end="01:37:58.360" style="s2">beast of the field in every fall of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.289" end="01:37:59.920" style="s2">air and brought them unto Adam to see</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.360" end="01:38:01.510" style="s2">what he would call them and whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.920" end="01:38:03.610" style="s2">Adam called every living creature that</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.510" end="01:38:05.530" style="s2">was the name thereof so that&#39;s an echo</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.610" end="01:38:07.329" style="s2">of the idea of the power of the word</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.530" end="01:38:08.860" style="s2">right so even though these stories are</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.329" end="01:38:10.840" style="s2">from different traditions their separate</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.860" end="01:38:13.780" style="s2">traditions you see at the beginning that</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.840" end="01:38:15.969" style="s2">God uses his word to bring order out of</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.780" end="01:38:17.499" style="s2">chaos and then he allows Adam in some</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.969" end="01:38:20.949" style="s2">sense to do the same thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.499" end="01:38:23.139" style="s2">there&#39;s this unarticulated plethora of</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.949" end="01:38:25.689" style="s2">being and the man comes along and says</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.139" end="01:38:27.610" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s that that&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.689" end="01:38:29.349" style="s2">that brings them into a higher order</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.610" end="01:38:31.809" style="s2">form of being so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.349" end="01:38:35.019" style="s2">replication of the creation in a in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.809" end="01:38:37.119" style="s2">shrunken form and Adam gave names to all</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.019" end="01:38:39.369" style="s2">the cattle cattle are just anything that</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.119" end="01:38:40.780" style="s2">has four legs roughly speaking and to</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.369" end="01:38:42.760" style="s2">the fowl of the air and to every beast</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.780" end="01:38:45.550" style="s2">of the field but for Adam there was not</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.760" end="01:38:47.349" style="s2">found to help meet for him and the goat</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.550" end="01:38:48.999" style="s2">Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.349" end="01:38:50.349" style="s2">upon Adam and he slept and he took one</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.999" end="01:38:53.199" style="s2">of his ribs and closed up the flesh</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.349" end="01:38:55.059" style="s2">instead thereof and the rib which the</p>

<p begin="01:38:55.059" end="01:38:58.599" style="s2">woman and brought her unto the man and</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.650" end="01:39:00.429" style="s2">Adam said this is now bone of my bones</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.599" end="01:39:02.170" style="s2">and flesh of my flesh she shall be</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.429" end="01:39:04.960" style="s2">called woman because she was taken out</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.170" end="01:39:06.400" style="s2">of man and then there&#39;s an injunction</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.960" end="01:39:08.350" style="s2">therefore a man shall leave his father</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.400" end="01:39:10.360" style="s2">and his mother and shall cleave unto his</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.350" end="01:39:11.890" style="s2">wife and they shall be one flesh while</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.360" end="01:39:13.750" style="s2">there&#39;s also a there&#39;s a moral</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.890" end="01:39:16.390" style="s2">injunction there and so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.750" end="01:39:18.700" style="s2">the two beings that have been created or</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.390" end="01:39:20.650" style="s2">actually not whole until they&#39;re one</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.700" end="01:39:22.330" style="s2">thing right and once they&#39;re joined</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.650" end="01:39:24.730" style="s2">together that&#39;s supposed to be one thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.330" end="01:39:27.489" style="s2">and that one thing is actually a more</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.730" end="01:39:30.580" style="s2">perfect entity than the two things that</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.489" end="01:39:33.300" style="s2">are apart so and that&#39;s actually part of</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.580" end="01:39:36.190" style="s2">the sacred basis of the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.300" end="01:39:38.200" style="s2">monogamous relationships in Western</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.190" end="01:39:40.260" style="s2">culture and they were both naked the man</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.200" end="01:39:43.180" style="s2">and his wife and we&#39;re not ashamed a</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.260" end="01:39:46.050" style="s2">crucial piece of information so what</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.180" end="01:39:46.050" style="s2">exactly does that mean</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.920" end="01:39:52.870" style="s2">well the first question is what does it</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.360" end="01:39:55.300" style="s2">mean to be naked and so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.870" end="01:39:57.430" style="s2">that I thought about a lot in relation</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.300" end="01:40:01.870" style="s2">and there&#39;s a relationship there with</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.430" end="01:40:03.520" style="s2">shame so the first question is what does</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.870" end="01:40:05.710" style="s2">it mean to be naked and the second</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.520" end="01:40:08.320" style="s2">question is what does it mean to be not</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.710" end="01:40:10.960" style="s2">ashamed of that well there&#39;s an there is</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.320" end="01:40:14.080" style="s2">a I would say there&#39;s an implication of</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.960" end="01:40:16.750" style="s2">a kind of unconsciousness so Adam and</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.080" end="01:40:18.969" style="s2">Eve exists in this paradisal state but</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.750" end="01:40:20.890" style="s2">they they don&#39;t they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.969" end="01:40:23.350" style="s2">have the capacity for self-reflection</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.890" end="01:40:25.690" style="s2">there&#39;s no self-consciousness here well</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.350" end="01:40:26.500" style="s2">why would I say that because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.690" end="01:40:28.930" style="s2">very little difference between</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.500" end="01:40:31.270" style="s2">self-consciousness and shame in fact if</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.930" end="01:40:33.550" style="s2">you do psychometric analysis of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.270" end="01:40:36.250" style="s2">state of self-consciousness it loads</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.550" end="01:40:37.690" style="s2">with neuroticism so loads with anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.250" end="01:40:40.060" style="s2">and emotional pain so to become</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.690" end="01:40:42.880" style="s2">self-conscious what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.060" end="01:40:44.950" style="s2">become self-conscious it me becomes it</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.880" end="01:40:46.300" style="s2">means you become aware one way of</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.950" end="01:40:48.580" style="s2">thinking about it is you become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.300" end="01:40:50.350" style="s2">your vulnerability or another is that</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.580" end="01:40:52.660" style="s2">you become aware of your insufficiency</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.350" end="01:40:54.969" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say that you&#39;re standing</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.660" end="01:40:57.700" style="s2">up in front of a crowd talking and you</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.969" end="01:40:59.140" style="s2">become self-conscious what happens well</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.700" end="01:41:01.630" style="s2">first of all you can&#39;t talk anymore</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.140" end="01:41:03.130" style="s2">the second is he kind of fall inside and</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.630" end="01:41:05.020" style="s2">the third is you feel ashamed and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.130" end="01:41:08.890" style="s2">fourth is that you retreat and you look</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.020" end="01:41:10.480" style="s2">down so it&#39;s a low status operation and</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.890" end="01:41:12.700" style="s2">it&#39;s associated with heightened anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.480" end="01:41:14.850" style="s2">and so then you might say well why would</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.700" end="01:41:17.950" style="s2">you become self-conscious before a crowd</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.850" end="01:41:20.770" style="s2">well the answer is they can see you</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.950" end="01:41:22.240" style="s2">right and they can judge you and you can</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.770" end="01:41:24.100" style="s2">make an error in front of them and you</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.240" end="01:41:25.870" style="s2">can make a fool of yourself so they put</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.100" end="01:41:27.760" style="s2">you down that you can you can display</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.870" end="01:41:29.500" style="s2">yourself in a manner that ratchets you</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.760" end="01:41:31.990" style="s2">down the dominance hierarchy that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.500" end="01:41:33.400" style="s2">become self-conscious and so well at</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.990" end="01:41:36.100" style="s2">least you have the advantage of being</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.400" end="01:41:37.180" style="s2">covered up in front of the crowd but</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.100" end="01:41:38.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say all of a sudden you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.180" end="01:41:41.470" style="s2">stripped of your clothes</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.680" end="01:41:45.040" style="s2">so what&#39;s the problem with that well all</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.470" end="01:41:47.830" style="s2">of your insufficiencies let&#39;s say are on</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.040" end="01:41:49.870" style="s2">painful display you can be evaluated by</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.830" end="01:41:51.520" style="s2">everyone but even more importantly than</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.870" end="01:41:53.500" style="s2">that if possible is that clothes</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.520" end="01:41:55.750" style="s2">actually protect the most vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.500" end="01:41:56.920" style="s2">parts of you human beings are upright</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.750" end="01:41:59.140" style="s2">animals right</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.920" end="01:41:59.980" style="s2">we&#39;re very strange animals you take a</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.140" end="01:42:02.140" style="s2">cat or a dog</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.980" end="01:42:04.540" style="s2">they&#39;re basically armored the part of</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.140" end="01:42:06.790" style="s2">them that you see their back is heavily</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.540" end="01:42:09.010" style="s2">armored heavily protected human being</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.790" end="01:42:10.780" style="s2">stretched up right and so the softest</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.010" end="01:42:13.000" style="s2">part of parts of us are there for</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.780" end="01:42:16.390" style="s2">display but also we&#39;re displayed as</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.000" end="01:42:18.370" style="s2">sexual creatures too and so to become to</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.390" end="01:42:20.680" style="s2">be naked and not ashamed of it is to</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.370" end="01:42:22.750" style="s2">lack self-consciousness so the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.680" end="01:42:23.800" style="s2">that the Adam and Eve in the original</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.750" end="01:42:28.780" style="s2">state in the garden lacked</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.800" end="01:42:30.730" style="s2">self-consciousness now the serpent was</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.780" end="01:42:33.490" style="s2">more subtle subtle is an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.730" end="01:42:36.190" style="s2">word here because it means kind of fog</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.490" end="01:42:38.110" style="s2">like and and vague and difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.190" end="01:42:40.270" style="s2">detect so it&#39;s something that that lurks</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.110" end="01:42:41.980" style="s2">and is hidden so that&#39;s what the serpent</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.270" end="01:42:44.290" style="s2">is it sits in the domain of hidden</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.980" end="01:42:46.450" style="s2">things than any beast of the field which</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.290" end="01:42:49.750" style="s2">the Lord God had made and the serpent</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.450" end="01:42:51.310" style="s2">said unto the woman hey hasn&#39;t God said</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.750" end="01:42:53.230" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t eat of every tree of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.310" end="01:42:54.910" style="s2">garden and the woman said we may eat of</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.230" end="01:42:56.470" style="s2">the fruit of the trees of the garden but</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.910" end="01:42:58.390" style="s2">of the fruit of the tree which is in the</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.470" end="01:43:00.880" style="s2">middle of the garden the central fruit</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.390" end="01:43:02.830" style="s2">God has said you shall not eat of it</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.880" end="01:43:05.830" style="s2">neither shall you touch it lest you die</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.830" end="01:43:08.950" style="s2">and the serpent said unto the woman you</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.830" end="01:43:10.300" style="s2">shall not surely die for God knows that</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.950" end="01:43:12.280" style="s2">in the day you eat thereof then your</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.300" end="01:43:15.010" style="s2">eyes will be opened and you will be as</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.280" end="01:43:18.100" style="s2">God&#39;s knowing good and evil all right so</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.010" end="01:43:20.530" style="s2">there&#39;s another implication there we</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.100" end="01:43:23.650" style="s2">already saw that there&#39;s an implication</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.530" end="01:43:25.300" style="s2">that Adam and Eve are not self conscious</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.650" end="01:43:27.190" style="s2">and now there&#39;s the implication that</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.300" end="01:43:29.050" style="s2">their eyes aren&#39;t open or at least that</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.190" end="01:43:31.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not open fully in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.050" end="01:43:31.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not open for example to the</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.000" end="01:43:33.500" style="s2">knowledge of good and</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.880" end="01:43:35.659" style="s2">evil and that seems to be associated</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.500" end="01:43:39.440" style="s2">somehow with death in some strange way</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.659" end="01:43:41.810" style="s2">okay so and it&#39;s the serpent talking to</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.440" end="01:43:44.030" style="s2">the woman so the serpent taught is that</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.810" end="01:43:46.100" style="s2">is the tempter of the woman so the</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.030" end="01:43:48.620" style="s2">question is why in the world would that</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.100" end="01:43:51.080" style="s2">be I showed you those representations of</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.620" end="01:43:52.909" style="s2">Mary right holding the infant up in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.080" end="01:43:54.830" style="s2">air with her foot on the snake so you</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.909" end="01:43:57.770" style="s2">think well who&#39;s more self-conscious</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.830" end="01:43:59.870" style="s2">women are men and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.770" end="01:44:01.909" style="s2">women are more self-conscious than men</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.870" end="01:44:03.650" style="s2">and even further you might say that</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.909" end="01:44:05.150" style="s2">women taught men to be self-conscious</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.650" end="01:44:06.920" style="s2">and I believe that to be the case</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.150" end="01:44:09.139" style="s2">maybe babies taught women to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.920" end="01:44:10.820" style="s2">self-conscious but women taught men to</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.139" end="01:44:12.679" style="s2">be self-conscious and they still teach</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.820" end="01:44:14.090" style="s2">them that all the time because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.679" end="01:44:16.280" style="s2">nothing that makes a man more</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.090" end="01:44:18.949" style="s2">self-conscious that to be rejected by a</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.280" end="01:44:21.380" style="s2">woman that he desires so the woman is</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.949" end="01:44:23.510" style="s2">always offering self-consciousness to</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.380" end="01:44:25.730" style="s2">men and it isn&#39;t necessarily a gift that</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.510" end="01:44:27.560" style="s2">they exactly appreciate and that motif</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.730" end="01:44:30.139" style="s2">of course runs through the Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.560" end="01:44:32.150" style="s2">story centrally because Eve is damned</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.139" end="01:44:34.130" style="s2">forever in some sense for making out</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.150" end="01:44:35.750" style="s2">himself conscious well he didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.130" end="01:44:37.159" style="s2">be self-conscious things were pretty</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.750" end="01:44:38.960" style="s2">good when his eyes were closed and he</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.159" end="01:44:41.360" style="s2">was wandering around not worrying about</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.960" end="01:44:43.760" style="s2">whether he was naked or not well the</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.360" end="01:44:44.480" style="s2">women became self-conscious why because</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.760" end="01:44:47.840" style="s2">of snakes</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.480" end="01:44:50.030" style="s2">well maybe right maybe that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.840" end="01:44:52.760" style="s2">what happened you know she imagined</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.030" end="01:44:54.830" style="s2">we&#39;re being preyed upon for millions of</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.760" end="01:44:56.960" style="s2">years by predatory reptiles right and we</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.830" end="01:44:58.940" style="s2">become more and more alert to threat and</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.960" end="01:45:00.830" style="s2">more and more alert to threat and then</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.940" end="01:45:03.409" style="s2">one day we get so alert to threat that</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.830" end="01:45:05.300" style="s2">we can see threat lurking in the future</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.409" end="01:45:06.860" style="s2">and then all of a sudden we become aware</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.300" end="01:45:08.449" style="s2">of the future and then we become aware</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.860" end="01:45:10.400" style="s2">of death and then we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.449" end="01:45:11.780" style="s2">self-conscious but it&#39;s pretty good if</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.400" end="01:45:13.400" style="s2">you want to keep the snakes down which</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.780" end="01:45:15.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing quite successfully ever</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.400" end="01:45:18.860" style="s2">since then but it&#39;s a big price to pay</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.679" end="01:45:20.630" style="s2">we got so damn sensitive to threat that</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.860" end="01:45:23.540" style="s2">we were finally able to conceive the</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.630" end="01:45:25.610" style="s2">ultimate threat not proximal threats but</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.540" end="01:45:27.710" style="s2">the fact of threat itself and the fact</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.610" end="01:45:30.440" style="s2">of mortality itself and the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.710" end="01:45:32.510" style="s2">finitude itself and maybe women learned</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.440" end="01:45:34.790" style="s2">that because they become painfully aware</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.510" end="01:45:37.330" style="s2">of the mortal limitations of their</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.790" end="01:45:41.900" style="s2">infants first right this small thing</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.330" end="01:45:43.969" style="s2">could die could end a little and</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.900" end="01:45:45.320" style="s2">certainly as an object of predation and</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.969" end="01:45:48.139" style="s2">you can imagine God</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.320" end="01:45:50.060" style="s2">knows how many infants human-beings lost</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.139" end="01:45:53.090" style="s2">to predators I mean I told you at one</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.060" end="01:45:55.989" style="s2">point I believe that there was a cat</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.090" end="01:45:59.360" style="s2">that was found that had a that had a</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.989" end="01:46:02.469" style="s2">that had a skull and jaws that were</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.360" end="01:46:06.079" style="s2">specialized for biting the skulls of</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.469" end="01:46:07.369" style="s2">protohumans one long tooth at the back</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.079" end="01:46:08.810" style="s2">that would drive right through the back</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.369" end="01:46:10.909" style="s2">of the skull so the cat could put its</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.810" end="01:46:13.099" style="s2">teeth here and drive the tooth right</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.909" end="01:46:15.619" style="s2">into the back of the skull so you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.099" end="01:46:17.989" style="s2">that&#39;s a good enough dragon for our for</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.619" end="01:46:21.440" style="s2">all for our intents and purposes I would</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.989" end="01:46:24.650" style="s2">say anyways the snake comes along and</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.440" end="01:46:26.389" style="s2">opens the woman&#39;s eyes when the woman</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.650" end="01:46:27.800" style="s2">saw that the tree was good for food and</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.389" end="01:46:29.449" style="s2">that was pleasant to the eye and a</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.800" end="01:46:31.670" style="s2">treated to be desired to make one wise</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.449" end="01:46:33.949" style="s2">she took of the fruit thereof and did</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.670" end="01:46:36.380" style="s2">eat and gave also unto her husband with</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.949" end="01:46:38.150" style="s2">her and he did eat and the eyes of both</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.380" end="01:46:39.679" style="s2">of them were opened and they knew that</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.150" end="01:46:40.610" style="s2">they were naked and they sewed fig</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.679" end="01:46:42.679" style="s2">leaves together and made themselves</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.610" end="01:46:45.679" style="s2">aprons well there&#39;s a lot happening in</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.679" end="01:46:46.940" style="s2">those few lines now there&#39;s a fruit</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.679" end="01:46:49.250" style="s2">thing going on there</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.940" end="01:46:51.110" style="s2">snake and fruit okay so we know from</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.250" end="01:46:53.150" style="s2">Lynn is Bell hypothetically that the</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.110" end="01:46:54.679" style="s2">reason that primates like us developed</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.150" end="01:46:56.810" style="s2">our intense vision is because we</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.679" end="01:46:59.960" style="s2">co-evolved with snakes so the snakes</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.810" end="01:47:03.920" style="s2">opened their eyes what about fruit color</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.960" end="01:47:06.290" style="s2">vision right why to detect ripe fruit we</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.920" end="01:47:08.630" style="s2">know that and our women and ripe fruit</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.290" end="01:47:10.699" style="s2">the same well they&#39;re the same insofar</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.630" end="01:47:12.949" style="s2">as it was women offering the ripe fruit</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.699" end="01:47:14.770" style="s2">and that&#39;s undoubtedly something that</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.949" end="01:47:17.659" style="s2">happened you know that the hypothetical</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.770" end="01:47:20.090" style="s2">idea is the male&#39;s hunt and bring home</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.659" end="01:47:22.880" style="s2">protein the women gather what are they</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.090" end="01:47:25.400" style="s2">gathering well they&#39;re gathering at</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.880" end="01:47:28.099" style="s2">minimum ripe fruit and then what are</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.400" end="01:47:31.070" style="s2">they doing they&#39;re sharing it well you</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.099" end="01:47:32.570" style="s2">also bring about a moral obligation when</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.070" end="01:47:35.360" style="s2">you&#39;re sharing food right there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.570" end="01:47:37.849" style="s2">invitation to reciprocity there and so</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.360" end="01:47:40.130" style="s2">the fact that women were sharing let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.849" end="01:47:43.010" style="s2">say ripe fruit with men also brings them</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.130" end="01:47:44.659" style="s2">into their what would you call builds up</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.010" end="01:47:46.400" style="s2">the basis for the potential of a</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.659" end="01:47:48.260" style="s2">reciprocal moral obligation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.400" end="01:47:50.719" style="s2">something like that and the problem</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.260" end="01:47:52.489" style="s2">again for men with being allied with</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.719" end="01:47:53.780" style="s2">women and infants is that it also</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.489" end="01:47:55.550" style="s2">heightens their self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.780" end="01:47:58.369" style="s2">because you&#39;re a lot tougher and more</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.550" end="01:47:59.179" style="s2">indomitable say if there&#39;s just you but</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.369" end="01:48:01.610" style="s2">as soon as you have</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.179" end="01:48:03.650" style="s2">wife say and then you also have an</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.610" end="01:48:05.059" style="s2">infant well all the burden of their</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.650" end="01:48:07.579" style="s2">self-consciousness and their</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.059" end="01:48:09.739" style="s2">vulnerability is placed upon you well</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.579" end="01:48:12.650" style="s2">it&#39;s a hell of a bargain well why did</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.739" end="01:48:14.780" style="s2">men accept the bargain well it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.650" end="01:48:17.239" style="s2">because women stood in front of them</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.780" end="01:48:19.010" style="s2">offering them fruit right well part of</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.239" end="01:48:21.199" style="s2">the price that the men paid for that was</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.010" end="01:48:24.469" style="s2">to wake the hell up well who the hell</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.199" end="01:48:26.570" style="s2">wants that it&#39;s a lot more it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.469" end="01:48:28.519" style="s2">more calming to remain asleep with no</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.570" end="01:48:30.050" style="s2">knowledge of the sort of burden of</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.519" end="01:48:33.409" style="s2">mortality that you would bear if you</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.050" end="01:48:35.239" style="s2">became self-conscious so fine so now</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.409" end="01:48:37.070" style="s2">they&#39;re done with it they the snake and</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.239" end="01:48:39.380" style="s2">the fruit woke them up and they can see</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.070" end="01:48:41.989" style="s2">and the scales drop from the rise and so</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.380" end="01:48:44.510" style="s2">we can really see well so what does that</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.989" end="01:48:46.789" style="s2">mean how our brain is visual is devoted</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.510" end="01:48:49.010" style="s2">to visual processing so as well as long</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.789" end="01:48:50.360" style="s2">as as our eyes got better our brain got</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.010" end="01:48:52.760" style="s2">bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.360" end="01:48:55.610" style="s2">what happens when it gets big enough</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.760" end="01:48:57.949" style="s2">well not only can you see you can Metis</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.610" end="01:49:00.349" style="s2">see it&#39;s you can start to see into the</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.949" end="01:49:00.829" style="s2">future well that&#39;s exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.349" end="01:49:02.449" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.829" end="01:49:04.400" style="s2">not only could we see with our eyes we</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.449" end="01:49:07.610" style="s2">could see with our imagination and our</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.400" end="01:49:11.510" style="s2">imagination is or you can see with your</p>

<p begin="01:49:11.510" end="01:49:15.949" style="s2">up a vision you can imagine the future</p>

<p begin="01:49:15.949" end="01:49:20.269" style="s2">potential future with your eyes closed</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.110" end="01:49:22.820" style="s2">the circuitry is there once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.269" end="01:49:25.099" style="s2">developed you can use it to imagine you</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.820" end="01:49:26.900" style="s2">can project your project your vision</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.099" end="01:49:29.360" style="s2">into places that don&#39;t even exist and</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.900" end="01:49:31.189" style="s2">you can start to conceptualize the</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.360" end="01:49:33.139" style="s2">future what happens when you</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.189" end="01:49:35.959" style="s2">conceptualize the future well this is a</p>

<p begin="01:49:35.959" end="01:49:40.099" style="s2">work because you can see the future</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.570" end="01:49:42.920" style="s2">coming you think all the future is</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.099" end="01:49:44.570" style="s2">coming it isn&#39;t just the present anymore</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.920" end="01:49:46.249" style="s2">I don&#39;t have to just worry about whether</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.570" end="01:49:47.510" style="s2">or not I&#39;m hungry right now I&#39;m gonna</p>

<p begin="01:49:53.719" end="01:49:58.249" style="s2">it&#39;s like you can forget about your</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.329" end="01:50:00.559" style="s2">day-to-day existence in paradise at that</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.249" end="01:50:02.239" style="s2">point there&#39;s no evidence that people in</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.559" end="01:50:03.530" style="s2">industrialized societies are happier</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.239" end="01:50:05.300" style="s2">than people in non industrialized</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.530" end="01:50:09.559" style="s2">societies in fact quite the contrary</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.300" end="01:50:11.840" style="s2">we&#39;re less happy why well because we</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.559" end="01:50:12.799" style="s2">fully and constantly bear the burden of</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.840" end="01:50:14.209" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.799" end="01:50:16.429" style="s2">well that&#39;s good because we don&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.209" end="01:50:18.049" style="s2">and we live maybe 30 years longer and we</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.429" end="01:50:19.489" style="s2">have fewer horrible diseases and all of</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.049" end="01:50:21.619" style="s2">that but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s any</p>

<p begin="01:50:36.049" end="01:50:38.779" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.889" end="01:50:41.539" style="s2">it&#39;s your destiny there&#39;s no escaping</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.779" end="01:50:44.510" style="s2">from it well human beings work what does</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.539" end="01:50:47.299" style="s2">that mean they sacrifice the present for</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.510" end="01:50:49.249" style="s2">the future and that&#39;s partly as soon as</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.299" end="01:50:51.109" style="s2">this happens like the next story which</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.249" end="01:50:52.969" style="s2">is Cain and Abel you see the motif of</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.109" end="01:50:54.949" style="s2">sacrifice emerge write that story</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.969" end="01:50:57.199" style="s2">circulates around the motif of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.949" end="01:51:00.439" style="s2">sacrifice the present for the future</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.199" end="01:51:03.319" style="s2">well what&#39;s the price you pay you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.439" end="01:51:05.089" style="s2">get the present that&#39;s a big price right</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.319" end="01:51:06.699" style="s2">because what you do is what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.089" end="01:51:09.159" style="s2">essentially is you&#39;re taking all the</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.699" end="01:51:12.079" style="s2">potential suffering of the future and</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.159" end="01:51:14.659" style="s2">putting it into the present all the time</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.079" end="01:51:17.869" style="s2">well so what happens well maybe you live</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.659" end="01:51:20.179" style="s2">longer and you live healthier but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.869" end="01:51:23.389" style="s2">not without the burden that that puts on</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.179" end="01:51:26.329" style="s2">you so the eyes of them were both opened</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.389" end="01:51:28.489" style="s2">and they knew they were naked well so</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.329" end="01:51:30.379" style="s2">what does that mean well what does naked</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.489" end="01:51:31.909" style="s2">mean it means you know you&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.379" end="01:51:34.069" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what it means they know</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.909" end="01:51:35.689" style="s2">they&#39;re vulnerable so they so fig leaves</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.069" end="01:51:39.019" style="s2">together and make themselves aprons so</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.689" end="01:51:40.669" style="s2">what happens is they wake up their eyes</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.019" end="01:51:42.229" style="s2">open they know they&#39;re vulnerable so</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.669" end="01:51:43.879" style="s2">they discover the future they discover</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.229" end="01:51:45.109" style="s2">their vulnerability extended into the</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.879" end="01:51:47.059" style="s2">future and the first thing they do is</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.109" end="01:51:49.129" style="s2">build culture right that&#39;s the fig</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.059" end="01:51:50.539" style="s2">leaves it&#39;s like okay here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.129" end="01:51:53.449" style="s2">vulnerability we put a barrier between</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.539" end="01:51:56.599" style="s2">us in the world it&#39;s like a wall right</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.449" end="01:51:58.399" style="s2">because this is externalized clothing</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.599" end="01:52:01.069" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.399" end="01:52:03.049" style="s2">so to put that clothing on this is</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.069" end="01:52:05.179" style="s2">clothing as a human Universal by the way</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.049" end="01:52:07.039" style="s2">now sometimes it&#39;s only used for</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.179" end="01:52:08.869" style="s2">decorative purposes but far more often</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.039" end="01:52:13.129" style="s2">especially in cold climates it&#39;s used</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.869" end="01:52:14.989" style="s2">for protection so to clothe yourself is</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.129" end="01:52:18.019" style="s2">to recognize your vulnerability and to</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.989" end="01:52:20.179" style="s2">use culture to hold it at bay so find</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.019" end="01:52:21.799" style="s2">they make themselves aprons and they</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.179" end="01:52:24.459" style="s2">heard the voice of the Lord God walking</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.799" end="01:52:26.659" style="s2">in the garden in the cool of the day and</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.459" end="01:52:28.219" style="s2">Adam and his wife hid themselves</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.659" end="01:52:31.729" style="s2">from the presence of the Lord God among</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.219" end="01:52:34.159" style="s2">the trees of the garden okay so before</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.729" end="01:52:35.360" style="s2">Adam and Eve wake up before they realize</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.159" end="01:52:40.459" style="s2">they&#39;re vulnerable they don&#39;t hide from</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.360" end="01:52:44.360" style="s2">God so what does that mean well he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.459" end="01:52:47.059" style="s2">spirit that goes into the unknown - to -</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.360" end="01:52:48.229" style="s2">to conquer it and to make the world okay</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.059" end="01:52:50.659" style="s2">so let&#39;s say that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.229" end="01:52:51.919" style="s2">to do you&#39;re supposed to mediate between</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.659" end="01:52:53.570" style="s2">chaos and order</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.919" end="01:52:55.669" style="s2">okay and you&#39;re supposed to do that</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.570" end="01:52:58.130" style="s2">forthrightly so then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.669" end="01:53:00.590" style="s2">what the hell is stopping you and that</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.130" end="01:53:01.459" style="s2">answer is easy your knowledge of your</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.590" end="01:53:03.349" style="s2">vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.459" end="01:53:05.869" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s what&#39;s stopping you</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.349" end="01:53:08.809" style="s2">it&#39;s like why aren&#39;t you courageous and</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.869" end="01:53:10.999" style="s2">forthright well because you can be cut</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.809" end="01:53:12.650" style="s2">off at the knees and terribly hurt and</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.999" end="01:53:14.689" style="s2">so you&#39;re gonna shrink back from that</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.650" end="01:53:17.090" style="s2">responsibility and it&#39;s no bloody wonder</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.689" end="01:53:21.679" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.090" end="01:53:24.019" style="s2">going to happen so Lord God calls them</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.679" end="01:53:26.419" style="s2">to Adam so he&#39;s trying to what that</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.019" end="01:53:29.300" style="s2">means - for the for God to call on you</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.419" end="01:53:31.219" style="s2">is to say for God to say I want to act</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.300" end="01:53:33.829" style="s2">through you or I want to act with you</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.219" end="01:53:38.150" style="s2">well that spirit let&#39;s say well Adam</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.829" end="01:53:41.059" style="s2">says I heard I heard God says to Adam</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.150" end="01:53:43.130" style="s2">where are you and Adam says I heard your</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.059" end="01:53:46.130" style="s2">voice in the garden right I heard the</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.130" end="01:53:48.169" style="s2">call but I was afraid because I was</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.130" end="01:53:49.550" style="s2">naked and I hid myself it&#39;s like yes</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.169" end="01:53:51.889" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what human beings are</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.550" end="01:53:55.610" style="s2">like that&#39;s precisely exactly what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.889" end="01:53:57.619" style="s2">like we hear the call but we hide and we</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.610" end="01:54:00.849" style="s2">have the thing is it&#39;s there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.619" end="01:54:03.979" style="s2">reason for it it&#39;s not something trivial</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.849" end="01:54:06.110" style="s2">and God said who told you you were naked</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.979" end="01:54:08.389" style="s2">did you eat the tree that I told you</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.110" end="01:54:09.679" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t eat and the man says the man</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.389" end="01:54:10.939" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come off very well in this</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.679" end="01:54:12.559" style="s2">particular phrase as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.939" end="01:54:14.630" style="s2">concerned and there&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.559" end="01:54:16.489" style="s2">this is actually quite a comedic story</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.630" end="01:54:19.989" style="s2">except that it&#39;s also a catastrophic</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.489" end="01:54:22.820" style="s2">tragedy it&#39;s like God calls out him out</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.989" end="01:54:24.619" style="s2">like what&#39;s with you now you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.820" end="01:54:26.840" style="s2">hiding from me why and the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.619" end="01:54:28.489" style="s2">out him does it says it&#39;s her fault it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.840" end="01:54:30.919" style="s2">her fault she made me self-conscious</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.489" end="01:54:33.979" style="s2">well I see that in resentful men all the</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.919" end="01:54:36.800" style="s2">time they&#39;re very antipathy towards</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.979" end="01:54:38.689" style="s2">women and they blame their misery and</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.800" end="01:54:40.099" style="s2">resentment on the fact that women won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.689" end="01:54:40.430" style="s2">have anything to do with them while the</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.099" end="01:54:42.050" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.430" end="01:54:43.580" style="s2">making them self-conscious for not being</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.050" end="01:54:45.170" style="s2">all they should be because the women</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.580" end="01:54:47.270" style="s2">think why should I bother with you if</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.170" end="01:54:48.770" style="s2">you&#39;re not the embodiment of the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.270" end="01:54:50.990" style="s2">that will move into the unknown and and</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.770" end="01:54:52.700" style="s2">face the Leviathan which is exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.990" end="01:54:54.050" style="s2">she should be saying and you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.700" end="01:54:55.640" style="s2">well I don&#39;t want to have anything to do</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.050" end="01:54:57.380" style="s2">with that but I&#39;d like women to like me</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.640" end="01:54:59.270" style="s2">anyways it&#39;s like well good luck with</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.380" end="01:55:00.860" style="s2">that so that doesn&#39;t work out and so</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.270" end="01:55:03.050" style="s2">instead of getting your act together you</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.860" end="01:55:04.790" style="s2">say those goddamn women that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.050" end="01:55:06.740" style="s2">what Adam says to God he said but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.790" end="01:55:08.870" style="s2">don&#39;t be laying this on my feet it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.740" end="01:55:10.400" style="s2">woman you made her she made me all</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.870" end="01:55:13.130" style="s2">self-conscious and cowardly</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.400" end="01:55:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like brilliant great wonderful and</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.130" end="01:55:17.990" style="s2">God says to the woman what did you do</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.680" end="01:55:20.540" style="s2">and the woman said well it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.990" end="01:55:23.570" style="s2">the serpent that that confused me and</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.540" end="01:55:24.950" style="s2">and I ate well it&#39;s like actually I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.570" end="01:55:26.690" style="s2">little more sympathetic to her than to</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.950" end="01:55:28.370" style="s2">Adam all things considered because after</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.690" end="01:55:30.710" style="s2">all she was trying to deal with the damn</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.370" end="01:55:32.960" style="s2">snake right and we find out that the</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.710" end="01:55:35.030" style="s2">snake is not only the thing that preys</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.960" end="01:55:36.710" style="s2">upon her infants but as the tradition</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.030" end="01:55:39.470" style="s2">developed it&#39;s identified with Satan</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.710" end="01:55:41.030" style="s2">himself so and that&#39;s the snake in every</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.470" end="01:55:43.340" style="s2">soul that&#39;s the right way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.030" end="01:55:46.820" style="s2">about that so she had her reasons</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.340" end="01:55:49.190" style="s2">but doesn&#39;t matter you pay whether you</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.820" end="01:55:51.320" style="s2">have your reasons or not and so God says</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.190" end="01:55:53.390" style="s2">to the serpent because you&#39;ve done this</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.320" end="01:55:55.700" style="s2">you&#39;re cursed above all cattle and above</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.390" end="01:55:57.800" style="s2">every beast of the field upon the belly</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.700" end="01:56:00.170" style="s2">shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.800" end="01:56:03.410" style="s2">all the days of thy life so first of all</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.170" end="01:56:05.210" style="s2">the serpent seems to have legs right and</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.410" end="01:56:06.320" style="s2">then it&#39;s turned into a snake and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.210" end="01:56:09.110" style="s2">actually how it worked by the way</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.320" end="01:56:11.300" style="s2">because snakes had legs and they lost</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.110" end="01:56:13.070" style="s2">them now you know I&#39;m not trying to say</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.300" end="01:56:14.920" style="s2">that this story necessarily represents</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.070" end="01:56:17.360" style="s2">that but it&#39;s an interesting parallel</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.920" end="01:56:19.010" style="s2">and he tells the snake I&#39;ll put enmity</p>

<p begin="01:56:23.360" end="01:56:27.470" style="s2">well yes well that&#39;s the snake striking</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.670" end="01:56:29.000" style="s2">right and the fact that when human being</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.470" end="01:56:29.540" style="s2">see snakes they want to just like The</p>

<p begin="01:56:31.640" end="01:56:35.240" style="s2">of the snakes and that&#39;s why the many</p>

<p begin="01:56:35.240" end="01:56:39.320" style="s2">snakes from the land like st. Patrick or</p>

<p begin="01:56:48.440" end="01:56:53.750" style="s2">potential is the right way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.850" end="01:56:54.290" style="s2">about it all right unto the woman he</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.750" end="01:56:56.240" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.290" end="01:56:58.910" style="s2">I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and</p>

<p begin="01:57:03.350" end="01:57:08.300" style="s2">rule over thee well that&#39;s a statement</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.320" end="01:57:11.630" style="s2">of Destiny not a statement of the way it</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.300" end="01:57:13.310" style="s2">should be so what does it mean I will</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.630" end="01:57:14.120" style="s2">greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.310" end="01:57:16.010" style="s2">conception</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.120" end="01:57:17.690" style="s2">well self-consciousness will do that</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.010" end="01:57:19.790" style="s2">because of course women are fully aware</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.690" end="01:57:22.130" style="s2">of exactly how fragile their infants are</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.790" end="01:57:23.570" style="s2">so that&#39;s a big problem in sorrow thou</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.130" end="01:57:25.610" style="s2">shalt bring forth children</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.570" end="01:57:28.370" style="s2">that&#39;s something particular to human</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.610" end="01:57:31.520" style="s2">women right and here&#39;s why the price we</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.370" end="01:57:33.380" style="s2">paid for the rapid expansion of our</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.520" end="01:57:35.360" style="s2">brain which is also something that gave</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.380" end="01:57:37.250" style="s2">us this self-consciousness and vision</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.360" end="01:57:39.830" style="s2">meant that there&#39;s an evolutionary arms</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.250" end="01:57:42.050" style="s2">race between the pelvic width of women</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.830" end="01:57:45.020" style="s2">and the hole in the center of the pelvis</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.050" end="01:57:47.990" style="s2">and the infant&#39;s head so what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.020" end="01:57:50.120" style="s2">the infant is born far too young for a</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.990" end="01:57:51.560" style="s2">mammal of our size because if it was</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.120" end="01:57:53.030" style="s2">Benny older the head would be too big</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.560" end="01:57:55.070" style="s2">the pelvis would have to be too wide</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.030" end="01:57:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s structural stability would be</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.070" end="01:57:58.730" style="s2">compromised and then women couldn&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.720" end="01:58:00.980" style="s2">so right now women are at the maximum</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.730" end="01:58:03.110" style="s2">for hip-width in terms of their ability</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.980" end="01:58:05.450" style="s2">to run so what&#39;s happened is that</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.110" end="01:58:07.850" style="s2">infants have had to be born younger with</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.450" end="01:58:09.560" style="s2">a compressible head so you know the</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.850" end="01:58:11.660" style="s2">bones of an infant&#39;s collar joined</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.560" end="01:58:13.100" style="s2">together and sometimes after babies are</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.660" end="01:58:15.230" style="s2">born their head is actually almost</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.100" end="01:58:17.060" style="s2">cone-shaped because of the tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.230" end="01:58:19.370" style="s2">pressure that was exerted on their head</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.060" end="01:58:21.710" style="s2">during the during the birthing process</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.370" end="01:58:24.230" style="s2">and of course that&#39;s killed innumerable</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.710" end="01:58:28.280" style="s2">women right I mean women&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.230" end="01:58:30.590" style="s2">expectancy before what the latter half</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.280" end="01:58:32.360" style="s2">of the 20th century was way below men</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.590" end="01:58:36.940" style="s2">because they died in childbirth all the</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.360" end="01:58:43.490" style="s2">time and why well it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.940" end="01:58:46.130" style="s2">what do you call that it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.490" end="01:58:48.440" style="s2">very narrow gateway and the price that</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.130" end="01:58:50.840" style="s2">women pay for it is very high risk of</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.440" end="01:58:53.150" style="s2">death very high risk of sorrow because</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.840" end="01:58:55.340" style="s2">of death of children in in childbirth</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.150" end="01:58:57.410" style="s2">and also extraordinarily extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.340" end="01:58:59.750" style="s2">pain in giving birth so that&#39;s the price</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.410" end="01:59:02.630" style="s2">women pay for having vision and being</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.750" end="01:59:05.120" style="s2">self-conscious well that&#39;s and then</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.630" end="01:59:07.400" style="s2">worse they desire their husband and</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.120" end="01:59:07.970" style="s2">he&#39;ll rule over them well whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.400" end="01:59:10.160" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.970" end="01:59:11.750" style="s2">good or bad it doesn&#39;t matter guards</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.160" end="01:59:14.030" style="s2">statement is that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.750" end="01:59:16.300" style="s2">well partly that&#39;s because as far as I</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.030" end="01:59:18.980" style="s2">can tell there isn&#39;t really women</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.300" end="01:59:22.010" style="s2">roughly speaking there&#39;s women with</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.980" end="01:59:25.390" style="s2">infants and a woman with an infant is</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.010" end="01:59:27.410" style="s2">compromised in terms of her what</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.390" end="01:59:29.540" style="s2">independent individuality to a</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.410" end="01:59:31.340" style="s2">remarkable degree because the infant is</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.540" end="01:59:34.360" style="s2">dependent absolutely dependent</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.340" end="01:59:36.650" style="s2">absolutely dependent for a year and then</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.360" end="01:59:38.900" style="s2">unbelievably dependent for like eight</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.650" end="01:59:41.540" style="s2">years after that and then still pretty</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.900" end="01:59:43.580" style="s2">dependent for another five so once you</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.540" end="01:59:45.470" style="s2">have an infant it&#39;s no longer you and</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.580" end="01:59:46.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked to lots of women for whom</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.470" end="01:59:48.410" style="s2">that was a great relief by the way</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.850" end="01:59:51.200" style="s2">because it actually is somewhat of a</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.410" end="01:59:53.270" style="s2">relief to now not be the center of</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.200" end="01:59:55.040" style="s2">everything you know if you go visit your</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.270" end="01:59:56.510" style="s2">in-laws for example and you have a baby</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.040" end="01:59:58.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like they pay attention to the baby</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.510" end="02:00:00.020" style="s2">your parents will do the same thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.400" end="02:00:03.050" style="s2">kind of nice to have that happen but</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.020" end="02:00:05.480" style="s2">it&#39;s still an absolute catastrophe for</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.050" end="02:00:06.800" style="s2">you as an independent being and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.480" end="02:00:08.270" style="s2">not going to go out in the forest and</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.800" end="02:00:10.760" style="s2">hunt down dragons when you have an</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.270" end="02:00:12.470" style="s2">infant so even if you could do it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.760" end="02:00:14.930" style="s2">not gonna do it and so that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.470" end="02:00:17.300" style="s2">what that&#39;s statement outlines and then</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.930" end="02:00:19.430" style="s2">to atomy says because you listen to your</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.300" end="02:00:20.870" style="s2">wife an eighth of that tree which I said</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.430" end="02:00:21.230" style="s2">you know maybe that&#39;s not such a good</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.870" end="02:00:23.600" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.230" end="02:00:26.180" style="s2">curse it is the ground for thy sake in</p>

<p begin="02:00:29.570" end="02:00:32.960" style="s2">and thistles shall it bring forth to</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.370" end="02:00:35.090" style="s2">thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.960" end="02:00:37.100" style="s2">field in the sweat of thy face shalt</p>

<p begin="02:00:39.770" end="02:00:45.530" style="s2">it was thou taken for dust thou art and</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.290" end="02:00:48.200" style="s2">unto dust thou shalt thou return and I</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.530" end="02:00:49.910" style="s2">missed one thing about that when the</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.200" end="02:00:51.230" style="s2">serpent this took me a long time to</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.910" end="02:00:53.750" style="s2">figure out I think I&#39;ve mentioned it</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.230" end="02:00:58.700" style="s2">already but it&#39;s worth reviewing the</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.750" end="02:01:01.100" style="s2">serpent tells Eve that if she eats from</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.700" end="02:01:02.840" style="s2">the fruit of the tree then her eyes will</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.100" end="02:01:03.740" style="s2">be open and she&#39;ll be as God&#39;s knowing</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.840" end="02:01:05.930" style="s2">good and evil</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.740" end="02:01:08.840" style="s2">well the serpent doesn&#39;t say well you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.930" end="02:01:11.480" style="s2">be as as gods insofar as knowing good</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.840" end="02:01:13.700" style="s2">and evil but you&#39;ll die so you only get</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.480" end="02:01:16.750" style="s2">half the gift and so then I thought well</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.700" end="02:01:19.700" style="s2">there&#39;s this weird Minter mingling of of</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.750" end="02:01:21.240" style="s2">occurrences in the story there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.700" end="02:01:22.950" style="s2">development of vision</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.240" end="02:01:24.510" style="s2">the development of self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.950" end="02:01:26.190" style="s2">there&#39;s the knowledge of nakedness</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.510" end="02:01:28.170" style="s2">there&#39;s the emergence of work there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.190" end="02:01:30.330" style="s2">the emergence of pain and suffering in</p>

<p begin="02:01:34.170" end="02:01:38.250" style="s2">on there why is there an emphasis on</p>

<p begin="02:02:03.300" end="02:02:08.220" style="s2">it out but it can&#39;t represent it or</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.250" end="02:02:09.600" style="s2">maybe even more it acts it out but it</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.220" end="02:02:12.210" style="s2">can&#39;t represent it and it certainly</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.600" end="02:02:14.190" style="s2">can&#39;t analyze its representation it</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.210" end="02:02:15.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have that level of capacity but</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.190" end="02:02:18.000" style="s2">we do so there&#39;s that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.960" end="02:02:20.310" style="s2">moral knowledge to some degree why</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.000" end="02:02:21.960" style="s2">knowledge of good and evil I thought all</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.310" end="02:02:23.660" style="s2">right here&#39;s what it is let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.960" end="02:02:26.400" style="s2">about what you would consider</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.660" end="02:02:30.480" style="s2">reprehensible universally you could say</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.400" end="02:02:32.520" style="s2">how is this torturing an infant I would</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.480" end="02:02:34.050" style="s2">consider that virtually universally</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.520" end="02:02:35.940" style="s2">reprehensible wouldn&#39;t you say</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.050" end="02:02:37.860" style="s2">okay so we&#39;ll accept that as a</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.940" end="02:02:41.340" style="s2">reasonable definition so then the</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.860" end="02:02:43.740" style="s2">question is one why would you do it</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.340" end="02:02:47.820" style="s2">we&#39;ll leave that aside for a moment to</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.740" end="02:02:51.120" style="s2">how do you know how to do it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.820" end="02:02:53.670" style="s2">issue and that&#39;s easy once I know how I</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.120" end="02:02:55.920" style="s2">can be hurt because I&#39;m aware of my own</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.670" end="02:02:58.860" style="s2">vulnerability I know how you can be hurt</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.920" end="02:03:01.350" style="s2">and I can make it into a game and I can</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.860" end="02:03:04.800" style="s2">prolong it forever and I can do it the</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.350" end="02:03:07.320" style="s2">worst possible way and that&#39;s why when</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.800" end="02:03:08.820" style="s2">you open your eyes and you know your</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.320" end="02:03:10.260" style="s2">vulnerability and your nakedness that</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.820" end="02:03:12.780" style="s2">you immediately have the knowledge of</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.260" end="02:03:15.240" style="s2">good and evil and so then evil becomes</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.780" end="02:03:18.240" style="s2">something like well there&#39;s tragedy in</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.240" end="02:03:20.280" style="s2">life fine earthquakes cancer disease all</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.240" end="02:03:22.170" style="s2">those terrible things that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.280" end="02:03:22.890" style="s2">than me deciding that I&#39;m going to make</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.170" end="02:03:24.840" style="s2">you miserable</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.890" end="02:03:27.030" style="s2">the one is while you&#39;re a limited</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.840" end="02:03:28.560" style="s2">creature in an unlimited world you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.030" end="02:03:30.390" style="s2">going to get hurt because of that and</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.560" end="02:03:32.340" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s ways that you can be that</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.390" end="02:03:34.230" style="s2">will enable you to transcend that at</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.340" end="02:03:34.760" style="s2">least to some degree and still have the</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.230" end="02:03:36.829" style="s2">benefit</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.760" end="02:03:38.780" style="s2">of being that&#39;s entirely different than</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.829" end="02:03:40.639" style="s2">me deciding that things are going to go</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.780" end="02:03:42.889" style="s2">a lot worse for you than they might and</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.639" end="02:03:44.900" style="s2">human beings are capable I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.889" end="02:03:47.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever gone to some of the dungeon</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.900" end="02:03:49.639" style="s2">torture dungeons in Europe boy those are</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.030" end="02:03:52.039" style="s2">fun places to go you think you take the</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.639" end="02:03:53.719" style="s2">most malevolent person you possibly</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.039" end="02:03:55.820" style="s2">could and then have a little convention</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.719" end="02:03:57.860" style="s2">of those people and then get them to</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.820" end="02:04:00.050" style="s2">think up the worst possible things that</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.860" end="02:04:01.789" style="s2">they could possibly devise and then you</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.050" end="02:04:05.150" style="s2">have the instruments of torture that in</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.789" end="02:04:07.519" style="s2">a in a medieval torture dungeon right</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.150" end="02:04:08.989" style="s2">it&#39;s an art form and you think well why</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.519" end="02:04:12.590" style="s2">do people why are people willing to</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.989" end="02:04:13.969" style="s2">inflict that on one another well and</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.590" end="02:04:15.320" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about that next time when we</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.969" end="02:04:17.000" style="s2">talk about the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.320" end="02:04:19.250" style="s2">because I think it holds the secret to</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.000" end="02:04:20.570" style="s2">that and in the meantime I&#39;ll stop with</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.250" end="02:04:22.219" style="s2">this story but I want to tell you the</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.570" end="02:04:23.719" style="s2">story of the Buddha because it maps on</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.219" end="02:04:26.800" style="s2">to it very nicely so what do you have</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.719" end="02:04:29.030" style="s2">you have you have a protected space</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.800" end="02:04:31.280" style="s2">there&#39;s unconscious beings in a</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.030" end="02:04:34.659" style="s2">protected space something comes in in</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.280" end="02:04:37.250" style="s2">the form of the serpent to reveal death</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.659" end="02:04:39.769" style="s2">to view to reveal vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.250" end="02:04:41.809" style="s2">death right and then the paradise comes</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.769" end="02:04:43.699" style="s2">to an end the human beings are</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.809" end="02:04:45.650" style="s2">eliminated from it and they don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.699" end="02:04:48.050" style="s2">come back so God puts angels with</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.650" end="02:04:49.880" style="s2">flaming swords at the at the at the</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.050" end="02:04:52.070" style="s2">gateway to paradise so that people</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.880" end="02:04:54.139" style="s2">cannot come back yet it isn&#39;t obvious</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.070" end="02:04:56.269" style="s2">what that means except that there&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.139" end="02:04:58.219" style="s2">to be some sort of trial by fire before</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.269" end="02:04:59.869" style="s2">re-entering paradise but we can leave</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.219" end="02:05:01.539" style="s2">that alone for a moment so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.869" end="02:05:04.280" style="s2">basic structure of this story</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.539" end="02:05:07.400" style="s2">unconscious human beings emergence of</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.280" end="02:05:09.710" style="s2">knowledge realization of death and</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.400" end="02:05:11.869" style="s2">suffering and the elimination of the</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.710" end="02:05:14.659" style="s2">paradise right okay so now I&#39;ll read you</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.869" end="02:05:16.909" style="s2">the story of the Buddha the father of</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.659" end="02:05:19.039" style="s2">Prince Gautama the Buddha Savior of the</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.909" end="02:05:20.599" style="s2">Orient determined to protect his son</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.039" end="02:05:22.219" style="s2">from desperate knowledge and tragic</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.599" end="02:05:24.500" style="s2">awareness built for him and enclosed</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.219" end="02:05:28.130" style="s2">pavilion a walled garden of earthly</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.500" end="02:05:30.500" style="s2">delights okay so the story goes that an</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.130" end="02:05:32.269" style="s2">angel visited Buddha&#39;s father and said</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.500" end="02:05:33.590" style="s2">that he&#39;s going to have a son and the</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.269" end="02:05:34.969" style="s2">son is either going to become the</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.590" end="02:05:37.219" style="s2">greatest ruler that the world has ever</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.969" end="02:05:38.960" style="s2">seen or a spiritual leader and the</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.219" end="02:05:40.699" style="s2">father being a practical man thought</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.960" end="02:05:42.829" style="s2">where there&#39;s no bloody way I want my</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.699" end="02:05:44.389" style="s2">son to be some like wandering spiritual</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.829" end="02:05:46.219" style="s2">leader I want him to be the greatest</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.389" end="02:05:48.120" style="s2">king that the world has ever seen</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.219" end="02:05:51.870" style="s2">okay and so</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.120" end="02:05:54.000" style="s2">the father decides how am I going to get</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.870" end="02:05:55.110" style="s2">my son to be the greatest ruler the</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.000" end="02:05:56.850" style="s2">world has ever seen</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.110" end="02:05:58.230" style="s2">I better get him to fall in love with</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.850" end="02:06:00.240" style="s2">the world because then he&#39;s not gonna go</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.230" end="02:06:02.540" style="s2">traipsing after some sort of half-witted</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.240" end="02:06:05.250" style="s2">spiritual knowledge he&#39;s gonna stick to</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.540" end="02:06:06.810" style="s2">practical tasks right that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.250" end="02:06:09.120" style="s2">that a father should do to some degrees</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.810" end="02:06:11.670" style="s2">orient you in the world right and maybe</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.120" end="02:06:13.680" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t subvert your your spiritual</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.670" end="02:06:15.210" style="s2">development to any great degree but</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.680" end="02:06:17.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a practical element to this and</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.210" end="02:06:19.890" style="s2">and so anyways that&#39;s how it works and</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.670" end="02:06:22.950" style="s2">so that&#39;s what happens the the the</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.890" end="02:06:25.770" style="s2">father builds this city of perfection</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.950" end="02:06:28.080" style="s2">and he eliminates from it everything</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.770" end="02:06:29.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a reminder of the suffering</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.080" end="02:06:31.770" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with life so the only</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.760" end="02:06:32.910" style="s2">thing that&#39;s allowed the only creatures</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.770" end="02:06:34.260" style="s2">that are allowed to be in there the only</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.910" end="02:06:37.020" style="s2">people that are allowed to be in there</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.260" end="02:06:38.940" style="s2">are healthy young and happy people so</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.020" end="02:06:40.890" style="s2">the buddha grows up surrounded by</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.940" end="02:06:42.330" style="s2">nothing but the positive elements of</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.890" end="02:06:45.060" style="s2">life well you think well what does that</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.330" end="02:06:47.700" style="s2">mean well it&#39;s akin to the paradise idea</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.060" end="02:06:49.980" style="s2">obviously walled enclosure of paradise</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.700" end="02:06:52.080" style="s2">where there&#39;s no death but there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.980" end="02:06:54.570" style="s2">to it than that - it&#39;s also in some</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.080" end="02:06:56.280" style="s2">sense what a good father would do what</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.570" end="02:06:58.440" style="s2">do you do with your young children</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.280" end="02:07:00.750" style="s2">well you don&#39;t expose them to death and</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.440" end="02:07:03.120" style="s2">decay at every step of the way right do</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.750" end="02:07:06.120" style="s2">you you build a protected world for them</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.120" end="02:07:07.980" style="s2">like a walled enclosure and you only</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.120" end="02:07:10.170" style="s2">keep what&#39;s healthy and life-giving</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.980" end="02:07:12.330" style="s2">inside of it and you don&#39;t expose them</p>

<p begin="02:08:38.369" end="02:08:42.179" style="s2">away with all the kids right so the</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.289" end="02:08:43.739" style="s2">consequence of raising a child in a</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.179" end="02:08:46.079" style="s2">healthy way is that the child is going</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.739" end="02:08:48.479" style="s2">to be curious enough to go out there and</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.079" end="02:08:50.309" style="s2">look for some trouble and we actually</p>
<p begin="02:08:48.479" end="02:08:51.989" style="s2">know that because there is follow-up</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.309" end="02:08:53.340" style="s2">studies of teenagers you imagine that</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.989" end="02:08:55.439" style="s2">there&#39;s teenagers who never break any</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.340" end="02:08:56.789" style="s2">rules and then there&#39;s teenagers who</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.439" end="02:08:59.010" style="s2">break all the rules okay</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.789" end="02:09:01.669" style="s2">these teenagers don&#39;t do very well</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.010" end="02:09:04.409" style="s2">introverted depressed anxious depressed</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.669" end="02:09:07.110" style="s2">sorry I said that twice these ones are</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.409" end="02:09:08.309" style="s2">antisocial the ones in the middle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.110" end="02:09:10.590" style="s2">what you want you want your damn</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.309" end="02:09:12.239" style="s2">teenager to get out of the paradisal</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.590" end="02:09:14.189" style="s2">confines of your house and they go</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.239" end="02:09:15.959" style="s2">causes some trouble and to investigate</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.189" end="02:09:17.699" style="s2">maybe you don&#39;t want to know about it</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.959" end="02:09:19.590" style="s2">any more than you have to you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.699" end="02:09:21.840" style="s2">them to be breaking rules all the time</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.590" end="02:09:23.789" style="s2">and you don&#39;t want them to be so timid</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.840" end="02:09:25.199" style="s2">and oppressed that they can&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.789" end="02:09:27.929" style="s2">move on their own and never make a</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.199" end="02:09:29.579" style="s2">mistake so the the paradoxical thing</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.929" end="02:09:30.510" style="s2">here and it&#39;s sort of echoed out this is</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.579" end="02:09:33.149" style="s2">why I like these two stories</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.510" end="02:09:35.070" style="s2">back-to-back is like if you give people</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.149" end="02:09:36.929" style="s2">what they want then the first thing</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.070" end="02:09:38.999" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna do is try to get beyond it</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.929" end="02:09:41.039" style="s2">and Dostoevsky says the same thing in</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.999" end="02:09:42.719" style="s2">notes from underground he says if you</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.039" end="02:09:45.329" style="s2">gave people everything they wanted</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.719" end="02:09:47.309" style="s2">pure utopia so he says so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.329" end="02:09:49.199" style="s2">there sitting in a pool of bliss with</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.309" end="02:09:50.939" style="s2">nothing but bubbles of happiness coming</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.199" end="02:09:53.519" style="s2">up from the surface and all they have to</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.939" end="02:09:55.979" style="s2">do is eat cake and busy themselves with</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.519" end="02:09:58.559" style="s2">the continuation of the species dosti</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.979" end="02:10:00.209" style="s2">said Dostoyevsky&#39;s observation is the</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.559" end="02:10:02.489" style="s2">first thing that people would do is find</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.209" end="02:10:04.079" style="s2">something to smash that with just so</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.489" end="02:10:06.360" style="s2">that something interesting and perverse</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.079" end="02:10:09.209" style="s2">could happen it&#39;s like well yes where</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.360" end="02:10:11.309" style="s2">were creatures that are designed to</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.209" end="02:10:13.559" style="s2">encounter the unknown we want to keep</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.309" end="02:10:14.580" style="s2">moving beyond what we have even if we</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.559" end="02:10:16.380" style="s2">have what we have is</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.580" end="02:10:17.880" style="s2">what we want and maybe that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.380" end="02:10:20.100" style="s2">because we&#39;re oriented towards the</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.880" end="02:10:22.050" style="s2">future we think well this is great but</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.100" end="02:10:23.940" style="s2">it&#39;s not good enough it&#39;s great but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.050" end="02:10:26.550" style="s2">not good enough there&#39;s always something</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.940" end="02:10:28.080" style="s2">more that drives us forward well so</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.550" end="02:10:30.450" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens with the Buddha he</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.080" end="02:10:32.430" style="s2">gets curious he sees the walls he thinks</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.450" end="02:10:34.380" style="s2">there&#39;s walls there&#39;s probably something</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.430" end="02:10:41.100" style="s2">outside of those walls so then he goes</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.380" end="02:10:42.690" style="s2">to his father and he says I&#39;m I want to</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.100" end="02:10:44.070" style="s2">go outside what&#39;s outside and his father</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.690" end="02:10:45.750" style="s2">says no how you don&#39;t want to go outside</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.070" end="02:10:47.670" style="s2">and Buddha says yeah well I really do</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.750" end="02:10:49.230" style="s2">want to go outside and his father knows</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.670" end="02:10:51.030" style="s2">that unless he lets him go outside he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.230" end="02:10:54.030" style="s2">going to climb over the walls and so the</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.030" end="02:10:55.050" style="s2">father decides he&#39;s gonna let him go</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.030" end="02:10:57.780" style="s2">outside because he can fix everything</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.050" end="02:10:59.190" style="s2">out there first so he goes outside it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.780" end="02:11:00.420" style="s2">like the Chinese preparing for the</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.190" end="02:11:03.090" style="s2">Olympics you know when they sprayed the</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.420" end="02:11:04.800" style="s2">grass with with with green paint got rid</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.090" end="02:11:06.960" style="s2">of all the homeless people it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.800" end="02:11:07.980" style="s2">thing so he goes outside the city and he</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.960" end="02:11:11.610" style="s2">tells everyone all right</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.980" end="02:11:13.620" style="s2">old people sick people dying people hit</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.610" end="02:11:15.510" style="s2">the road we don&#39;t want to see you for a</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.620" end="02:11:17.250" style="s2">while clean all this out we want the</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.510" end="02:11:19.050" style="s2">attractive people around the sides of</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.250" end="02:11:21.090" style="s2">the roads like waving palm fronds and</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.050" end="02:11:22.320" style="s2">all of that and so when my son comes out</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.090" end="02:11:24.510" style="s2">he&#39;s going to see nothing but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.320" end="02:11:26.790" style="s2">good and so he gets that all arranged</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.510" end="02:11:28.260" style="s2">and lets his son go outside now his son</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.790" end="02:11:31.170" style="s2">goes outside in this little chariot</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.260" end="02:11:33.660" style="s2">thing and he has a someone with him now</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.170" end="02:11:35.220" style="s2">unbeknownst to his father that person</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.660" end="02:11:37.410" style="s2">that&#39;s with him is an emissary of the</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.220" end="02:11:39.180" style="s2">gods and so in a perverse way he plays</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.410" end="02:11:43.080" style="s2">the same role as the serpent in the</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.180" end="02:11:45.230" style="s2">story of Adam and Eve and the gods have</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.080" end="02:11:48.870" style="s2">already arranged so that the father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.230" end="02:11:51.030" style="s2">carer is going to be insufficient and</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.870" end="02:11:53.070" style="s2">it&#39;s the snake in the garden idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.030" end="02:11:55.830" style="s2">like no matter how much care you take to</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.070" end="02:11:58.500" style="s2">make things perfect some of the some of</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.830" end="02:12:00.830" style="s2">what what you&#39;re excluding is going to</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.500" end="02:12:03.720" style="s2">come back in so anyways</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.830" end="02:12:05.790" style="s2">Buddha goes outside and and he&#39;s in his</p>

<p begin="02:14:34.180" end="02:14:39.210" style="s2">me and the attendant answer&#39;s no man is</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.970" end="02:14:41.409" style="s2">exempt from the ravages of disease</p>
<p begin="02:14:39.210" end="02:14:44.920" style="s2">once again the world collapse</p>

<p begin="02:14:47.440" end="02:14:52.179" style="s2">in his mouth and he ventured forth a</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.270" end="02:14:54.429" style="s2">third time the gods in their mercy sent</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.179" end="02:14:56.800" style="s2">him a dead man in funeral procession</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.429" end="02:14:59.040" style="s2">this creature he asked his attendant</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.800" end="02:15:01.330" style="s2">laying so still appearing so fearsome</p>
<p begin="02:14:59.040" end="02:15:04.060" style="s2">surrounded by grief and by sorrow</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.330" end="02:15:06.250" style="s2">lost and forlorn what is he and the</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.060" end="02:15:08.710" style="s2">attendant answered that is a man like</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.250" end="02:15:11.320" style="s2">other man born of woman beloved and</p>
<p begin="02:15:08.710" end="02:15:13.900" style="s2">hated who is once you who once was you</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.320" end="02:15:16.330" style="s2">and now is the earth like other men you</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.900" end="02:15:19.000" style="s2">say inquired the prince then this could</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.330" end="02:15:21.580" style="s2">happen to me this is your end said the</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.000" end="02:15:23.110" style="s2">attendant and the end of all men well</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.580" end="02:15:25.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the end of childhood right</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.110" end="02:15:27.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no going back after that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.210" end="02:15:29.590" style="s2">like Pinocchio goes back there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.520" end="02:15:32.409" style="s2">home anymore it&#39;s there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.590" end="02:15:34.690" style="s2">your father can do to protect you from</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.409" end="02:15:37.480" style="s2">knowledge of death there&#39;s no returning</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.690" end="02:15:39.489" style="s2">to the childhood unconsciousness because</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.480" end="02:15:42.429" style="s2">you&#39;re new now no and there&#39;s no going</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.489" end="02:15:45.190" style="s2">backwards suicide that&#39;s going backwards</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.429" end="02:15:47.199" style="s2">that&#39;s how you replace your emergent</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.190" end="02:15:49.449" style="s2">self-consciousness with the old blissful</p>
<p begin="02:15:47.199" end="02:15:52.090" style="s2">unconsciousness and that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.449" end="02:15:54.429" style="s2">suicidal people wish they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.090" end="02:15:58.900" style="s2">destroy their painful self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.429" end="02:16:00.940" style="s2">and make it all go away the world</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.900" end="02:16:03.190" style="s2">collapsed a final time and Gautama asked</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.940" end="02:16:05.080" style="s2">to be returned home but the attendant</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.190" end="02:16:06.909" style="s2">had orders from the princes father and</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.080" end="02:16:08.980" style="s2">took him instead to a festival of women</p>
<p begin="02:16:06.909" end="02:16:11.290" style="s2">occurring near occurring nearby and a</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.980" end="02:16:13.030" style="s2">grove in the woods the prince was met by</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.290" end="02:16:14.560" style="s2">a beautiful assemblage who offered</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.030" end="02:16:16.900" style="s2">themselves freely to him without</p>
<p begin="02:16:14.560" end="02:16:19.570" style="s2">restraint in song dance and play in the</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.900" end="02:16:21.850" style="s2">spirit of sensual love but Gautama could</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.570" end="02:16:24.010" style="s2">think only of death and the inevitable</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.850" end="02:16:29.290" style="s2">decomposition of beauty and took no</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.010" end="02:16:31.960" style="s2">pleasure in the display well so you see</p>
<p begin="02:16:29.290" end="02:16:33.849" style="s2">the parallels between one story and the</p>
<p begin="02:16:31.960" end="02:16:35.620" style="s2">other they&#39;re the same they have the</p>
<p begin="02:16:33.849" end="02:16:37.780" style="s2">same underlying structure initial</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.620" end="02:16:40.000" style="s2">paradise partly childhood partly</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.780" end="02:16:42.010" style="s2">unconsciousness the emergence of</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.000" end="02:16:44.500" style="s2">knowledge of mortality into that and the</p>
<p begin="02:16:42.010" end="02:16:46.300" style="s2">demolition of the of the paradise this</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.500" end="02:16:48.420" style="s2">is the same meta story that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.300" end="02:16:51.610" style="s2">talking about all along ordered state</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.420" end="02:16:53.380" style="s2">collapse into chaos well the rest of the</p>
<p begin="02:16:51.610" end="02:16:55.269" style="s2">story is the return like in the Bible</p>
<p begin="02:16:53.380" end="02:16:59.429" style="s2">Bibles actually set up that</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.269" end="02:17:01.989" style="s2">it&#39;s collapsed into history and then a</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.429" end="02:17:03.969" style="s2">movement upward the question is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.989" end="02:17:06.880" style="s2">the movement upward that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.969" end="02:17:09.369" style="s2">here when the collapse is caused by</p>
<p begin="02:17:06.880" end="02:17:10.809" style="s2">knowledge of mortality and self caught</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.369" end="02:17:12.729" style="s2">and the emergence of self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.809" end="02:17:15.099" style="s2">and knowledge of death is there any</p>
<p begin="02:17:12.729" end="02:17:17.439" style="s2">manner in which Redemption can be</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.099" end="02:17:19.869" style="s2">attained or is that the final like is</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.439" end="02:17:22.059" style="s2">that finally is that does that finally</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.869" end="02:17:25.179" style="s2">demolish you well that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.059" end="02:17:28.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s the answer</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.179" end="02:17:31.539" style="s2">to that question that entire</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.199" end="02:17:33.699" style="s2">civilizations constantly pursue and the</p>
<p begin="02:17:31.539" end="02:17:36.189" style="s2">question is well what is the answer and</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.699" end="02:17:39.159" style="s2">part of the answer is identification</p>
<p begin="02:17:36.189" end="02:17:41.979" style="s2">with the spirit that generates order out</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.159" end="02:17:43.989" style="s2">of chaos that&#39;s the answer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.979" end="02:17:45.729" style="s2">something like that and so then the</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.989" end="02:17:48.429" style="s2">question is what does that mean well</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.729" end="02:17:50.050" style="s2">that&#39;ll be what the last two lectures in</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.429" end="02:17:53.829" style="s2">the course are about because we&#39;re down</p>
<p begin="02:17:50.050" end="02:17:58.329" style="s2">to two last lectures so any questions</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.829" end="02:18:00.609" style="s2">does it make sense more more importantly</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.329" end="02:18:03.219" style="s2">really is there is there any way in</p>
<p begin="02:18:00.609" end="02:18:05.109" style="s2">which it doesn&#39;t make sense because</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.219" end="02:18:07.929" style="s2">these stories are not supposed to make</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.109" end="02:18:10.840" style="s2">sense right that&#39;s the theory is that</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.929" end="02:18:13.239" style="s2">their archaic superstitions or something</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.840" end="02:18:14.769" style="s2">like that well it doesn&#39;t seem to me</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.239" end="02:18:17.769" style="s2">that that&#39;s the case it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="02:18:14.769" end="02:18:20.679" style="s2">they make insanely perfect sense they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.769" end="02:18:22.569" style="s2">exactly right they tell you exactly what</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.679" end="02:18:26.789" style="s2">human beings are like and exactly what</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.569" end="02:18:29.769" style="s2">the situation that we face is so and so</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.789" end="02:18:32.019" style="s2">then the question is well the diagnosis</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.769" end="02:18:36.279" style="s2">is made properly what it has the cure</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.019" end="02:18:37.689" style="s2">being properly identified well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.279" end="02:18:40.439" style="s2">what we&#39;ll discuss for the next two</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.689" end="02:18:40.439" style="s2">sessions</p>
