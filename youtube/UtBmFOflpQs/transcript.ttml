<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:34.410" style="s2">social minds he is also external faculty</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.309" end="00:00:35.850" style="s2">at the Santa Fe Institute Simon could</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.410" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">you give us a brief overview of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.850" end="00:00:40.379" style="s2">department and your lab all right well</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:43.170" style="s2">thanks Jim social decision sciences it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.379" end="00:00:44.930" style="s2">Department here at CMU where we mix</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.170" end="00:00:47.910" style="s2">together the economic and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.930" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">so we&#39;re interested in how people buy</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.910" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">and sell obviously we&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:00:54.180" style="s2">how businesses work how markets work but</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:57.690" style="s2">we&#39;re also interested in how the mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.180" end="00:00:59.550" style="s2">works and in particular how the unusual</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.690" end="00:01:01.800" style="s2">workings of the mind intersect with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">markets in ways you might not expect we</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.800" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">tend to think of ourselves at least when</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">we operate economically as rational</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:09.090" style="s2">people money is on the line and so we</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:10.979" style="s2">should behave well we mostly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.090" end="00:01:13.250" style="s2">behave well particularly when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.979" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">confronted with situations that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.250" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">somewhat counter to the things that our</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">culture evolved to handle so out of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">comes behavioral economics and this</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:24.780" style="s2">comes Thinking Fast and Slow behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.020" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">heuristics and we&#39;re interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.780" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">ways that those things go right in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:30.689" style="s2">a lot of the snap decisions we make</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">actually are pretty good and we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.689" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">interested in the way those things go</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:37.500" style="s2">wrong I come out of the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">Institute and when I was a postdoc there</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.500" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">I wanted to study the ways in which the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">way we think scales up to the way our</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.299" end="00:01:47.189" style="s2">cultures work and at the time we did not</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">have access to a psychological lab we</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.189" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do tests Mechanical Turk was</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:54.090" style="s2">pretty young and so I ended up turning</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:55.740" style="s2">to large-scale archives so things</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.090" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">sticking around in places that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.740" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">historians tend to look as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">psychologists from there we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.600" end="00:02:04.890" style="s2">working mostly in text because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">usually keep very structured records of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.890" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">stuff that happened in the past we tend</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">to write down things that people say so</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">the lab today we work on a range of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">projects some of these are contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:17.160" style="s2">so we look at online behavior we have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:19.709" style="s2">big project now on the men&#39;s seduction</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.160" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">movement with Chloe Perry we have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.709" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">project on the evolution of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:25.910" style="s2">theorems so in fact now mathematicians</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:27.570" style="s2">are able to prove their</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.910" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">essentially by writing a computer</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.570" end="00:02:30.810" style="s2">program so we can look at the syntax</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">trees and out of that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.810" end="00:02:35.820" style="s2">something more about the proof that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:37.860" style="s2">square root of two is irrational and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.820" end="00:02:39.690" style="s2">work with some really big and deep data</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.860" end="00:02:42.150" style="s2">sets so a big paper that we had last</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.690" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">year was on the French Revolution people</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.150" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">kept records and transcripts of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:48.270" style="s2">debates that were held in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">Parliament we&#39;ve looked at the long time</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.270" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">school evolution of the Criminal Court</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:53.850" style="s2">system the bureaucracy of the court is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:56.070" style="s2">much younger than the need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.850" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">solve our problems to punish people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.070" end="00:03:00.270" style="s2">do wrong and to redress things in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:03.210" style="s2">to keep society going and so in fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.270" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">most of the way we did justice certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.210" end="00:03:08.190" style="s2">before let&#39;s say the 20th century was by</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:10.680" style="s2">talking to through so in each of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.190" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">cases were looking not at a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.680" end="00:03:15.270" style="s2">so much as a set of manuscripts and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:18.360" style="s2">those manuscripts can get very very big</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.270" end="00:03:20.520" style="s2">so in the case of online behavior we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.360" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">running a model right now that has 100</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.520" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">million bulletin board posts and close</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:27.750" style="s2">to half a billion words French</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:31.080" style="s2">Revolution that long ago 40,000 speeches</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.750" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of words and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.080" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">you might say we do data science but a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:38.130" style="s2">lot of what we do actually is much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:40.860" style="s2">focused on the cognition of that process</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.130" end="00:03:42.360" style="s2">so the way people think and how the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.860" end="00:03:44.600" style="s2">people think scales up into the way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.360" end="00:03:47.550" style="s2">culture things extremely interesting I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.600" end="00:03:49.950" style="s2">my professional life back before I got</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.550" end="00:03:52.770" style="s2">involved in science most of my projects</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.950" end="00:03:56.220" style="s2">were involved in text also we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.770" end="00:03:58.800" style="s2">always in a say back in the 80s in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.220" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">small corner of Technology people</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.800" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">dealing with text right I know I wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:05.640" style="s2">couple of full text search engines back</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">in the day I wrote an automated spell</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">checker in the early days really crude</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:13.830" style="s2">automatic tagging systems for my topic</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:16.109" style="s2">etc and only in the last 15 years has</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.830" end="00:04:19.200" style="s2">text processing really come into its own</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.109" end="00:04:21.150" style="s2">yeah I think 2010 maybe we had</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.200" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">algorithms that came out in the early</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.150" end="00:04:26.310" style="s2">2000 so famously something called topic</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:28.830" style="s2">modeling and just the ability to use a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.310" end="00:04:30.300" style="s2">computer to process a large archive when</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.830" end="00:04:31.830" style="s2">it&#39;s sitting on your desk really changed</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.300" end="00:04:33.480" style="s2">things even interact directly with some</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">of the objects that come out of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.480" end="00:04:38.130" style="s2">algorithms it&#39;s funny in the end when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:38.680" style="s2">want to get something done we usually</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.130" end="00:04:40.300" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.680" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">talk it over right there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.300" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">there&#39;s the financial district and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:04:48.430" end="00:04:51.970" style="s2">more talkers than calculators I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.400" end="00:04:53.259" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.970" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">we&#39;re not very good calculators because</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.560" end="00:06:03.820" style="s2">of our algorithms that we use or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.389" end="00:06:05.979" style="s2">even 10 or 15 years old that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.820" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">you want right so if you run a chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.979" end="00:06:10.840" style="s2">Russian from in 1894 a machine you want</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.370" end="00:06:14.050" style="s2">to have a pretty good understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.840" end="00:06:15.669" style="s2">how that algorithm works so when I watch</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.050" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">what comes out of those places super</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.669" end="00:06:21.400" style="s2">exciting and at the same time untested</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:23.289" style="s2">so if something comes you know straight</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.400" end="00:06:24.759" style="s2">off the assembly line at the skunkworks</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.289" end="00:06:27.190" style="s2">right you&#39;re not gonna take that into</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.759" end="00:06:29.470" style="s2">battle just yet so we work with a b-52</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.190" end="00:06:31.060" style="s2">much more often it makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.470" end="00:06:33.099" style="s2">of course that is the problem with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.060" end="00:06:34.690" style="s2">of state-of-the-art machine learning is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.099" end="00:06:38.110" style="s2">that so much of it is now neural nets</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.690" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">right and hence a black box and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.110" end="00:06:42.430" style="s2">have the visibility the old-fashioned AI</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.430" end="00:06:46.120" style="s2">frankly the end of the day was a</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.120" end="00:06:50.470" style="s2">we no longer have the ability to even</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.760" end="00:06:52.960" style="s2">look at the code and say what its gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.470" end="00:06:56.050" style="s2">do I mean this is this is a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.960" end="00:06:57.580" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem for science right so for</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.050" end="00:06:58.630" style="s2">example if you run Russian through one</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.580" end="00:07:01.210" style="s2">of these algorithms Russian it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.630" end="00:07:03.040" style="s2">highly inflected language and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.210" end="00:07:04.870" style="s2">really know what its representation is</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.040" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">internally when it&#39;s speeding up the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.870" end="00:07:08.350" style="s2">other side instead of semantic claims</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:10.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem for science also a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.350" end="00:07:12.340" style="s2">problem for Policy right so machine</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.660" end="00:07:15.310" style="s2">learning is incredibly powerful it can</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.340" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">help us make better decisions but in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.310" end="00:07:20.229" style="s2">end we want to be able to ask the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:21.639" style="s2">who govern us the why questions like why</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.229" end="00:07:25.090" style="s2">didn&#39;t I get a mortgage what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.639" end="00:07:26.860" style="s2">problem why did you pull me over and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.090" end="00:07:28.389" style="s2">machine learning algorithm a it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.860" end="00:07:29.949" style="s2">give us a straight answer or at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.389" end="00:07:31.510" style="s2">not a neural net machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.949" end="00:07:33.820" style="s2">algorithm yeah yeah I would always want</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.510" end="00:07:36.250" style="s2">to keep this clear at the moment the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.820" end="00:07:39.270" style="s2">field is highly concentrated on neural</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.250" end="00:07:41.370" style="s2">nets personally I believe it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.270" end="00:07:43.960" style="s2">concentrated in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.370" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">particle physics was over concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.960" end="00:07:48.190" style="s2">on string theory 10 years ago and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.320" style="s2">already starting to see in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.190" end="00:07:52.300" style="s2">conversations with AI people that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.320" end="00:07:55.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a renewed interest in things</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.300" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">outside of deep learning deep neural net</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:07:59.950" style="s2">neural net reinforcement learning</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">paradigms but a lot of people when they</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.700" end="00:08:11.410" style="s2">yeah so you know Gary Marcus is a great</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.250" end="00:08:13.150" style="s2">proponent of what we I guess we still</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.410" end="00:08:15.460" style="s2">call a good old-fashioned AI right</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.150" end="00:08:16.840" style="s2">symbolic representations I will probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.460" end="00:08:18.250" style="s2">get to this in our conversation Jim</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.840" end="00:08:19.690" style="s2">right but this is perhaps the difference</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.250" end="00:08:21.940" style="s2">between biological evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.690" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">cultural evolution we&#39;re really good</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.940" end="00:08:26.199" style="s2">we&#39;re getting better now at building</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:28.570" style="s2">machines that can do things that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.199" end="00:08:30.789" style="s2">evolved to do hundreds or maybe millions</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.570" end="00:08:35.169" style="s2">of years ago recognize objects avoid</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.789" end="00:08:37.719" style="s2">obstacles we&#39;re not so good at the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.169" end="00:08:39.700" style="s2">of things that we think are hallmarks of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.719" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">our species we&#39;re not so good at</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.700" end="00:08:43.270" style="s2">programming machine to reflect upon</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:45.640" style="s2">itself for example we&#39;re not so good at</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.270" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">programming machines to communicate to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.640" end="00:08:50.380" style="s2">another machine for example in a way</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:52.630" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t require a set of protocols</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.380" end="00:08:53.340" style="s2">and a really precise specification of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.630" end="00:08:55.350" style="s2">the inputs</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.340" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">I like that that if I heard you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.350" end="00:09:00.690" style="s2">if so it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:04.730" style="s2">this suggestion that perhaps neural AI</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.690" end="00:09:08.010" style="s2">is analogous to biological evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.730" end="00:09:09.480" style="s2">symbolic AI might be analogous the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.010" end="00:09:11.730" style="s2">cultural evolutions I get there right</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.480" end="00:09:14.250" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.730" end="00:09:16.470" style="s2">learn to drive a car it&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.250" end="00:09:18.510" style="s2">learn maybe you know in our teens or in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.470" end="00:09:20.430" style="s2">our 20s there are things that children</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.510" end="00:09:24.450" style="s2">do well before they can drive a car very</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.430" end="00:09:26.490" style="s2">well than a machine still can&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.450" end="00:09:28.770" style="s2">an interesting one right it&#39;s it&#39;s a set</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.490" end="00:09:31.620" style="s2">of feedback mechanisms much stronger</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.770" end="00:09:34.200" style="s2">than the mechanisms you&#39;ll find in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.620" end="00:09:34.710" style="s2">design system like a car interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.200" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.710" end="00:09:40.260" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve also been involved with some</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.320" end="00:09:42.690" style="s2">symbolic AI of late for the last several</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.260" end="00:09:44.070" style="s2">years have been affiliated to a greater</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.690" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">or lesser degree with the OpenCog</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.070" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">project been Gert cyl and his crew and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:54.690" style="s2">they&#39;ve been working for many many years</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:56.460" style="s2">on a symbolic form of AI but it&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.690" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">and that can also include neural net as</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.460" end="00:10:00.510" style="s2">inputs and then essentially the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:02.580" style="s2">components can orchestrate non symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.510" end="00:10:04.140" style="s2">component some sense is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.580" end="00:10:06.270" style="s2">trained to do when we grow up right we</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.140" end="00:10:09.150" style="s2">have instincts we have things that work</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.270" end="00:10:11.100" style="s2">very well in a world that is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.150" end="00:10:12.330" style="s2">around and we go to school and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.100" end="00:10:13.890" style="s2">teach us a couple of symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.330" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">representations that help us get through</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.890" end="00:10:18.300" style="s2">exactly in fact the model I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:20.490" style="s2">using think about how this intersects</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.300" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">your cultural versus biological is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.490" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">the neural net components approximately</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:29.670" style="s2">congruent with perception right and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:33.180" style="s2">symbolic components are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.670" end="00:10:35.460" style="s2">analogous to Kinnaman system to type</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:37.110" style="s2">thinking right and then the system one</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.460" end="00:10:38.940" style="s2">type thinking is something in between</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.110" end="00:10:41.459" style="s2">which is a little bit less clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.940" end="00:10:42.870" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned a lot about system one</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.459" end="00:10:43.620" style="s2">from deep learning I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.870" end="00:10:44.850" style="s2">think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.620" end="00:10:47.220" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s quite amazing</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.850" end="00:10:49.740" style="s2">is when you pipe a image or a video</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.220" end="00:10:51.510" style="s2">through one of these neural networks the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.740" end="00:10:54.270" style="s2">kinds of things it does on the way to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.510" end="00:10:56.010" style="s2">producing an output is very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.270" end="00:10:58.070" style="s2">the kinds of things that happen in the</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:04.260" style="s2">into an interpretable</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.530" end="00:11:06.030" style="s2">I&#39;m very happy to see just the last year</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.260" end="00:11:07.800" style="s2">and a half more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.030" end="00:11:09.840" style="s2">expanding their perception of what</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.490" end="00:11:22.050" style="s2">in social science both right both in</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.180" end="00:11:28.350" style="s2">versus nature so you idiots the answer</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.830" end="00:11:29.700" style="s2">is obviously both we wouldn&#39;t have the</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.580" end="00:12:00.840" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have him talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.740" end="00:12:03.110" style="s2">about the Fermi paradox for those of you</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.970" end="00:12:12.450" style="s2">bomb during World War two and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.589" end="00:12:14.670" style="s2">really smart famous guys were sitting</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.450" end="00:12:16.830" style="s2">around the lunch table speculating on</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.670" end="00:12:19.710" style="s2">how many intelligent species there were</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.830" end="00:12:20.580" style="s2">in the universe and Fermi what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.710" end="00:12:23.130" style="s2">was his first name</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.580" end="00:12:25.530" style="s2">Enrico Enrico and Rico Fermi comes up to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.130" end="00:12:28.860" style="s2">them and says okay where are they right</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.530" end="00:12:31.020" style="s2">and ever since this perspective has been</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.860" end="00:12:33.510" style="s2">called the Fermi paradox which is under</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.020" end="00:12:35.000" style="s2">some reasonable sets of assumptions you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.510" end="00:12:37.290" style="s2">would assume there are many many</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.000" end="00:12:38.820" style="s2">intelligent species probably more</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.290" end="00:12:40.230" style="s2">intelligent than humans because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.820" end="00:12:42.300" style="s2">could have been around a lot longer out</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.230" end="00:12:45.960" style="s2">in the universe and yet despite our</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.300" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">looking for the last 60 70 years with</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.960" end="00:12:50.870" style="s2">growing levels of sophistication we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:54.360" style="s2">seen absolutely no sign of them and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.870" end="00:12:56.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a long list of thoughts and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.360" end="00:12:58.530" style="s2">kind of fall basically into two big</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.100" end="00:13:00.690" style="s2">categories one is they&#39;re not out there</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.530" end="00:13:02.610" style="s2">for some reason that&#39;s not obvious or</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.690" end="00:13:04.530" style="s2">maybe is obvious if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.610" end="00:13:05.820" style="s2">and then on the other side is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.530" end="00:13:07.980" style="s2">out there but they&#39;re not showing</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.820" end="00:13:10.360" style="s2">themselves or they exist in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.980" end="00:13:12.670" style="s2">not easy for us to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.360" end="00:13:14.890" style="s2">TEKT and I&#39;ve been fascinated with this</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.670" end="00:13:17.470" style="s2">question even before I knew the name of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.890" end="00:13:19.180" style="s2">it since I was probably 12 years old and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.470" end="00:13:22.209" style="s2">I read everything I can on the topic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.180" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">try to keep up on it and I thought Simon</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.209" end="00:13:26.470" style="s2">would be a great guy to give his</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">thoughts on the Fermi paradox where are</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.470" end="00:13:30.760" style="s2">the aliens aren&#39;t there any I think you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:33.100" style="s2">set me up pretty well here Jim right</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.760" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">because there are two large schools of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.100" end="00:13:36.070" style="s2">thought for those who think there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.529" end="00:13:37.990" style="s2">one out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.070" end="00:13:40.269" style="s2">Andrew Samberg has a really terrific</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.990" end="00:13:42.550" style="s2">paper where he takes essentially our</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.269" end="00:13:44.110" style="s2">best after physical knowledge sticks it</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.550" end="00:13:46.120" style="s2">through a Bayesian machine and he got</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.110" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">the other side claims this is a 15%</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.120" end="00:13:49.420" style="s2">chance given our best knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:52.060" style="s2">there is nobody out there at least not</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.420" end="00:13:55.300" style="s2">in our galaxy anders takes the Drake</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.060" end="00:13:56.950" style="s2">Equation and just tries to factor in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.300" end="00:13:58.990" style="s2">uncertainties and our uncertainties are</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.950" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">extremely large though not a bell-curve</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.990" end="00:14:03.730" style="s2">distribution right it&#39;s not that we know</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:05.260" style="s2">these facts plus or minus one we</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.730" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">probably know them plus or minus a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.260" end="00:14:08.829" style="s2">factor of 10</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:11.470" style="s2">so that really changes once you</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.829" end="00:14:13.779" style="s2">understand how weak our knowledge is of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.470" end="00:14:16.300" style="s2">say even something like planet formation</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.779" end="00:14:17.980" style="s2">you can get a lot more skeptical about</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.300" end="00:14:20.980" style="s2">the idea that they should be out there I</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.980" end="00:14:23.529" style="s2">think they are out there Jim and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.980" end="00:14:27.250" style="s2">they&#39;re actually here in a funny sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.529" end="00:14:28.930" style="s2">we know that if you stick an organism in</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.250" end="00:14:31.390" style="s2">an environment and have it evolve</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.930" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty confident that it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.390" end="00:14:36.370" style="s2">to look reasonably similar to the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:38.980" style="s2">we have around here the visual system</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.370" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">let&#39;s say of a bird is at least in its</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.980" end="00:14:43.110" style="s2">mathematical properties very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:45.459" style="s2">the visual system in a human being and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.110" end="00:14:47.050" style="s2">we were just talking about very similar</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.459" end="00:14:50.140" style="s2">to the visual system in a self-driving</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.050" end="00:14:53.740" style="s2">car so at that level I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.140" end="00:14:55.029" style="s2">they&#39;re around or if they were around we</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.740" end="00:14:58.390" style="s2">would be able to spot them pretty</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.029" end="00:15:00.820" style="s2">clearly but once you go to the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.390" end="00:15:03.459" style="s2">level once you ask who are we as</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.820" end="00:15:05.290" style="s2">thinking species you can&#39;t build a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.459" end="00:15:06.519" style="s2">faster than light drive with a deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.290" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">neural network I think you and I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.519" end="00:15:10.420" style="s2">probably agree on that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:12.610" style="s2">once you evolve the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.420" end="00:15:15.370" style="s2">representations that you need to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.610" end="00:15:17.709" style="s2">things done all bets are off when a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.370" end="00:15:20.180" style="s2">machine or a human being or any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.709" end="00:15:22.100" style="s2">creature can reflect upon itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.180" end="00:15:25.790" style="s2">what comes out the other side is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.100" end="00:15:29.029" style="s2">completely unpredictable the mines that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.790" end="00:15:30.740" style="s2">we would encounter would be to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.029" end="00:15:34.070" style="s2">things that we would have a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.740" end="00:15:36.190" style="s2">of trouble recognizing so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.070" end="00:15:39.350" style="s2">would have a great deal of difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.190" end="00:15:41.630" style="s2">recognizing the very things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.350" end="00:15:43.490" style="s2">looking for if we could go to a planet</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.630" end="00:15:44.600" style="s2">with life on it I think we&#39;d spot it</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.490" end="00:15:46.490" style="s2">pretty quickly we&#39;d have an out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.600" end="00:15:48.740" style="s2">equilibrium system there would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.490" end="00:15:50.330" style="s2">something like oxygen there be a set of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.740" end="00:15:52.970" style="s2">batteries probably coming out of their</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.330" end="00:15:55.160" style="s2">nearest arm but if we look for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.970" end="00:15:57.500" style="s2">symbolic products which is what we do</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.160" end="00:15:59.510" style="s2">when we we turn on a radio telescope</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.500" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">when we run something like the search</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.510" end="00:16:03.649" style="s2">for extraterrestrial intelligence we</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:05.600" style="s2">look for radio signals we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.649" end="00:16:08.630" style="s2">signals that would be created by</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:10.370" style="s2">something similar to a human mind if the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.630" end="00:16:12.140" style="s2">monkey says David Brin would describe</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.370" end="00:16:14.750" style="s2">the monkeys got uplifted if the Dolphins</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.140" end="00:16:17.029" style="s2">got uplifted we would probably you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.750" end="00:16:21.860" style="s2">ruff gasps we&#39;d probably be able to spot</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.029" end="00:16:26.089" style="s2">it but I think if we saw a communication</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.860" end="00:16:28.730" style="s2">from a living organism that had evolved</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.089" end="00:16:31.550" style="s2">beyond our planet I think it would</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.730" end="00:16:33.080" style="s2">probably drive us mad and my guess is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.550" end="00:16:35.660" style="s2">we&#39;re running some pretty good filters</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.080" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">to keep us outside the realm of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.660" end="00:16:39.410" style="s2">able to see them the psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:40.970" style="s2">wonder a little bit about this right why</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.410" end="00:16:42.500" style="s2">do we have such a theme of alien</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.970" end="00:16:44.089" style="s2">abductions you go back further and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.500" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">further and you look at me these are</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.089" end="00:16:48.260" style="s2">essentially religious experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:50.839" style="s2">people have those experiences tend to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.260" end="00:16:53.060" style="s2">drive people a little bit rather than so</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.839" end="00:16:55.490" style="s2">like I say I wouldn&#39;t be surprised when</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.060" end="00:16:58.400" style="s2">I was at Arecibo we had Serendip the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.490" end="00:17:00.589" style="s2">search for extraterrestrial developed</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.400" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">industrial populations right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.589" end="00:17:05.540" style="s2">a very ambitious project my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:08.209" style="s2">we&#39;re getting a lot of signals from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.540" end="00:17:10.819" style="s2">guys out there and we just don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.209" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">know what to look for interesting I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.819" end="00:17:15.260" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of surprised that there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:17.650" style="s2">mathematical techniques to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.260" end="00:17:20.809" style="s2">distinguish noise from signal</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.650" end="00:17:22.100" style="s2">irrespective of how it&#39;s encoded so this</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.809" end="00:17:23.750" style="s2">is a great one actually Chris Moore at</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.100" end="00:17:25.250" style="s2">the Santa Fe Institute this was a paper</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.750" end="00:17:28.550" style="s2">I think he wrote when he was quite young</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.250" end="00:17:30.620" style="s2">the most efficient encoding the best way</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.550" end="00:17:31.870" style="s2">to get data from one place to the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.620" end="00:17:34.360" style="s2">given a particular</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:40.990" style="s2">that means essentially is that if</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.090" end="00:17:47.710" style="s2">bulb there&#39;s a lot of inefficiencies in</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.059" end="00:17:50.200" style="s2">the way in which we transmit information</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.710" end="00:17:52.300" style="s2">right now if we&#39;re really good at it if</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.200" end="00:17:54.610" style="s2">we&#39;re able to compress what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.300" end="00:17:55.990" style="s2">say efficiently out the other side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.610" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">actually going to look purely random</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.990" end="00:17:59.290" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s thinking out loud here</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:17:59.710" style="s2">suppose the Society&#39;s a billion years</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.290" end="00:18:01.750" style="s2">old</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.710" end="00:18:04.840" style="s2">and has essentially codified huge</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.750" end="00:18:07.480" style="s2">amounts of structures of thought right</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.840" end="00:18:10.210" style="s2">and so essentially communication is</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.480" end="00:18:13.090" style="s2">really sending codes to a lookup table</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.210" end="00:18:15.610" style="s2">in this vast tree structure of thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.090" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">and knowledge and codes do look exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.610" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">like noise that they&#39;re well designed</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.230" end="00:18:22.210" style="s2">exactly I mean if there&#39;s any pattern in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">communication you should be able to use</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.210" end="00:18:25.690" style="s2">the pattern to make the communication</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:27.700" style="s2">shorter if you have a repetition you</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.690" end="00:18:29.860" style="s2">don&#39;t repeat you just make a notation</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.700" end="00:18:32.380" style="s2">yeah the Society&#39;s been old so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.860" end="00:18:34.150" style="s2">to think about if we were able to codify</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.380" end="00:18:36.250" style="s2">everything we knew over a billion years</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.150" end="00:18:38.980" style="s2">and everyone in the galaxy shared this</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.250" end="00:18:40.210" style="s2">semantic net right probably not too much</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.980" end="00:18:42.309" style="s2">it hadn&#39;t been explored in a billion</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.210" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">years other than the recombinations of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.309" end="00:18:46.000" style="s2">the things in the trees this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:47.530" style="s2">point right so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.000" end="00:18:50.020" style="s2">comes up when people talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.530" end="00:18:51.970" style="s2">Fermi paradox is the incredibly short</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.020" end="00:18:54.460" style="s2">time scale of cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.970" end="00:18:57.820" style="s2">compared to biological evolution it took</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.460" end="00:18:59.710" style="s2">us a long time to get from the sponges</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.820" end="00:19:01.900" style="s2">well this is something David Krakauer</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.710" end="00:19:03.780" style="s2">talks about right we spent a long time</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.900" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">as sponges before we really got our</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.780" end="00:19:10.030" style="s2">multicellular act together but we went</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">from you know a lifespan of 30 years no</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.030" end="00:19:15.670" style="s2">written language no cities no culture up</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:17.429" style="s2">to where we are today mastery of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.670" end="00:19:20.050" style="s2">mechanics mastery of the electron and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.429" end="00:19:21.670" style="s2">not even the blink of an eye it&#39;s a time</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.050" end="00:19:24.220" style="s2">scale on which biological evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.670" end="00:19:27.100" style="s2">almost no handle maybe lactose digestion</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.220" end="00:19:29.290" style="s2">right so the Fermi paradox says we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.100" end="00:19:31.480" style="s2">look you know if you pick a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.290" end="00:19:33.309" style="s2">at random it&#39;s really unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.480" end="00:19:36.760" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be in this very early</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.309" end="00:19:39.100" style="s2">childbirth phase so you know chances are</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.760" end="00:19:41.400" style="s2">they are millions of years old we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.100" end="00:19:44.500" style="s2">trouble predicting the next 10 years so</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.400" end="00:19:45.520" style="s2">I think on the one hand people say</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.500" end="00:19:47.170" style="s2">they&#39;re so old that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:50.140" style="s2">you know flying around the galaxy and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.170" end="00:19:52.060" style="s2">warp-drive that may be true but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.140" end="00:19:53.950" style="s2">thing that&#39;s just as old is not their</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.060" end="00:19:57.820" style="s2">technology but also their culture and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.950" end="00:20:00.130" style="s2">their minds and we have a lot of thermal</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.820" end="00:20:01.480" style="s2">sources sitting out there in the galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.130" end="00:20:04.690" style="s2">we have a lot of things that look like</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.480" end="00:20:07.210" style="s2">warm stuff and maybe some of those are</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.690" end="00:20:09.250" style="s2">broadcasting interesting you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.210" end="00:20:11.110" style="s2">typical 12 year old nerd I of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.250" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">assumed they had to be out there right</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.110" end="00:20:15.850" style="s2">and all along I always assumed they had</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:17.680" style="s2">to be out there until I started</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.850" end="00:20:20.740" style="s2">seriously researching the Fermi paradox</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.680" end="00:20:23.680" style="s2">and the arguments on both sides here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.740" end="00:20:26.260" style="s2">couple that make me go hmm this is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.680" end="00:20:28.360" style="s2">actually I kind of refined this idea in</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.260" end="00:20:31.750" style="s2">about a 4-hour conversation with Stuart</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.360" end="00:20:33.760" style="s2">Kaufman one time which is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.750" end="00:20:35.920" style="s2">obviously familiar with the era</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.760" end="00:20:38.200" style="s2">catastrophes and evolution when error</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.920" end="00:20:41.290" style="s2">rates are too high for our audience in</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.200" end="00:20:43.150" style="s2">an evolutionary system you copy things</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.290" end="00:20:44.950" style="s2">into the next generation and you copy</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.150" end="00:20:47.680" style="s2">them with a higher lower level of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.950" end="00:20:50.380" style="s2">fidelity our current DNA system is very</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.680" end="00:20:53.350" style="s2">good it&#39;s only a few errors per billion</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.380" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">until you get to that rate something</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.350" end="00:20:57.340" style="s2">close to that rate evolution doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:58.810" style="s2">work very fast you can&#39;t evolve a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.340" end="00:21:00.790" style="s2">complex structure with a high error</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.810" end="00:21:02.560" style="s2">rates called the era catastrophe I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.790" end="00:21:04.570" style="s2">remember the exact threshold level where</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.560" end="00:21:07.780" style="s2">you have to get to before it evolution</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.570" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">to take off but it&#39;s pretty high and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.780" end="00:21:13.420" style="s2">this conversation with Kaufman was all</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:16.360" style="s2">right just do what I by autocatalytic</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.420" end="00:21:18.340" style="s2">networks right which is Stuart&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.360" end="00:21:20.020" style="s2">theory on sort of the pre evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.340" end="00:21:22.270" style="s2">life that network can replicate</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.020" end="00:21:24.700" style="s2">themselves and become a standing</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.270" end="00:21:28.360" style="s2">chemical wave essentially but I said how</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.700" end="00:21:30.370" style="s2">do you go from low fidelity copying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.360" end="00:21:34.450" style="s2">this massive machinery we have in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.370" end="00:21:37.570" style="s2">DNA to have high fidelity copying which</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.450" end="00:21:39.640" style="s2">then allowed evolution to really ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.570" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">itself relatively rapidly as far as we</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.640" end="00:21:43.840" style="s2">know all the life that we know about</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.400" style="s2">today all the way back that archaea you</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.840" end="00:21:47.680" style="s2">know the most primitive bacteria they</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.400" end="00:21:49.870" style="s2">all use the high fidelity copying DNA</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.680" end="00:21:51.850" style="s2">system how did we jump from</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.870" end="00:21:54.910" style="s2">autocatalytic chemistry you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.850" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">chemistry in a warm pond to this very</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.910" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">complicated machine</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:22:02.990" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s exceedingly rare there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:05.930" style="s2">you know filters we talked about right</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.990" end="00:22:07.340" style="s2">there are big lucky accidents in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.930" end="00:22:09.530" style="s2">modern era some of our big lucky</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.340" end="00:22:12.380" style="s2">accidents are course cultural the Cuban</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.530" end="00:22:15.170" style="s2">Missile Crisis ended as with the whimper</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.380" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">not a bang I think of evolution right as</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.170" end="00:22:19.580" style="s2">a conversation among a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:21.710" style="s2">organisms right we&#39;re all sitting around</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.580" end="00:22:23.810" style="s2">a table we&#39;re talking some of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.710" end="00:22:26.360" style="s2">are better than others and maybe one way</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.810" end="00:22:27.640" style="s2">to think of the era catastrophe is how</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.360" end="00:22:31.130" style="s2">do you keep that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.640" end="00:22:33.470" style="s2">sufficiently on track and if you keep it</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.130" end="00:22:35.570" style="s2">too much on track if if the ideas aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.470" end="00:22:37.070" style="s2">coming if people are simply rehearsing</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.570" end="00:22:40.160" style="s2">and repeating what&#39;s come before nothing</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.070" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">happens but if that group starts moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.160" end="00:22:43.490" style="s2">too quickly it becomes chaotic you leave</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:45.650" style="s2">the room at the end of the day and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.490" end="00:22:47.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got nothing done and so there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.650" end="00:22:50.330" style="s2">a balance there&#39;s a balance between</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.000" end="00:22:52.910" style="s2">change and comprehensibility there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.330" end="00:22:54.980" style="s2">balance between making sure your body</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.910" end="00:22:56.870" style="s2">plan looks roughly like my body plan</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.980" end="00:22:58.460" style="s2">right the old joke is you know if a cow</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.870" end="00:23:00.010" style="s2">gives birth to a calf and you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.460" end="00:23:02.660" style="s2">seen a calf that looks like that before</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.010" end="00:23:06.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not going well for that calf right</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.660" end="00:23:09.320" style="s2">so we need some stability but we also</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.380" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">need evolvability we need the chance for</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.320" end="00:23:12.830" style="s2">things to change and that change is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:15.950" style="s2">always stressful most mutations are</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.830" end="00:23:18.050" style="s2">horrific events for us but once in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.950" end="00:23:18.710" style="s2">while someone takes a hit for the good</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.710" end="00:23:23.570" style="s2">so to speak and off the other side we</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:25.610" style="s2">get something new great well I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.570" end="00:23:27.110" style="s2">that&#39;s it for Fermi paradox we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.610" end="00:23:29.750" style="s2">going to solve it today but very</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.110" end="00:23:33.680" style="s2">interesting topic but let&#39;s pick up this</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.750" end="00:23:35.450" style="s2">idea of noise versus coherence right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.680" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about social</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.450" end="00:23:40.310" style="s2">media right and I know you&#39;ve done some</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:41.810" style="s2">work on block lists if you could tell us</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.310" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">what block lists are and how they relate</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.810" end="00:23:46.730" style="s2">the social media and maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:48.500" style="s2">speculation about their goods and/or</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.730" end="00:23:51.290" style="s2">they&#39;re not so good right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.500" end="00:23:53.150" style="s2">we&#39;re a 99% speculation lab right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.290" end="00:23:55.580" style="s2">then maybe once every hundred days we</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.060" end="00:24:03.530" style="s2">evolution sped up by factors of hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.610" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">tens of thousands and that&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.530" end="00:24:07.860" style="s2">very very quickly you know Wired</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:09.990" style="s2">magazine I was a junkie</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.860" end="00:24:11.549" style="s2">the stuff in the 90s Wired magazine it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.990" end="00:24:12.929" style="s2">puts out an idea right you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.549" end="00:24:14.520" style="s2">William gives some rights that article</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.929" end="00:24:17.549" style="s2">and you read it and it blows your mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.520" end="00:24:19.140" style="s2">and you do something with it but in</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.140" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">system if I want to take Gibson&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.330" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">and do something with it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:25.830" style="s2">let&#39;s say I read a letter back to Wired</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:27.720" style="s2">okay that you know the magazine comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.830" end="00:24:30.390" style="s2">out I go to the store I buy it I write</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.390" end="00:24:33.870" style="s2">pick it up they write something so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.520" end="00:24:35.160" style="s2">know it takes about a month let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.870" end="00:24:37.770" style="s2">takes about you that&#39;s the time scale in</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.770" end="00:24:41.070" style="s2">scales a minute right you know if</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.070" end="00:24:45.210" style="s2">something I can get right back as soon</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.230" end="00:24:47.970" style="s2">as I see it 53 seconds after he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.210" end="00:24:51.059" style="s2">written it and so if you look at what</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.970" end="00:24:53.730" style="s2">the time scale factor right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.059" end="00:24:55.410" style="s2">by how many factors have we sped up</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.730" end="00:24:56.549" style="s2">cultural evolution to go from a</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.429" end="00:25:25.049" style="s2">has to change we can look in the past</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:28.380" style="s2">and what we see is a movie on incredible</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.820" end="00:27:01.220" style="s2">but and this gets to your question both</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.029" end="00:27:02.330" style="s2">directly after a long detour what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.220" end="00:27:05.299" style="s2">seeing now I think is people</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:16.549" style="s2">awhile for example we worked on</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.309" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">Wikipedia Wikipedia is as probably with</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:21.500" style="s2">something that works in practice but not</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.490" end="00:27:24.429" style="s2">in theory and we don&#39;t have a good</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:36.500" style="s2">unfairness it has rebels that has</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.590" end="00:27:40.309" style="s2">protests but Wikipedia probably was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.500" end="00:27:42.470" style="s2">first example of the post soup era for</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.309" end="00:27:45.860" style="s2">social media for social interaction</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.470" end="00:27:48.200" style="s2">online we had maybe okay early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.860" end="00:27:49.640" style="s2">people imported the structures from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.200" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">institutions around them which were</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.640" end="00:27:53.450" style="s2">mostly university institutions people</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:55.159" style="s2">were online because they were at a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.450" end="00:27:57.110" style="s2">university they got their account there</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.159" end="00:28:00.289" style="s2">AOL comes along and the system</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.110" end="00:28:02.210" style="s2">completely decomposes right so those of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.289" end="00:28:04.909" style="s2">us of a certain age talk about eternal</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.210" end="00:28:07.809" style="s2">September the day when the new people</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.909" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">came and they never stopped coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.809" end="00:28:13.640" style="s2">Wikipedia was able to handle that new</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:15.679" style="s2">era and we&#39;re very curious about</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.640" end="00:28:18.380" style="s2">essentially what we think of as a common</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.679" end="00:28:21.649" style="s2">law system that emerged it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.380" end="00:28:24.590" style="s2">Napoleonic top-down code Sibyl it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.649" end="00:28:26.600" style="s2">much more informal way of resolving</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.590" end="00:28:27.950" style="s2">disputes but not just resolving disputes</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.600" end="00:28:30.500" style="s2">keeping the system</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.950" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">running finding ways to provide</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.500" end="00:28:34.850" style="s2">restorative as opposed to retributive</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">justice so okay let&#39;s go into Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.850" end="00:28:39.860" style="s2">right so Twitter is in some sense even</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:42.320" style="s2">more difficult to run than Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.860" end="00:28:43.700" style="s2">Wikipedia always had a goal right no one</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.320" end="00:28:44.929" style="s2">was quite sure what that goal was but</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.700" end="00:28:46.970" style="s2">they all knew they had a goal and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.929" end="00:28:49.639" style="s2">sometimes they fight over it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.970" end="00:28:52.190" style="s2">quite clear what Twitter&#39;s goal is and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.639" end="00:28:54.409" style="s2">so out the other side people have</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.190" end="00:28:57.620" style="s2">produced mechanisms for forming</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.409" end="00:29:00.289" style="s2">societies for forming groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.620" end="00:29:03.370" style="s2">reasonably stable even in the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.289" end="00:29:05.899" style="s2">a of an idea of where this is all going</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.370" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">one of the things that we noticed and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.899" end="00:29:09.649" style="s2">this is partly just being online but</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:11.659" style="s2">it&#39;s also partly talking to people what</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.649" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">we call qualitative research what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.659" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">noticed is this new phenomenon of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:20.029" style="s2">bottom-up censorship we&#39;re used to let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:22.190" style="s2">say Facebook or Twitter cutting people</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.029" end="00:29:24.860" style="s2">out of a conversation their corporations</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.190" end="00:29:28.760" style="s2">they have to do it right you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.860" end="00:29:30.260" style="s2">a free speech zone online if that</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.760" end="00:29:33.049" style="s2">company also has to answer to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.260" end="00:29:35.450" style="s2">shareholders and to the people who could</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.049" end="00:29:37.490" style="s2">sue them if they have to answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.450" end="00:29:39.919" style="s2">advertisers it&#39;s just not possible right</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.490" end="00:29:41.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not the Agora it&#39;s something far</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.919" end="00:29:43.159" style="s2">more like a cafe right if you go into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.510" end="00:29:46.010" style="s2">cafe and start saying some weird stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.159" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">you&#39;ll find yourself kicked out so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.010" end="00:29:50.570" style="s2">used to the top-down censorship what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:53.149" style="s2">started to notice was the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.570" end="00:29:55.429" style="s2">what are called block lists so on</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.149" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">Twitter you know give a few and I really</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.429" end="00:29:59.870" style="s2">get into it at some point you might</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:01.820" style="s2">decide to block me right and so blocking</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.870" end="00:30:03.889" style="s2">is the individual level version of</p>

<p begin="00:33:26.120" end="00:33:30.230" style="s2">they had these were things he dialed up</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.190" end="00:33:32.000" style="s2">right they were the local kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.230" end="00:33:34.220" style="s2">to remember from the wargames era and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:36.050" style="s2">they didn&#39;t even developed a packet</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.220" end="00:33:37.490" style="s2">switching mechanism people would dial up</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.250" end="00:48:15.230" style="s2">tragedy now that would be very hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.890" end="00:48:16.190" style="s2">and very good alright let&#39;s move on to</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:26.260" style="s2">scientific minds of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.030" end="00:48:29.090" style="s2">recently died I guess was last week and</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.260" end="00:48:31.930" style="s2">just an amazing character when I showed</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.090" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">up at the Santa Fe Institute in 2002 and</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.930" end="00:48:36.830" style="s2">Murray at that time was probably 70</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:39.770" style="s2">something like that and was still</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.830" end="00:48:42.980" style="s2">probably the second smartest person I</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.770" end="00:48:54.500" style="s2">had ever met who counted again who&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.980" end="00:48:57.230" style="s2">beats Mary Smith and this is at age 70</p>

<p begin="00:49:04.250" end="00:49:08.030" style="s2">people you know you want to know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.330" end="00:49:10.040" style="s2">humans 2.0 might sort of look like go</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.030" end="00:49:11.360" style="s2">talk to Eric right yeah well Eric Eric</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.040" end="00:49:12.950" style="s2">if he&#39;s if he&#39;s hearing this he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.950" end="00:49:16.970" style="s2">these these advanced mental technologies</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.380" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">also come with a high level of humility</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.970" end="00:49:25.090" style="s2">in his case you know Murray is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:29.210" style="s2">it&#39;s you know I a lot of us we were very</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.090" end="00:49:34.070" style="s2">sad to see Murray go I showed up at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.210" end="00:49:36.560" style="s2">Institute and Murray was sharp as you</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.070" end="00:49:39.020" style="s2">ever wanted somebody who loves it</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.560" end="00:49:40.700" style="s2">not just won a Nobel Prize but one sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.020" end="00:49:43.140" style="s2">of one of the you know if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.700" end="00:49:44.970" style="s2">Nobel Prize for Nobel Prizes I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.140" end="00:49:47.210" style="s2">would have had a pretty strong shot at</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.670" end="00:50:52.830" style="s2">human mind was I would say just as much</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.460" end="00:50:54.300" style="s2">off the scale Murray was somebody he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.830" end="00:50:56.130" style="s2">involved in the MacArthur Genius grant</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.300" end="00:50:58.590" style="s2">for many years he was one of the first</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.590" end="00:51:03.420" style="s2">know him Jim Cormac McCarthy was one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">the first recipients of an award that</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.420" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">changed his life he&#39;d written suitry but</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:11.190" style="s2">he his greatest work was in the future</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:13.140" style="s2">and without question Murray was involved</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.190" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">in that decision we never know right</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.140" end="00:51:17.700" style="s2">these guys are pretty secretive about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:21.420" style="s2">but to be able to spot a talent like</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.700" end="00:51:23.130" style="s2">Cormac McCarthy that early Richard</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.420" end="00:51:26.940" style="s2">Fineman gonna done that right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.130" end="00:51:31.170" style="s2">Mary was he he had a vision that along</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.940" end="00:51:34.140" style="s2">artistic lines along human lines that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.170" end="00:51:36.780" style="s2">think I&#39;ve never seen a scientist with</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.140" end="00:51:39.750" style="s2">that with that level of ability we love</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.780" end="00:51:42.120" style="s2">the the wacky fireman character right we</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.750" end="00:51:44.610" style="s2">love the fact that he had a really thick</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.120" end="00:51:46.020" style="s2">Brooklyn accent Murray can rub people</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.610" end="00:51:49.050" style="s2">the wrong way who used to rub people the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.020" end="00:51:51.840" style="s2">wrong way because he also to a great</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.050" end="00:51:54.090" style="s2">deal about your mind as well but I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.840" end="00:51:55.510" style="s2">he&#39;s Murray I think is due for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.090" end="00:51:58.990" style="s2">reevaluation in the coming</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.510" end="00:52:00.550" style="s2">I was always amazed at his breath he has</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.990" end="00:52:03.280" style="s2">a dinner companion he could talk on</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.550" end="00:52:06.700" style="s2">almost any topic in amazed as you say</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:08.530" style="s2">both cultured and erudite at the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.700" end="00:52:10.600" style="s2">time right to this degree there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.530" end="00:52:12.580" style="s2">difference between the two but the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.600" end="00:52:15.190" style="s2">interesting thing about him and unlike</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.580" end="00:52:17.620" style="s2">other some other characters like that he</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.190" end="00:52:19.030" style="s2">was happy to admit he was wrong on three</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.620" end="00:52:21.100" style="s2">occasions when I was having a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.030" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">with Murray he somehow wandered into one</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.100" end="00:52:25.570" style="s2">of my patches and made some strong</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:27.040" style="s2">statement and I took him through the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.570" end="00:52:29.650" style="s2">thinking and the logic in the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.040" end="00:52:31.660" style="s2">and he said you&#39;re right I was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.650" end="00:52:34.870" style="s2">three times I mean you know people of</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.660" end="00:52:37.840" style="s2">Murray&#39;s sort to do that I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.870" end="00:52:40.180" style="s2">really is was intellectually honest in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.840" end="00:52:42.190" style="s2">deep and fundamental way as well as</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.180" end="00:52:44.050" style="s2">unbelievably broad I mean there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.190" end="00:52:46.030" style="s2">no topic you could bring up that Murray</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.050" end="00:52:48.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a reasonably informed</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.030" end="00:52:50.530" style="s2">perspective and a surprisingly large</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.190" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">body of information about how you kill</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.530" end="00:52:54.520" style="s2">your crusher like you know Barry got a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:58.570" style="s2">defined wines right forget it right your</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.520" end="00:53:02.140" style="s2">duck right I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll drink Jameson</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.570" end="00:53:04.450" style="s2">you know it&#39;s Murray I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.140" end="00:53:05.770" style="s2">modern era right we have and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.450" end="00:53:07.870" style="s2">people online you look at people in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.770" end="00:53:10.210" style="s2">newspapers I think the basic split here</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.870" end="00:53:11.380" style="s2">is between debaters and thinkers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.210" end="00:53:13.750" style="s2">really fun to watch a really good</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.380" end="00:53:16.630" style="s2">debater just crush something right but</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.750" end="00:53:19.750" style="s2">if you are good at debating you&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.630" end="00:53:23.590" style="s2">at defending a set of ideas that may be</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.750" end="00:53:27.730" style="s2">wrong and the the way to lose the debate</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.590" end="00:53:30.580" style="s2">is to say well Chris hasn&#39;t thought of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.730" end="00:53:33.070" style="s2">that you might be right that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.580" end="00:53:34.660" style="s2">debate move that&#39;s gonna keep you on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.070" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">podcast it&#39;s not a debate movies gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.660" end="00:53:40.570" style="s2">keep you on a TV show</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:42.730" style="s2">Murray was not a debater right he was</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.570" end="00:53:46.750" style="s2">not somebody who&#39;d come in with an idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.730" end="00:53:50.070" style="s2">and you know walk all over anybody he</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.750" end="00:53:53.650" style="s2">was a thinker and he was somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.070" end="00:53:55.930" style="s2">great to have at a dinner party great to</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.650" end="00:53:59.590" style="s2">have on a long hike but he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.930" end="00:54:02.260" style="s2">somebody who would have the you know 50</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.590" end="00:54:03.700" style="s2">million follower account on social media</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.260" end="00:54:05.319" style="s2">I think that&#39;s probably correct though</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.700" end="00:54:06.819" style="s2">he did have one</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.319" end="00:54:09.099" style="s2">item that I was aware of that he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.819" end="00:54:14.049" style="s2">very doctrinaire about which his hatred</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.099" end="00:54:15.579" style="s2">of mathematicians came from I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.049" end="00:54:17.829" style="s2">because obviously the boy was</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.579" end="00:54:20.109" style="s2">extraordinarily talented now in</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.829" end="00:54:22.239" style="s2">mathematically with in any kind of</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.239" end="00:54:27.959" style="s2">throws well this I mean you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.109" end="00:54:30.430" style="s2">one thing he had firemen had in common</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.959" end="00:54:32.049" style="s2">Marie I mean okay what a Marie Jeremy</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.430" end="00:54:34.569" style="s2">did many things I think sis of course he</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.049" end="00:54:36.219" style="s2">he developed the mathematics behind the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.569" end="00:54:38.259" style="s2">structure of the proton right he</p>

<p begin="00:54:44.469" end="00:54:47.349" style="s2">understanding is Marie just had to dig</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.819" end="00:54:49.690" style="s2">that out of a squirrel&#39;s of ancient</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.349" end="00:54:51.910" style="s2">wisdom right the mathematicians the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.690" end="00:54:54.029" style="s2">they deal with the objects that</p>

<p begin="00:54:56.619" end="00:55:00.219" style="s2">physics major in college and being a</p>

<p begin="00:55:00.219" end="00:55:03.699" style="s2">everything and so a bunch of us took the</p>

<p begin="00:55:03.699" end="00:55:09.759" style="s2">allowed to take math 55 and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.329" end="00:55:11.829" style="s2">studied what&#39;s called real analysis</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.759" end="00:55:14.049" style="s2">right so it&#39;s just stuff you draw right</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.829" end="00:55:17.319" style="s2">it&#39;s like curvy lines straight lines</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.049" end="00:55:19.660" style="s2">with an x and a y and as a physicist you</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.319" end="00:55:21.400" style="s2">understand those things very well and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.660" end="00:55:24.099" style="s2">I was like well how hard can this be</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.400" end="00:55:26.259" style="s2">we had a textbook we called it Rudin</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.099" end="00:55:28.509" style="s2">after the author and you know you would</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.259" end="00:55:30.459" style="s2">not believe the bizarre and unpleasant</p>

<p begin="00:56:11.140" end="00:56:14.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense because how do</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.699" end="00:56:16.059" style="s2">they do it they do some you know crazy</p>

<p begin="00:56:20.690" end="00:56:24.170" style="s2">count the atoms and I tell you they you</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.270" end="00:56:52.579" style="s2">revolutions sort of broadly construed</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.220" end="00:56:54.710" style="s2">over a very long time period yes so</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.579" end="00:56:57.710" style="s2">biological evolution what does it do one</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.710" end="00:57:00.859" style="s2">of the great one-liners is that your</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.710" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">body is a really great model of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.859" end="00:57:04.760" style="s2">world that you encounter right you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:06.680" style="s2">feet that you walk on because we have a</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.680" end="00:57:10.430" style="s2">have a bilateral symmetry as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.020" end="00:57:12.410" style="s2">radial symmetry because you don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.430" end="00:57:13.790" style="s2">underwater right you know you have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.410" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">left hand on the right hand but not an</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.790" end="00:57:21.050" style="s2">op hand in the down hand so you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:22.730" style="s2">think of yourself as a story about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.050" end="00:57:26.660" style="s2">world and in particular story about the</p>

<p begin="00:57:26.660" end="00:57:31.339" style="s2">a great extent now as a model of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.210" end="00:57:33.829" style="s2">biological world as well so your your</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.339" end="00:57:35.589" style="s2">body is has a really good theory about</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.829" end="00:57:38.240" style="s2">small things that make you sick as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.589" end="00:57:40.910" style="s2">that&#39;s biology right that&#39;s the physical</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.240" end="00:57:41.390" style="s2">stuff that you really can&#39;t change very</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.910" end="00:57:43.339" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.390" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">you can replace parts of a gym right but</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.339" end="00:57:50.180" style="s2">by a larger your body plan is fixed so</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:53.060" style="s2">what is cultural evolution what does it</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.180" end="00:57:55.430" style="s2">do for us the underlying mechanism is</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.060" end="00:57:57.740" style="s2">the same Darwin spotted this really</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.430" end="00:58:01.550" style="s2">early on the underlying mechanism is we</p>

<p begin="00:58:01.550" end="00:58:07.819" style="s2">alter the DNA mechanism for us is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.900" end="00:58:10.730" style="s2">human brain far more complicated right</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.819" end="00:58:13.280" style="s2">your DNA has these ribosomes they they</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.730" end="00:58:15.680" style="s2">make a copy or they they translate the</p>

<p begin="00:58:15.680" end="00:58:20.270" style="s2">your brain is the ribosome for culture</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.170" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">it translates internal representations</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.270" end="00:58:25.730" style="s2">into actions behaviors and speech it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:28.140" style="s2">far more complicated but underlying all</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.730" end="00:58:30.840" style="s2">of that is the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.140" end="00:58:34.160" style="s2">most of what we see around us is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.840" end="00:58:36.990" style="s2">product of we know not who right</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.160" end="00:58:38.820" style="s2">who-who made this language who made the</p>

<p begin="00:58:38.820" end="00:58:46.230" style="s2">who made the idea of a building with</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.230" end="00:58:50.730" style="s2">what extent they&#39;re reasonably adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.840" end="00:58:54.660" style="s2">as we say right windows keep the heat in</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.730" end="00:58:56.730" style="s2">and but the rain out and let the light</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.660" end="00:58:58.950" style="s2">through but you know they can&#39;t get too</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.730" end="00:59:00.360" style="s2">big or you the room will get too hot so</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.950" end="00:59:02.520" style="s2">in some sense a lot of our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.360" end="00:59:05.310" style="s2">adaptive and there&#39;s some really fun</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.520" end="00:59:07.380" style="s2">stories of you know the the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.310" end="00:59:09.480" style="s2">which even things as basic as our</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.380" end="00:59:11.940" style="s2">language are adaptive to the climates in</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.480" end="00:59:14.790" style="s2">which that language evolved Italian has</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.940" end="00:59:17.220" style="s2">a different pattern than Swedish in part</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.790" end="00:59:19.080" style="s2">because Italians are speaking in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.220" end="00:59:20.580" style="s2">country that&#39;s much warmer you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.080" end="00:59:22.680" style="s2">have to be in such close quarters you</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.580" end="00:59:24.870" style="s2">can stand further apart it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.680" end="00:59:26.580" style="s2">probably why we gesture a lot as being</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.870" end="00:59:27.990" style="s2">half italian-american because you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.580" end="00:59:30.360" style="s2">when you&#39;re that far away from somebody</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.990" end="00:59:32.010" style="s2">and that on the patio right you need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.360" end="00:59:34.980" style="s2">really really need to show what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.010" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">saying so you know some of this is it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.980" end="00:59:39.540" style="s2">adaptation to the physical world but</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">some of it is adaptation to the very</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.540" end="00:59:45.660" style="s2">nature of knowledge I secretly as an X</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:47.820" style="s2">physicist I&#39;m a plate inist right I</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.660" end="00:59:51.390" style="s2">think there are underlying structures to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.820" end="00:59:53.970" style="s2">the thanks Jim yeah people can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.390" end="00:59:57.540" style="s2">here your large Italian gestures right</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.970" end="00:59:59.730" style="s2">now but you know when I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.540" end="01:00:01.170" style="s2">development of let&#39;s say of political</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.730" end="01:00:03.780" style="s2">systems are working with Alexander</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.170" end="01:00:06.210" style="s2">Barron and a group in Indiana when we</p>

<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:21.360" style="s2">run the pension system and if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.710" end="01:00:22.920" style="s2">dismantle the church someone&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.360" end="01:00:24.440" style="s2">keep records so that all the gold</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.920" end="01:00:27.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t disappear into someone&#39;s pocket</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.060" end="01:00:31.710" style="s2">Rebecca Spang who&#39;s historian and I know</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.830" end="01:00:33.420" style="s2">her view on the French Revolution is in</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.710" end="01:00:35.120" style="s2">part the idea that we&#39;ve neglected some</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.420" end="01:00:37.180" style="s2">of that stuff right well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.120" end="01:00:40.490" style="s2">rack you know think about the stupid</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.180" end="01:00:42.290" style="s2"> that we did in Iraq right literally</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.490" end="01:00:44.450" style="s2">the money did disappear the pensions</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.290" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">were gone they go yeah they go back to</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.450" end="01:00:49.220" style="s2">the City of London mostly exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:51.110" style="s2">so yeah so you know some of that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.220" end="01:00:52.520" style="s2">is adaptation to circumstances right the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.110" end="01:00:54.440" style="s2">holder evolution I went declares war</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.520" end="01:00:57.620" style="s2">that you&#39;ve gotta run there&#39;s got some</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.440" end="01:01:00.380" style="s2">problems but I also see the story of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.620" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">French Revolution the story of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.380" end="01:01:04.360" style="s2">Soviet era something we have under study</p>

<p begin="01:01:04.360" end="01:01:10.660" style="s2">evolution of theater I see these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.190" end="01:01:14.420" style="s2">as in part humankind&#39;s contact with</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.660" end="01:01:17.390" style="s2">basic objects of sense and knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.420" end="01:01:20.030" style="s2">that there is such a thing as alley</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.030" end="01:01:24.560" style="s2">social construction that&#39;s propagated by</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.970" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">the fact that Marie was supercharging</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.560" end="01:01:30.800" style="s2">and had a twinkle in his eye right that</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:32.990" style="s2">what we see is our adaptation to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.800" end="01:01:34.520" style="s2">invisible we see in the French</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.990" end="01:01:36.230" style="s2">Revolution for example people</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.520" end="01:01:39.980" style="s2">encountering some of the most basic</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.230" end="01:01:41.810" style="s2">ideas of ethical behavior unlike the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.980" end="01:01:42.830" style="s2">Americans the French hold a revolution</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.810" end="01:01:46.250" style="s2">and one of the first things they do is</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.830" end="01:01:48.140" style="s2">bring slaves to us today this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.250" end="01:01:50.870" style="s2">something that we expect people to</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.140" end="01:01:52.730" style="s2">understand we don&#39;t think of slavery as</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.870" end="01:01:56.360" style="s2">something that hey one context is by</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.730" end="01:01:59.540" style="s2">another context not so fine so when we</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.360" end="01:02:01.520" style="s2">look at what people are doing what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.540" end="01:02:05.450" style="s2">most interested in is the way that they</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.520" end="01:02:08.470" style="s2">deform their minds in response to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.450" end="01:02:14.590" style="s2">invisible expand on that look okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.470" end="01:02:17.510" style="s2">a lovely statement okay so all right so</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.590" end="01:02:19.970" style="s2">here&#39;s one right this is this is unusual</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.510" end="01:02:21.890" style="s2">project we have with Kent Chang so Kent</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.970" end="01:02:23.300" style="s2">joined us I said what do you wanna work</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.890" end="01:02:26.180" style="s2">out and Kent say you know I want to work</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.300" end="01:02:29.900" style="s2">on theater and I want to work on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.180" end="01:02:31.310" style="s2">fact that theater is famously a endeavor</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.900" end="01:02:33.830" style="s2">that gay people are drawn to in</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.310" end="01:02:35.780" style="s2">particular gay men right and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.830" end="01:02:37.850" style="s2">interested in the idea that let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.780" end="01:02:40.070" style="s2">take someone like Oscar Wilde right as</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.850" end="01:02:43.220" style="s2">gay as they come Oscar Wilde writes</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.070" end="01:02:44.690" style="s2">plays that are heterosexual romances</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.220" end="01:02:45.619" style="s2">right famously The Importance of Being</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.690" end="01:02:48.140" style="s2">Earnest</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.619" end="01:02:49.490" style="s2">is on the surface about two men who fall</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.140" end="01:02:51.799" style="s2">in love with two women and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.490" end="01:02:53.420" style="s2">nuts and they&#39;re all you know eating you</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.799" end="01:02:56.599" style="s2">know cucumber sandwiches with the edges</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.420" end="01:02:59.390" style="s2">cut off and what we ended up looking for</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.599" end="01:03:03.559" style="s2">is the ways in which Oscar Wilde is</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.390" end="01:03:05.749" style="s2">encoding human relationships that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.559" end="01:03:07.190" style="s2">fundamentally different from the surface</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.749" end="01:03:10.190" style="s2">that he&#39;s describing right on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.190" end="01:03:14.710" style="s2">surface these are really normative I</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.190" end="01:03:16.730" style="s2">would convention convention top recently</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.710" end="01:03:18.200" style="s2">our local shake we have a great</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.730" end="01:03:19.940" style="s2">Shakespeare Theatre in Staunton Virginia</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.200" end="01:03:22.460" style="s2">the American Shakespeare Center and they</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.940" end="01:03:23.960" style="s2">also occasionally put on other plays and</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.460" end="01:03:25.400" style="s2">they happen to put on The Importance of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.960" end="01:03:27.559" style="s2">Being Earnest about two years ago I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.400" end="01:03:29.539" style="s2">never seen it and it was like alright</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.559" end="01:03:31.099" style="s2">this is like a beautiful clockwork piece</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.539" end="01:03:32.749" style="s2">of machinery right I mean it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.099" end="01:03:35.450" style="s2">unbelievable play and I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.749" end="01:03:36.980" style="s2">clockwork is a nice point right you look</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.450" end="01:03:38.390" style="s2">at a clock face and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.980" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">something behind it it looks nothing</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.390" end="01:03:43.400" style="s2">like numbers and enhance right so you</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.079" end="01:03:45.049" style="s2">know what is Oscar Wilde doing well like</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.400" end="01:03:46.940" style="s2">the the simple thing to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.049" end="01:03:48.319" style="s2">and both Kent and I think this is is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.940" end="01:03:50.299" style="s2">the case but the simple thing to say is</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.319" end="01:03:52.130" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of subtle code</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.299" end="01:03:53.749" style="s2">sitting in here right you know there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.130" end="01:03:55.369" style="s2">some bits of slang that if you were a</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.749" end="01:03:56.720" style="s2">certain type of guy and you were you</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.369" end="01:03:58.759" style="s2">know in a certain social world you</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.720" end="01:04:00.710" style="s2">understood that he was saying a couple</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.759" end="01:04:03.230" style="s2">things that were not exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.710" end="01:04:04.819" style="s2">straightest things in the world but we</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.230" end="01:04:06.739" style="s2">think it&#39;s pretty limiting to view</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.819" end="01:04:09.380" style="s2">something like The Importance of Being</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.739" end="01:04:12.079" style="s2">Earnest as simply an encryption of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.380" end="01:04:15.529" style="s2">something else what we think he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.079" end="01:04:17.029" style="s2">and we see this in not just in earnest</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.529" end="01:04:19.489" style="s2">but in a long tradition that includes</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.029" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">some people like Tennessee Williams we</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.489" end="01:04:26.420" style="s2">see wild imagining new ways for people</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:28.579" style="s2">to be together and not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.420" end="01:04:30.259" style="s2">sexual right we see Oscar Wilde is</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.579" end="01:04:32.180" style="s2">working out the terms of a male</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.259" end="01:04:35.059" style="s2">friendship for example and you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.180" end="01:04:37.400" style="s2">Wilde when he began was not with</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.059" end="01:04:40.009" style="s2">somebody who thought mostly about how</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.400" end="01:04:43.119" style="s2">people relate to each other so what we</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.009" end="01:04:46.039" style="s2">see him doing is finding ways or</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.119" end="01:04:49.519" style="s2">describing and implicitly projecting</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.039" end="01:04:51.950" style="s2">onto the stage modes of being that today</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.519" end="01:04:54.769" style="s2">we might even take for granted so for</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.950" end="01:04:56.839" style="s2">example the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.769" end="01:04:58.339" style="s2">the idea that people sexualities are</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.839" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">more fluid than we would expect is</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.339" end="01:05:02.449" style="s2">something that we see there we see both</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.079" end="01:05:04.489" style="s2">examples in the two main male characters</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.449" end="01:05:07.309" style="s2">whilst discovering something he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.489" end="01:05:10.400" style="s2">discovering in those plays he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.309" end="01:05:12.499" style="s2">discovering facts about how humans can</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.400" end="01:05:14.479" style="s2">be together how humans can form</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.499" end="01:05:17.380" style="s2">relationships these are possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.479" end="01:05:20.509" style="s2">that he both creates and runs across</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.380" end="01:05:22.130" style="s2">Daniel Bernstein who writes his library</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.509" end="01:05:24.469" style="s2">to Congress has written a couple books</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.130" end="01:05:25.549" style="s2">great a story on it he has a book called</p>

<p begin="01:05:33.709" end="01:05:39.109" style="s2">another sense I think we can view</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.809" end="01:05:42.349" style="s2">artists also as discoverers they learn</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.109" end="01:05:45.169" style="s2">things about our minds and tell us about</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.349" end="01:05:47.630" style="s2">our minds in ways that have massive</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.169" end="01:05:50.299" style="s2">downstream consequences they they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.630" end="01:05:52.969" style="s2">just you know it&#39;s Kurt Cobain didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:05:52.969" end="01:05:59.719" style="s2">something that disappeared but he also</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.789" end="01:06:02.569" style="s2">created cognitive patterns that enlarged</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.719" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">our ability as a species and in order</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.569" end="01:06:07.339" style="s2">for that to happen there had to be some</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:10.069" style="s2">contact with the real something beyond</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.339" end="01:06:11.979" style="s2">just the idea that we all agree to say</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.069" end="01:06:13.880" style="s2">the thing that we all agree the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.979" end="01:06:15.979" style="s2">interesting so that one law we could</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.880" end="01:06:18.829" style="s2">talk about an unfolding it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.979" end="01:06:20.539" style="s2">that culture is at any given time X but</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.829" end="01:06:22.969" style="s2">there&#39;s an opportunity and it happens</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.539" end="01:06:25.249" style="s2">constantly to unfold into new areas</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.969" end="01:06:27.469" style="s2">right you know one of the things like</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.249" end="01:06:30.199" style="s2">look back at our ear I find amazingly</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.469" end="01:06:32.959" style="s2">interesting is how rapidly point of view</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.199" end="01:06:35.089" style="s2">about homosexuality has changed you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.959" end="01:06:38.059" style="s2">Stonewall&#39;s was not that long ago right</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.089" end="01:06:40.609" style="s2">and now gay marriage is accepted</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.059" end="01:06:42.890" style="s2">everywhere and frankly by almost</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.609" end="01:06:45.229" style="s2">everybody under the age of 35 right and</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.890" end="01:06:47.929" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t would have never guessed it</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.229" end="01:06:49.969" style="s2">you know in say 1985 that this could</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.929" end="01:06:51.739" style="s2">happen so quickly but it&#39;s a broader</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.969" end="01:06:53.509" style="s2">unfolding because it actually fits</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.739" end="01:06:56.809" style="s2">perfectly well with the Declaration of</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.509" end="01:06:59.720" style="s2">Independence right all men of course</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.809" end="01:07:02.330" style="s2">created equal women that&#39;s add them to</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.720" end="01:07:05.090" style="s2">I mean that is why when you think about</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.330" end="01:07:07.580" style="s2">it it&#39;s an unfolding but it is grounded</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.090" end="01:07:09.140" style="s2">in something we already had ever said</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.580" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">has this line I encounter through</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.180" end="01:09:05.839" style="s2">was probably wrong about universal</p>

<p begin="01:09:08.570" end="01:09:14.120" style="s2">and he was very strongly of the school</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.570" end="01:09:16.550" style="s2">that Chomsky grossly underestimated the</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.980" end="01:09:38.420" style="s2">you know Chomsky came at language</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.260" end="01:09:40.310" style="s2">essentially as a computer scientist and</p>

<p begin="01:16:34.730" end="01:16:38.790" style="s2">we started going down that road but then</p>

<p begin="01:16:58.080" end="01:17:02.640" style="s2">also posits something called extended</p>

<p begin="01:17:02.640" end="01:17:06.060" style="s2">bit less clear on what that is this</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.050" end="01:17:08.850" style="s2">ability to perhaps reflect on our own</p>

<p begin="01:17:49.320" end="01:17:53.850" style="s2">is nothing like animal consciousness</p>

<p begin="01:17:58.650" end="01:18:02.640" style="s2">then this this obsession kept going for</p>

<p begin="01:26:10.350" end="01:26:14.880" style="s2">know where&#39;s the great religious work of</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.810" end="01:26:17.790" style="s2">the computers right what have they done</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.880" end="01:26:19.290" style="s2">recently you know have they had an axial</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.790" end="01:26:21.350" style="s2">age have the machines written the</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.290" end="01:26:24.620" style="s2">Upanishads or have they had this</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.350" end="01:26:27.980" style="s2">dialogues and answer I think no right so</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.620" end="01:26:30.020" style="s2">under that test we&#39;re the only ones so I</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.980" end="01:26:31.520" style="s2">mean I would suggest that using my</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.020" end="01:26:33.110" style="s2">analogy the computers aren&#39;t even there</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.520" end="01:26:36.470" style="s2">yet right the smartest computers in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.110" end="01:26:39.740" style="s2">world maybe they&#39;re at the Shrew stage</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.470" end="01:26:42.200" style="s2">right and we don&#39;t expect shrews to</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.740" end="01:26:44.810" style="s2">write Shakespeare right and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.200" end="01:26:47.470" style="s2">give it 30 years and then your question</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.810" end="01:26:51.800" style="s2">may be more valid something these</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.470" end="01:26:53.810" style="s2">analogous consciousnesses may well come</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.800" end="01:26:56.990" style="s2">up with things that we think of as on</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.810" end="01:26:58.820" style="s2">par with our best creations but it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.990" end="01:26:59.930" style="s2">early to tell yet I mean this is this</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.820" end="01:27:01.670" style="s2">gets back I think all the way to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.930" end="01:27:04.160" style="s2">beginning of our of our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.670" end="01:27:06.110" style="s2">right with the Fermi paradox you know in</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.160" end="01:27:08.510" style="s2">the end the reason we&#39;re really keen</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.110" end="01:27:09.440" style="s2">about aliens is is you know well we want</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.510" end="01:27:11.510" style="s2">to hang out with them right because</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.440" end="01:27:13.700" style="s2">we&#39;re bored of our stuff you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.510" end="01:27:15.920" style="s2">the question if that does happen if</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.700" end="01:27:17.330" style="s2">these machines do have their axial age</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.920" end="01:27:19.760" style="s2">if their consciousness does actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.330" end="01:27:21.590" style="s2">bubble up to the visible level you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.760" end="01:27:22.940" style="s2">maybe the question is will they be fun</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.590" end="01:27:25.160" style="s2">to hang out with well we have new</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.940" end="01:27:27.350" style="s2">playmates on the earth again every nerd</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.160" end="01:27:28.820" style="s2">believed yes that there were aliens out</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.350" end="01:27:31.250" style="s2">there and every twelve-year-old nerd-boy</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.820" end="01:27:32.870" style="s2">least in my era believed we could</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.250" end="01:27:35.210" style="s2">eventually build AI so we could talk to</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.870" end="01:27:36.590" style="s2">you absolutely right you know when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.210" end="01:27:38.570" style="s2">talking about the Fermi paradox it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.590" end="01:27:40.220" style="s2">just that they&#39;d be fun to talk to which</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.570" end="01:27:42.560" style="s2">they would be or if they didn&#39;t kill us</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.220" end="01:27:44.750" style="s2">right or the silent Forest Theory right</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.560" end="01:27:46.070" style="s2">thank you no the reason everybody is</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.750" end="01:27:47.480" style="s2">quiet out there is because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.070" end="01:27:49.580" style="s2">certain number of predators and if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.480" end="01:27:52.700" style="s2">speak up you will get eaten but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.580" end="01:27:55.100" style="s2">another much deeper issue right if we</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.700" end="01:27:58.400" style="s2">are indeed alone we have a gigantic</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.100" end="01:28:01.310" style="s2">normal responsibility right if we are</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.400" end="01:28:03.620" style="s2">the only general intelligence in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.310" end="01:28:05.180" style="s2">universe we have a greater duty to</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.620" end="01:28:08.420" style="s2">preserve ourselves than if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.180" end="01:28:11.360" style="s2">relatively routine because we may be a</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.420" end="01:28:13.850" style="s2">point of the spear of evolution and it</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.360" end="01:28:16.400" style="s2">is perhaps our destiny to bring life to</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.850" end="01:28:17.720" style="s2">and on a live universe and if we knew</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.400" end="01:28:19.130" style="s2">that to be a fact which unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.720" end="01:28:21.950" style="s2">proving a negative is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.130" end="01:28:24.380" style="s2">difficult but if we didn&#39;t know that for</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.950" end="01:28:26.930" style="s2">a fact somehow I suspect it would make</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.380" end="01:28:29.690" style="s2">us take everything we do is shitload</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.930" end="01:28:30.680" style="s2">more seriously this is exactly the thing</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.690" end="01:28:32.790" style="s2">I would expect from a good</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.680" end="01:28:35.620" style="s2">self-replicating organism</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.790" end="01:28:37.210" style="s2">like do we have a moral duty well I mean</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.620" end="01:28:38.920" style="s2">only if moral duties there be are their</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.210" end="01:28:40.660" style="s2">species because if we disappear and</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.920" end="01:28:42.790" style="s2">morality disappears with us well they</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.660" end="01:28:44.290" style="s2">were done right so that&#39;s fine this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.790" end="01:28:48.550" style="s2">maybe their here&#39;s the way into this</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.290" end="01:28:51.220" style="s2">into this intuition when we study we</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.550" end="01:28:53.650" style="s2">look into big archives sometimes we get</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.220" end="01:28:55.060" style="s2">famous people and here&#39;s the phrase we</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.650" end="01:28:55.600" style="s2">sometimes do sometimes we get ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.060" end="01:28:57.790" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.600" end="01:29:00.250" style="s2">this always rubs me the wrong way this</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.790" end="01:29:02.710" style="s2">phrase ordinary because we&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.250" end="01:29:05.350" style="s2">extraordinary there&#39;s nothing like a</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.710" end="01:29:08.230" style="s2">human mind the differences between two</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.350" end="01:29:10.720" style="s2">human minds are so negligible compared</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.230" end="01:29:12.970" style="s2">to the difference between a human mind</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.720" end="01:29:15.490" style="s2">and a non-human mind you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.970" end="01:29:17.320" style="s2">a cognitive scientist or you you study</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.490" end="01:29:18.940" style="s2">social behavior from a cognitive point</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.320" end="01:29:21.580" style="s2">of view it can be an overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.940" end="01:29:23.530" style="s2">experience to walk into a crowd and not</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.580" end="01:29:26.310" style="s2">because the crowd is irrational but</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.530" end="01:29:29.590" style="s2">because you&#39;re surrounded by this</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.310" end="01:29:32.380" style="s2">unbelievable mechanisms unbelievable</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.590" end="01:29:35.020" style="s2">creatures it&#39;s not implausible that</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.380" end="01:29:36.910" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing like it elsewhere in the</p>

<p begin="01:29:36.910" end="01:29:41.290" style="s2">think neither of us would be surprised</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.710" end="01:29:42.700" style="s2">if a self-replicating organism worked</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.290" end="01:29:44.020" style="s2">out that they could use solar energy to</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.700" end="01:29:45.700" style="s2">make copies of itself that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.020" end="01:29:47.530" style="s2">surprise right we wouldn&#39;t be blown away</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.700" end="01:29:50.020" style="s2">we&#39;d be thrilled if we found life on</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.530" end="01:29:53.740" style="s2">Mars we wouldn&#39;t be shocked it would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.020" end="01:29:55.960" style="s2">a shocking event to find things with</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.740" end="01:29:57.670" style="s2">consciousness things that we could hang</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.960" end="01:29:59.590" style="s2">out with or at least we thought one day</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.670" end="01:30:01.360" style="s2">we could hang out with if we discovered</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.590" end="01:30:03.310" style="s2">that I think we would be shocked there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.360" end="01:30:05.140" style="s2">something miraculous about us it would</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.310" end="01:30:07.450" style="s2">be the biggest news in the history of</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.140" end="01:30:09.220" style="s2">the world well it would be you know in</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.450" end="01:30:11.710" style="s2">some sense the end of news as we know it</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.220" end="01:30:13.750" style="s2">exactly let&#39;s go to a last topic and</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.710" end="01:30:16.780" style="s2">then let&#39;s wrap up one current science</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.750" end="01:30:19.780" style="s2">fiction I used to be a true science</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.780" end="01:30:20.980" style="s2">fiction aficionado in fact growing up my</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.780" end="01:30:22.840" style="s2">main source of science fiction was a</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.980" end="01:30:24.730" style="s2">library so I prided myself on reading</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.840" end="01:30:26.320" style="s2">every single science fiction book that</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.730" end="01:30:28.180" style="s2">was printed and hard copy which wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.320" end="01:30:30.460" style="s2">that large a percentage but it was the</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.180" end="01:30:32.050" style="s2">better stuff of it unfortunately over</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.460" end="01:30:34.090" style="s2">the years getting it distracted into</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.050" end="01:30:35.980" style="s2">many other areas in fiction and</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.090" end="01:30:36.820" style="s2">nonfiction tically literary fiction for</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.980" end="01:30:40.060" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.820" end="01:30:42.790" style="s2">my fiction reading I have kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.060" end="01:30:47.050" style="s2">drifted away from sci-fi I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.790" end="01:30:48.880" style="s2">hear what is cool in sci-fi today in one</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.050" end="01:30:50.710" style="s2">sense I think I&#39;m pretty much in tune</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.880" end="01:30:53.500" style="s2">with what everyone&#39;s reading right so</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.710" end="01:30:57.250" style="s2">touching obviously blew up can we use</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.500" end="01:30:58.659" style="s2">translator of six and leo chinese</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.250" end="01:31:00.550" style="s2">science fiction has reached the modern</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.659" end="01:31:02.349" style="s2">era right that&#39;s super super exciting</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.550" end="01:31:05.409" style="s2">was the three-body problem rhe body</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.349" end="01:31:06.909" style="s2">problem Ken actually is so can I is the</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.409" end="01:31:08.199" style="s2">translator for six and he&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.909" end="01:31:10.869" style="s2">science fiction writer and I was</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.199" end="01:31:12.790" style="s2">thrilled to see he had invented so you</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.869" end="01:31:15.940" style="s2">know we have British Victorian steampunk</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.790" end="01:31:19.150" style="s2">he has Chinese Empire silk clunker right</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.940" end="01:31:21.190" style="s2">so reimagining the legends of a culture</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.150" end="01:31:24.369" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s not quite fantasy I</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.190" end="01:31:26.469" style="s2">think because it&#39;s a story about the</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.369" end="01:31:29.110" style="s2">technology and not simply the magic</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.469" end="01:31:31.119" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s who&#39;s bumped into science</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.110" end="01:31:32.800" style="s2">fiction is gonna bump into this one of</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.119" end="01:31:35.050" style="s2">the things that I do with science</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.800" end="01:31:37.179" style="s2">fiction and this is partly because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.050" end="01:31:39.159" style="s2">interested in the cultural evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.179" end="01:31:42.040" style="s2">you know the last 10 minutes of</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.159" end="01:31:43.989" style="s2">evolution is the fact that science</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.040" end="01:31:46.900" style="s2">fiction drives culture it tells us</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.989" end="01:31:48.909" style="s2">stories and people just can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.900" end="01:31:51.010" style="s2">make it real right so the Star Trek</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.909" end="01:31:52.989" style="s2">communicator is a great example and you</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.010" end="01:31:54.550" style="s2">know here it is right you know Apple</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.989" end="01:31:55.989" style="s2">health you know given though 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.550" end="01:31:57.250" style="s2">and it will die did tell you if you have</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.989" end="01:31:59.949" style="s2">something really deeply wrong in the</p>
