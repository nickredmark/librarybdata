<p begin="00:00:07.779" end="00:00:13.089" style="s2">where we&#39;re going to talk about a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.469" end="00:00:16.059" style="s2">of quality articles that have come out</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.089" end="00:00:20.230" style="s2">quite recently and talking about the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.059" end="00:00:22.090" style="s2">and the first one was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.230" end="00:00:25.600" style="s2">whether the IDW is intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.090" end="00:00:27.340" style="s2">diverse and then a follow-up article as</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.600" end="00:00:29.140" style="s2">well we&#39;re going to talk about some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.340" end="00:00:30.460" style="s2">the criticisms of the article but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.140" end="00:00:34.290" style="s2">like to starts I know that you&#39;re a fan</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.460" end="00:00:36.970" style="s2">of this tactic by Steele Manning that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.290" end="00:00:39.880" style="s2">particular arguments if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.970" end="00:00:42.370" style="s2">restate the argument in a in a in a way</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.880" end="00:00:45.790" style="s2">that you think is more accurate than was</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.370" end="00:00:47.739" style="s2">made how would you do that well I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.790" end="00:00:52.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a great question David I think that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.739" end="00:00:54.610" style="s2">part of the problem is that there are a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.239" end="00:00:56.620" style="s2">lot of different skeins running through</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.610" end="00:00:59.710" style="s2">this discussion it&#39;s hard to pull them</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.620" end="00:01:04.719" style="s2">apart one of which is that some people</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.710" end="00:01:06.579" style="s2">within the IDW are fans of term</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.719" end="00:01:08.439" style="s2">classical liberalism and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.579" end="00:01:10.840" style="s2">necessarily for it or against it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.439" end="00:01:17.229" style="s2">just not a term that I tend to apply to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.840" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">myself and I don&#39;t think that sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.229" end="00:01:24.189" style="s2">care has been taken to say that some</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:25.389" style="s2">members of the group or movement or</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.189" end="00:01:28.060" style="s2">what-have-you</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.389" end="00:01:31.179" style="s2">use that label while others do not and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.060" end="00:01:33.159" style="s2">so there&#39;s a bit of a pressure at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.179" end="00:01:35.350" style="s2">moment to say well you guys all call</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.159" end="00:01:39.670" style="s2">yourself classical liberals and I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.350" end="00:01:41.979" style="s2">don&#39;t think that that&#39;s the case so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.670" end="00:01:44.950" style="s2">would be the the first sort of steel</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.979" end="00:01:51.189" style="s2">Manning is is that I would want the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.950" end="00:01:56.229" style="s2">critique to be more careful about saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.189" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">that it&#39;s limited to those who identify</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.229" end="00:02:00.069" style="s2">as classical liberals and then the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:01.569" style="s2">author has every right to try to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.069" end="00:02:06.819" style="s2">the case that the classical liberal</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.569" end="00:02:09.789" style="s2">position is in fact a version turbit ISM</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.819" end="00:02:12.340" style="s2">but I certainly don&#39;t think of myself as</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.789" end="00:02:14.910" style="s2">a classical liberal first and foremost I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.340" end="00:02:19.170" style="s2">think of myself somebody who has</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.910" end="00:02:21.550" style="s2">progressive conservative and libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.170" end="00:02:23.020" style="s2">feelings on a variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.550" end="00:02:27.100" style="s2">issues I think that&#39;s why all of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.020" end="00:02:30.730" style="s2">positions continue to be explored with</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.100" end="00:02:32.740" style="s2">none no particular political viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:34.150" style="s2">ever becoming dominant because if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.740" end="00:02:37.060" style="s2">if we&#39;re really truly honest with</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.150" end="00:02:39.580" style="s2">ourselves when we say we&#39;re conservative</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.060" end="00:02:41.320" style="s2">or liberal or or progressive or</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.580" end="00:02:44.140" style="s2">what-have-you we&#39;re usually talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.320" end="00:02:48.570" style="s2">about kind of the leading note or tone</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.140" end="00:02:50.860" style="s2">that we are expressing and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.570" end="00:02:52.780" style="s2">you know when people are in cautious and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.860" end="00:02:55.090" style="s2">they say well I am a staunch libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.780" end="00:02:56.170" style="s2">or I am a committed conservative then</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.090" end="00:02:57.820" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.170" end="00:03:04.300" style="s2">exchanging sort of a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.820" end="00:03:07.210" style="s2">resolution for a four degree degree of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.300" end="00:03:10.630" style="s2">clarity and a lot of people appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.210" end="00:03:12.670" style="s2">that clarity on the front end I pay a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.630" end="00:03:15.190" style="s2">fairly heavy price by saying I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.670" end="00:03:17.590" style="s2">free speech absolutist I&#39;m very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.190" end="00:03:21.220" style="s2">associated with free speech but there</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.590" end="00:03:23.230" style="s2">are a lot ways in which I can&#39;t stomach</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.220" end="00:03:27.520" style="s2">certain kinds of free speech outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.230" end="00:03:29.610" style="s2">for example child pornography is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.520" end="00:03:32.710" style="s2">something that I would stand behind</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.610" end="00:03:35.970" style="s2">under free speech or from it you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.710" end="00:03:38.680" style="s2">many of us pay a hefty price for</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.970" end="00:03:41.110" style="s2">appearing to purists to be mealy-mouthed</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.680" end="00:03:43.060" style="s2">if you will when I said I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.110" end="00:03:47.080" style="s2">necessarily anti tribal I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.060" end="00:03:50.170" style="s2">necessarily you know anti progressive or</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.080" end="00:03:54.240" style="s2">Pro progressive or anything like that so</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.170" end="00:03:58.390" style="s2">I suppose what I&#39;m thinking is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.240" end="00:04:00.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a critique made of wing if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.390" end="00:04:05.140" style="s2">will of the IDW as if it was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.610" end="00:04:07.750" style="s2">totality of the IDW and that wing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.140" end="00:04:10.510" style="s2">being faulted in the minds of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.750" end="00:04:13.720" style="s2">authors and others for an insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.510" end="00:04:16.359" style="s2">layer of a level of resolution and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.720" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">think that those of us who paid a hefty</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.359" end="00:04:22.060" style="s2">price for saying well I&#39;m I can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.320" end="00:04:26.440" style="s2">tied to an absolutist position on any of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.060" end="00:04:28.389" style="s2">this stuff really it so because we want</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.440" end="00:04:29.860" style="s2">to keep a very high level of resolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.389" end="00:04:31.150" style="s2">and so I think that there&#39;s a series of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.860" end="00:04:34.030" style="s2">trade-offs there&#39;s no way of pleasing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.150" end="00:04:36.069" style="s2">everybody I think when it what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.030" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">article was trying to do and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.069" end="00:04:43.689" style="s2">say there&#39;s there&#39;s a further refinement</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:47.349" style="s2">and that has to do with the fact that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.689" end="00:04:50.379" style="s2">you brick progressivism or the left or</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.349" end="00:04:54.249" style="s2">whatever you want to call it into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.379" end="00:04:57.909" style="s2">traditional liberal core of the left and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.249" end="00:05:00.689" style="s2">then you augment that with a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.909" end="00:05:05.020" style="s2">recent extremely aggressive upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.689" end="00:05:08.259" style="s2">which appears willing to attack reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.020" end="00:05:12.129" style="s2">civility as agents of oppression you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.259" end="00:05:16.270" style="s2">know our tools of oppression I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.129" end="00:05:20.169" style="s2">that the upgrade really what is it at</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.270" end="00:05:23.080" style="s2">issue in a question what is it what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.169" end="00:05:27.870" style="s2">being questioned and if you believe that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.080" end="00:05:27.870" style="s2">upgrade that extremely postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.770" end="00:05:34.839" style="s2">adjustment to classically progressive</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:37.240" style="s2">positions if you think that is now the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.839" end="00:05:39.729" style="s2">new dominant left and it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.240" end="00:05:42.069" style="s2">away you probably take a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.729" end="00:05:46.569" style="s2">dismissive attitude towards the entire</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.069" end="00:05:48.039" style="s2">left-of-center Canon of thought and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.569" end="00:05:54.099" style="s2">would say that there are members of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.039" end="00:05:56.409" style="s2">of the IDW who believe that this current</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.099" end="00:05:58.779" style="s2">aggressive strain has displaced</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.409" end="00:06:01.270" style="s2">classically liberal or classically</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.779" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">progressive positions which will never</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.270" end="00:06:07.389" style="s2">return and that we now need to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:11.409" style="s2">the fact that that upgrade is permanent</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.389" end="00:06:13.180" style="s2">and those people have probably decided</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.409" end="00:06:16.779" style="s2">that they are going to abandon any hope</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.180" end="00:06:18.729" style="s2">in a left-of-center position well I held</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.779" end="00:06:22.180" style="s2">that position that that upgrade if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.729" end="00:06:24.759" style="s2">will that marginal difference in a level</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.180" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">of aggression and willingness to attack</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.759" end="00:06:30.490" style="s2">reason and data and evidence and itself</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:33.639" style="s2">in favor of tying people in knots</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.490" end="00:06:36.339" style="s2">logically and epistemologically I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.639" end="00:06:38.500" style="s2">thought that was permanent I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.339" end="00:06:41.620" style="s2">understand quickly why do people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.500" end="00:06:44.320" style="s2">completely abandoning any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.620" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">resolution view of the left now it</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.320" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">happens that I understand why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:49.690" style="s2">saying that but I disagree I believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:52.360" style="s2">that many people are fairly moderate and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.690" end="00:06:55.630" style="s2">liberal in their views and are going</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.360" end="00:06:58.120" style="s2">through a period akin to the McCarthy</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.630" end="00:07:01.240" style="s2">era which I&#39;ve called left car theism in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.120" end="00:07:02.590" style="s2">which it&#39;s very dangerous to simply say</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.240" end="00:07:05.260" style="s2">the obvious which is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.590" end="00:07:09.550" style="s2">attacking reason or one of two genders</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.260" end="00:07:11.590" style="s2">or concepts as abstract as patriarchy or</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.550" end="00:07:13.479" style="s2">anything like that you&#39;ve probably made</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.590" end="00:07:18.729" style="s2">a fairly significant wrong turn</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.479" end="00:07:20.500" style="s2">somewhere in your thinking and while it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.729" end="00:07:24.690" style="s2">might be difficult too dangerous for</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.500" end="00:07:26.860" style="s2">most people to explore their own</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.690" end="00:07:30.250" style="s2">relatively moderate left-of-center</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.860" end="00:07:32.260" style="s2">positions I don&#39;t think that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.250" end="00:07:34.120" style="s2">reasonable left or the analytic left or</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.260" end="00:07:36.539" style="s2">the traditional apps have gone away I</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.100" end="00:07:46.979" style="s2">think that&#39;s a that&#39;s a major difference</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.050" end="00:07:49.060" style="s2">between the sort of right leaning</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.740" end="00:07:59.710" style="s2">that&#39;s what makes that&#39;s what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.419" end="00:08:01.900" style="s2">interesting certainly why I&#39;m listening</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.050" end="00:08:10.660" style="s2">new if I understand it correctly is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:15.130" style="s2">Claire is suggesting that we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.660" end="00:08:18.970" style="s2">caricature the left</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.560" end="00:08:32.219" style="s2">she&#39;s publishing for making them hear</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.470" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">frequently that the new upgrade to the</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.339" end="00:08:52.089" style="s2">think we&#39;re very interested to hear why</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.390" end="00:09:25.660" style="s2">think that there are sort of</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.580" end="00:09:45.970" style="s2">Claire believed that so if the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.330" end="00:09:49.990" style="s2">that viewing everything through a racial</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.459" end="00:10:41.529" style="s2">the could it came from an original tweet</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.740" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">that seemed to show that the most of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.529" end="00:10:48.459" style="s2">members of the IDW were liberal on most</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:51.910" style="s2">issues and he or he said that it feels</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.430" end="00:10:58.990" style="s2">certainly true online and probably</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.660" end="00:11:27.400" style="s2">this is very mysterious I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.810" end="00:11:32.050" style="s2">us have traditionally had a very</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.450" end="00:12:17.890" style="s2">with at all because it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.280" end="00:12:20.290" style="s2">adulthood because some people would say</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.890" end="00:12:22.540" style="s2">that that is is a caricature and most</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.290" end="00:12:24.700" style="s2">people on the Left don&#39;t believe those</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:27.670" style="s2">those things there are far more</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:47.999" style="s2">well then here&#39;s the question why is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.889" end="00:12:53.079" style="s2">that this moderate reasonable EFT</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.999" end="00:12:55.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tell these shrill voices to shut</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.240" end="00:20:29.640" style="s2">think that is and what do you make of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.240" end="00:20:32.620" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question I mean I think</p>

<p begin="00:20:34.660" end="00:20:42.520" style="s2">think Davis view of how he is balancing</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.070" end="00:20:45.730" style="s2">his portfolio is that he is accepting a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.520" end="00:20:48.130" style="s2">lot of very conservative gigs for</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.730" end="00:20:52.510" style="s2">example with turning-point USA or Prager</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.130" end="00:20:56.020" style="s2">you or going on Fox and then feeling is</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.510" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">that he&#39;s balancing it by saying hey do</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.020" end="00:21:03.150" style="s2">you realize you guys just invited a gay</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">man who smokes weed into your group and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.150" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">kudos to that for being tolerant so from</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:09.610" style="s2">his perspective yeah he&#39;s doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:12.309" style="s2">work with conservatives but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.610" end="00:21:14.230" style="s2">constantly reminding them that they are</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.309" end="00:21:16.870" style="s2">changing and that they are becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.230" end="00:21:21.010" style="s2">tolerant if you walk if you like his</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.870" end="00:21:24.670" style="s2">view I think is is that he is making the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.010" end="00:21:27.460" style="s2">the right more liberal now from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.670" end="00:21:30.660" style="s2">different perspective and in this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.460" end="00:21:36.190" style="s2">held by many people he is choosing</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.660" end="00:21:38.470" style="s2">repeatedly to punch tip left and to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.190" end="00:21:40.900" style="s2">accept right-wing speaking engagements</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.470" end="00:21:43.480" style="s2">no right-of-center speaking engage and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.900" end="00:21:46.030" style="s2">so from that perspective well then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.480" end="00:21:47.920" style="s2">just really much more on the right and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.030" end="00:21:50.610" style="s2">think that he&#39;s agreed that he&#39;s moved</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.920" end="00:21:53.410" style="s2">right I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.610" end="00:21:56.800" style="s2">but I think it has to do with whether or</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.410" end="00:21:59.160" style="s2">not you view his balancing of this which</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.800" end="00:22:02.260" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s quite open about</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.160" end="00:22:05.530" style="s2">talking about being pro-choice at a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.260" end="00:22:08.980" style="s2">conservative event and that is a way in</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.530" end="00:22:12.340" style="s2">which he is actually taking the left to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.980" end="00:22:14.450" style="s2">the right as he fights the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.340" end="00:22:17.780" style="s2">left that he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.450" end="00:22:19.370" style="s2">is uh has taken the left down and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.780" end="00:22:20.870" style="s2">know I don&#39;t think he makes any bones</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.370" end="00:22:22.340" style="s2">about it he doesn&#39;t think the left is</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.870" end="00:22:25.880" style="s2">ever coming back I think he thinks the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.340" end="00:22:27.380" style="s2">Democratic Party is finished so you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.880" end="00:22:29.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a debate that he and I have I</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.380" end="00:22:30.470" style="s2">don&#39;t think the Democratic Party is</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.000" end="00:22:33.830" style="s2">finished I think that we have to fight</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.470" end="00:22:36.350" style="s2">for its soul right now and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.830" end="00:22:39.260" style="s2">what what I think is sort of dividing</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.350" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">people as is the Dave&#39;s rhetoric and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.260" end="00:22:43.340" style="s2">Dave strategy is different than my</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:45.800" style="s2">strategy so you know do I like Dave</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.340" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">strategy better than my strategy now you</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.800" end="00:22:52.010" style="s2">know I think he&#39;s doing something where</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:53.510" style="s2">he&#39;s you know going on more conservative</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.010" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">programs and I would feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.510" end="00:22:58.460" style="s2">with I&#39;m one of the issues that I see a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:23:00.620" style="s2">lot of the criticisms of the left and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.460" end="00:23:02.870" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking particularly of Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.620" end="00:23:05.180" style="s2">and Jordan Peterson possibly because</p>
