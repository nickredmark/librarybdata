<p begin="00:00:04.880" end="00:00:08.080" style="s2">hi everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.839" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">i recently sat down with tyson juncker</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.080" end="00:00:12.799" style="s2">porter who&#39;s just released a new book</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:14.000" style="s2">called sam talk how indigenous thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.799" end="00:00:16.400" style="s2">can save the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.000" end="00:00:17.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s made quite a big splash tyson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.400" end="00:00:19.760" style="s2">from the appellate clan</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.760" end="00:00:21.680" style="s2">in northern queensland in australia and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.760" end="00:00:23.840" style="s2">he&#39;s also a senior lecturer</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.680" end="00:00:25.359" style="s2">in indigenous knowledges at deakin</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.840" end="00:00:27.199" style="s2">university in melbourne</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.359" end="00:00:28.840" style="s2">so what&#39;s special about the book is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.199" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">tyson is taking an indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.840" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">perspective and using that to look back</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">at western culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:35.920" style="s2">and he&#39;s really looking at a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:37.840" style="s2">topics like</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.920" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">systems change and complexity that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.840" end="00:00:40.399" style="s2">been exploring in rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">anybody who thinks they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.399" end="00:00:45.200" style="s2">solution or they have a plan or a design</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.559" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">or anything like that um they&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.200" end="00:00:48.320" style="s2">idiot</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t dynamic systems don&#39;t operate</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.320" end="00:00:50.239" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">you know you have a thing called</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.239" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">emergence we know this we know the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:55.199" style="s2">science on it</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:56.239" style="s2">and you know emergence is the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.199" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">that can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:00:59.920" style="s2">these kind of complexities so all you</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:00.800" style="s2">can do is foster the conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.920" end="00:01:02.719" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.800" end="00:01:04.400" style="s2">tyson also brings a really unique</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.719" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">perspective on a lot of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.400" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">dynamics that we&#39;ve explored on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">channel so</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">everything from the culture wars through</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">to economics</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:14.320" style="s2">in any theory if you&#39;re just focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:17.439" style="s2">a few little snippets</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.320" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">that fit with your personal brand and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">you&#39;re barking those things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">like an idiot then</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.360" end="00:01:30.079" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna be an idiot and um</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.560" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">i i really can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.079" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">where it&#39;s coming from this idea that um</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:40.400" style="s2">that that is just a trait of the left</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:41.200" style="s2">or the social justice warriors or anyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.400" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">because i&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.200" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">everybody doing that i&#39;m seeing people</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">who are claiming centrism especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:52.240" style="s2">but everybody&#39;s critiquing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">else in very shallow ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.240" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">and he also doesn&#39;t hold his punches</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">when he&#39;s talking about where</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">our current systems and trajectory in</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">the west is leading us</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">you know where you used to have family</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">and community now you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">um you&#39;re gonna have the economy</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">and government the economy in the state</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to provide all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">things for you that land used to provide</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">um but you have to sell us a third of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">your life</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">the trade-off is you have to give us a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">third of your life</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:25.840" style="s2">like you&#39;re gonna have to spend the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">other third another third sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.840" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">oh and by the way a sizable chunk of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">third that&#39;s left over you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">to spend commuting</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">life maintenance tasks paying your bills</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">make sure you</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">provide you with these little shitty</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">indoor spaces</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">where you can lift heavy things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">don&#39;t need lifting</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">and pedal on a bike that goes nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">and run even though nothing&#39;s chasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">you and you&#39;re not chasing anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">and you&#39;re not in a hurry you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">do all those pointless tasks</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to do them over and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">over and over</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">until you fucking die and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">progress</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">your book sand talk is is creating quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">a splash at the moment um and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">generating a lot of interest be really</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">great to hear just a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s the key message or some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">the key messages in the book</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s basically a reversal</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">uh usually when people look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">indigenous knowledge it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s examining you know the content</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">of indigenous knowledge you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.720" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">uh snippets of it um from</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">from a non-indigenous perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">even if it&#39;s an indigenous voice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">about trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">our knowledge uh to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">although santorum doesn&#39;t do that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">kind of flips things around</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">so um santok is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">looking at the world from an indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">so it&#39;s um taking that indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">knowledge standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">and using that as a lens to have a look</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">at what&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s kind of turning it back</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like reverse anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">really and it&#39;s a really cheeky book</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not done in like an aggressive way</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">or a blamey way or like going ah</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">you&#39;re like this privilege that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">privilege whatever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of just fun you know we kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">of do some thought experiments have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">few laughs tell some yarns</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a few slaps in there</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">just for fun</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">too but um yeah people enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">it seems and it looks like i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">really strongly invites the reader to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">their stories alongside and their</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">knowledge alongside and amongst</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">uh all of that knowledge and so in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">way you know it&#39;s designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">a book that no two people would read the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">same book everybody&#39;s reading a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">different book when they come there</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">because they&#39;re bringing their</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">to that and finding a safe space to um</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">just experiment with that experiment</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">with these</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">getting those messages out there</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:29.039" style="s2">and um i couldn&#39;t think of anything else</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">to write about so i just i wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.039" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">and i thought it would be a labor-saving</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">device like it would save me from having</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">too many more yarns because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">exhausting but not</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">it&#39;s just exponentially increased the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">amount of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">that i have to have and um</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">you know and straining all of my</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:55.919" style="s2">i&#39;m on borrowed time i&#39;m using up all my</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:58.639" style="s2">related relational credit here</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.919" end="00:06:58.639" style="s2">in this house</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">well yeah i&#39;m glad you&#39;re making it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">there&#39;s people out there like vacuuming</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">trying to feed people and bathe people</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">right now not happy with me not being</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">there doing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">you know are you off having your yards</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">are you that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna watch this fridge</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">yeah brilliant so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">yeah i mean on the subject of yarns you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">just described really nicely that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">sand talk and i suppose the the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">view you&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">is based on many different stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">coming together you know everywhere yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">and of course like the land has stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">as well and is speaking and teaching us</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">so there&#39;s all this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">interconnection of stories and yarns the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">telling of stories there&#39;s a huge part</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">of sound talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">now in a way it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:48.319" style="s2">you know you could see it as a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.319" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">thing this kind of coming weaving</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">together of many different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve spoken a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">before and i was really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">your take on</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">on post modernism you have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">unique perspective because you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:02.879" style="s2">you have this perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">understanding that these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.879" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">multiple</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">viewpoints exist but you&#39;re also you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">know you&#39;re also holding quite i think a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">nuanced position</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked a lot on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">and looked a lot from the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">of rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">on like looking at the culture wars and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">looking at this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">tension between you know one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">there&#39;s the entities like the idw and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">the others which is you know described</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">as kind of woke or social justice</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">and this big tension between them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">happening i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">when we&#39;ve talked you have interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">synthesis around these things so i</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">thought it&#39;d be interesting to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">maybe beginning with where you think</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">postmodernism has gone too far and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">going into where you think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">offered a valuable perspective but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">we could start where</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:44.399" style="s2">where you think it it has gone too far</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">in the culture and where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.399" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">yeah but the language of going too far</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">i don&#39;t know it always makes me feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">like god daddy will smack</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">you know and i do hear that phrase a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">and and and and it&#39;s often not with you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">it&#39;s often followed by just a remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">process of um</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">of you know uh critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:19.000" style="s2">like critiquing critical theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">uh post-modernism uh post-structuralism</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.000" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">deconstructivism all these things it</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">sort of delivers a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">blistering critique of those things</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">using the tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">of critique that are just</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:36.320" style="s2">so i see like um yeah all these</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">downtrodden powerful</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.320" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">cultural groups sort of rising up to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">use the victims tools to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">deconstruct the victim&#39;s house or so i i</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">don&#39;t quite get it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">look so you&#39;ve got um you know critical</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">theory critical race theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">you know all of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">theories and what is a theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">well a theory is wrong for a start</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">like that&#39;s the limit and any scientist</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">will tell you the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:11.279" style="s2">every theory is wrong but it can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">useful in certain contexts</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.279" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">you know newton&#39;s physics it helps</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:18.079" style="s2">it&#39;s helping with the vacuuming that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">happening out there right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.079" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">i think you can probably hear that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">vacuum cleaner you know newton&#39;s physics</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">works in certain contexts</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">but in order for this zoom meeting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2">take place we probably don&#39;t want to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">with newton we</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:31.760" style="s2">probably want to go with einstein</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.760" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">the signal won&#39;t work because you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">time changes for this when the signal</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">bounces up to the satellite</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">the further you go from the earth time</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">changes so you&#39;re going to need einstein</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:45.920" style="s2">for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">but then he&#39;s only good up to a point</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.920" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">you need to switch between theories</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">and i guess if you&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">complexity and dealing with complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">in a complex world then you need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">borrow from lots of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">theories simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">so i mean basically you know if you read</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">my book um and a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">conservative people who read my book and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">really loved it</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think they realize that what</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">i&#39;m doing there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">is standpoint theory and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">grounded in a lot of deconstructivism</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">simply because these are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">have allowed me the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">to come into the space you know um i</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">have problems with post-modernism but</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:26.839" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">from an indigenous perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.839" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">post-modernism is placeless</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s ethereal it&#39;s floating in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">space it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:37.040" style="s2">you know all indigenous knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">grounded strongly in place</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.040" end="00:11:40.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s very spatial you know it always</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">is so</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.839" end="00:11:45.959" style="s2">postmodernism is not a good tool for</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:48.360" style="s2">that however post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.959" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">deconstructivism and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.360" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">post-colonialism</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">has been a very good tool for us to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">able to enter the academy</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">and to assert our standpoint and to to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">make sure that we&#39;re able to think</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">and inquire from our standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">which is a very difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">explain but</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">and this has given rise to lots of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">really good things i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever heard of misty jenkins</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">uh but misty jenkins is an aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:20.079" style="s2">woman from australia</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">and she&#39;s like she&#39;s one of the top</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">genetic researchers on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">uh at the moment she&#39;s got a lab where</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">she&#39;s she&#39;s pretty much sorting out</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">brain cancer</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">but um she but she&#39;s come up with one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">the one of the very big</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">discoveries that completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">revolutionized genetic science</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">and it was her you know grounding in her</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">indigenous standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">making room for her to be able to apply</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">our patterns of logic to what she was</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">studying</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">and to bring in other variables that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">usually out there like</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">time and place and season and things</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">um to be able to bring those things in</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:03.839" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s allowed her to make those</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:05.920" style="s2">discoveries</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.839" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">so you can&#39;t throw the baby out with the</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">you know um most of the post-colonial</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.440" end="00:13:15.519" style="s2">methodologies we have in the indigenous</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">you know we we have to acknowledge uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.800" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">post-structural feminism uh for their</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">legacy</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">you know um you don&#39;t have to be a</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">to use those tools you know we pick</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">those things up and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">problematic stuff in there</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">you know and a lot of um you know women</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">of color around the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">uh you know have you know done the hard</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">work of actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">critiquing the stuff that&#39;s that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">there and trying to find more creative</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">ways to do the work</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">um but i guess in any theory if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">just focusing on a few little snippets</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">that fit with your personal brand and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">you&#39;re barking those things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">like an idiot then</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna be an idiot and um</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">i i really can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">where it&#39;s coming from this idea that um</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">that that is just a trait of the left or</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">social justice warriors or anyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">because i&#39;m seeing everybody doing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">i&#39;m seeing people who are claiming</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">centrism especially doing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">but everybody&#39;s critiquing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">else in very shallow ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">and when they&#39;re looking at the bell</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">curve</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">it&#39;s great to include the outliers in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">your analysis</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">because they&#39;re part of the story too</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">but if you just focus on the outliers</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">the tales of the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">then your analysis is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:48.399" style="s2">accurate</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">so if you&#39;re only looking at youtube</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">videos of sjws</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">when they&#39;re angry and you&#39;re going oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">that&#39;s what post-modernism is</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">then it&#39;s not going to work it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">not going to be valid</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">where&#39;s the validity where&#39;s the rigor</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">that you are claiming</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">because all these people are always</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">claiming this i&#39;m being objective and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">empirical</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">the data doesn&#39;t lie so i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">quote one statistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">out of context and make it look like all</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">and well you can&#39;t argue with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:26.639" style="s2">statistics i&#39;m just being rational</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re in a context bros and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.639" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">your analysis is rubbish</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:35.199" style="s2">it&#39;s absolute rubbish it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">empirical you&#39;re not the positivist</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">are set up um to prevent that from</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">i said there&#39;s this last ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">year blip of a bit of an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">and particularly the last few centuries</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">where um you know that&#39;s taken over a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">bit but that won&#39;t last much longer</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">in the book you talk about the the way</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">in which aboriginal culture is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">geared up to make sure that narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take over</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">and that that is it&#39;s a huge part of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">you know we were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">the culture wars and this this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">everyone thinking that they&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">everyone you know doubling down on</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">reason or doubling down on</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">on deconstruction or whatever it might</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">be it strikes me that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">there&#39;s this rampant narcissism in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">culture and it goes much deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">a particular spat on twitter it goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">right down to the core of it so</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">so what what aboriginal culture you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">in what ways can it help us get get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">new lens on that on our own narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">um i i think it&#39;s about just getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">back to natural law</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">uh you know like like i was saying there</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">inherent sort of abhorrence of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">of anybody</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">you know getting one over anyone else or</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">dominating</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:56.559" style="s2">you know the idea of one story</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">or one point of view coming out on top</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.559" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">and being the one story to rule them all</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">is absolute anathema to us all at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">molecular level</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.760" end="00:21:07.760" style="s2">we cannot accept that you know as human</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.760" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">um we all hate that but we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.919" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">trapped in it at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s just there&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.280" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">weird fractal things going on so even</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve mentioned before you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:23.520" style="s2">doubling down</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">um that&#39;s a critique an attempted</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.520" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">critique</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">to try and expose the pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">communication that&#39;s going on at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">but as soon as we put that out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">um everybody picked it up and that just</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">became another layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">to the purity testing going on you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">so everybody&#39;s accusing everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">of doubling down</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:50.799" style="s2">whenever they say anything um you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">it&#39;s um yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.799" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just fractal</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">um misery what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">misery stacked misery stacked misery in</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">in all communication at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s lawless behavior</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:08.480" style="s2">because all we have is paper law digital</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.480" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">um whatever that is that is ephemeral</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">uh coming from institutions that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.799" style="s2">don&#39;t trust anymore</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">um so i think it&#39;s you see every time</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.799" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a disaster people fall back on</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:23.679" style="s2">natural law</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">like we always see where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">disaster a disaster basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">you could define it as any situation</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">knocks the control of the state and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">the mechanisms of the state out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">operation for a while</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what a disaster is and into that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">gap</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.679" end="00:22:47.280" style="s2">floods all this natural law um</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">from the human beings and and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.280" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">landscape that they inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">um suddenly we just get back into it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">you always hear about it after the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">disasters</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">there&#39;s always feel good news reports</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">about you know how everybody came</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">together cooperatively</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">and collaborated and lifted themselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">out and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">see people interviewed and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">miserable or scared or upset about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:12.159" style="s2">disaster</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of really excited on a bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">of a high</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">about the you know the marketplace that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:21.120" style="s2">emerged</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">uh the sharing economy that emerged in</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.120" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">which everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">supporting each other and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">suddenly found that they were all quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">prosperous</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">and all had everything that they needed</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">just through that through that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">free-flowing exchange with no monopolies</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">and no controls</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:40.480" style="s2">then the state comes back in and get and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">gets control you see it in like you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.480" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2">um you know when there&#39;s a coup or</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">you see it in sudan and places like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">somalia</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">all around the world you see these</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:53.520" style="s2">temporary uh disruptions</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">uh to all these institutions that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.520" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">just don&#39;t trust anymore</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">um you see that emergence of natural law</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.559" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">what people need to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">but if if anybody gives i hesitate even</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">to call it natural law because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">label</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">and then people will be purity testing</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">on that just whatever you do don&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">it a name</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">all you can do is foster the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">for emergence</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">and allow it to emerge and just behave</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">with integrity</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">and you know maybe others will do the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">but the minute you have an idea and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">think this is an important idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">everybody should know about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">everybody should be doing this</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">as soon as you do that that&#39;s you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">made an ideology and you&#39;re stuffed</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve made a closed system and entropy</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">is the only thing that can ensue</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m curious about how this</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">applies or how this could apply because</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">i suppose a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">uh a critic might say yeah but we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">all these supply chains like how are we</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">without those how are we going to feed</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">everyone all of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">so so what are what are some of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">that we might</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">rethink it rather than just going no but</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">we need the state we need those laws etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">yeah for some people we&#39;re already we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">already starting to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">how are we going to feed everybody for</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">the next decade</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">the supply chains have been so</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">catastrophically disrupted</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">and they&#39;re so complicated that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">understands how they work</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">so we can&#39;t just tinker them back</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">together again</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen so we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">there you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">how will we make it work well you know i</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">guess your</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">your um your</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">freed slaves uh in in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">uh had that same conundrum so remember</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">they were promised 40 acres in a mule</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">you remember that where did that go</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">forget about reparations just give</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">everybody the equivalent of 40 acres and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">a mule</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">that that&#39;d be good how much does that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">cost now that&#39;s worth a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">you start that off but they didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">the 40 acres in a mule they were just</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">dumped and so they had to like just with</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">the clothes on their back</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">and the work of their hands they had to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">try and build communities</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">now the economic systems that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">created in their</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">communities they were a very different</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">economic system</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">you know they were collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">and um you know these these</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">these really dynamic sharing economies</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:31.039" style="s2">every unit of value every hard one unit</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">of value</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.039" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">had a lot of velocity within that system</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:37.679" style="s2">so although there wasn&#39;t very much</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">wealth there there was</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.679" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">amazing prosperity so you ended up with</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">black wall street</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">you know tulsa all these places and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">you know it wasn&#39;t racism that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:53.279" style="s2">caused</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">the massacres and riots that followed</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.279" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">it was basically an intolerable</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">um collective sharing economy</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">a different economic system emerging</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">that was absolutely unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.400" end="00:27:09.600" style="s2">to the juggernaut of the that free</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">market economy that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">well not that it&#39;s a free market with</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">the monopolistic economy that was being</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.080" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">created</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">you know so you had um you had</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">adjacent white communities that were</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:29.360" style="s2">far more wealthy but far less prosperous</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:32.799" style="s2">than the poor black neighborhoods coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.360" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">out so they had to be destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.799" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">you know so i guess i don&#39;t know you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">find the answer in there</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m just it&#39;s really striking you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:42.320" style="s2">know as you&#39;re talking i&#39;m thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">this is one of the perhaps key arguments</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know quite what to describe it</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.919" end="00:27:50.080" style="s2">because as you mentioned giving it a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">name but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">what i&#39;ve called it kind of wokism or</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">the now the genesis of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">post-structuralism which is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">certain ways of knowing um basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:03.679" style="s2">oppress other ways of knowing which i</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of validity to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.679" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">you know what you&#39;re just describing</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">what happened in tulsa for example of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">like a different way emerging and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">the dominant culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">what i think renee isa called the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">dominator society kind of coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">suppressing it you know that is i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:19.120" style="s2">a valid</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">aspect of it but then there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.120" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">that balancing point it seems between</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">also honoring the perspective of say</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">rationality and finding some</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">way to blend them together i mean do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s doable</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">is that like what what is what&#39;s your</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">based on that uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">you know that sort of positivist</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">and there are there are some things that</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">uh to to try and you know see a few</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">different points of view</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:03.039" style="s2">and to use a few other tools that will</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">actually help</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.039" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">um you know like i said before even with</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">your genetics research and everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">but uh yeah i mean i think people look</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:14.159" style="s2">sort of the volume of the minority that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">are you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.159" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">um screaming workisms and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">and they kind of equate that the quality</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">of the volume to the the quantity of you</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">know how far it&#39;s spread</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly not the dominant ideology</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">although you know a lot of people just</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">i mean it is the thing you know um</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">you know amazon might put up a black</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:39.919" style="s2">lives matter sticker and make a</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.919" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">um but it&#39;s not changing their</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">operations</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to change anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">structurally all they have to do is say</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">and so everybody goes oh look they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">you know they&#39;re taking over or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s nothing&#39;s changed the structure&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:58.720" style="s2">still there</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.640" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">the prison industrial complex is still a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.480" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">yeah you know i yeah that&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">that&#39;s not going anywhere and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">requires</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">inequality so post-modernism uh critical</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">race theory all these things</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">they&#39;re really just trying to bring an</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">awareness of power</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">to the table because power is a variable</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:22.320" style="s2">in all of these things that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">study and if you ignore that variable</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.320" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">a really key variable then your findings</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">are invalid</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">your data is invalid your analysis is</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">invalid you do need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">at least like you need to factor in</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">power as a variable</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">because it just is it exists and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">great that your opinion might be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">power doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">like oh what are all these people</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:50.480" style="s2">complaining about</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">um you know that&#39;s great if that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.480" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">opinion</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s not rational</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re claiming a rational viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">and you&#39;re ignoring power</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">that that&#39;s not rational brass</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">yeah yeah and i i think for me</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">that the critique and the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">the way power moves and the way it works</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">and the way it plays out in society</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">is the most valuable aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">post-modernism and is why i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">foucault is so important</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.679" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">at the same time i would love to get you</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">boring though</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">yeah yeah but yeah that&#39;s how i use</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">foucault to help me fall asleep at night</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">it&#39;s so dense i get two pages yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">kind of french</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">philosophy in general or kind of french</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">critical theory is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">yeah is hard it&#39;s quite dense</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">um but so i just wanted to kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">at one example in particular like so i</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">i&#39;m with you on the uh on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:49.039" style="s2">we have to look at power</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">and we have to consider that but again</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.039" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">where does it start to become its own</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">power game is my question right so for</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:55.519" style="s2">example there was this um</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">there was this i don&#39;t know if you saw</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.519" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">it a big spat on twitter about the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">the statement two plus two equals five</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">and it it was made as a sort of pithy</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:06.159" style="s2">remark by</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">i think james lindsay who&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.159" end="00:33:12.880" style="s2">contentious character and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">also question his um approach and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.880" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">world view in various ways but he posted</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">that and then other people took it up as</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">like yeah two plus two equals four</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">is is basically white supremacy because</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:25.519" style="s2">it&#39;s one kind of rational way of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">coming in and determining everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">else and then other people were arguing</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">yeah well hang on like it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">somewhat a universal through cultures</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">and other people said no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">what would be your take on it because</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">some people would look at that and go</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s important to be aware of power</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">but even with maths</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">is that valid what do you write here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">indigenous knowledge it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">people think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">static and and just remains the same for</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t um we&#39;re always taking on</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">new knowledge but we do it rigorously</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">you know things are tested very</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">rigorously before they&#39;re incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">and basically the the inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">the method of inquiry that we have is</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">about drilling down to the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:10.800" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">of that new of the thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">so you know base as soon as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">saying that i&#39;m thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">trying to get down to what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">foundational story here um</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s seldom what people are talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">you know people are seldom</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">seldom angry for the reason they think</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">and they are never</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">angry for the reason they say so</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:38.560" style="s2">you know you drill down to the story and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of stories there</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">but the foundational story on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">silly little debate because it is silly</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like you might call it a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:55.440" style="s2">bad faith conversation</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:56.639" style="s2">you know um but i i guess you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.440" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">foundational story is</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">where did those uh numerals come from in</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:04.240" style="s2">the first place you know no one&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">like you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.240" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">i i plus i i equals iv are they</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">they&#39;re going one plus one where did</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">they come from</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:18.160" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re arabic numerals</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">and and that&#39;s that uh that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.160" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">project of westernism is to just go</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">around the world and plunder</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">all kinds of stuff and to remove it from</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">its context and build</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:31.200" style="s2">you know this uh canon of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:33.359" style="s2">that&#39;ll be the center of all things</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.200" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">um so i i would say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.359" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">foundational</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the foundational story</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">there so you&#39;d start you</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:43.920" style="s2">i&#39;d probably want to ask an arab</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">mathematician what he thinks about that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.920" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">you know because they have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know they have lots of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">about you know five who&#39;s unlucky and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">all that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">so they probably wouldn&#39;t want two plus</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">two to equal five i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">that&#39;s just that would be a a fun little</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">um look i recommend it to my</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">university like the they have a a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">diversity kind of you know um</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">every university has this they have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">diversity program where they do all</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">and i went look it&#39;s lovely that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">got like a poster of a girl and a hijab</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">um that&#39;s nice but that&#39;s not diversity</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">and inclusion diversity inclusion would</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">be like</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">you know if you were targeting that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">segment if you really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">like equally value that culture&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">knowledge then you&#39;d say right</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">every research project with more than a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">million dollars funding</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">um um has to allow this team of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:51.599" style="s2">of of arab scientists to have a second</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:51.599" style="s2">run at their data</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.079" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">you know so once you&#39;ve analyzed your</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.760" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">data and you&#39;ve got your findings</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">you then have to submit it to this um</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">arab speaking committee</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.960" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">who in arabic speaking their own</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">language will go through and analyze</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">analyze your data and see if they come</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">up with the same findings</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">and that will be a test for rigor i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">if you really did value that culture and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">their knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">and their um facility with these</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">numerals</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">which has a far longer tradition than</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">yours</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">then give them another go of your data</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">and see if they can replicate your</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:25.839" style="s2">results</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">if they can&#39;t have another look at it</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.839" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">bros um</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">they didn&#39;t like that idea that would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">actual diversity</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">and that would be productive diversity</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t they just want the pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">girl in the hijab on the poster</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">you know um they might they might put</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">her on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.160" end="00:37:45.359" style="s2">on the board of something or they might</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">make her a vice chancellor or something</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.359" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">like that and everyone will feel good</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">for about five minutes but you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">you can&#39;t people trying to rescue this</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">but then you&#39;ve got the sjws on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.640" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">other side they&#39;re trying to change the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">system they think that they can make</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">this civilization</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">fair you you can&#39;t so as i said before</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like trying to make your dog into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">vegan um</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">he&#39;s one or two things that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">happen he&#39;s gonna die or he&#39;s gonna eat</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">you know this this civilization this</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">this economic system you know it&#39;s a dog</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">and you don&#39;t want to be a vegan</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">can&#39;t be vegan so so would your</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">suggestion be that we let the dog die</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">and that we see what happens after that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">or or you know we&#39;re in the situation</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">whether we like it or not</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">whoever we are wherever we are so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think there&#39;s there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t any solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know anybody who thinks</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a solution or they have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">plan or a design</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:51.839" style="s2">or anything like that um they&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">idiot</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.839" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">you you can&#39;t dynamic systems don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">operate like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">you know you have a thing called</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">emergence we know this we know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">science on it</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">and you know emergence is the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">that can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">these kind of complexities so all you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">can do is foster the conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.280" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">you know if i was going to go straight</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">from my own like psychotic ideology i</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">would just be like yeah shoot the dog</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">just shoot it shoot it</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">get a goat if you wanted to eat veggies</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">would just be narcissism my narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:30.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t i can&#39;t have a solution nobody</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.119" end="00:39:31.520" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.000" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s insane there</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">corruptable system that would come out</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">yeah um i think we&#39;re just gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">go through</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">all this and you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:49.680" style="s2">unfortunate enough to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:51.520" style="s2">stepped into the twitter sphere and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.680" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">started wrestling the pigs</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">through</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">it&#39;s so interesting what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">comes right back to something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">talking about before which</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">you know this narcissism this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">we can control</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">that this idea that the world is there</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">for us to control rather than</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">you know a lot of um cultures a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:33.160" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:34.400" style="s2">cultures from ancient you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.160" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">pre-socratic</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.400" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">you know in the west as well as around</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">the world had a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">we we need to look after the sacred you</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">know we are stewards of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.520" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">sacred isn&#39;t just there to look after us</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">we look after it and then there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">similar i can think</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">kind of attitude towards the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">like kind of what can this system give</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">me me me as opposed to surrendering and</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:41:00.079" style="s2">allowing it to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">that is so opposite to what western</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.079" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">culture is set up to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">and the value systems that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">we live by you know so i&#39;m just i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:12.400" style="s2">curious about</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">what are some of the the axioms as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.400" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">terrible word for it but what are some</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">of the values that that aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">would use to go hey chill out</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">you know and and be in that flow rather</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">than trying to control it</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">um the terrible answer to that is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.040" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">there are none</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">because they&#39;re not needed</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">like um you know so so</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.920" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">aboriginal culture at its foundation</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">it never separated society from nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">it didn&#39;t have to separate all those</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">abstracts and name those things and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">come up with rules</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">uh to put that the law is natural law</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">and the law</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">is in the land um and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">all around you and you have to follow</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">um and and those laws are inalienable</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.839" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">change it like a bill of rights or a</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:10.960" style="s2">charter or</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:12.079" style="s2">you know a um which is in america always</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:13.440" style="s2">talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.079" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">what&#39;s that document the founding</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">fathers</p>

<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">it starts with c constitution that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">we apparently there&#39;s one for australia</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:28.319" style="s2">too but i mean that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">a funny little temporary tweakable thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:31.920" style="s2">you know it&#39;ll disappear along with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">paper it&#39;s written on</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.920" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">um but you know there is permanent</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">inalienable law</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">and it is in the land it&#39;s in it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">your dna</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s in every natural</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">impulse that</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">the pathological impulses that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">you know in response to a really sick</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">environment a sick</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">habitat and a sick system that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">you know a lot of people think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:08.160" style="s2">our nature is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">we just run around we&#39;re just raping</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.160" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">like that&#39;s what if where</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">we remove this rule of law or anything</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">else it&#39;s just it&#39;s just rape and murder</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">until we&#39;re all dead</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">um but uh that&#39;s not what happened for</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">the last million years</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s been a million years of um</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:28.319" style="s2">symbolic reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">and meaning making at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">because that&#39;s the oldest example of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:35.040" style="s2">symbolic reasoning found with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">the carved shells the beautiful carved</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s a million years old</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">at least who knows how far back before</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">that you know we do have a lot of</p>
