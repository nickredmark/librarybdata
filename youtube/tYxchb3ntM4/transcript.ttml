<p begin="00:00:04.410" end="00:00:09.320" style="s2">recording thanks so much for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.810" end="00:00:12.059" style="s2">conversation we just had part one and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.320" end="00:00:14.700" style="s2">now we&#39;re taking a little bit of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.059" end="00:00:16.440" style="s2">dive into some of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.700" end="00:00:19.050" style="s2">learned from you and and also would love</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.440" end="00:00:22.050" style="s2">to have your reflections on in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.050" end="00:00:23.820" style="s2">my own learning and one I came a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.050" end="00:00:26.279" style="s2">of years ago when I was writing my book</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.820" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">designing regenerative cultures I came</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">across the work of a biologist and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:34.860" style="s2">systems theorist called John Stewart and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:37.230" style="s2">he described evolution in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.860" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">I&#39;d not heard it described before but it</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.230" end="00:00:41.460" style="s2">really made a lot of sense to me he said</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">that the general process of evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.460" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">a process of diversification and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:50.730" style="s2">subsequent integration of that diversity</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:53.129" style="s2">at higher levels of complexity and he</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">said that more often than not in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.129" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">long arc of evolution that reintegration</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">of diversity at higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:05.369" style="s2">complexity happens through collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">processes whether this is to nucleated</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.369" end="00:01:09.180" style="s2">cells in one engulfing the other in</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.229" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">forming a nucleated cells the endless</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.180" end="00:01:13.409" style="s2">symbiosis theory and what that made</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">possible in terms of multicellular</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.409" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">organism and most of higher life-forms</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.619" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">being based on nucleated cells and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">how that from multicellular organism to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">social organism see everytime you get or</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">the complexity of ecosystems that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.330" end="00:01:33.180" style="s2">process by which life creates conditions</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">conducive to life seems to be so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.180" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">more um symbiotic and Symphonic</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:43.140" style="s2">altogether optimizing the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">then it is about competing individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:48.259" style="s2">one against the other I mean both hands</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">and so do you agree that we might have</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.259" end="00:01:53.399" style="s2">in evolutionary theory and also in</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:55.939" style="s2">education around biology and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:01:58.759" style="s2">have somewhat over focused on</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.939" end="00:02:03.450" style="s2">competition as a driving force in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.759" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">evolution and have undervalued the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.450" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">of symbiosis and collaboration that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:09.470" style="s2">actually underlies that when you zoom</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:12.450" style="s2">out and you take a systems view of life</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.470" end="00:02:14.380" style="s2">absolutely absolutely but first let me</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.450" end="00:02:16.900" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.380" end="00:02:22.360" style="s2">I really like Stewart&#39;s way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.900" end="00:02:24.370" style="s2">describing evolution and and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.360" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">emphasis on cooperation makes total</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.370" end="00:02:36.550" style="s2">sense because it is actually implied in</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:41.940" style="s2">the diversification if you understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.550" end="00:02:45.870" style="s2">life as a network then biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.940" end="00:02:50.890" style="s2">means higher complexity of the network</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.870" end="00:02:53.770" style="s2">more connections and since this living</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.890" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">network is a network of processes of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.770" end="00:03:01.480" style="s2">metabolic and cognitive processes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">ecological processes every new</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.480" end="00:03:09.190" style="s2">connection can be seen as a cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">so collections are cooperations and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.190" end="00:03:16.090" style="s2">greater diversity means more cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:19.530" style="s2">or if the cooperation lacks of course it</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.090" end="00:03:22.900" style="s2">means breakdown and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.530" end="00:03:24.730" style="s2">the situation like like we have in in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.900" end="00:03:27.190" style="s2">our political world where we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.730" end="00:03:31.030" style="s2">prejudice in groups fighting each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.190" end="00:03:34.300" style="s2">and and you know distinguishing between</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.030" end="00:03:37.150" style="s2">us and panda me and the other that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.300" end="00:03:38.890" style="s2">the lack of cooperation but nature non</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.150" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">human nature that doesn&#39;t work like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.890" end="00:03:49.390" style="s2">it cooperates basically so so my one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:54.300" style="s2">my great mentors in biology has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.390" end="00:03:59.140" style="s2">Lynn Margulis the famous microbiologist</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.300" end="00:04:04.800" style="s2">who really taught me that among many</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.140" end="00:04:08.130" style="s2">things that there are three avenues of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.800" end="00:04:11.650" style="s2">evolution that the classical</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.130" end="00:04:14.980" style="s2">neo-darwinian theory the the the modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.650" end="00:04:18.010" style="s2">synthesis it&#39;s also called recognizes</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.980" end="00:04:21.370" style="s2">only random mutations followed by</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.010" end="00:04:25.810" style="s2">natural selection but random mutations</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.370" end="00:04:27.560" style="s2">are only part of evolution bacteria can</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.810" end="00:04:30.889" style="s2">mutate very far</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.560" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">and multiply very fast but they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.889" end="00:04:38.660" style="s2">another way of changing the genome and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:42.200" style="s2">that is by horizontal gene transfer they</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.660" end="00:04:46.760" style="s2">trade genes so they spill out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.200" end="00:04:49.940" style="s2">bacterium will in you know day to day in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.760" end="00:04:52.550" style="s2">its day-to-day life it will spill out a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.940" end="00:04:55.940" style="s2">certain proportion of its of its genes</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.550" end="00:04:58.820" style="s2">and other bacteria will absorb it and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.940" end="00:05:01.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a constant trading of genes to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.820" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">the extent that some microbiologists</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.190" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">think that one should not talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:09.410" style="s2">species of bacteria because the genome</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2">is so fluid and always changing that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.410" end="00:05:15.229" style="s2">can&#39;t define species so innocent just</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.220" end="00:05:17.300" style="s2">briefly in a similar way I find that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.229" end="00:05:19.130" style="s2">when we talk about ourselves Homo</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.300" end="00:05:21.100" style="s2">sapiens which is a bit of sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.130" end="00:05:22.669" style="s2">sapiens which is slightly arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.100" end="00:05:26.510" style="s2">compared to whom we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.669" end="00:05:29.540" style="s2">performing and we are not one species we</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.510" end="00:05:31.880" style="s2">are walking ecosystems the amount of gut</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.540" end="00:05:34.430" style="s2">flora and and skin flora that we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.880" end="00:05:36.260" style="s2">that maintain is a life and healthy we</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.430" end="00:05:38.390" style="s2">actually have more non-human cells in</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.260" end="00:05:42.979" style="s2">our bodies and on our bodies than we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.390" end="00:05:45.830" style="s2">have human cells so absolutely yes so so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.979" end="00:05:49.160" style="s2">the second Avenue evolution is the gene</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.830" end="00:05:52.280" style="s2">trading and the third Avenue of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.160" end="00:05:55.220" style="s2">evolution is is something that lynn</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.280" end="00:05:57.950" style="s2">margulis popularized and built a theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.220" end="00:06:01.900" style="s2">around and that&#39;s symbiosis</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.950" end="00:06:06.200" style="s2">so there are you know two organisms</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.900" end="00:06:09.620" style="s2">living in close proximity to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.200" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">that they end up completely depending on</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.620" end="00:06:15.590" style="s2">one another and forming a new organism</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.810" end="00:06:18.169" style="s2">so for example the chloroplasts in plant</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.590" end="00:06:21.080" style="s2">cells that contain the chlorophyll and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.169" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">are essential for photosynthesis were</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.080" end="00:06:28.990" style="s2">original originally individual bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:32.210" style="s2">that invaded the cell and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.990" end="00:06:35.810" style="s2">became comfortable there and collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.210" end="00:06:39.490" style="s2">it cooperated with the plant cell so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.810" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">have these three avenues of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.490" end="00:06:45.889" style="s2">genetics</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:48.020" style="s2">random mutation which is not that random</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.889" end="00:06:51.740" style="s2">either but let&#39;s not get into that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.020" end="00:06:54.680" style="s2">becomes too complicated so random well</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.740" end="00:06:58.939" style="s2">let me just say that an organism can</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.680" end="00:07:01.639" style="s2">control the amount of randomness the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.939" end="00:07:06.439" style="s2">random mutation is based on a copying</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.639" end="00:07:09.050" style="s2">error of the DNA and the error the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.439" end="00:07:10.879" style="s2">amount of error can be controlled by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.050" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">organism but that&#39;s a whole other story</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.879" end="00:07:17.590" style="s2">so anyway you have random mutation gene</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:21.379" style="s2">trading and sim buy or Genesis as</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.590" end="00:07:25.129" style="s2">smuggles calls it now what happens then</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.379" end="00:07:30.289" style="s2">is you have a new genome and that new</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.129" end="00:07:32.659" style="s2">genome has to be integrated into its</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.289" end="00:07:35.629" style="s2">environment into its cellular</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.659" end="00:07:37.550" style="s2">environment into its tissue environment</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.629" end="00:07:40.009" style="s2">and into the larger environment a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.550" end="00:07:42.770" style="s2">natural selection will see to it that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.009" end="00:07:47.539" style="s2">only the successful integration can</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.770" end="00:07:51.169" style="s2">survive now this integration of a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.539" end="00:07:55.069" style="s2">genome in its environment is a highly</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.169" end="00:07:57.860" style="s2">ordered and very complex process you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.069" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">know I remember spending hours with with</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.860" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">Lin one evening at the Cortona school</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:05.960" style="s2">that Pierluigi Louise you organized late</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:08.180" style="s2">at night where she explained to me how</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.960" end="00:08:10.580" style="s2">genomes are integrated in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.180" end="00:08:14.419" style="s2">environment and you know my head began</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.580" end="00:08:18.830" style="s2">to swim it&#39;s very very complex so</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.419" end="00:08:23.870" style="s2">evolution has random elements but</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.830" end="00:08:26.900" style="s2">overall it is an ordered process it is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.870" end="00:08:30.169" style="s2">complex process it is a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.900" end="00:08:32.680" style="s2">process and as we have come to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.169" end="00:08:35.810" style="s2">understand it is a cognitive process</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.680" end="00:08:38.329" style="s2">because according to the so called</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.810" end="00:08:43.159" style="s2">Santiago theory of cognition about which</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.329" end="00:08:45.649" style="s2">I&#39;ve written a lot the the the very</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.159" end="00:08:50.199" style="s2">essential dynamics of self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.649" end="00:08:53.810" style="s2">is cognitive so that&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.199" end="00:08:55.190" style="s2">view of evolution from the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.810" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">lottery point</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.190" end="00:09:00.890" style="s2">fuels new Darwinists yeah and you just</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:05.510" style="s2">gave me the key for the next question</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.890" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">because I remember you and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.510" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">paraphrase because I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:10.670" style="s2">exact quote I remember you saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.690" end="00:09:13.640" style="s2">something I think it was even in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.670" end="00:09:16.870" style="s2">turning point and which was that if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.640" end="00:09:19.310" style="s2">follow the converging crises that we see</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.870" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">around the planet at the moment the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.310" end="00:09:23.540" style="s2">ecological crisis now you could say the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:25.670" style="s2">ecological and the climate crisis the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.540" end="00:09:28.520" style="s2">social crisis and social breakdown and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.670" end="00:09:30.980" style="s2">the ever faster cycles of economic</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.520" end="00:09:33.980" style="s2">crisis and if you follow all these</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.980" end="00:09:35.780" style="s2">rivers upstream you come to one single</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.980" end="00:09:40.070" style="s2">source which is a crisis of perception</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.780" end="00:09:42.500" style="s2">or crisis of consciousness and to some</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.070" end="00:09:45.770" style="s2">extent the Santiago theory of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.500" end="00:09:49.970" style="s2">is one of the first scientific theories</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.770" end="00:09:52.970" style="s2">that overcomes part of that crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.970" end="00:09:57.050" style="s2">consciousness that dualism between mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.970" end="00:10:02.080" style="s2">and matter self and world nature culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.050" end="00:10:05.420" style="s2">the way that we we tend to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.080" end="00:10:08.990" style="s2">things in a Cartesian framework rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.420" end="00:10:14.050" style="s2">than pay attention through the dimension</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.990" end="00:10:19.340" style="s2">of mind in what we are observing yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.050" end="00:10:21.230" style="s2">did talk about the crisis of perception</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.340" end="00:10:24.920" style="s2">I think in the turning point in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.230" end="00:10:28.280" style="s2">early 1980s and I may have got that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.920" end="00:10:30.500" style="s2">phrase from hazel Henderson the radical</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.280" end="00:10:35.840" style="s2">economist who is an old friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.500" end="00:10:40.390" style="s2">so what we&#39;re talking about here is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.840" end="00:10:44.330" style="s2">very profound change of worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.390" end="00:10:47.450" style="s2">has been happening over the last half</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.330" end="00:10:51.470" style="s2">century and longer the change of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.450" end="00:10:54.290" style="s2">paradigms essentially from seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.470" end="00:10:58.520" style="s2">world as a machine to understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.290" end="00:11:02.390" style="s2">as a network and a network of course is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.520" end="00:11:05.270" style="s2">a pattern of relationships and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.390" end="00:11:07.130" style="s2">in order to understand networks we need</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.270" end="00:11:08.600" style="s2">to understand patterns and relationships</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.130" end="00:11:10.910" style="s2">and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.600" end="00:11:13.940" style="s2">systems thinking is all about and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.910" end="00:11:17.899" style="s2">why I call the the new paradigm a</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.940" end="00:11:25.430" style="s2">systemic or system&#39;s view of the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.899" end="00:11:29.319" style="s2">and so this has a profound effect on on</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.430" end="00:11:31.819" style="s2">all our activities and endeavors</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.319" end="00:11:34.430" style="s2">professionally and personally</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.819" end="00:11:37.990" style="s2">because what we&#39;re dealing with in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.430" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">personal and professional lives is</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.990" end="00:11:45.560" style="s2">usually living systems whether we talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:48.860" style="s2">about the economy or education or</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.560" end="00:11:51.709" style="s2">healthcare or management all that has to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.860" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">do with life and so the profound change</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.709" end="00:11:59.389" style="s2">from seeing life as a crock workers as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:12:03.620" style="s2">machine to understanding it as a network</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.389" end="00:12:07.750" style="s2">of processes and as a cognitive network</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.620" end="00:12:11.529" style="s2">and this is now what the Santiago theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.750" end="00:12:15.829" style="s2">developed by Humberto Maturana and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.529" end="00:12:19.399" style="s2">Francisco Varela at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.829" end="00:12:25.310" style="s2">Santiago in in Chile</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.399" end="00:12:28.660" style="s2">what this theory says is that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.310" end="00:12:32.750" style="s2">dynamics of organization of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.660" end="00:12:36.709" style="s2">self-organization of living organisms or</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.750" end="00:12:39.800" style="s2">any living systems is essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.709" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">cognitive process this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.800" end="00:12:46.040" style="s2">expansion of the view of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:51.350" style="s2">cognition is the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.040" end="00:12:55.420" style="s2">activity of living systems so when when</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.350" end="00:12:58.370" style="s2">an organism perceives something that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.420" end="00:13:01.790" style="s2">stimulus so that disturbance as matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.370" end="00:13:07.189" style="s2">Anna calls it will enter the organism</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.790" end="00:13:10.579" style="s2">and the organism will respond to it with</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.189" end="00:13:15.110" style="s2">certain structural changes according to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.579" end="00:13:17.750" style="s2">its nature the environment triggers the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.110" end="00:13:20.149" style="s2">response triggers the structural changes</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.750" end="00:13:22.250" style="s2">but doesn&#39;t determine them and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.149" end="00:13:27.560" style="s2">organism actually cell</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.250" end="00:13:29.480" style="s2">what to notice and what not to notice if</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.560" end="00:13:30.950" style="s2">I understand them correctly there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.480" end="00:13:36.290" style="s2">almost because we talked earlier about</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.950" end="00:13:42.020" style="s2">the kind of parallels of the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.290" end="00:13:43.280" style="s2">traditions to science and this what in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.020" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">the Vedanta they call the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.280" end="00:13:48.740" style="s2">distinction and is is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:51.560" style="s2">organism observed like in in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.740" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">structural coupling between organism and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.560" end="00:13:57.080" style="s2">environment what we now call environment</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:13:59.330" style="s2">actually becomes the environment the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.080" end="00:14:01.970" style="s2">organism becomes organism so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.330" end="00:14:04.340" style="s2">first distinction of the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.970" end="00:14:06.440" style="s2">between organism and environment that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.340" end="00:14:07.490" style="s2">the beginning of that process of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.440" end="00:14:14.870" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.490" end="00:14:22.190" style="s2">yes sorry I didn&#39;t want so so when we</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.870" end="00:14:25.820" style="s2">adopt this view of seeing life around us</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.190" end="00:14:29.410" style="s2">as cognitive cognitive systems and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.820" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">therefore as intelligent this will</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.410" end="00:14:35.540" style="s2">profoundly influence the way we deal</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">with our environment if the environment</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.540" end="00:14:41.420" style="s2">really were a machine then the best way</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:43.730" style="s2">to deal with it would be to control it</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.420" end="00:14:46.010" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do when you drive your</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.730" end="00:14:48.470" style="s2">car you need to control it otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.010" end="00:14:51.200" style="s2">get into trouble the way one deals with</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.470" end="00:14:54.380" style="s2">the machine is you know to control it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.200" end="00:14:57.260" style="s2">but if the environment is a living</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.380" end="00:15:00.020" style="s2">system a living being an intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.260" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">being then the best way to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.020" end="00:15:06.710" style="s2">is not by a domination and control but</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">by a dialogue and cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.710" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">partnership and there&#39;s so much we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:16.090" style="s2">learn from nature so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.310" end="00:15:19.520" style="s2">controlling nature or rather then</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.090" end="00:15:26.450" style="s2">extracting things from nature for our</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.520" end="00:15:30.230" style="s2">use we can extract knowledge from nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.450" end="00:15:33.770" style="s2">and can learn from nature because you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.230" end="00:15:35.510" style="s2">know natural systems have solved many of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.770" end="00:15:38.199" style="s2">the problems we are struggling</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.510" end="00:15:42.230" style="s2">with you know millions of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.199" end="00:15:45.110" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole movement of eco</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.230" end="00:15:47.779" style="s2">design and biomimicry that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.110" end="00:15:52.970" style="s2">tries to learn from nature and copy</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.779" end="00:15:55.699" style="s2">nature to design you know I attempted to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.970" end="00:15:57.560" style="s2">in terms of the languages because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.699" end="00:16:00.860" style="s2">talking about the upstream conception</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.560" end="00:16:02.660" style="s2">change or the consciousness change the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.860" end="00:16:05.180" style="s2">way we used the word nature and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.660" end="00:16:07.820" style="s2">just done it yourself and Jeanine does</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.180" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">it but biomimicry it&#39;s learning from</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.820" end="00:16:13.250" style="s2">nature when we say from we actually put</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:15.019" style="s2">nature back out there again but of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.250" end="00:16:18.290" style="s2">course what we&#39;re really talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.019" end="00:16:22.699" style="s2">is that we as human beings are part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.290" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">that process and we learn as nature from</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.699" end="00:16:28.790" style="s2">the wider community of life yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:33.220" style="s2">that&#39;s right but but of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.790" end="00:16:35.720" style="s2">when you when you interact with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.220" end="00:16:38.089" style="s2">there are connections but there are also</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.720" end="00:16:40.250" style="s2">differences you know I learned from you</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.089" end="00:16:44.630" style="s2">and you learn from me and we both learn</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.250" end="00:16:48.709" style="s2">from nature yeah as the wider context in</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.630" end="00:16:50.600" style="s2">for me the so much about I mean to some</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.709" end="00:16:55.550" style="s2">extent the Santiago theory also speaks</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.600" end="00:16:58.279" style="s2">to what what is life and but the in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.550" end="00:17:00.470" style="s2">work that I do with bringing in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.279" end="00:17:02.779" style="s2">concept of regeneration as life as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.470" end="00:17:04.760" style="s2">regenerative community to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.779" end="00:17:09.020" style="s2">life we were talking about it earlier</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.760" end="00:17:12.799" style="s2">these patterns of complexification also</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.020" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">then in local pockets need breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.799" end="00:17:18.650" style="s2">ossified structures that no longer serve</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:20.900" style="s2">in order to unleash the possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.650" end="00:17:22.510" style="s2">new connections and in in your book the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.900" end="00:17:24.829" style="s2">system&#39;s view of life you have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.510" end="00:17:27.230" style="s2">subchapters one of them ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.829" end="00:17:28.970" style="s2">what is life and then you also ask the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.230" end="00:17:32.919" style="s2">question what is death and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.970" end="00:17:35.870" style="s2">the second part we often culturally add</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.919" end="00:17:39.559" style="s2">two booing death as something negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.870" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">but in many ways good more than 200</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.559" end="00:17:45.980" style="s2">years ago said and that death is life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:48.830" style="s2">ingenious way to create plenty of life</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.980" end="00:17:51.890" style="s2">so I would love for you to to speak</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.830" end="00:17:53.299" style="s2">to that dynamic relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.890" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">life and death</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.299" end="00:17:59.029" style="s2">and how that might inform us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:18:02.929" style="s2">participate in that longer cycle more</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.029" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">wisely no yeah I didn&#39;t know this saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.929" end="00:18:13.940" style="s2">of greater that&#39;s very beautiful and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:16.610" style="s2">well of course the the central question</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.940" end="00:18:20.299" style="s2">that I have been exploring for the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.610" end="00:18:20.840" style="s2">thirty years is the question what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.299" end="00:18:22.789" style="s2">light</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.840" end="00:18:31.210" style="s2">you know the age-old question what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.789" end="00:18:34.669" style="s2">life and so when you go around to</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.210" end="00:18:37.429" style="s2">biology departments and ask the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.669" end="00:18:42.860" style="s2">professor&#39;s there what&#39;s your definition</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.429" end="00:18:46.340" style="s2">of life then they tend to focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.860" end="00:18:49.549" style="s2">structures of living systems so they</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.340" end="00:18:53.960" style="s2">might say well the essential difference</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.549" end="00:18:57.620" style="s2">between a rock and the plant is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:19:00.409" style="s2">that a plant is made of cells all living</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.620" end="00:19:03.500" style="s2">systems are either individual cells or</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.409" end="00:19:07.309" style="s2">made of cells a rock is not made of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.500" end="00:19:11.960" style="s2">cells and within the cells there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.309" end="00:19:16.549" style="s2">very large molecules macromolecules like</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.960" end="00:19:21.860" style="s2">proteins lipids DNA RNA with a carbon</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.549" end="00:19:25.010" style="s2">backbone and some and they don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.860" end="00:19:29.179" style="s2">in nonliving systems and some biologists</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.010" end="00:19:31.130" style="s2">might even say well life is a chemical</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.179" end="00:19:34.100" style="s2">even organism it&#39;s a chemical system</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.130" end="00:19:36.409" style="s2">made of DNA so all you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.100" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">really look for DNA if you see DNA it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.409" end="00:19:41.110" style="s2">alive if you don&#39;t see DNA it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">alive well this sounds very simple but</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.110" end="00:19:50.360" style="s2">it is flawed because dead organisms also</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:52.250" style="s2">contain DNA when an organism dies the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.360" end="00:19:55.519" style="s2">DNA doesn&#39;t disappear it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.250" end="00:19:58.010" style="s2">molecule and it stays there so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.519" end="00:20:00.139" style="s2">difference between the living and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.010" end="00:20:01.720" style="s2">dead organism or living and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.139" end="00:20:05.710" style="s2">non-living organism</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.720" end="00:20:07.870" style="s2">is the process of life is what poets and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.710" end="00:20:12.279" style="s2">philosophers for ages have called the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.870" end="00:20:14.519" style="s2">breath of life and in modern scientific</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.279" end="00:20:17.080" style="s2">language the breath of life is called</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.519" end="00:20:21.179" style="s2">metabolism this is something I learned</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.080" end="00:20:25.299" style="s2">from also from Lynn Margulis she defines</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.179" end="00:20:30.539" style="s2">metabolism as a constant flow of energy</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.299" end="00:20:34.509" style="s2">and matter through a network of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.539" end="00:20:37.509" style="s2">processes of chemical reactions in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.509" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">cell for example which allows the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.509" end="00:20:44.649" style="s2">organism continually to continually</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:49.259" style="s2">regenerate itself repair itself and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.649" end="00:20:54.309" style="s2">perpetuate itself so in this definition</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.259" end="00:20:57.659" style="s2">of metabolism there are two aspects the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.309" end="00:21:01.149" style="s2">flow aspect and the network aspect and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.659" end="00:21:03.580" style="s2">my synthesis of this whole system&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.149" end="00:21:06.279" style="s2">of life is essentially a synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.580" end="00:21:11.860" style="s2">between the flow aspect in the network</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.279" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">aspect so the flow aspect was researched</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.860" end="00:21:16.629" style="s2">and developed by Ilya Prigogine</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:25.029" style="s2">in his concept of dissipative structures</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.629" end="00:21:28.389" style="s2">of systems being continuously far from</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.029" end="00:21:30.669" style="s2">equilibrium subject to constant flows of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.389" end="00:21:33.340" style="s2">energy and matter and then the network</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.669" end="00:21:36.909" style="s2">aspect was developed by matter Anna and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.340" end="00:21:39.309" style="s2">Marella who discovered that the key</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.909" end="00:21:44.129" style="s2">characteristic of these living networks</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.309" end="00:21:47.470" style="s2">is that there are self generating self</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.129" end="00:21:49.659" style="s2">producing self making and they coined</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.470" end="00:21:53.259" style="s2">the Greek term which literally means</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.659" end="00:21:56.139" style="s2">self making that&#39;s Otto poiesis</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.259" end="00:22:01.539" style="s2">Otto polices so these autopoietic</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.139" end="00:22:05.019" style="s2">networks continually regenerate</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.539" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">themselves replace their structures</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.019" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">transform their structures and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:11.799" style="s2">regenerate themselves and you must like</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:13.779" style="s2">that very much</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.799" end="00:22:15.749" style="s2">because you have written this book about</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.779" end="00:22:20.379" style="s2">regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.749" end="00:22:22.869" style="s2">regeneration is a term that is has</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.379" end="00:22:28.779" style="s2">become very popular lately you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.869" end="00:22:32.350" style="s2">thanks partly to your work and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.779" end="00:22:35.049" style="s2">say that if you really understand the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.350" end="00:22:38.710" style="s2">systemic nature of life in terms of Auto</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.049" end="00:22:41.230" style="s2">Asaph that a living system is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.710" end="00:22:46.179" style="s2">regenerative system that&#39;s the very</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.230" end="00:22:48.399" style="s2">definition of life yeah I like life as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.179" end="00:22:49.899" style="s2">planetary process is a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.399" end="00:22:52.379" style="s2">community and when you were saying in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.899" end="00:22:54.580" style="s2">pre-kg and I was reminded suddenly that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.379" end="00:22:56.859" style="s2">when when I first had a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.580" end="00:23:00.580" style="s2">about with with Jim Lovelock at cha maha</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.859" end="00:23:03.070" style="s2">college and about that first moment when</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.580" end="00:23:06.669" style="s2">when he kind of got struck with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.070" end="00:23:10.450" style="s2">first vision of of Gaia as as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.669" end="00:23:13.450" style="s2">planetary process and he was actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.450" end="00:23:16.659" style="s2">working on helping to design new</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.450" end="00:23:17.739" style="s2">instruments for detecting life on Mars</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.659" end="00:23:20.679" style="s2">he was at the Jet Propulsion</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.739" end="00:23:24.159" style="s2">laboratories at the time and in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.679" end="00:23:26.830" style="s2">office nextel data new data came in from</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:29.049" style="s2">radio spectrometry or something of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.830" end="00:23:31.509" style="s2">atmospheric compositions of all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.049" end="00:23:33.489" style="s2">other planets and in his tea break he</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.509" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">just looked at his colleagues dataset</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.489" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">and he noticed something that really</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:40.899" style="s2">struck him which was dead in all on all</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:44.200" style="s2">the other planets in our solar system</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.899" end="00:23:46.809" style="s2">there is a chemical equilibrium meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.200" end="00:23:49.570" style="s2">that all the reactions that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.809" end="00:23:52.179" style="s2">have already happened and and the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.570" end="00:23:54.429" style="s2">gases are in compositions that have</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.179" end="00:23:57.820" style="s2">balanced each other out and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.429" end="00:24:00.700" style="s2">look at Gaia there&#39;s a stock to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.820" end="00:24:03.909" style="s2">equilibrium um that makes life possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.700" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">and and and he at that moment he</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.909" end="00:24:07.720" style="s2">basically almost got himself out of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:09.460" style="s2">job by basically saying we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.720" end="00:24:11.950" style="s2">design more instruments we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.460" end="00:24:15.519" style="s2">send anybody upset I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.950" end="00:24:18.609" style="s2">there isn&#39;t any life there because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.519" end="00:24:22.299" style="s2">the process of life is what creates the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.609" end="00:24:24.749" style="s2">disequilibrium yeah and you know eugene</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.299" end="00:24:26.820" style="s2">would say because the earth is</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.749" end="00:24:29.250" style="s2">dissipative structure and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.820" end="00:24:31.860" style="s2">and Venus and Mars are not dissipative</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.250" end="00:24:34.950" style="s2">structures now Daniel do you know was</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.860" end="00:24:38.549" style="s2">Lovelock way of Riga Sheen&#39;s work at</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.950" end="00:24:40.649" style="s2">that time I actually don&#39;t know and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.549" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">about bad but in terms of the historic</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.649" end="00:24:45.269" style="s2">do you know when prigogine did his work</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:49.769" style="s2">because this insight is in the sixties</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.269" end="00:24:51.570" style="s2">yeah yeah so I think they must have as</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.769" end="00:24:55.409" style="s2">happens people have the same rush</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.570" end="00:24:58.470" style="s2">because and madryn in Bateson you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.409" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">Bateson with its concept of mind as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.470" end="00:25:05.700" style="s2">systems phenomenon and matter Anna with</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">you know this idea of cognition as as</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.700" end="00:25:11.190" style="s2">the dynamics of self-organization but</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:15.299" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s go on to your ask me Bob</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.190" end="00:25:20.519" style="s2">also and this part in our textbook is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.299" end="00:25:24.840" style="s2">actually about the Louise erode and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.519" end="00:25:27.740" style="s2">he says is that life is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.840" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">pattern it&#39;s a pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.740" end="00:25:35.009" style="s2">self-organization of self generation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:38.519" style="s2">regeneration and death is the breaking</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.009" end="00:25:42.710" style="s2">of that pattern but that pattern may</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.519" end="00:25:45.659" style="s2">break all of a sudden when you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.710" end="00:25:49.889" style="s2">somebody has a car accident and dies on</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.659" end="00:25:53.340" style="s2">the spot or a stroke or a heart attack</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.889" end="00:25:56.519" style="s2">or what is more much more common the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.340" end="00:25:59.220" style="s2">pattern may break slowly and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.519" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">process of aging you know certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.220" end="00:26:05.490" style="s2">collections no longer work or you know I</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:08.700" style="s2">know from my experience as I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.490" end="00:26:11.309" style="s2">older my hearing is not what it used to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.700" end="00:26:13.289" style="s2">be you know my attention span is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.309" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">what it used to be of course we wear</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.289" end="00:26:21.659" style="s2">glasses you know yeah I take naps in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:23.879" style="s2">afternoon I don&#39;t have to I can survive</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.659" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">without a nap in the afternoon but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.879" end="00:26:27.629" style="s2">really like it and I highly recommend</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s my it&#39;s my grandmother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.629" end="00:26:37.950" style="s2">recipe for success and she turned 103 so</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:40.590" style="s2">so the slow breaking of this pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.950" end="00:26:45.210" style="s2">connections is for aging is and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.590" end="00:26:47.940" style="s2">eventually resulting in tests and at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.210" end="00:26:49.830" style="s2">end of your book like if you may because</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.940" end="00:26:55.100" style="s2">but before before we go there I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.830" end="00:26:58.860" style="s2">to UM pick up on that dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.100" end="00:27:01.289" style="s2">breakdown or periodic disturbance in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.860" end="00:27:03.570" style="s2">like if we zoom out from the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.289" end="00:27:05.730" style="s2">individual focus on life and we really</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.570" end="00:27:07.710" style="s2">look at life as a systemic phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.730" end="00:27:09.570" style="s2">across ecosystems that maintain</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.710" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">planetary health and the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.570" end="00:27:16.289" style="s2">conducive to life for life on on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:18.090" style="s2">planet M I sense that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.289" end="00:27:20.279" style="s2">discussion at the moment about are we in</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.090" end="00:27:27.330" style="s2">collapse and is there already too late</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.279" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">and life itself teaches that at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.330" end="00:27:34.019" style="s2">of chaos the system as it is at its most</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.200" end="00:27:37.769" style="s2">creative because the rigidity of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.019" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">structures that have created the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.769" end="00:27:41.249" style="s2">imbalance also begin to break down and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:43.110" style="s2">feel like that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.249" end="00:27:45.779" style="s2">happening right now around the globe we</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.110" end="00:27:48.149" style="s2">see systems crumbling and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.779" end="00:27:50.129" style="s2">alarming and it&#39;s disconcerting and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.149" end="00:27:52.379" style="s2">withered we you also see evil monsters</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.129" end="00:27:56.279" style="s2">of the past rear their ugly heads em as</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.379" end="00:27:59.789" style="s2">people demagogues and try to use that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.279" end="00:28:03.149" style="s2">opportunity of multiple breakdowns for</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.789" end="00:28:04.889" style="s2">their own benefits but ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.149" end="00:28:07.649" style="s2">positive take on that would be that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.889" end="00:28:10.409" style="s2">these breakdowns are actually part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.649" end="00:28:12.899" style="s2">the systemic transformation that is now</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.409" end="00:28:15.450" style="s2">really underway and and that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.899" end="00:28:17.850" style="s2">actually is part of life&#39;s pattern to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.450" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">resume without reading absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.850" end="00:28:23.519" style="s2">because something we haven&#39;t talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">about yet is the process of emergence</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.519" end="00:28:29.940" style="s2">which is a key characteristic of life in</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:32.220" style="s2">the system&#39;s fields right and this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.940" end="00:28:36.139" style="s2">something that has been developed by</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.220" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">Ilya Prigogine and and to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.139" end="00:28:43.159" style="s2">understanding the process of emergence</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:48.119" style="s2">is probably the biggest achievement of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.159" end="00:28:54.179" style="s2">complexity theory and what we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.119" end="00:28:57.929" style="s2">understood is that even though all live</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.179" end="00:29:01.429" style="s2">organisms maintain themselves in a state</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.929" end="00:29:05.690" style="s2">of balance in a state of homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.429" end="00:29:10.309" style="s2">every now and then they will encounter a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.690" end="00:29:16.259" style="s2">point of imbalance and at that point of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.309" end="00:29:20.909" style="s2">imbalance and prigogine described this</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.259" end="00:29:23.850" style="s2">dynamic there is there is a disturbance</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.909" end="00:29:26.669" style="s2">either from the environment or from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.850" end="00:29:29.940" style="s2">inner workings of the organism and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.669" end="00:29:32.190" style="s2">instead that disturbance gets sent</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.940" end="00:29:36.779" style="s2">around feedback loops and goes around</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.190" end="00:29:40.039" style="s2">and around and gets amplified as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.779" end="00:29:42.629" style="s2">know there are two kinds of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.039" end="00:29:45.119" style="s2">self-balancing feedback and self</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.629" end="00:29:48.149" style="s2">amplifying feedback so it gets amplified</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.119" end="00:29:49.379" style="s2">and amplified until the system as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.149" end="00:29:53.700" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.379" end="00:29:56.659" style="s2">reaches a state of crisis straight state</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.700" end="00:30:01.350" style="s2">of imbalance technically known as</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.659" end="00:30:03.720" style="s2">bifurcation point and it can then go in</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.350" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">different directions it will either</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.720" end="00:30:10.529" style="s2">break down or more frequently will break</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:12.509" style="s2">through to a new state of order and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.529" end="00:30:15.169" style="s2">is what we are experiencing now in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.509" end="00:30:21.619" style="s2">world at large there there is imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.169" end="00:30:24.269" style="s2">there is crisis there is emergency and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.619" end="00:30:28.100" style="s2">hopefully we will be able to break</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.269" end="00:30:31.830" style="s2">through to a new state of Ohio order</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.100" end="00:30:34.139" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s exactly where I feel we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.830" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">at and the jury is still out whether</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.139" end="00:30:39.960" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna make it but but Daniel I</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:43.019" style="s2">want to come back to life and death and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.960" end="00:30:47.220" style="s2">that good quotation from Goethe that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.019" end="00:30:53.429" style="s2">mentioned and that is is totally borne</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.220" end="00:30:59.809" style="s2">out by by science because when you when</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.429" end="00:31:04.200" style="s2">you think of living systems as</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.809" end="00:31:06.450" style="s2">constantly renewing themselves and when</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.200" end="00:31:07.530" style="s2">you think of this constant regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.450" end="00:31:11.820" style="s2">as the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.530" end="00:31:17.520" style="s2">very essence of life and apply this say</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.820" end="00:31:21.380" style="s2">to a human organism then we know that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.520" end="00:31:25.380" style="s2">constantly renew and recycle ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.380" end="00:31:27.930" style="s2">very rapidly in fact so the stomach</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.380" end="00:31:30.660" style="s2">lining for instance you know changes</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.930" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">completely within 24 hours or something</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.660" end="00:31:36.180" style="s2">like this and you know other other</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:39.690" style="s2">tissues have a rapid turnover of cells</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.180" end="00:31:43.500" style="s2">so this constant self renewal</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.690" end="00:31:45.450" style="s2">is the very essence of life well if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.500" end="00:31:48.450" style="s2">look at it from the point of view of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.450" end="00:31:52.020" style="s2">cell it&#39;s a cycle of life and death so</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.450" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">what is life and death at one level is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.020" end="00:31:58.440" style="s2">the very essence of life at the higher</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:32:00.330" style="s2">level and and that&#39;s a very deep insight</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.440" end="00:32:03.980" style="s2">and I think this is what gorillas who</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.330" end="00:32:08.040" style="s2">had many deep insights meant in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.980" end="00:32:09.660" style="s2">this quotation comes from Goethe suffer</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.040" end="00:32:11.400" style="s2">rhythms on nature which is something</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.660" end="00:32:14.540" style="s2">that he wrote relatively late in life</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.400" end="00:32:16.560" style="s2">where he really in an essence picked up</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.540" end="00:32:19.020" style="s2">some of his learnings and it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.560" end="00:32:20.910" style="s2">actually an older house Huxley&#39;s father</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.020" end="00:32:23.160" style="s2">or grandfather when he got the</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.160" end="00:32:30.540" style="s2">the first edition of nature he got two</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.940" end="00:32:33.510" style="s2">pages and he he quoted Goethe for heart</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.540" end="00:32:36.420" style="s2">for almost half or more than half of his</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.510" end="00:32:40.730" style="s2">new pages and saying something along the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.420" end="00:32:44.430" style="s2">lines of long long after the</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.870" end="00:32:56.610" style="s2">will remain and then then he basically</p>
