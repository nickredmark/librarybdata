<p begin="00:00:19.130" end="00:00:26.100" style="s2">welcome to the wakin up podcast this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.930" end="00:00:29.420" style="s2">Sam Harris okay well today back by</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.100" end="00:00:32.040" style="s2">popular demand I have Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.420" end="00:00:33.560" style="s2">Jordan is a clinical psychologist and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.040" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">professor at the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.560" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">he formerly taught at Harvard University</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:42.239" style="s2">and he has published articles on drug</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:45.540" style="s2">abuse and alcoholism and aggression but</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">he has made a special focus on tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.540" end="00:00:51.269" style="s2">and of late he has been fighting a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">pitched battle against political</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.269" end="00:00:55.769" style="s2">correctness up in Canada and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:00:58.679" style="s2">attracted a lot of support and criticism</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.769" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">on that front as I said last time around</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.679" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">he is far and away the most requested</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:07.980" style="s2">guest I&#39;ve ever had and we did a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:11.370" style="s2">about four or so episodes back entitled</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.980" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">what is true podcast number 62 and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.370" end="00:01:17.700" style="s2">to the disappointment of everyone was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:21.120" style="s2">fairly brutal slog through differing</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.700" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">conceptions of epistemology if ever the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.120" end="00:01:26.760" style="s2">phrase bogged down applied to a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:29.460" style="s2">it applied there some people enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.760" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">but most of you didn&#39;t but as I say in</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.460" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2">the conversation today with Jordan I did</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:37.880" style="s2">a poll online and 30,000 of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.500" end="00:01:39.810" style="s2">responded and 81% wanted us to try again</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.880" end="00:01:43.260" style="s2">because there was much more to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.810" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">about and as it turns out there was we</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.260" end="00:01:47.010" style="s2">had a much better conversation this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">around it was very collegial and if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.010" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">have anything to say about it feel free</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:53.550" style="s2">to reach out to Jordan and me on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:54.150" style="s2">or make noise wherever you want and now</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.550" end="00:01:59.910" style="s2">I bring you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.150" end="00:02:02.040" style="s2">Jordan Peterson I am back here with</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.910" end="00:02:04.080" style="s2">Jordan Peterson Jordan thanks for coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.040" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">back on the podcast my pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.080" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">let&#39;s just take a moment to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">up to speed while we can assume many</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">have heard our previous effort at this</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:17.370" style="s2">all won&#39;t have so we did a podcast a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:21.030" style="s2">little over a month ago it was podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.370" end="00:02:23.640" style="s2">62 I believe on my list and it went</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">fairly haywire we intended to speak</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:28.440" style="s2">about many things but got bogged down on</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:29.130" style="s2">the question of what it means to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.440" end="00:02:31.950" style="s2">that a prophet</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.130" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">is true and I consider this actually a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.950" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">very interesting problem and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:37.830" style="s2">but it seemed to me that we got stuck at</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:40.350" style="s2">a point that wasn&#39;t very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.830" end="00:02:42.690" style="s2">many of our listeners felt the same and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.350" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">at the time I didn&#39;t let the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.690" end="00:02:45.990" style="s2">conversation proceed to other topics</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:47.730" style="s2">because I felt that it would just be</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.990" end="00:02:48.950" style="s2">pointless I knew you wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.730" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">about things like the validity of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.950" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">religious faith and Jungian archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">and many other controversial things and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:03:00.660" style="s2">I felt if we couldn&#39;t agree on what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">separates fact from fantasy we would</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.660" end="00:03:06.570" style="s2">just be doomed to talk past one another</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">I think it&#39;s it&#39;s still possible we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:11.640" style="s2">doomed to talk past one another but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">ran a Twitter poll after our first</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.640" end="00:03:16.920" style="s2">podcast and despite all the complaints I</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">received about our conversation 81% of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.920" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">people wanted us to make a second</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">attempt I think 30,000 people answered</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">that poll so it was a considerable</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">number of people I decided we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:30.390" style="s2">give our our people what most of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">claim to want and we&#39;ll just see how it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.390" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">goes because I don&#39;t want us to fight</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">the same battle all over again I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">listeners who are curious about how that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:42.810" style="s2">last conversation went can listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:44.820" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure the topic of truth and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">falsity will come up but if it does I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.820" end="00:03:50.490" style="s2">think the best thing to do is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:52.920" style="s2">flag it on the fly and move on and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.490" end="00:03:54.600" style="s2">think this will be an exercise in seeing</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.920" end="00:03:58.320" style="s2">just how much can profitably be said</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.600" end="00:04:00.330" style="s2">across different epistemologies with</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.320" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">that warning about the various road</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.330" end="00:04:03.990" style="s2">hazards I think we should just see where</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:06.810" style="s2">we wind up and I think it could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.990" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">someplace interesting because you and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.810" end="00:04:11.100" style="s2">appear to share many of the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">concerns I think we both find the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.100" end="00:04:17.130" style="s2">question of how to live in this world to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">be the most important one and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.130" end="00:04:21.480" style="s2">we&#39;re equally concerned about some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:24.090" style="s2">the very well subscribed answers to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.480" end="00:04:26.070" style="s2">question that are obviously wrong and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.090" end="00:04:27.780" style="s2">I think we should just do our best to to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.070" end="00:04:30.690" style="s2">make sense and see where it goes well I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:34.140" style="s2">hope so too that seems right I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.690" end="00:04:36.510" style="s2">place a tremendous emphasis on the moral</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.140" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">necessity of the spoken truth and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.510" end="00:04:41.700" style="s2">certainly something that I&#39;m in accord</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:44.050" style="s2">with and you&#39;re also concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.700" end="00:04:46.120" style="s2">ethics in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.050" end="00:04:47.950" style="s2">alleviation of suffering from from what</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.120" end="00:04:50.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to understand from what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.950" end="00:04:53.410" style="s2">from what I&#39;ve read of your writings and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.820" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">you&#39;re also very much concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.410" end="00:05:00.010" style="s2">relationship between scientific fact and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:02.230" style="s2">value and so we do share this intense</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.010" end="00:05:04.210" style="s2">concern about the same domain and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.230" end="00:05:06.630" style="s2">think for many of the same reasons and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.210" end="00:05:09.940" style="s2">think that you&#39;re an outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.630" end="00:05:12.250" style="s2">exponent of your particular position and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.940" end="00:05:14.020" style="s2">that makes you an excellent person to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.250" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">talk about these things with I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.020" end="00:05:18.190" style="s2">actually going to start with a bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:20.620" style="s2">apology because I listened to our talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.190" end="00:05:22.690" style="s2">twice trying to figure out where it went</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.620" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">off the rails it actually went okay for</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.690" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">the first hour and then we got bogged</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.060" end="00:05:30.220" style="s2">down in the truth issue and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:33.040" style="s2">made a couple of strategic errors which</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.220" end="00:05:36.340" style="s2">I hope not to repeat the first one was</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.040" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">that um I started the conversation by</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.340" end="00:05:41.020" style="s2">more or less accusing you of being</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">insufficiently Darwinian and that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.020" end="00:05:46.390" style="s2">designed to be I thought playful and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:48.010" style="s2">provocative but when I listened to our</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.390" end="00:05:50.140" style="s2">conversation again I thought that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.010" end="00:05:52.330" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a very wise strategic move that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.140" end="00:05:55.270" style="s2">was one mistake I made in the second</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.330" end="00:05:57.010" style="s2">mistake I made was that I had just read</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.270" end="00:06:00.190" style="s2">a number of things that you had written</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.010" end="00:06:02.440" style="s2">and I told you a lot about what you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.190" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">thought instead of letting you say it</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.440" end="00:06:08.170" style="s2">and I was doing that partly well partly</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:10.540" style="s2">because there is an argument to be had</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.170" end="00:06:12.550" style="s2">here and I suppose partly because I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.540" end="00:06:15.070" style="s2">nervous but also partly to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.550" end="00:06:17.800" style="s2">that I had actually familiarized myself</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.070" end="00:06:19.900" style="s2">with what you had read and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.800" end="00:06:21.340" style="s2">indicate or what you had written and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.900" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">wanted to indicate to you that I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.340" end="00:06:26.320" style="s2">taking it seriously but I&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:27.580" style="s2">to not be the least bit provocative in</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.320" end="00:06:29.890" style="s2">that manner during this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.580" end="00:06:31.570" style="s2">because I really do think that we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.890" end="00:06:32.830" style="s2">something important to talk about and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.570" end="00:06:34.900" style="s2">think that that&#39;s why so many people</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.830" end="00:06:38.260" style="s2">actually want to listen to us talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.900" end="00:06:40.120" style="s2">so anyways Hollywood get bogged down</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.260" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">yeah yeah just in the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.120" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">completing that bit of housekeeping I</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.550" end="00:06:59.070" style="s2">a path through that particular thesis</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.980" end="00:07:01.590" style="s2">that we could converge on as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.070" end="00:07:03.270" style="s2">second point telling me what I think in</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.590" end="00:07:05.580" style="s2">advance of our actually hitting that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.270" end="00:07:08.130" style="s2">topic I think that is that&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.580" end="00:07:10.320" style="s2">certainly a mistake with me or anyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.130" end="00:07:13.350" style="s2">and that&#39;s fine that you did that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.320" end="00:07:15.450" style="s2">postmortem and I agree with that bit so</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.350" end="00:07:18.120" style="s2">let&#39;s just start with a clean slate here</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.450" end="00:07:20.490" style="s2">and I think kind of a natural starting</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.120" end="00:07:22.260" style="s2">point would be to ask you and I again</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.490" end="00:07:24.540" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard a few of the things you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.540" end="00:07:30.270" style="s2">invent yourself anew however it strikes</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.270" end="00:07:34.320" style="s2">you what is the relationship in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.270" end="00:07:37.040" style="s2">view between science and religion well I</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.320" end="00:07:40.620" style="s2">think that religious systems are</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.040" end="00:07:43.770" style="s2">descriptions of how people ought to act</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.620" end="00:07:47.460" style="s2">and I think that the way that I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.770" end="00:07:52.310" style="s2">that those rows in a quasi evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.460" end="00:07:54.539" style="s2">manner and so imagine imagine the</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.539" end="00:08:01.169" style="s2">chimpanzee troop or a wolf pack okay so</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.320" end="00:08:02.700" style="s2">well we&#39;ll use the the wolf idea first</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.169" end="00:08:07.020" style="s2">and then switch if it&#39;s okay to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.700" end="00:08:09.419" style="s2">chimpanzee idea so as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.020" end="00:08:12.750" style="s2">the behavioral actions and interactions</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.419" end="00:08:16.050" style="s2">among social animals you could think of</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.229" end="00:08:35.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a hierarchy of of of</p>

<p begin="00:08:35.490" end="00:08:39.719" style="s2">community understands that hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.620" end="00:08:42.780" style="s2">rank that&#39;s essentially the culture of</p>

<p begin="00:08:42.780" end="00:08:50.070" style="s2">pack and there&#39;s an implicit recognition</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.070" end="00:08:57.480" style="s2">that that troop or pack such that for</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.350" end="00:09:32.279" style="s2">the dominant wolf will not deign to tear</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">it out basically and you can think of</p>

<p begin="00:09:47.160" end="00:09:52.769" style="s2">has indicated for example that if the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.700" end="00:09:55.829" style="s2">dominant arc is only based on brute</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.769" end="00:09:58.140" style="s2">force and that chimp at the top who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.829" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">generally male is there because he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.140" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">barbarian dictator let&#39;s say then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:10.260" style="s2">very likely to be taken out by two male</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:12.990" style="s2">chimps three-quarters his power who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.260" end="00:10:15.510" style="s2">much better at social bonding and who</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.990" end="00:10:19.260" style="s2">made a very tight compact between one</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.510" end="00:10:22.410" style="s2">another and and so that the chimp troop</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.260" end="00:10:25.140" style="s2">that&#39;s based on a tyranny is unstable</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.410" end="00:10:26.940" style="s2">what Dewald indicated was that the chimp</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.140" end="00:10:29.550" style="s2">troops that tend to be more stable are</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.940" end="00:10:31.350" style="s2">run by dominant males who actually are</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.550" end="00:10:33.149" style="s2">very good at social bonding and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.350" end="00:10:35.730" style="s2">reciprocity and who pay a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.149" end="00:10:38.730" style="s2">attention to the females and infants in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.730" end="00:10:41.579" style="s2">the troop so the dominance isn&#39;t power</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.730" end="00:10:44.550" style="s2">so much as as it might as you might</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.579" end="00:10:47.430" style="s2">think of as good politics and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:49.350" style="s2">an emergent ethic that and I truly</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.430" end="00:10:51.930" style="s2">believe it&#39;s emergent ethic that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.350" end="00:10:53.699" style="s2">similar to what Piaget described as</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.930" end="00:10:56.699" style="s2">emerging among children when they play</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.699" end="00:10:59.579" style="s2">games that not only specifies the nature</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.699" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">of the social contract let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.579" end="00:11:05.850" style="s2">also is structured as if the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:11.190" style="s2">within the social contract have some</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.850" end="00:11:13.199" style="s2">implicit value so imagine that as human</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.190" end="00:11:16.259" style="s2">beings diverged away from their</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.199" end="00:11:17.609" style="s2">chimpanzee progenitors there</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.259" end="00:11:21.029" style="s2">the common ancestor we have with</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.609" end="00:11:23.189" style="s2">chimpanzees we already started to act</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.029" end="00:11:25.589" style="s2">out this ethic it was coded in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.189" end="00:11:27.839" style="s2">procedures to speak technically because</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.589" end="00:11:30.569" style="s2">we have a procedural memory and then as</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.839" end="00:11:33.539" style="s2">we develop cortically we watch each</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.569" end="00:11:36.389" style="s2">other and and ourselves very very</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.539" end="00:11:38.819" style="s2">intently and once we developed language</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.389" end="00:11:42.559" style="s2">we were able to start encapsulating that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.819" end="00:11:45.149" style="s2">procedural ethic first in stories and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.559" end="00:11:48.239" style="s2">that story those stories were partly</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.149" end="00:11:50.429" style="s2">about what a very well structured</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.239" end="00:11:53.609" style="s2">procedural ethic might be and how it</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.429" end="00:11:56.489" style="s2">might go wrong but also about how an</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.609" end="00:12:00.809" style="s2">individual within that procedural ethic</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.489" end="00:12:03.749" style="s2">should be treated and should act and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.809" end="00:12:08.059" style="s2">storytelling which was the mapping of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.749" end="00:12:11.129" style="s2">that procedure was the birthplace of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.059" end="00:12:13.919" style="s2">image and story basis of religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.129" end="00:12:15.179" style="s2">aviation as far as I can tell so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.919" end="00:12:17.279" style="s2">the basic thesis</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.179" end="00:12:19.619" style="s2">it&#39;s like piya Jai&#39;s notion that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.279" end="00:12:22.649" style="s2">children when they first come together</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.619" end="00:12:24.389" style="s2">to learn a game if they&#39;re if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.649" end="00:12:26.850" style="s2">young enough they can play the game when</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.389" end="00:12:28.289" style="s2">they&#39;re together but if you take them</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.850" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">out of the game and ask them</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.289" end="00:12:33.989" style="s2">individually about the rules they give</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:35.699" style="s2">widely disparate accounts so they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.989" end="00:12:38.369" style="s2">the procedure in place but they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.699" end="00:12:41.129" style="s2">got the episodic representation</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.369" end="00:12:43.049" style="s2">chemically speaking it&#39;s only until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.129" end="00:12:45.449" style="s2">only once they become more</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.049" end="00:12:46.919" style="s2">linguistically sophisticated that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.449" end="00:12:49.470" style="s2">can actually come up with a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.919" end="00:12:51.720" style="s2">representation of the rules and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.470" end="00:12:54.089" style="s2">it&#39;s only later when they start to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.720" end="00:12:56.189" style="s2">construe themselves not merely as</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.089" end="00:12:58.949" style="s2">followers of the rules but also as</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.189" end="00:13:01.649" style="s2">originators of the rules and that&#39;s akin</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.949" end="00:13:03.389" style="s2">to the recognition of I would say</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.649" end="00:13:06.059" style="s2">constructive individuality in</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.389" end="00:13:08.159" style="s2">relationship to the state so I see these</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.059" end="00:13:11.549" style="s2">things as very very very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.159" end="00:13:13.589" style="s2">biologically predicated whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.549" end="00:13:16.259" style="s2">concept of an archetype come into this</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.589" end="00:13:19.379" style="s2">picture well okay imagine this Sam you</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.259" end="00:13:22.529" style="s2">tell me what you think about this so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.379" end="00:13:24.899" style="s2">know how if you if you have a can I tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.529" end="00:13:26.279" style="s2">you just a two minutes tour sure so okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.899" end="00:13:29.220" style="s2">so one time I was at the hockey rink</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.279" end="00:13:30.150" style="s2">with my son and he was playing he was</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.220" end="00:13:31.860" style="s2">young he&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.150" end="00:13:33.630" style="s2">oh and they were playing this</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.860" end="00:13:36.570" style="s2">championship game in this little league</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.630" end="00:13:37.890" style="s2">that they had and uh my son was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.570" end="00:13:39.930" style="s2">good hockey player but there was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.890" end="00:13:42.600" style="s2">on the team who was better than him who</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.930" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">was kind of a star but he was uh he was</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.600" end="00:13:46.710" style="s2">a diva</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.980" end="00:13:48.390" style="s2">you know and even though he would score</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.710" end="00:13:51.240" style="s2">goals and all of that he wouldn&#39;t pass</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.390" end="00:13:52.770" style="s2">and he wouldn&#39;t he wasn&#39;t facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.240" end="00:13:55.470" style="s2">the development of any of the other team</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.770" end="00:13:58.110" style="s2">members and so anyways we watched this</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.470" end="00:14:00.360" style="s2">game and it was very close it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.110" end="00:14:03.060" style="s2">exciting game and in the final few</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.360" end="00:14:06.510" style="s2">minutes of the last period the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.060" end="00:14:10.650" style="s2">team scored and my son&#39;s team and this</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.510" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">the Stars team lost and so then the kids</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.650" end="00:14:15.720" style="s2">went off the ice in that and the diva</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:17.790" style="s2">kid smashed his hockey stick on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.720" end="00:14:19.830" style="s2">cement and started to complain bitterly</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.790" end="00:14:22.380" style="s2">about how unfair the game is and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.830" end="00:14:25.350" style="s2">his his idiot father came running up to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.380" end="00:14:27.360" style="s2">him and told him how unfair the reffing</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.350" end="00:14:29.070" style="s2">had been out and how it was stolen from</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.360" end="00:14:31.080" style="s2">them and how catastrophic all of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.070" end="00:14:33.480" style="s2">was and I thought it was one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.080" end="00:14:36.420" style="s2">Highness displays of poor parenting that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.480" end="00:14:38.010" style="s2">I&#39;d ever seen now so there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.420" end="00:14:40.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a moral of that story</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.010" end="00:14:43.320" style="s2">so his kid was very good at playing</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.680" end="00:14:46.290" style="s2">hockey but he wasn&#39;t very good at being</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.320" end="00:14:47.910" style="s2">a good player and so you know you always</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.290" end="00:14:49.950" style="s2">tell your kids doesn&#39;t matter whether</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.910" end="00:14:52.140" style="s2">you win or lose it matters how you play</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.950" end="00:14:54.060" style="s2">the game and of course you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.140" end="00:14:56.220" style="s2">what that means and neither does the kid</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.060" end="00:14:57.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s often a mystery to the kid what</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.220" end="00:14:59.850" style="s2">that means because obviously you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.720" end="00:15:04.200" style="s2">trying to win but but imagine it this</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.850" end="00:15:07.340" style="s2">way imagine that human beings that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.200" end="00:15:10.530" style="s2">goal of human life isn&#39;t to win the game</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.340" end="00:15:13.850" style="s2">the goal of human life in some sense is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.530" end="00:15:16.530" style="s2">to win the set of all possible games and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.850" end="00:15:19.200" style="s2">in order to win the set of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.530" end="00:15:22.080" style="s2">games you don&#39;t need to win any</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.200" end="00:15:23.910" style="s2">particular game you have to play in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.080" end="00:15:26.690" style="s2">manner that ensures that you will be</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.910" end="00:15:30.690" style="s2">invited to play more and more games and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.690" end="00:15:32.550" style="s2">so when you tell your children to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.690" end="00:15:35.460" style="s2">good sports to play properly</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.550" end="00:15:38.130" style="s2">what you mean is play to win but play to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.460" end="00:15:40.260" style="s2">win in such a way that people on your</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.130" end="00:15:41.910" style="s2">team are happy to play with you and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.260" end="00:15:43.490" style="s2">people on the other teams are happy to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.910" end="00:15:45.890" style="s2">play with you and so they</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.490" end="00:15:48.860" style="s2">you keep get invite getting invited to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.890" end="00:15:53.750" style="s2">games hmm now if you think of each game</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.860" end="00:15:58.310" style="s2">as a as a small hierarchy of value or</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.750" end="00:16:00.260" style="s2">dominance then obviously the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.310" end="00:16:02.690" style="s2">thing is to move up the hierarchy but</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.260" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s what animals do is they move</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.690" end="00:16:06.830" style="s2">up to in their specific hierarchy but</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:09.050" style="s2">because human beings are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.830" end="00:16:12.040" style="s2">abstraction we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.050" end="00:16:14.600" style="s2">conceptualize the hierarchy as such</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.040" end="00:16:17.570" style="s2">rather than any specific one and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.600" end="00:16:20.060" style="s2">also to characterize a mode of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.570" end="00:16:22.250" style="s2">that is most likely to move you up the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.060" end="00:16:24.830" style="s2">hierarchy no matter what that hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.250" end="00:16:28.190" style="s2">is and as far as I can tell that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.830" end="00:16:30.470" style="s2">archetype of the hero the hero is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.190" end="00:16:33.260" style="s2">person who&#39;s most likely to move up any</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.470" end="00:16:36.709" style="s2">given dominance hierarchy at any time in</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.260" end="00:16:38.870" style="s2">any place and the hero is also and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.709" end="00:16:41.390" style="s2">so that the nature of that archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.870" end="00:16:43.100" style="s2">hero first was acted out it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.390" end="00:16:45.320" style="s2">laid out in procedure and then it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.100" end="00:16:47.510" style="s2">acted out and then it was described but</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.320" end="00:16:50.839" style="s2">it&#39;s also it&#39;s multi-dimensional it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.510" end="00:16:55.520" style="s2">not only he who plays to be invited to</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.839" end="00:16:59.630" style="s2">play again but also he who goes out into</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.520" end="00:17:01.520" style="s2">the great unknown to face chaos and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.630" end="00:17:03.529" style="s2">dangers there but to gather what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.520" end="00:17:06.230" style="s2">valuable as a consequence and to bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.529" end="00:17:08.839" style="s2">it back to the community and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.230" end="00:17:11.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the basis of the dragon myth</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.839" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">archetype which is of course plays out</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.120" end="00:17:15.350" style="s2">in art and literature throat while</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">throughout recorded history the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.350" end="00:17:21.500" style="s2">story we have which is the enuma elish</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.199" end="00:17:24.470" style="s2">from mesopotamia is a story about Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.500" end="00:17:26.929" style="s2">who&#39;s the culture hero and also the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.470" end="00:17:30.380" style="s2">highest God in the Mesopotamian Pantheon</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.929" end="00:17:33.050" style="s2">he confronts the dragon of chaos cups</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.380" end="00:17:37.160" style="s2">her into pieces and makes the world in</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.050" end="00:17:38.540" style="s2">fact one of his names was nem I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.160" end="00:17:41.570" style="s2">remember the name unfortunately but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.540" end="00:17:44.420" style="s2">meant he who creates ingenious things as</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.570" end="00:17:46.790" style="s2">a consequence of the combat with Tiamat</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.420" end="00:17:49.820" style="s2">who&#39;s the dragon of chaos so he cuts off</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.790" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">he cuts up the unknown into pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.820" end="00:17:56.210" style="s2">makes ingenious things out of them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:57.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a perfect description of of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.210" end="00:17:59.480" style="s2">human archetype</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.380" end="00:18:01.850" style="s2">the fact that we are hyper exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.480" end="00:18:04.190" style="s2">and that we use our capacity to explore</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.850" end="00:18:06.020" style="s2">the dangerous unknown to gather the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.190" end="00:18:08.840" style="s2">treasure that lies there and then to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.020" end="00:18:11.510" style="s2">distribute it to the community so and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.840" end="00:18:13.220" style="s2">that in terms of the evolution of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.510" end="00:18:15.680" style="s2">archetype sound think about it this way</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.220" end="00:18:18.860" style="s2">okay and again you can tell me what you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.680" end="00:18:22.100" style="s2">what you think about this so we know</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.860" end="00:18:25.820" style="s2">that roughly speaking that human females</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.100" end="00:18:27.620" style="s2">mate across and up dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.820" end="00:18:30.410" style="s2">whereas chimpanzee females are</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.620" end="00:18:32.630" style="s2">non-selective mater&#39;s the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.410" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">chimps males will chase away the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.630" end="00:18:36.920" style="s2">subordinate chimps from the females in</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:40.490" style="s2">estrus and so they&#39;re more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.920" end="00:18:42.920" style="s2">have offspring but the females will mate</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.490" end="00:18:44.450" style="s2">with anyone whereas human females are</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.920" end="00:18:46.520" style="s2">very selective and they have hidden</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.450" end="00:18:48.440" style="s2">ovulation and they made across and up</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.520" end="00:18:51.770" style="s2">doormen it&#39;s her cue so imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.440" end="00:18:54.590" style="s2">woman wants the man who&#39;s most capable</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.770" end="00:18:57.650" style="s2">of rising up the set of all dominance</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.590" end="00:19:00.530" style="s2">hierarchies so what happens is she</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.650" end="00:19:02.660" style="s2">outsources that problem to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.530" end="00:19:04.970" style="s2">computational capacity of the male</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.660" end="00:19:07.430" style="s2">hierarchy and she lets the men fight it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.970" end="00:19:09.470" style="s2">out among themselves compete and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.430" end="00:19:12.410" style="s2">cooperate to determine who the best man</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.470" end="00:19:15.830" style="s2">is he&#39;s provided with the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.410" end="00:19:19.090" style="s2">the mating opportunities and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.830" end="00:19:21.680" style="s2">how the extended religious phenotype</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.090" end="00:19:23.570" style="s2">manifests itself in evolutionary space</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.680" end="00:19:25.490" style="s2">which was something that you and Richard</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.570" end="00:19:27.290" style="s2">Dawkins were wondering about the last</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.490" end="00:19:29.960" style="s2">time that you talked like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.290" end="00:19:31.670" style="s2">psychopathy which was in some sense you</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.960" end="00:19:34.340" style="s2">know you were thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.670" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">charismatic liar but really what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.340" end="00:19:39.500" style="s2">selected for is the the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:42.770" style="s2">because that&#39;s the right way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.500" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">about it that&#39;s best able to rise across</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.770" end="00:19:47.660" style="s2">the set of all dominance hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:49.580" style="s2">females are selecting very hard for that</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.660" end="00:19:51.860" style="s2">which is at least in part why we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.580" end="00:19:54.920" style="s2">this tremendously expanded cortical</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.860" end="00:19:59.020" style="s2">capacity well let me see if I can wade</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.920" end="00:20:02.120" style="s2">into this picture and find places of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.020" end="00:20:04.070" style="s2">agreement and disagreement for clarity</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.120" end="00:20:06.350" style="s2">sake I think it&#39;s useful to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.070" end="00:20:09.920" style="s2">between two different intellectual</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.130" end="00:20:25.580" style="s2">got here right and this captures all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.250" end="00:20:28.850" style="s2">evolutionary psychology and much of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.580" end="00:20:31.100" style="s2">you just began to say about selection</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.770" end="00:23:33.700" style="s2">you would conclude that given current</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.890" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">opportunities every man should be</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.700" end="00:23:40.280" style="s2">passionately committed to doing more or</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.280" end="00:23:46.010" style="s2">sperm bank because then he would could</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.309" end="00:23:47.990" style="s2">father possibly tens of thousands of</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.970" end="00:24:00.290" style="s2">just get up in the morning with just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.220" end="00:24:02.330" style="s2">commitment to that project unlike any</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.290" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">other that could be discovered in life</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.330" end="00:24:09.410" style="s2">so we have motives and norms and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">concerns that don&#39;t narrowly track a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.410" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">gene level analysis of what we should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:17.270" style="s2">doing so I just put that out there I</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:20.120" style="s2">think the more interesting conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.270" end="00:24:22.760" style="s2">is not to talk about how apes like</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.120" end="00:24:25.309" style="s2">ourselves could have gotten religion but</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.760" end="00:24:27.350" style="s2">to talk about what we should do given</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.309" end="00:24:29.630" style="s2">the way the world is now and what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.350" end="00:24:32.870" style="s2">seem to know about it through science</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.630" end="00:24:34.429" style="s2">well that that&#39;s fine I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.870" end="00:24:37.340" style="s2">make a couple of comments about that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.429" end="00:24:38.179" style="s2">mean the hypotheses that I&#39;m proposing</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.340" end="00:24:40.789" style="s2">is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.179" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">not dependent on group selection so so</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.789" end="00:24:46.129" style="s2">we can leave that one aside as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.869" style="s2">know I think the jury&#39;s out on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.129" end="00:24:49.730" style="s2">ultimate validity of the idea of group</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.869" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">selection but I&#39;m not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.730" end="00:24:52.639" style="s2">going down that rabbit hole because it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:55.309" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter to me one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.639" end="00:24:58.039" style="s2">really how that&#39;s resolved with regards</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.309" end="00:25:00.590" style="s2">to the potential validity of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.039" end="00:25:02.330" style="s2">evolutionarily derived motivations to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.590" end="00:25:04.879" style="s2">the present day I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.330" end="00:25:07.249" style="s2">more complicated so the first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.879" end="00:25:10.070" style="s2">would say is that I believe there has</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.249" end="00:25:13.009" style="s2">been a central march forward with a set</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.070" end="00:25:15.139" style="s2">of very productive ideas as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.009" end="00:25:17.619" style="s2">have evolved their morality but those</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.139" end="00:25:19.970" style="s2">have spun off counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.619" end="00:25:22.279" style="s2">evolutionary dead ends like everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.970" end="00:25:25.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s possible for example that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.279" end="00:25:29.029" style="s2">celibacy is one of those with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.340" end="00:25:31.070" style="s2">the donation to sperm bank idea I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.029" end="00:25:33.559" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially the mosquito way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.070" end="00:25:36.019" style="s2">propagation right and that&#39;s it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.559" end="00:25:37.549" style="s2">versus K is that the tremendous that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.019" end="00:25:39.980" style="s2">correct terminology I don&#39;t remember it</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.549" end="00:25:42.769" style="s2">correctly but there&#39;s two fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.980" end="00:25:44.690" style="s2">different strategies extreme strategies</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.769" end="00:25:48.470" style="s2">for propagating yourself in the world it</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.690" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">one is to disseminate yourself as widely</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.470" end="00:25:53.869" style="s2">as possible and let the offspring live</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:55.759" style="s2">or die as they may which would be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.869" end="00:25:57.559" style="s2">sperm bank approach and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.759" end="00:26:00.139" style="s2">other one which is high investment in</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.559" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">children which is maybe taken to its</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.139" end="00:26:04.509" style="s2">extreme in human beings and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:07.190" style="s2">tilted a lot more towards that and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.509" end="00:26:09.289" style="s2">you can&#39;t really imagine a human being</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.190" end="00:26:10.940" style="s2">being motivated to take the mosquito</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.289" end="00:26:14.119" style="s2">approach because that&#39;s really not built</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.940" end="00:26:16.249" style="s2">into us but but that isn&#39;t to say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.119" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">the sexual morality that&#39;s part and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.249" end="00:26:21.169" style="s2">parcel of our being which seems to tend</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:24.139" style="s2">relatively strongly towards monogamy for</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.169" end="00:26:26.269" style="s2">example as marriage is a human Universal</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.139" end="00:26:28.999" style="s2">although there are variations of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.269" end="00:26:31.940" style="s2">we&#39;re still very much tilted towards the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.999" end="00:26:34.009" style="s2">high investment in single offspring</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.940" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">patterns so let me just clarify one</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.009" end="00:26:39.619" style="s2">point I certainly am NOT saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:41.809" style="s2">can&#39;t see the thumbprint of evolution in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.619" end="00:26:44.119" style="s2">more or less everything we do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.809" end="00:26:46.429" style="s2">obviously can and as you point out our</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.119" end="00:26:47.899" style="s2">sexual morality and our commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.429" end="00:26:50.059" style="s2">monogamy all of that is amenable to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.899" end="00:26:52.310" style="s2">being interpreted in evolutionary terms</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.059" end="00:26:54.890" style="s2">no doubt those stories are</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.310" end="00:26:57.310" style="s2">interesting to understand my point is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.890" end="00:27:00.550" style="s2">that we are in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.310" end="00:27:04.220" style="s2">repudiating and struggling to outgrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.550" end="00:27:06.580" style="s2">most of what evolution has prepared us</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.220" end="00:27:09.020" style="s2">to want and care about and fear</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.580" end="00:27:10.910" style="s2">tribalism xenophobia and the list is</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.020" end="00:27:13.460" style="s2">long but we want we want to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.910" end="00:27:16.130" style="s2">our tribal violence program and all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.460" end="00:27:18.710" style="s2">rest let me address that because you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.130" end="00:27:21.170" style="s2">most of the evolutionary psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.710" end="00:27:23.960" style="s2">that I&#39;ve encountered have what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.170" end="00:27:26.440" style="s2">consider the misbegotten notion that our</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.960" end="00:27:29.660" style="s2">primary period of evolutionary</p>

<p begin="00:29:02.570" end="00:29:05.780" style="s2">been kept conceptualized as feminine</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:07.220" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.780" end="00:29:10.660" style="s2">and I think the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.220" end="00:29:12.710" style="s2">because the unknown it&#39;s the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.660" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">cognitively speaking or territorial</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.710" end="00:29:18.190" style="s2">speaking that gives rise to new forms</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:21.170" style="s2">but it&#39;s also more importantly that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.190" end="00:29:23.480" style="s2">female human beings so the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.170" end="00:29:26.330" style="s2">plays a very vicious role in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.480" end="00:29:29.180" style="s2">selection process you may know and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.330" end="00:29:32.300" style="s2">probably do that you have twice as many</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.180" end="00:29:35.300" style="s2">female ancestors as male ancestors so as</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.300" end="00:29:37.130" style="s2">far as human beings are concerned the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.300" end="00:29:39.890" style="s2">feminine is a bottleneck through which</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.130" end="00:29:41.870" style="s2">genes must pass so to speak and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.890" end="00:29:44.330" style="s2">very narrow and picky and choosey</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.870" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">bottleneck so it has a positive element</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.330" end="00:29:49.040" style="s2">and a negative element so roughly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">the same thing Sam that&#39;s represented in</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.040" end="00:29:55.460" style="s2">the Taoist yin-yang symbol because that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:58.190" style="s2">yin-yang symbol basically is predicated</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.460" end="00:30:01.130" style="s2">on the idea that being is partly the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.190" end="00:30:03.050" style="s2">known or the interpretive structure</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.130" end="00:30:05.000" style="s2">that&#39;s brought to bear on the situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.050" end="00:30:07.580" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the white paisley it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.000" end="00:30:09.800" style="s2">serpent actually and the unknown which</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.580" end="00:30:12.050" style="s2">is the black paisley or serpent and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.800" end="00:30:14.660" style="s2">two ER are interchangeable and out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.050" end="00:30:16.280" style="s2">them arises meaning so the idea behind</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.660" end="00:30:18.950" style="s2">the Taoist symbol is that you should</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.280" end="00:30:21.170" style="s2">have one foot in what you know and one</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.950" end="00:30:23.480" style="s2">foot in you in what you don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.170" end="00:30:25.910" style="s2">that&#39;s the place where information flow</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.480" end="00:30:27.830" style="s2">is maximized and that&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.910" end="00:30:30.020" style="s2">as occupying the position of the hero</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.830" end="00:30:33.130" style="s2">who confronts the unknown and generates</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.020" end="00:30:35.920" style="s2">new information and those those</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.130" end="00:30:39.560" style="s2">evolutionary realities remain absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.920" end="00:30:41.900" style="s2">unchanged the idea that every place you</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.560" end="00:30:43.700" style="s2">go there&#39;s something you know and an</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.900" end="00:30:45.530" style="s2">interpretive framework that you bring to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.700" end="00:30:47.990" style="s2">bear so there&#39;s a cultural element and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.530" end="00:30:50.300" style="s2">everywhere you go or are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.990" end="00:30:52.040" style="s2">something that transcends that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.300" end="00:30:55.310" style="s2">that you have to deal with and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.040" end="00:30:58.400" style="s2">everywhere you go you&#39;re there and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.310" end="00:31:00.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the so the three basic archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.400" end="00:31:03.140" style="s2">characters of Mythology are the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.200" end="00:31:05.920" style="s2">individual positive a negative culture</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.140" end="00:31:08.390" style="s2">positive and negative and nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.920" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">positive and negative and we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.390" end="00:31:12.650" style="s2">outgrown that in the least it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:14.990" style="s2">the same problem it&#39;s always being and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.650" end="00:31:16.850" style="s2">as far as I can tell it&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.990" end="00:31:19.520" style="s2">same set of problems that always will be</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.850" end="00:31:24.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly why these archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.520" end="00:31:27.590" style="s2">can&#39;t be cannot be transcended and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.020" end="00:31:28.400" style="s2">cannot be ignored they pop up of their</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.590" end="00:31:30.770" style="s2">own accord</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.400" end="00:31:33.920" style="s2">I mean look give you an example one</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.770" end="00:31:37.040" style="s2">question you Norden how is any of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.920" end="00:31:40.010" style="s2">religious though I understand how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.040" end="00:31:44.540" style="s2">know thinking of the individual versus</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.010" end="00:31:45.800" style="s2">the cosmos gives us a kind of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.540" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">structure right you have your</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.800" end="00:31:51.170" style="s2">protagonist and you have all the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:53.740" style="s2">that can happen to him or not and all</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.170" end="00:31:57.650" style="s2">the things that he can want or not and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.740" end="00:31:59.690" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to conceive of any human</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.650" end="00:32:02.990" style="s2">life or the life of a whole civilization</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.690" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">in terms of stories like that but how</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.990" end="00:32:07.400" style="s2">does this bring religion into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:09.230" style="s2">picture okay well I&#39;m going to approach</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.400" end="00:32:13.100" style="s2">that from two perspectives the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.230" end="00:32:15.910" style="s2">perspective I presume is one that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.100" end="00:32:18.020" style="s2">might find interesting given your your</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.910" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">interest in spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.020" end="00:32:25.490" style="s2">so it&#39;s certainly capable for people to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">experience deeply a sense of meaning no</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.490" end="00:32:29.330" style="s2">csikszentmihalyi talked about that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:30.980" style="s2">flow which i think is a rather trivial</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.330" end="00:32:32.780" style="s2">way of dealing with it but at least it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.980" end="00:32:35.870" style="s2">one that people can directly understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.780" end="00:32:36.920" style="s2">but I would say you can understand when</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.870" end="00:32:39.560" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.920" end="00:32:41.810" style="s2">because you&#39;re deeply engaged in it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.560" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">you also have a sense in some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.810" end="00:32:46.670" style="s2">standing outside of time because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:49.880" style="s2">don&#39;t times flow and it also feels</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.670" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">worthwhile and that the sacrifices that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.880" end="00:32:55.370" style="s2">you have made to enable yourself to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:58.970" style="s2">that were justified and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.370" end="00:33:01.790" style="s2">because the ultimate domains of reality</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.970" end="00:33:04.580" style="s2">are in fact chaos and order or known and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.790" end="00:33:07.250" style="s2">unknown that when you straddle those two</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.580" end="00:33:09.950" style="s2">properly and maximize information flow</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.250" end="00:33:13.370" style="s2">you feel in a deep sense of intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.950" end="00:33:15.140" style="s2">meaning and that&#39;s the output of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.370" end="00:33:17.030" style="s2">entire structure of your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.140" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">telling you that you&#39;re in the right</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.030" end="00:33:22.610" style="s2">place at the right time with regards to</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.610" end="00:33:28.120" style="s2">and move forward a question here Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.160" end="00:33:31.730" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you grant that there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.120" end="00:33:34.520" style="s2">pathological experiences of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.730" end="00:33:37.400" style="s2">meaning that is actually based on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.520" end="00:33:40.100" style="s2">misconception or divorced from the truth</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.400" end="00:33:41.420" style="s2">which can be no less intoxicating to the</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.450" end="00:35:44.120" style="s2">have to ally yourself with the</p>

<p begin="00:35:49.820" end="00:35:54.980" style="s2">yourself and then well and then all hell</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.980" end="00:35:59.630" style="s2">life of others and you could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.740" end="00:36:01.490" style="s2">rigorously honest but still mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.630" end="00:36:04.790" style="s2">right um you could have a belief system</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.490" end="00:36:07.450" style="s2">or be raised in a culture that has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.790" end="00:36:11.030" style="s2">belief system that is completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.450" end="00:36:14.300" style="s2">illogical or out of touch with reality</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.300" end="00:36:18.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be local to your own</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.220" end="00:36:21.830" style="s2">brain you could just be confused right</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.790" end="00:36:23.810" style="s2">well I think this is partly why I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.830" end="00:36:25.310" style="s2">more insistent than I should have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.810" end="00:36:27.800" style="s2">in our last discussion about a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.310" end="00:36:30.860" style="s2">particular idea about truth I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.800" end="00:36:33.500" style="s2">because I would say there&#39;s the truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.860" end="00:36:35.930" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with being in</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.500" end="00:36:39.500" style="s2">possession of a set of accurate facts</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.930" end="00:36:41.810" style="s2">but there&#39;s a more enacted truth or</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.500" end="00:36:44.420" style="s2">embodied truth which is the consistent</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.810" end="00:36:47.570" style="s2">attempt to go beyond what you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.420" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">so that would be the necessity of living</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.570" end="00:36:53.720" style="s2">in humility or in ignorance and so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.720" end="00:36:57.890" style="s2">with someone or when you&#39;re acting in</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:37:00.110" style="s2">the world is not so much attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.890" end="00:37:03.170" style="s2">prove that what you already know is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.110" end="00:37:05.570" style="s2">completely right and correct but</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.170" end="00:37:08.180" style="s2">attempting to understand very carefully</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.570" end="00:37:10.250" style="s2">where you&#39;re in error and learning</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.180" end="00:37:14.090" style="s2">everything you can to correct back and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.250" end="00:37:18.080" style="s2">you see that idea is also deeply rooted</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.090" end="00:37:21.560" style="s2">in in religious mythology so for example</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.080" end="00:37:25.400" style="s2">the figure of Horus who&#39;s the Egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.560" end="00:37:27.590" style="s2">eye and who&#39;s also a falcon now Horus is</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.400" end="00:37:28.910" style="s2">an eye and a falcon because Falcons can</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.590" end="00:37:30.980" style="s2">see better than any other animal</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.910" end="00:37:33.320" style="s2">including human beings even though we</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.980" end="00:37:35.510" style="s2">can see very well and he&#39;s an eye</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.320" end="00:37:38.450" style="s2">because the eye with the open iris</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.510" end="00:37:41.810" style="s2">signifies paying attention and Horus</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.450" end="00:37:45.170" style="s2">who&#39;s a messianic figure in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.810" end="00:37:47.390" style="s2">for the ancient Egyptians had his eyes</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.170" end="00:37:49.580" style="s2">open to the corruption of the state</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.390" end="00:37:53.720" style="s2">which was symbolized by a deity named</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.580" end="00:37:55.430" style="s2">Seth Seth who later became Satan in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.720" end="00:37:59.000" style="s2">developmental pathway of this set of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.430" end="00:37:59.390" style="s2">ideas and Horus who lived in truth so</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.000" end="00:38:01.820" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.390" end="00:38:04.070" style="s2">was able to keep his eyes open and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.820" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">understand the corrupt nature of his</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.070" end="00:38:09.860" style="s2">society and his uncle his uncle was Seth</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:12.260" style="s2">and to put that right again and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.860" end="00:38:15.940" style="s2">there&#39;s the there&#39;s the idea that lived</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.260" end="00:38:18.620" style="s2">truth can rescue you from pathological</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.940" end="00:38:20.690" style="s2">untruth and that might be moral or</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.620" end="00:38:23.480" style="s2">factual if you&#39;re a scientist and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.690" end="00:38:26.330" style="s2">operating in a truthful manner you</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.480" end="00:38:29.630" style="s2">update archaic archaic</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.610" end="00:38:36.040" style="s2">type of person then what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.350" end="00:38:38.000" style="s2">updating archaic and blind</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.040" end="00:38:40.280" style="s2">representations of the proper moral</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.280" end="00:38:46.130" style="s2">encapsulated completely in a set of</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.350" end="00:38:48.980" style="s2">rules see that&#39;s partly why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.130" end="00:38:50.840" style="s2">partly why for example in in in the line</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.980" end="00:38:53.150" style="s2">of Christian thought Moses couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.840" end="00:38:55.940" style="s2">reach the promised land because his</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.150" end="00:38:58.700" style="s2">morality was bounded by rules and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.940" end="00:39:01.790" style="s2">not possible to reach the proper mode of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.700" end="00:39:03.380" style="s2">being by only acting out rules because</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.790" end="00:39:07.070" style="s2">rules are the same rules aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.380" end="00:39:10.040" style="s2">applicable in every situation I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.070" end="00:39:11.960" style="s2">could tell you the Christian story in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.040" end="00:39:14.660" style="s2">way that you might find interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.960" end="00:39:16.490" style="s2">about ten minutes if you if you would</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.660" end="00:39:17.810" style="s2">like me to do that and let&#39;s hold off on</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.490" end="00:39:20.150" style="s2">Christianity I want to get there because</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.810" end="00:39:23.090" style="s2">I know that&#39;s the the system of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.150" end="00:39:24.650" style="s2">you find most interesting in this area</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.090" end="00:39:28.010" style="s2">and so I would like to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.650" end="00:39:31.850" style="s2">okay my issue is that it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.010" end="00:39:35.150" style="s2">that this kind of language game of you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.850" end="00:39:37.850" style="s2">talking about ancient stories and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.150" end="00:39:40.850" style="s2">way in which they seem to cash out some</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.850" end="00:39:43.100" style="s2">of the pre scientific intuitions and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.850" end="00:39:45.950" style="s2">moral norms of any group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.100" end="00:39:48.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s a validity to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.950" end="00:39:49.940" style="s2">picture when you talk that way that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.200" end="00:39:53.180" style="s2">just see that that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.940" end="00:39:55.310" style="s2">unconstrained by anything I think you</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.180" end="00:39:56.900" style="s2">can do that with anything with any</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.310" end="00:39:59.450" style="s2">system of beliefs you can find two</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.900" end="00:40:02.060" style="s2">people which from my point of view are</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.450" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">living in some form of radical error</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.060" end="00:40:05.360" style="s2">which is to say that virtually</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">everything they think is true almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.360" end="00:40:10.610" style="s2">certainly isn&#39;t and the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:12.950" style="s2">treating one another is terrible on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.610" end="00:40:14.750" style="s2">basis of those misconceptions and there</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.950" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">never going to get anywhere worth going</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.750" end="00:40:19.310" style="s2">right so a modern example of that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:21.829" style="s2">something like Isis or the Taliban but</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.310" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">there&#39;s some ancient examples or you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.829" end="00:40:26.839" style="s2">know older examples that are in some</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:29.150" style="s2">cases even easier to understand because</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.839" end="00:40:30.920" style="s2">we have no affinity for them so did you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.150" end="00:40:32.780" style="s2">know that the dough boo people the</p>

<p begin="00:40:46.579" end="00:40:50.599" style="s2">tragically confused people who have ever</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.599" end="00:40:54.859" style="s2">hothouse version of radical confusion</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.420" end="00:40:56.960" style="s2">which you wouldn&#39;t believe would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.859" end="00:40:59.240" style="s2">possible but for the fact that some</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:41:02.089" style="s2">anthropologist wrote about it but so</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.240" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">this was a culture that was completely</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.109" end="00:41:19.700" style="s2">magically stealing their possessions and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.780" end="00:41:23.089" style="s2">especially their crops it was like a</p>

<p begin="00:41:23.089" end="00:41:28.369" style="s2">all in this way and and they believed</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.369" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">to everything they literally thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.780" end="00:41:33.650" style="s2">that gravity had to be supplemented by</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:35.300" style="s2">magic so that if you didn&#39;t cast the</p>

<p begin="00:41:35.300" end="00:41:41.210" style="s2">rise out of the ground and disappear and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.750" end="00:41:44.030" style="s2">they thought every interaction of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.210" end="00:41:46.520" style="s2">sort and every outcome for people was</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.030" end="00:41:47.869" style="s2">zero-sum so that if one man succeeded in</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.520" end="00:41:50.630" style="s2">growing more vegetables than his</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.869" end="00:41:53.720" style="s2">neighbor his success his surplus of</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.630" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">vegetables must have been stolen from</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.720" end="00:41:57.890" style="s2">one of his neighbors through sorcery</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:42:00.230" style="s2">even the farmer who got lucky in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.890" end="00:42:02.329" style="s2">way with a surplus would have believed</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.230" end="00:42:03.890" style="s2">that he succeeded for this reason that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.329" end="00:42:05.540" style="s2">he actually magically stole his</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.540" end="00:42:10.220" style="s2">harvest was a crime by everyone&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:42:10.220" end="00:42:17.030" style="s2">lucky harvester and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.680" end="00:42:18.200" style="s2">you could play this same game with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.030" end="00:42:19.730" style="s2">dough boom you could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.200" end="00:42:22.369" style="s2">archetypes you could talk about whatever</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.369" end="00:42:26.540" style="s2">were using to justify this this view of</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.210" end="00:42:33.320" style="s2">threading the needle of how what they</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.070" end="00:42:35.600" style="s2">were doing was response to the ancient</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.600" end="00:42:40.280" style="s2">know you could give some sympathetic</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.280" end="00:42:46.610" style="s2">of myth and archetype and meaning but</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.180" end="00:42:49.640" style="s2">clearly this was like a kind of strange</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.610" end="00:42:52.940" style="s2">basin of Attraction that you&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.640" end="00:42:55.550" style="s2">lucky never to have found as a tribe or</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.940" end="00:42:57.650" style="s2">as a culture and we&#39;re very lucky not to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.550" end="00:42:59.870" style="s2">be stuck in some similar place there</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.650" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">there&#39;s another detail here which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.870" end="00:43:05.030" style="s2">especially horrible because the DOE boo</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">felt that magic became more powerful the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.030" end="00:43:09.650" style="s2">closer you were to somebody so that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:12.410" style="s2">people who were closest to them in life</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.650" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">their spouses or their children were the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.410" end="00:43:16.730" style="s2">people who are most likely to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">them with their magical powers well</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.730" end="00:43:20.630" style="s2">that&#39;s actually true salmon ever had</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:21.980" style="s2">family you know that but yeah so again</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.630" end="00:43:24.140" style="s2">you you could you could connect it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.980" end="00:43:25.790" style="s2">some kind of story that makes sense you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.140" end="00:43:28.370" style="s2">could go to Greek mythology and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.790" end="00:43:31.910" style="s2">Shakespeare and spin a yarn about it but</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.370" end="00:43:35.540" style="s2">clearly this underlying belief in magic</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.910" end="00:43:39.500" style="s2">was one it&#39;s almost certainly not true</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.540" end="00:43:41.330" style="s2">but - it was creating a truly toxic</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.500" end="00:43:43.160" style="s2">moral environment for these people and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.330" end="00:43:44.990" style="s2">so yeah I just put that out there as an</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.160" end="00:43:48.860" style="s2">example of something that one would</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.990" end="00:43:52.220" style="s2">never want to spend a lot of time trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.860" end="00:43:54.950" style="s2">to justify this worldview by reference</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.220" end="00:43:57.080" style="s2">to stories ancient or otherwise yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.950" end="00:43:58.760" style="s2">well I mean there&#39;s actually a technical</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.080" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">solution to the problem that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.760" end="00:44:05.540" style="s2">posing I mean part of the problem is how</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:08.210" style="s2">do you know if what you&#39;re looking at is</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.540" end="00:44:11.090" style="s2">a genuine thing or an artifact of your</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.210" end="00:44:15.380" style="s2">imagination and you know that Paul me</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.090" end="00:44:17.720" style="s2">land and his his uh his colleague Kronk</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.380" end="00:44:20.690" style="s2">cronbach basically addressed that back</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.720" end="00:44:23.000" style="s2">in the 1950s with a very solid piece of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.690" end="00:44:25.730" style="s2">methodological work that every</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.000" end="00:44:26.090" style="s2">psychologist either does or should know</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.730" end="00:44:27.860" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.090" end="00:44:30.740" style="s2">they were the inventors of the multi</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.740" end="00:44:36.230" style="s2">process which is a pretty awful jumble</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.280" end="00:44:38.660" style="s2">of words but basically it means</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.230" end="00:44:39.900" style="s2">something like in order to specify</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.660" end="00:44:42.390" style="s2">whether or not something</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.900" end="00:44:44.970" style="s2">exists you have used multiple methods to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.390" end="00:44:48.660" style="s2">detect it and that their reports should</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.970" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">Co very positively and so of course we</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.660" end="00:44:53.910" style="s2">do exactly that with our five senses you</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:55.650" style="s2">know just because you can see something</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.910" end="00:44:58.289" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s there but if you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.650" end="00:45:00.900" style="s2">see it and hear it well you&#39;re a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.289" end="00:45:02.369" style="s2">bit more certain when I wrote my book</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.900" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.369" end="00:45:08.670" style="s2">I was very acutely aware of that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:10.700" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly criticism that has been</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.670" end="00:45:14.130" style="s2">leveled against people like Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.700" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">mostly tragically enough by the post</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.130" end="00:45:17.940" style="s2">modernists of course who don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:20.099" style="s2">in any sort of overarching narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.940" end="00:45:24.119" style="s2">who have their own form of Dogen like</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.099" end="00:45:28.760" style="s2">pathology distributed well widely among</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.119" end="00:45:32.099" style="s2">them so what I did was refused to take a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.760" end="00:45:34.410" style="s2">presupposition as acceptable unless I</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.099" end="00:45:36.900" style="s2">could find its manifestation at at least</p>

<p begin="00:45:36.900" end="00:45:43.349" style="s2">so for example in my book I start out</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.980" end="00:45:45.630" style="s2">with a neuropsychological account an</p>

<p begin="00:46:42.930" end="00:46:47.640" style="s2">also wanted to ensure that it was in</p>

<p begin="00:47:44.550" end="00:47:48.780" style="s2">if we can talk about specifics but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.380" end="00:47:50.190" style="s2">just want to take a generic starting</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.780" end="00:47:51.869" style="s2">point which for me is more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.190" end="00:47:54.349" style="s2">and I think more illuminating it</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.869" end="00:47:57.720" style="s2">certainly describes the divide between</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.349" end="00:48:00.060" style="s2">science and religion that resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.720" end="00:48:01.859" style="s2">me and I think it connects nicely to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.060" end="00:48:03.480" style="s2">way you were describing kind of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.859" end="00:48:06.690" style="s2">primal circumstance of being an</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.480" end="00:48:09.990" style="s2">individual or a tribe standing in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.690" end="00:48:12.570" style="s2">face of mute and often hostile nature</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.990" end="00:48:14.970" style="s2">and trying to figure out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.570" end="00:48:16.890" style="s2">and how to live within it I think that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.970" end="00:48:19.349" style="s2">really is the primal circumstance this</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.890" end="00:48:21.750" style="s2">is what I think of religion as you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.349" end="00:48:24.060" style="s2">as a kind of failed science as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.750" end="00:48:26.070" style="s2">first attempt to tell a story about</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.060" end="00:48:28.920" style="s2">what&#39;s going on it gives us some power</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.070" end="00:48:31.260" style="s2">over it but it&#39;s a bad attempt because</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.920" end="00:48:33.000" style="s2">we didn&#39;t develop any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.260" end="00:48:35.190" style="s2">methodology at that point to</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.000" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">differentiate fact from fiction</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.190" end="00:48:40.440" style="s2">take the case that every parent will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">familiar with of standing helplessly</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.440" end="00:48:45.450" style="s2">over your sick child wondering what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:47.609" style="s2">wrong let&#39;s say your child throws up and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.450" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">has a fever and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.609" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">wrong with him or her and this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:53.580" style="s2">obviously one of the more the more</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:55.710" style="s2">ancient moments for any person and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.580" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know obvious evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.710" end="00:49:00.150" style="s2">reasons why we would be concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:03.030" style="s2">this and so this is quite Darwinian to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.150" end="00:49:04.820" style="s2">care what&#39;s happening to your infant but</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.030" end="00:49:08.180" style="s2">today this</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.820" end="00:49:11.750" style="s2">of uncertainty and helplessness and fear</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.180" end="00:49:13.220" style="s2">is bracketed by a basic understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.750" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">the processes in the world that can</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.220" end="00:49:17.360" style="s2">affect a human body and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">obviously enough to worry about there to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.360" end="00:49:23.270" style="s2">drive almost any parent crazy but one</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:25.910" style="s2">thing that is no longer on the menu is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.270" end="00:49:29.540" style="s2">the evil eye when your child gets sick</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.910" end="00:49:31.850" style="s2">no part of your mind if you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.540" end="00:49:33.650" style="s2">now devoted to the question of whether</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.850" end="00:49:36.950" style="s2">or not you should go burn your neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.650" end="00:49:39.530" style="s2">as a witch because she might have cast a</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.950" end="00:49:42.260" style="s2">malicious glance at your child right but</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.530" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">as you know that was not always so and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.260" end="00:49:45.800" style="s2">in fact in Africa people are still</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:46.610" style="s2">murdering their neighbors for the crime</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.800" end="00:49:49.670" style="s2">of witchcraft</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.610" end="00:49:52.730" style="s2">so the problem from my point of view is</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.670" end="00:49:55.820" style="s2">twofold one is that we know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.730" end="00:49:57.740" style="s2">a path forward to rule out things like</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.820" end="00:49:59.720" style="s2">witchcraft and the evil eye and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.740" end="00:50:02.780" style="s2">this path is science and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.720" end="00:50:07.010" style="s2">generally but the other problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.780" end="00:50:09.320" style="s2">you could still play this game by resort</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.010" end="00:50:11.210" style="s2">to ancient stories and finding some</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.320" end="00:50:13.480" style="s2">connection between those stories and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.210" end="00:50:16.550" style="s2">evolution you could play a game of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.480" end="00:50:18.470" style="s2">dignifying a belief in magic in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.550" end="00:50:21.530" style="s2">case you know the evil eye specifically</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.470" end="00:50:24.530" style="s2">along Jungian lines or archetypal lines</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.530" end="00:50:27.860" style="s2">or something you could be sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.530" end="00:50:29.690" style="s2">with this picture but my point is what</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.860" end="00:50:32.000" style="s2">would be the point of that given the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.690" end="00:50:34.700" style="s2">obvious harms that we no longer need</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.000" end="00:50:37.820" style="s2">commit based on disavowing this ancient</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.700" end="00:50:41.140" style="s2">ignorance why would one spend any time</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.820" end="00:50:43.850" style="s2">at all trying to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.140" end="00:50:46.040" style="s2">admittedly ancient concern about</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.850" end="00:50:48.770" style="s2">sympathetic magic right sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.040" end="00:50:51.530" style="s2">magic is dangerous that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.770" end="00:50:53.870" style="s2">basically all I think we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.530" end="00:50:56.600" style="s2">about it now and yet you could spend a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.870" end="00:50:58.940" style="s2">lifetime you could be reading not only</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.600" end="00:51:01.550" style="s2">young but you know sketchier people like</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.940" end="00:51:02.180" style="s2">Aleister Crowley and Elif ass Levy and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.550" end="00:51:05.150" style="s2">all that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.180" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">the history of hermeticism and you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.150" end="00:51:09.020" style="s2">open you know Manley Palmer halls the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:11.420" style="s2">secret teachings of all ages and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.020" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">just get deep into that stuff the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.420" end="00:51:16.010" style="s2">tradition of Western magic right seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:18.060" style="s2">to me to be almost by definition a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.010" end="00:51:20.310" style="s2">colossal waste of time</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.060" end="00:51:22.500" style="s2">and actually unnecessary to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.310" end="00:51:24.270" style="s2">anything that we care about at this</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.500" end="00:51:25.860" style="s2">moment in history okay well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.270" end="00:51:31.050" style="s2">think that we have to have an argument</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.860" end="00:51:34.470" style="s2">about the you the the utility of moving</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.050" end="00:51:36.840" style="s2">forward on the scientific front I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.470" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">consider myself a scientist and and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.840" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:43.380" style="s2">to justify to the audience that&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:46.470" style="s2">to be listening to this the utility of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.380" end="00:51:49.860" style="s2">the scientific approach I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.470" end="00:51:52.170" style="s2">that the there are there&#39;s great purpose</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.860" end="00:51:53.820" style="s2">in looking at these ancient stories in</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.170" end="00:51:56.930" style="s2">the same way Sam as there&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.820" end="00:51:59.670" style="s2">purpose and utility in reading fiction</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.930" end="00:52:00.660" style="s2">so and I don&#39;t mean that in a derogatory</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.670" end="00:52:03.060" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.660" end="00:52:05.340" style="s2">I mean one of the things that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.060" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">about after our last discussion because</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.340" end="00:52:10.470" style="s2">I went and did some investigation into</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:12.420" style="s2">definitions of truth and some serious</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.470" end="00:52:14.130" style="s2">investigation so that I was more</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.420" end="00:52:15.630" style="s2">prepared the next time that we talk but</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.130" end="00:52:18.420" style="s2">one of the questions that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.630" end="00:52:22.200" style="s2">ask you for example given your emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.420" end="00:52:24.270" style="s2">on the on truth as embedded in facts and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.200" end="00:52:26.490" style="s2">also the ability of moral truth to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.270" end="00:52:28.890" style="s2">reveal itself from a set of facts is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.490" end="00:52:30.770" style="s2">here&#39;s a sentence for you and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.890" end="00:52:34.020" style="s2">you can tell me what you make of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.770" end="00:52:37.800" style="s2">there is great truth revealed in</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.020" end="00:52:39.390" style="s2">Dostoyevsky Tolstoy and Shakespeare do</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.800" end="00:52:41.880" style="s2">you agree with out or disagree because</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.390" end="00:52:45.420" style="s2">there&#39;s no fact in any of that and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.880" end="00:52:47.340" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly no scientific data now</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.420" end="00:52:49.170" style="s2">do you think that that that those great</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.340" end="00:52:51.000" style="s2">works of literature which are I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.170" end="00:52:52.530" style="s2">say more or less universally regarded as</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.000" end="00:52:54.990" style="s2">valuable do they</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.530" end="00:52:56.850" style="s2">how would you this is where we&#39;d why we</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.990" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">got stuck on the issue of truth you see</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.850" end="00:53:01.980" style="s2">I would say that those stories there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:04.170" style="s2">more truth in Dostoyevsky&#39;s fiction than</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.980" end="00:53:06.150" style="s2">there is in a single person&#39;s life I</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.170" end="00:53:08.340" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I would go quite that far</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.150" end="00:53:11.730" style="s2">but yes I will totally agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.340" end="00:53:13.950" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of truth in fiction I</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.730" end="00:53:15.210" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s at all why we got</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.950" end="00:53:16.440" style="s2">bogged down in our previous discussion</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.210" end="00:53:19.050" style="s2">about truth</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.440" end="00:53:21.480" style="s2">how would you characterize that truthful</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.050" end="00:53:23.940" style="s2">because it&#39;s certainly not factual by by</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.480" end="00:53:26.280" style="s2">any stretch of the imagination it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.940" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">a different sort of truth let me stretch</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.280" end="00:53:31.140" style="s2">our imaginations there I think is a wide</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:34.200" style="s2">variety of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.140" end="00:53:36.930" style="s2">that are at the very least illustrated</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.200" end="00:53:39.529" style="s2">in fiction the reason why fiction is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.930" end="00:53:42.719" style="s2">compelling to us is that it does map on</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.529" end="00:53:46.680" style="s2">credibly to our experience of the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.719" end="00:53:48.930" style="s2">or what we can imagine to be valid human</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.680" end="00:53:51.479" style="s2">experiences yeah precisely if it were</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.930" end="00:53:54.779" style="s2">radically strange which is to say if it</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.479" end="00:53:57.569" style="s2">all seemed preposterous that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.779" end="00:54:00.209" style="s2">definition of an unsuccessful work of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.569" end="00:54:02.039" style="s2">fiction insofar as certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.209" end="00:54:03.869" style="s2">fiction push those boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.039" end="00:54:06.239" style="s2">certain kinds of you know magical</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.869" end="00:54:08.430" style="s2">realism or science fiction which begins</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.239" end="00:54:10.529" style="s2">to seem basically like tennis without</p>

<p begin="00:56:10.760" end="00:56:14.630" style="s2">specific example from what you said and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.010" end="00:56:18.020" style="s2">address it you were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.630" end="00:56:20.589" style="s2">propitiation of supernatural beings okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.020" end="00:56:24.109" style="s2">so I&#39;m I&#39;m going to if you don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.589" end="00:56:26.029" style="s2">tell you the story of Cain and Abel in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.109" end="00:56:28.369" style="s2">way that you probably haven&#39;t heard it</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.029" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">it&#39;s only a paragraph long this story</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.369" end="00:56:35.599" style="s2">and I want to set it up first so can</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:37.670" style="s2">enable our types from a classical</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.599" end="00:56:40.240" style="s2">religious interpretation standpoint and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.670" end="00:56:42.859" style="s2">there that you might think about them as</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.240" end="00:56:44.779" style="s2">foreshadowing the emergence of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.859" end="00:56:47.230" style="s2">of Christ and Satan so they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.779" end="00:56:50.270" style="s2">they&#39;re the idea of the hostile brothers</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.230" end="00:56:52.549" style="s2">and that that idea pops up in fiction</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.270" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">all the time it&#39;s a it&#39;s a constant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.549" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">an archetype it&#39;s man against his soul</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:57:01.970" style="s2">say or man against his darker nature</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:04.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the basic plot idea so now Cain</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.970" end="00:57:08.420" style="s2">and Abel in in Genesis are actually the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.520" end="00:57:10.730" style="s2">first to actual human beings because God</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.420" end="00:57:12.950" style="s2">or Adam and Eve are made by God so</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.730" end="00:57:14.420" style="s2">somehow they&#39;re not exactly human play</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.950" end="00:57:16.640" style="s2">alone with me for a minute I know this</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.420" end="00:57:18.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t literally true Sam so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.640" end="00:57:20.569" style="s2">trying to claim that it is but Cain and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.650" end="00:57:23.750" style="s2">Abel are the first two human beings that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.569" end="00:57:29.059" style="s2">are born into the world instead of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.750" end="00:57:32.089" style="s2">paradise and Cain is a an agriculturist</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.059" end="00:57:34.849" style="s2">and Abel is a shepherd and of course</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.089" end="00:57:36.740" style="s2">that Shepherd theme echoes much later in</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.849" end="00:57:37.849" style="s2">through Christianity and also in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.740" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">story of King David</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.849" end="00:57:41.420" style="s2">partly because if you are going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:43.910" style="s2">shepherd back then man you were one</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.420" end="00:57:46.520" style="s2">tough dude because you had slingshots</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.910" end="00:57:48.650" style="s2">and sticks and the reliance after your</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.520" end="00:57:51.559" style="s2">sheep so you know you weren&#39;t little boy</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.650" end="00:57:53.569" style="s2">blew in pastoral Victorian England you</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.559" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">were one tough character so to be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.569" end="00:57:59.120" style="s2">shepherd was no joke</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.880" end="00:58:01.100" style="s2">anyways Cain and Abel are making their</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.120" end="00:58:03.020" style="s2">way through life and Cain is having a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.100" end="00:58:06.320" style="s2">very rough time things aren&#39;t going his</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.020" end="00:58:08.120" style="s2">way at all whereas Abel everything goes</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.320" end="00:58:10.370" style="s2">his way all the women loved him his</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.120" end="00:58:12.890" style="s2">flocks increased he&#39;s he&#39;s successful</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.370" end="00:58:14.930" style="s2">and the story also intimates that not</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.890" end="00:58:17.060" style="s2">only is he successful but everyone likes</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.930" end="00:58:19.310" style="s2">him and understands why he&#39;s successful</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.060" end="00:58:21.710" style="s2">whereas Cain is kind of bitter and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.310" end="00:58:24.560" style="s2">nothing he ever does works out and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.710" end="00:58:27.470" style="s2">they both make sacrifices to go on and</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.560" end="00:58:29.480" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you Sam when I started to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.470" end="00:58:31.460" style="s2">understand what the discovery of</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.480" end="00:58:34.460" style="s2">sacrifice meant it just about blew me</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.460" end="00:58:37.160" style="s2">out of my room because I realized that</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.460" end="00:58:39.490" style="s2">in the discovery of sacrifice in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.160" end="00:58:42.200" style="s2">acting out of sacrifice we had</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.490" end="00:58:44.900" style="s2">information pertaining to the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.200" end="00:58:47.420" style="s2">human discovery that you could let</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.900" end="00:58:50.480" style="s2">something of value go in the present and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.420" end="00:58:53.180" style="s2">reap a reward in the future which is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.480" end="00:58:55.220" style="s2">staggering realization it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.180" end="00:58:57.020" style="s2">discoverer of the future discovery of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.220" end="00:58:59.630" style="s2">the future now people had to act these</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.020" end="00:59:01.400" style="s2">things out and then represent them in</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.630" end="00:59:04.430" style="s2">stories before they could understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.400" end="00:59:06.620" style="s2">them psychologically so Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.430" end="00:59:10.310" style="s2">make sacrifices and the idea is that to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.620" end="00:59:13.160" style="s2">keep yahwah happy the patriarchal spirit</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.310" end="00:59:16.640" style="s2">happy you have to sacrifice something of</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.160" end="00:59:19.190" style="s2">true value it has to be a real genuine</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.640" end="00:59:22.040" style="s2">sacrifice or you or you won&#39;t reap the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.190" end="00:59:23.960" style="s2">future rewards and what and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.040" end="00:59:26.300" style="s2">knows what that means them because I ask</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.960" end="00:59:28.550" style="s2">my students all the time what their</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.300" end="00:59:30.710" style="s2">parents sacrificed to send them to</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.550" end="00:59:32.750" style="s2">university and they all understand that</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.710" end="00:59:34.310" style="s2">perfectly well and what&#39;s happened is</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.750" end="00:59:36.080" style="s2">their parents have made a bargain with</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.310" end="00:59:38.930" style="s2">the present which is that they will</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.080" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">forgo certain kinds of gratification so</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.930" end="00:59:43.220" style="s2">that they or even their children can</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">reap a reward they&#39;re making a bargain</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.220" end="00:59:47.990" style="s2">with the structure of reality now that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:50.420" style="s2">was personified or anthropomorphize</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.990" end="00:59:52.730" style="s2">depending on which terminology want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.420" end="00:59:54.770" style="s2">use early when people were still sorting</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.730" end="00:59:56.300" style="s2">starting to work these things out but</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.770" end="00:59:59.620" style="s2">that didn&#39;t destroy the essential</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.300" end="01:00:03.680" style="s2">validity of the idea now the story goes</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.620" end="01:00:05.480" style="s2">Abel&#39;s sacrifices were valid the story</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:07.400" style="s2">implies that although it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.480" end="01:00:08.539" style="s2">ambivalent you never know if Cain is</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.400" end="01:00:10.669" style="s2">doing a bad job</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.539" end="01:00:12.650" style="s2">sacrificing or if yahwah&#39;s just being a</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.669" end="01:00:15.160" style="s2">son-of-a-bitch and torturing them which</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.650" end="01:00:17.209" style="s2">of course is a classic problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.160" end="01:00:19.099" style="s2">existentially because you don&#39;t know in</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.209" end="01:00:21.410" style="s2">your life when you fail if it&#39;s because</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.869" end="01:00:30.109" style="s2">speak or that fate is just treating you</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.900" end="01:00:32.839" style="s2">harshly and unjustly but the story</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.109" end="01:00:36.199" style="s2">intimates that claim is making errors in</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.839" end="01:00:38.929" style="s2">his sacrifices whatever things don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.199" end="01:00:42.140" style="s2">well for Cain and Abel continues to to</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.929" end="01:00:43.999" style="s2">flourish so Cain is very unhappy with</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.140" end="01:00:46.400" style="s2">this and one day he decides to have it</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.999" end="01:00:49.249" style="s2">out with the creator of being which you</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.400" end="01:00:52.039" style="s2">know is a pretty ballsy thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.249" end="01:00:55.069" style="s2">let&#39;s say and so he goes and has a chat</p>

<p begin="01:01:31.640" end="01:01:37.039" style="s2">story of people complaining about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.159" end="01:01:40.429" style="s2">fundamental tragedy and evil of being so</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.039" end="01:01:43.609" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty good argument so God says</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.429" end="01:01:45.589" style="s2">to kick hey and he says look you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.609" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good argument but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.589" end="01:01:51.199" style="s2">how I look at it you&#39;re like a man who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:53.449" style="s2">inside a house and at the door of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.199" end="01:01:56.989" style="s2">house there&#39;s this predatory cat that</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.449" end="01:01:59.089" style="s2">sexually aroused and it&#39;s it&#39;s sin it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.989" end="01:02:01.449" style="s2">missing the mark because that&#39;s what sin</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.089" end="01:02:04.640" style="s2">means it means to miss the bullseye and</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.449" end="01:02:06.890" style="s2">you have invited it into your house this</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.640" end="01:02:09.199" style="s2">corruption and sin you&#39;ve invited it</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.890" end="01:02:11.630" style="s2">into your house voluntarily so that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.199" end="01:02:14.869" style="s2">can have its way with you sexually so</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.630" end="01:02:16.939" style="s2">that and you you&#39;ve intertwined yourself</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.869" end="01:02:19.699" style="s2">with it creatively and brought something</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.939" end="01:02:22.070" style="s2">horrible forth and you&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.699" end="01:02:25.460" style="s2">there therefore can be laid at your feet</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.070" end="01:02:28.130" style="s2">and you have no reason to call me on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.460" end="01:02:30.140" style="s2">structure of my creation and so of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.130" end="01:02:32.120" style="s2">course that&#39;s the last thing that Kane</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.140" end="01:02:34.040" style="s2">wants to hear because he doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.120" end="01:02:36.560" style="s2">understand that he&#39;s at fault for making</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.040" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">the wrong sacrifices so he trots on out</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.560" end="01:02:40.970" style="s2">of there and the story says that his</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:43.580" style="s2">countenance Falls and that he&#39;s wrought</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.970" end="01:02:45.890" style="s2">which is to say almost nothing at all</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.580" end="01:02:48.680" style="s2">and he decides that he&#39;s going to serve</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.890" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">God a good one and wander off and</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.680" end="01:02:53.630" style="s2">destroy his ideal God&#39;s ideal but also</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">Cain&#39;s own ideals so he kills his</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.630" end="01:02:59.900" style="s2">brother and leaves him dead and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:01.880" style="s2">the story of mankind and that it&#39;s worse</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.900" end="01:03:05.630" style="s2">Sam because what happens after that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.880" end="01:03:08.720" style="s2">that Cain gives rise to descendants and</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.630" end="01:03:11.480" style="s2">in his first or so generation of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.720" end="01:03:14.900" style="s2">descendants if you bother or annoy them</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.480" end="01:03:17.240" style="s2">they kill seven of you not one and if</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.900" end="01:03:20.750" style="s2">you bother his descendants descendants</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.240" end="01:03:22.970" style="s2">they kill 49 of you not seven and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.750" end="01:03:24.950" style="s2">his ultimate descendant or one of his</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.970" end="01:03:29.000" style="s2">ultimate descendants is tubal-cain</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.950" end="01:03:32.540" style="s2">and tubal Cain historically speaking or</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.000" end="01:03:35.660" style="s2">or traditionally speaking is the first</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.540" end="01:03:38.410" style="s2">person who makes weapons of war and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.660" end="01:03:40.370" style="s2">the idea there is that the deceit and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.410" end="01:03:42.620" style="s2">jealousy and resentment of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.370" end="01:03:45.080" style="s2">individual propagates through society</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.620" end="01:03:47.450" style="s2">until war emerges and then the next</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.080" end="01:03:50.260" style="s2">story is the flood I&#39;ve got two</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.450" end="01:03:52.850" style="s2">reactions to this Jordan one is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.260" end="01:03:56.150" style="s2">obviously you some stories are</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.850" end="01:03:58.100" style="s2">interesting and are written for a reason</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.150" end="01:04:00.920" style="s2">and those reasons are interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.100" end="01:04:02.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve already granted you that in fiction</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.920" end="01:04:05.600" style="s2">there can be a lot of truth in fiction a</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.900" end="01:04:08.150" style="s2">lot of human truth which is distilled</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.600" end="01:04:10.190" style="s2">there and one of his virtues is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.150" end="01:04:13.130" style="s2">when you read somebody like Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.190" end="01:04:15.500" style="s2">or Tolstoy or Shakespeare you can run an</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.130" end="01:04:17.030" style="s2">emulation other people&#39;s lived</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.500" end="01:04:18.830" style="s2">experience you can essentially live</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.030" end="01:04:21.800" style="s2">other lives that are that you would</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.830" end="01:04:24.380" style="s2">never live personally and learn the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.800" end="01:04:26.870" style="s2">lessons of of those lives though you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.380" end="01:04:31.730" style="s2">never going to murder some old woman in</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.870" end="01:04:35.360" style="s2">her flat you can watch Raskolnikov do it</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.730" end="01:04:38.030" style="s2">and experience a plausible</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.360" end="01:04:40.310" style="s2">psychological arc that follows from that</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.030" end="01:04:42.200" style="s2">so I&#39;m not discounting the value of</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.310" end="01:04:46.340" style="s2">stories at all but it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.200" end="01:04:48.530" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is overlooking in your</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.340" end="01:04:51.770" style="s2">discussion of Cain and Abel and the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.530" end="01:04:54.950" style="s2">archetype of propitiating a God you are</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.770" end="01:04:57.620" style="s2">overlooking the obvious ground truth and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.950" end="01:05:01.100" style="s2">its consequences here and then telling a</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.620" end="01:05:03.950" style="s2">story which is fairly unconstrained by</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.100" end="01:05:06.470" style="s2">any rules the obvious ground truth for</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.950" end="01:05:09.200" style="s2">me is people thought they were in</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.470" end="01:05:11.780" style="s2">relationship to a deity who could become</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.200" end="01:05:16.190" style="s2">angry and who had to be propitiated and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.780" end="01:05:19.160" style="s2">this led to some very direct and</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.190" end="01:05:22.340" style="s2">appalling consequences for millennia the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.160" end="01:05:25.130" style="s2">most extreme being human sacrifice from</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.340" end="01:05:26.720" style="s2">which we graduated to animal sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.130" end="01:05:29.210" style="s2">at least in the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:31.670" style="s2">tradition and human sacrifice was real</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.210" end="01:05:33.740" style="s2">and it&#39;s virtually a cultural universal</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.670" end="01:05:36.890" style="s2">and yes so there&#39;s some archetypal story</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.740" end="01:05:40.550" style="s2">you can tell about it but it was perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.890" end="01:05:42.170" style="s2">the most barbarous symptom of human</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.550" end="01:05:44.650" style="s2">ignorance about the weather about</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.170" end="01:05:47.120" style="s2">disease about good and bad luck about</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.650" end="01:05:49.610" style="s2">agriculture about everything that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.120" end="01:05:51.740" style="s2">have ever given rise to and we are quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.610" end="01:05:54.140" style="s2">happy to have outgrown it and whenever</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.740" end="01:05:56.900" style="s2">we find a culture that is practicing</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.140" end="01:05:59.630" style="s2">something like human sacrifice based on</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.900" end="01:06:01.870" style="s2">its a notion of propitiating invisible</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.630" end="01:06:04.970" style="s2">deities we see these people as</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.870" end="01:06:07.400" style="s2">dangerously confused and any child born</p>

<p begin="01:06:13.070" end="01:06:16.280" style="s2">were talking I was reminded of something</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.660" end="01:06:18.620" style="s2">I wrote in the end of faith my first</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.280" end="01:06:22.220" style="s2">book in an EndNote that was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.620" end="01:06:25.460" style="s2">pitched to the Joseph Campbell use of</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.220" end="01:06:27.110" style="s2">Mythology of which you are showing some</p>

<p begin="01:06:27.110" end="01:06:30.620" style="s2">come up and I just want to read this to</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.090" end="01:06:32.630" style="s2">you because this is I believe this</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.620" end="01:06:34.760" style="s2">counterpoint to this way of talking</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:41.010" style="s2">what I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.790" end="01:06:43.140" style="s2">I went into a bookstore I walked into</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.010" end="01:06:46.380" style="s2">the cookbook section of a Barnes &amp; Noble</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.140" end="01:06:49.440" style="s2">and with my eyes closed just ran my hand</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.380" end="01:06:51.900" style="s2">down the Shelf and grabbed a book and</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.440" end="01:06:53.850" style="s2">opened it at random and looked at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.900" end="01:06:55.710" style="s2">first recipe I saw in the book turned</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.850" end="01:06:58.200" style="s2">out to be a book called a taste of</p>

<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:07.080" style="s2">therein I discovered it as yet</p>

<p begin="01:19:32.280" end="01:19:35.639" style="s2">yes the interpretation problem is a</p>

<p begin="01:20:04.920" end="01:20:11.730" style="s2">right so the Jews are wrong Jesus was</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.429" end="01:20:14.250" style="s2">divine and resurrected so the Muslims</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.730" end="01:20:16.020" style="s2">are wrong there&#39;s only one God so the</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.250" end="01:20:17.789" style="s2">Hindus are wrong right so even if you</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.020" end="01:20:20.190" style="s2">want to relax the literalism there</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.789" end="01:20:22.739" style="s2">you&#39;re still sending some fairly sharp</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.190" end="01:20:24.900" style="s2">elbows toward the other religions yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.739" end="01:20:28.110" style="s2">well well look this is this is again I</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.900" end="01:20:30.150" style="s2">think to give the devil his due this is</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.110" end="01:20:33.030" style="s2">exactly the point that post modernists</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.150" end="01:20:34.770" style="s2">like Derrida have put out have put</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.030" end="01:20:37.949" style="s2">forward and very powerfully you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.770" end="01:20:42.000" style="s2">they say well look if you accept a value</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.949" end="01:20:44.130" style="s2">system as paramount then you invalidate</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.000" end="01:20:45.989" style="s2">all other value systems and you exclude</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.130" end="01:20:49.050" style="s2">everyone who isn&#39;t succeeding in that</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.989" end="01:20:51.270" style="s2">value system and their answer is well</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.050" end="01:20:53.460" style="s2">we&#39;ll just dissolve all the value</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.270" end="01:20:56.460" style="s2">systems well that&#39;s a completely insane</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.460" end="01:20:59.039" style="s2">answer because you can&#39;t even focus on</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.460" end="01:21:01.500" style="s2">an object in the absence of a value</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.039" end="01:21:03.090" style="s2">system technically speaking because</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.500" end="01:21:06.179" style="s2">you&#39;re always focusing on things of</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.090" end="01:21:08.460" style="s2">value right and so the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.179" end="01:21:10.829" style="s2">conflict that you describe is an</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.460" end="01:21:13.500" style="s2">emergent consequence of value systems is</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.829" end="01:21:15.389" style="s2">a terrible problem and we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.500" end="01:21:18.210" style="s2">to solve it although I think the</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.389" end="01:21:20.099" style="s2">solution paradoxically enough is</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.210" end="01:21:22.050" style="s2">actually embedded to some degree in</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.099" end="01:21:24.510" style="s2">Christianity and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.050" end="01:21:27.179" style="s2">because Christianity makes the group&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.510" end="01:21:30.780" style="s2">subordinate to the individual and it</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.179" end="01:21:34.170" style="s2">also hypothesizes that the highest moral</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.780" end="01:21:36.150" style="s2">virtue that a person should uphold is</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.170" end="01:21:39.739" style="s2">that of the truth and that the truth</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.150" end="01:21:42.389" style="s2">speaks chaos into order in the most</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.739" end="01:21:45.179" style="s2">beneficial possible way and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.389" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">the fundamental ethical duty but why</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.179" end="01:21:49.699" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:52.199" style="s2">this a matter of allegiance to</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.699" end="01:21:54.810" style="s2">Christianity why not just take what is</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.199" end="01:21:57.030" style="s2">useful in any tradition you just</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.810" end="01:22:00.170" style="s2">mentioned Nietzsche right so you found</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.030" end="01:22:03.869" style="s2">some of his work useful there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.170" end="01:22:05.699" style="s2">tradition of allegiance to Nietzsche you</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.869" end="01:22:08.159" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t have to worry about</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.699" end="01:22:10.710" style="s2">whether or not you are sufficiently</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.159" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">Nietzschean in order to use his wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.710" end="01:22:16.079" style="s2">you just take from him insofar as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:18.860" style="s2">useful why not do the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.079" end="01:22:21.060" style="s2">Christianity why waste any time</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.860" end="01:22:23.520" style="s2">wondering whether or not you are a</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.060" end="01:22:26.250" style="s2">Christian or telling people that you are</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.520" end="01:22:28.980" style="s2">or not why not get out of the religion</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.250" end="01:22:32.639" style="s2">business and use everything that is</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.980" end="01:22:35.429" style="s2">useful in human culture however it comes</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.639" end="01:22:37.320" style="s2">to you in a way that&#39;s nondenominational</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.429" end="01:22:39.690" style="s2">well if that could be achieved that</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.320" end="01:22:41.760" style="s2">would be absolutely wonderful I I would</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.690" end="01:22:44.219" style="s2">say the first problem with that is that</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.760" end="01:22:46.829" style="s2">or the historical problem with that is</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.219" end="01:22:50.880" style="s2">that the kind of truth that have emerged</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.829" end="01:22:53.610" style="s2">out of this lengthy mythological process</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.880" end="01:22:56.849" style="s2">this lengthy imaginative mythological</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.610" end="01:22:59.119" style="s2">process were first encapsulated inside</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.849" end="01:23:01.560" style="s2">the stories and the images they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.119" end="01:23:03.960" style="s2">articulated philosophical or</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.560" end="01:23:06.780" style="s2">psychological truths of the kind that</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.960" end="01:23:07.889" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking about look you can you</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.780" end="01:23:09.719" style="s2">can think about this like the</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.889" end="01:23:12.389" style="s2">relationship between Dostoyevsky and</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.719" end="01:23:14.929" style="s2">Nietzsche so Dostoevsky and Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.389" end="01:23:17.760" style="s2">were very similar in many ways</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.929" end="01:23:19.550" style="s2">philosophically but Dostoyevsky wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.760" end="01:23:22.349" style="s2">philosopher he was a storyteller</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.550" end="01:23:24.570" style="s2">implicit in his stories was Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.349" end="01:23:26.790" style="s2">and philosophy even though paradoxically</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.570" end="01:23:29.040" style="s2">enough Dostoevsky was a Christian the</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.790" end="01:23:31.770" style="s2">storytellers get there before the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.040" end="01:23:33.540" style="s2">philosophers and you know you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.770" end="01:23:35.610" style="s2">now that the Philosopher&#39;s have got</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.540" end="01:23:38.550" style="s2">there maybe we don&#39;t have to pledge</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.610" end="01:23:41.250" style="s2">allegiance to a canonical version of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.550" end="01:23:45.119" style="s2">story and that could be the case in fact</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.250" end="01:23:47.250" style="s2">you see partly Nietzsche criticized</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.119" end="01:23:49.290" style="s2">Christianity for all the reasons that</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.250" end="01:23:51.420" style="s2">you just criticize Christianity or any</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.290" end="01:23:52.530" style="s2">other creed Deven in a devastating</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.420" end="01:23:54.750" style="s2">manner although he was also</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.530" end="01:23:56.550" style="s2">extraordinarily grateful to Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.750" end="01:23:58.680" style="s2">because he believed it had disciplined</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.550" end="01:24:00.570" style="s2">the European mind</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.680" end="01:24:02.700" style="s2">and that that period of discipline was</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.570" end="01:24:04.860" style="s2">necessary a period where everything was</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.700" end="01:24:06.870" style="s2">interpreted under the rubric of a single</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.860" end="01:24:09.810" style="s2">interpretation because that taught</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.870" end="01:24:11.490" style="s2">concentration but nature said well now</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.810" end="01:24:14.220" style="s2">we&#39;re beyond that and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.490" end="01:24:16.800" style="s2">have to become gods of our own accord in</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.220" end="01:24:19.020" style="s2">order to withstand the consequences and</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.800" end="01:24:21.150" style="s2">then of course that turned out to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.020" end="01:24:22.380" style="s2">very problematic for reasons that need</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.150" end="01:24:23.790" style="s2">to also prophesy</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.380" end="01:24:27.150" style="s2">because he said that the West would</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.790" end="01:24:29.460" style="s2">degenerate both into nihilism and into</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.150" end="01:24:31.410" style="s2">totalitarianism and that millions of</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.460" end="01:24:33.960" style="s2">people would die as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.410" end="01:24:36.480" style="s2">death of God and that&#39;s Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.960" end="01:24:38.580" style="s2">prophesied exactly the same thing in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.480" end="01:24:42.300" style="s2">devil&#39;s and it&#39;s exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.580" end="01:24:44.940" style="s2">and I don&#39;t believe that we can get past</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.300" end="01:24:47.700" style="s2">the Scylla and Charybdis of nihilism and</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.940" end="01:24:50.430" style="s2">totalitarianism without going back to</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.700" end="01:24:53.070" style="s2">the past to find what it has to offer us</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.430" end="01:24:54.900" style="s2">to bring it forward in an articulated</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.070" end="01:24:56.550" style="s2">manner and of course that&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.900" end="01:24:58.620" style="s2">why I think the discussion that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.550" end="01:25:00.480" style="s2">having with you is important because I</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.620" end="01:25:03.060" style="s2">think that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing right but</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.480" end="01:25:05.490" style="s2">there are two ways of going back to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.060" end="01:25:08.940" style="s2">past you exemplify both of them you are</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.490" end="01:25:12.030" style="s2">going back talking about people like</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.940" end="01:25:13.770" style="s2">Nietzsche right and you can throw the</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.030" end="01:25:17.490" style="s2">rest of philosophy and world literature</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.770" end="01:25:20.550" style="s2">into that bin but then it sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.490" end="01:25:23.940" style="s2">you are also tempted to go back in what</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.550" end="01:25:25.770" style="s2">appears to be a different category of</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.940" end="01:25:29.190" style="s2">effort which is the religious one which</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.770" end="01:25:31.380" style="s2">is your holding to one side certain</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.190" end="01:25:35.220" style="s2">arguably fiction writers and</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.380" end="01:25:36.750" style="s2">philosophers as being something other</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.220" end="01:25:39.810" style="s2">than fiction writers and philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.750" end="01:25:42.750" style="s2">and treating certain texts as something</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.810" end="01:25:45.750" style="s2">other than mere products of the human</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.750" end="01:25:47.460" style="s2">mind and you have a lot of company right</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.750" end="01:25:51.420" style="s2">this is what every religious person does</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.460" end="01:25:54.600" style="s2">but why not treat Jesus the same way you</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.420" end="01:25:56.640" style="s2">would treat Socrates well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.600" end="01:25:58.860" style="s2">a good start I think that Socrates and</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.640" end="01:26:00.510" style="s2">Jesus had an awful lot in common but the</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.860" end="01:26:03.210" style="s2">thing about Socrates is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.510" end="01:26:05.340" style="s2">primarily a historical figure whereas</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.210" end="01:26:07.590" style="s2">Christ may have been a historical figure</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.340" end="01:26:11.620" style="s2">I think that the simplest assumption is</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.590" end="01:26:13.900" style="s2">that someone of that description existed</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.620" end="01:26:16.870" style="s2">but he&#39;s also a mythological character</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.900" end="01:26:19.390" style="s2">and the mythology is unbelievably deep</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.870" end="01:26:22.180" style="s2">and what it is in some sense is it is</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.390" end="01:26:24.040" style="s2">the human imaginations attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.180" end="01:26:28.000" style="s2">construct a representation of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.040" end="01:26:30.730" style="s2">perfect man and so Christ is the perfect</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.000" end="01:26:34.240" style="s2">man now you may say well you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.730" end="01:26:36.430" style="s2">what that means you can say that Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.240" end="01:26:38.500" style="s2">was the perfect man hold it hold it self</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.430" end="01:26:41.620" style="s2">I didn&#39;t say that I didn&#39;t say I said</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.500" end="01:26:43.900" style="s2">that Christ is the perfect man that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.620" end="01:26:46.990" style="s2">different because I&#39;m speaking out the</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.900" end="01:26:50.640" style="s2">mythological level is that whatever</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.990" end="01:26:52.870" style="s2">human beings can imagine as perfect and</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.640" end="01:26:55.450" style="s2">in terms of the manner in which an</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.870" end="01:26:58.060" style="s2">individual could conduct himself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.450" end="01:27:00.190" style="s2">what Christ represents I&#39;m not claiming</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.060" end="01:27:02.620" style="s2">for a moment that that manifested itself</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.190" end="01:27:04.690" style="s2">in history that&#39;s a different claim and</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.620" end="01:27:07.150" style="s2">we can talk about that claim too but I</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.690" end="01:27:09.760" style="s2">would say it didn&#39;t even manifest itself</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.150" end="01:27:13.540" style="s2">in the Bible if you&#39;re going to write a</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.760" end="01:27:15.550" style="s2">story about the perfect man a fiction of</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.540" end="01:27:18.130" style="s2">the perfect man you wouldn&#39;t write it</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.550" end="01:27:21.370" style="s2">the way the New Testament is written and</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.130" end="01:27:23.830" style="s2">you would get Jesus to do things that he</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.370" end="01:27:26.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t do and not do things that he did</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.830" end="01:27:28.210" style="s2">do and he would say things that he</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.110" end="01:27:30.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t say he can get a lot more perfect</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.210" end="01:27:34.420" style="s2">than what you see and in Matthew Mark</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.910" end="01:27:35.110" style="s2">Luke and John okay so let me let me tell</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.420" end="01:27:37.660" style="s2">you why</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.110" end="01:27:41.080" style="s2">briefly why that story is archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.660" end="01:27:44.380" style="s2">perfect okay so so here&#39;s the reason</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.080" end="01:27:46.450" style="s2">it&#39;s because as has been agreed upon by</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.380" end="01:27:49.300" style="s2">the sages of the ages let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.450" end="01:27:53.440" style="s2">fundamental reality of life is suffering</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.300" end="01:27:55.360" style="s2">and and finitude and you can layer on</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.440" end="01:28:00.800" style="s2">top of that from an existential</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.360" end="01:28:02.570" style="s2">perspective malevolence and injustice</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.800" end="01:28:05.060" style="s2">and that&#39;s the law of human beings and</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.570" end="01:28:09.740" style="s2">so here is an archetypal story the most</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.060" end="01:28:15.790" style="s2">perfect innocent sinless person possible</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.740" end="01:28:17.990" style="s2">is betrayed by his friends</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.790" end="01:28:22.460" style="s2">his countrymen</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.990" end="01:28:25.130" style="s2">and the foreigners simultaneously for no</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.460" end="01:28:29.180" style="s2">crime whatsoever in the most torturous</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.130" end="01:28:32.780" style="s2">possible way and also abandoned by the</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.180" end="01:28:36.200" style="s2">creator of being himself and he accepts</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.780" end="01:28:37.700" style="s2">that all voluntarily you see the reason</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.200" end="01:28:41.390" style="s2">it&#39;s an archetypal story is because you</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.700" end="01:28:44.830" style="s2">can&#39;t get beyond that you see it hits a</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.390" end="01:28:48.350" style="s2">limit it&#39;s it&#39;s the limit of tragedy and</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.830" end="01:28:50.450" style="s2">so that&#39;s where the perfection lies now</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.350" end="01:28:52.460" style="s2">the issue is well what does that mean</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.450" end="01:28:54.740" style="s2">and here&#39;s what it means we can go</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.460" end="01:28:57.500" style="s2">incremental ii here because i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.740" end="01:28:59.330" style="s2">buy that it&#39;s the limit of tragedy but</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.500" end="01:29:03.260" style="s2">first of all the thing is anchored to a</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.330" end="01:29:05.540" style="s2">belief in human sacrifice this is what</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.260" end="01:29:07.210" style="s2">is so weird about christianity from my</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.540" end="01:29:10.580" style="s2">point of view is that if this is not a</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.210" end="01:29:13.100" style="s2">religion that disavows human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.580" end="01:29:16.100" style="s2">this is a religion that claims that</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.100" end="01:29:18.380" style="s2">human sacrifice is real and important</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.100" end="01:29:20.720" style="s2">but there was only one that was in fact</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.380" end="01:29:22.850" style="s2">necessary and effective and that is the</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.720" end="01:29:24.200" style="s2">sacrifice of jesus well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.850" end="01:29:25.940" style="s2">protestant in the catholic</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.200" end="01:29:27.500" style="s2">interpretation it&#39;s not so clear with</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.940" end="01:29:29.750" style="s2">the orthodox christians they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.500" end="01:29:32.180" style="s2">really they buy that version of</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.750" end="01:29:34.820" style="s2">christianity that&#39;s more the stress is</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.180" end="01:29:37.040" style="s2">more each individual&#39;s moral obligation</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.820" end="01:29:39.050" style="s2">to do the same thing i don&#39;t know enough</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.040" end="01:29:41.540" style="s2">about orthodox believed to dispute that</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.050" end="01:29:43.670" style="s2">but most Western Christians have</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.540" end="01:29:46.910" style="s2">unacknowledged at the core of their</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.670" end="01:29:49.220" style="s2">belief system this assertion of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.910" end="01:29:50.330" style="s2">validity of human sacrifice right which</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.220" end="01:29:53.210" style="s2">is insanity</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.330" end="01:29:54.770" style="s2">well it isn&#39;t insanity 7 if you think</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.210" end="01:29:56.750" style="s2">about sacrifice in the way that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.770" end="01:29:59.840" style="s2">talked about it earlier that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.750" end="01:30:03.830" style="s2">way it&#39;s thought about even in the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.840" end="01:30:05.990" style="s2">he had to die for our sins right he is</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.830" end="01:30:08.150" style="s2">the scapegoat he is the only effective</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.990" end="01:30:10.100" style="s2">scapegoat and he&#39;s a hero he&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.150" end="01:30:11.090" style="s2">in your terms because he took this on</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.100" end="01:30:12.110" style="s2">voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.090" end="01:30:13.760" style="s2">I mean to go back to what you were just</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.110" end="01:30:16.100" style="s2">saying this is not the ultimate tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.760" end="01:30:18.890" style="s2">because he did take it on voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.100" end="01:30:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s more tragic if someone really gets</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.890" end="01:30:24.050" style="s2">screwed by the cosmos oh yes you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.680" end="01:30:26.030" style="s2">right about that but the part the fact</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.050" end="01:30:28.460" style="s2">that he took it on voluntarily is</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.030" end="01:30:30.740" style="s2">actually the part of this story that</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.460" end="01:30:31.789" style="s2">involves the transcendence of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.740" end="01:30:34.639" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.789" end="01:30:36.199" style="s2">because the story there and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.639" end="01:30:39.019" style="s2">very old story it&#39;s far older than</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.199" end="01:30:43.730" style="s2">Christianity the story is that the best</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.019" end="01:30:47.239" style="s2">way to to transcend the bitterness of</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.730" end="01:30:49.369" style="s2">life is to accept it completely hmm</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.239" end="01:30:51.409" style="s2">including including betrayal at the</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.369" end="01:30:53.360" style="s2">hands of your friends including betrayal</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.409" end="01:30:56.769" style="s2">at the hands of your countrymen and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.360" end="01:30:59.510" style="s2">foreigners too to allow that to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.769" end="01:31:01.630" style="s2">acceptable to take it on voluntarily and</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.510" end="01:31:03.860" style="s2">not to be bitter about it like Cain</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.630" end="01:31:05.840" style="s2">because you get murderous when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.860" end="01:31:08.599" style="s2">bitter so I can go with you there but</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.840" end="01:31:11.000" style="s2">now if that is what you find compelling</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.599" end="01:31:14.030" style="s2">in this story I could just offer for</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.000" end="01:31:17.150" style="s2">your examination another example another</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.030" end="01:31:19.699" style="s2">story another tradition which in its</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.150" end="01:31:21.380" style="s2">details is basically irreconcilable with</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.699" end="01:31:23.869" style="s2">Christianity but it&#39;s also well</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.380" end="01:31:25.849" style="s2">subscribed it&#39;s the Buddha and Buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.869" end="01:31:29.329" style="s2">right the Buddha is another example of</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.849" end="01:31:31.579" style="s2">the perfect man he does give you a</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.329" end="01:31:34.579" style="s2">similar rationale to the one you just</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.579" end="01:31:38.210" style="s2">gave for radical acceptance of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.579" end="01:31:39.829" style="s2">vicissitudes of life and yet he&#39;s far</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.210" end="01:31:41.690" style="s2">more articulate I&#39;m here now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.829" end="01:31:44.719" style="s2">talking about the historical Buddha who</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.690" end="01:31:47.860" style="s2">predated Jesus by five centuries but who</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.719" end="01:31:50.750" style="s2">seems to have said much more that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.860" end="01:31:53.030" style="s2">psychologically perspicacious and he</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.750" end="01:31:54.320" style="s2">talks exactly on that point about the</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.030" end="01:31:56.210" style="s2">nature of acceptance</p>

<p begin="01:32:01.400" end="01:32:04.789" style="s2">doing that and the way in which you</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.019" end="01:32:06.920" style="s2">should structure life so as to be able</p>

<p begin="01:32:06.920" end="01:32:12.920" style="s2">moment and he presented a methodology of</p>

<p begin="01:34:09.079" end="01:34:12.769" style="s2">outcome I mean their practices like in</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.300" end="01:34:14.689" style="s2">Tibetan Buddhism there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.769" end="01:34:17.689" style="s2">called deity practice where you imagine</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.689" end="01:34:20.360" style="s2">yourself to be a deity or a bodhisattva</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.689" end="01:34:22.729" style="s2">and the practice of imagining yourself</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.360" end="01:34:24.919" style="s2">to be that is not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.729" end="01:34:27.169" style="s2">becoming delusional and thinking you are</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.919" end="01:34:29.659" style="s2">that that&#39;s exactly the same thing as</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.169" end="01:34:31.579" style="s2">the mystical imitation of Christ it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.659" end="01:34:32.869" style="s2">exactly the same idea so you could do</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.579" end="01:34:34.820" style="s2">that with Christ you could do it with</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.869" end="01:34:36.349" style="s2">Batman you could say to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.820" end="01:34:38.659" style="s2">shy and who doesn&#39;t like to go to</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.349" end="01:34:40.280" style="s2">parties because they just don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.659" end="01:34:41.989" style="s2">each subsequent encounter with a</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.280" end="01:34:43.999" style="s2">stranger that they where they have to</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.989" end="01:34:45.530" style="s2">overcome their shyness and their</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.999" end="01:34:46.849" style="s2">inability to make small talk and all the</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.530" end="01:34:48.889" style="s2">rest so shyness is a psychological</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.849" end="01:34:52.070" style="s2">problem that virtually everyone has to</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.889" end="01:34:54.260" style="s2">some degree or another and perhaps one</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.070" end="01:34:58.710" style="s2">way to overcome it is to walk into a</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.260" end="01:35:01.410" style="s2">party just trying on the idea</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.710" end="01:35:03.300" style="s2">that you are Batman right that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.410" end="01:35:06.180" style="s2">Bruce Wayne right you have this all of</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.300" end="01:35:08.730" style="s2">these secret abilities or you&#39;re Jason</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.180" end="01:35:11.010" style="s2">Bourne or some powerful character who</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.730" end="01:35:12.810" style="s2">you got it that&#39;s exactly it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.010" end="01:35:14.670" style="s2">capable of great things but we know as a</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.810" end="01:35:17.190" style="s2">total fiction so now does that have any</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.670" end="01:35:19.860" style="s2">psychological consequence and if so why</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.190" end="01:35:21.690" style="s2">I think there&#39;s no question it can have</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.860" end="01:35:23.910" style="s2">a psychological consequence and can be</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.690" end="01:35:25.650" style="s2">useful to do that but the crucial thing</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.910" end="01:35:28.410" style="s2">there is that you can play with those</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.650" end="01:35:31.489" style="s2">kind of schema without deluding yourself</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.410" end="01:35:33.750" style="s2">like if at any point in that adventure</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.489" end="01:35:35.550" style="s2">someone tapped you on the shoulder and</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.750" end="01:35:38.580" style="s2">said but do you really think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.550" end="01:35:40.469" style="s2">Batman you would say no now the problem</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.580" end="01:35:42.510" style="s2">is when you meet the guy who really</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.469" end="01:35:45.960" style="s2">thinks he&#39;s Batman that&#39;s where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.510" end="01:35:47.580" style="s2">you cross over into dangerously divisive</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.960" end="01:35:50.160" style="s2">and unsupported ideas about the nature</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.580" end="01:35:52.110" style="s2">of reality and religion is really the</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.160" end="01:35:55.110" style="s2">only game in town when you want to</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.110" end="01:35:56.910" style="s2">dignify those ideas generation after</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.110" end="01:35:59.130" style="s2">generation and protect them from</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.910" end="01:36:00.810" style="s2">criticism that&#39;s why the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.130" end="01:36:04.440" style="s2">attitude of speaking honestly about</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.810" end="01:36:06.360" style="s2">facts keeps smashing into religion</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.440" end="01:36:09.239" style="s2">uniquely it doesn&#39;t smash into fiction</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.360" end="01:36:11.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t smash into Dostoevsky it smashes</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.239" end="01:36:13.410" style="s2">into Jesus right because of what most</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.100" end="01:36:16.170" style="s2">people are doing with Jesus yes well</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.410" end="01:36:20.780" style="s2">okay so right look no arguments there</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.170" end="01:36:23.430" style="s2">but let me let me offer you a</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.780" end="01:36:26.280" style="s2">elaboration of your idea so let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.430" end="01:36:27.510" style="s2">kid wants to be Batman well that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.280" end="01:36:29.280" style="s2">because that&#39;s why he&#39;s reading the</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.510" end="01:36:31.980" style="s2">comics and that&#39;s why he&#39;s going to the</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.280" end="01:36:34.230" style="s2">billion dollar Marvel movies but or DC</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.980" end="01:36:36.840" style="s2">movies that portray these superheroes</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.230" end="01:36:39.360" style="s2">out on the screen it&#39;s because the kid</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.840" end="01:36:41.969" style="s2">is acting them out in imagination is</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.360" end="01:36:43.710" style="s2">trying on an ideal so let&#39;s say well</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.969" end="01:36:45.600" style="s2">maybe you start with a pro wrestler</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.710" end="01:36:47.400" style="s2">because you&#39;re you know you&#39;re not that</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.600" end="01:36:49.710" style="s2">conceptually sophisticated and then</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.400" end="01:36:52.890" style="s2">maybe you move to Batman and then maybe</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.710" end="01:36:55.770" style="s2">move from Batman to Thor in the Marvel</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.890" end="01:36:57.989" style="s2">cartoons and there you&#39;re in the you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.770" end="01:36:59.010" style="s2">in the domain of quasi deities and then</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.989" end="01:37:00.840" style="s2">maybe you get a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.010" end="01:37:03.900" style="s2">sophisticated than that and you try on</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.840" end="01:37:05.550" style="s2">Jesus or Buddha and then you ask</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.900" end="01:37:08.770" style="s2">yourself well what would happen to the</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.550" end="01:37:10.690" style="s2">world if you tried those on completely</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.770" end="01:37:13.210" style="s2">and that&#39;s the real question that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.690" end="01:37:15.340" style="s2">where the historical element and the</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.210" end="01:37:17.500" style="s2">mythological element meet and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.340" end="01:37:19.390" style="s2">obviously a hierarchy of rank among</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.500" end="01:37:21.040" style="s2">individuals and some people have a much</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.390" end="01:37:23.200" style="s2">more positive impact on the world</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.040" end="01:37:25.060" style="s2">through their actions than others and</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.200" end="01:37:27.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.060" end="01:37:29.710" style="s2">hypothetical ultimate limit to that if</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.610" end="01:37:32.200" style="s2">you are the best person you could</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.710" end="01:37:34.240" style="s2">possibly be in every possible way</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.200" end="01:37:36.370" style="s2">just exactly how much good could you</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.240" end="01:37:38.830" style="s2">bring into the world and at what point</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.370" end="01:37:40.660" style="s2">would you be a bodhisattva have</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.830" end="01:37:43.090" style="s2">something Buddhists ask themselves all</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.660" end="01:37:45.070" style="s2">the time when would you an incarnation</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.090" end="01:37:47.860" style="s2">of Christ something that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.070" end="01:37:50.650" style="s2">mythological or imaginative or</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.860" end="01:37:53.830" style="s2">delusional it&#39;s impartial because if the</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.650" end="01:37:55.660" style="s2">ideal recedes as you approach it but</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.830" end="01:37:58.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a reality underneath this which</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.660" end="01:38:00.940" style="s2">is that better people are better and</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.930" end="01:38:03.940" style="s2">worse people are worse and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.940" end="01:38:06.160" style="s2">archetypal limits to both of those so</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.940" end="01:38:08.590" style="s2">these are these are very complicated</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.160" end="01:38:10.180" style="s2">things they&#39;re not there they&#39;re fiction</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.590" end="01:38:12.490" style="s2">in a sense but I would think about the</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.180" end="01:38:14.650" style="s2">more as metafiction they&#39;re there what</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.490" end="01:38:17.050" style="s2">happens when you distill fiction into</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.650" end="01:38:20.260" style="s2">what&#39;s ever centrally true about fiction</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.050" end="01:38:22.690" style="s2">and it&#39;s really really true well I would</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.260" end="01:38:24.210" style="s2">grant you and again this is the topic of</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.690" end="01:38:27.370" style="s2">my book waking up that there are</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.210" end="01:38:29.290" style="s2">possibilities on the positive end of</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.370" end="01:38:32.050" style="s2">human psychology that very few people</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.290" end="01:38:34.570" style="s2">actual eyes for any significant amount</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.050" end="01:38:37.390" style="s2">of time and people glimpse them in their</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.570" end="01:38:40.390" style="s2">best moments in life they have peak</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.390" end="01:38:42.040" style="s2">experiences whether on drugs or you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.390" end="01:38:44.830" style="s2">after some crisis or they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.040" end="01:38:47.860" style="s2">fasting or they have moments where they</p>

<p begin="01:38:47.860" end="01:38:55.660" style="s2">feel as in touch as they ever will with</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.390" end="01:38:58.030" style="s2">just the sheer profundity of slamming</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.660" end="01:39:00.760" style="s2">into the present moment and finding it</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.030" end="01:39:02.290" style="s2">totally captivating and worthy of their</p>

<p begin="01:39:02.290" end="01:39:09.640" style="s2">for anything they have become identical</p>

<p begin="01:39:09.640" end="01:39:15.790" style="s2">be in some basic sense perfect now that</p>

<p begin="01:39:15.790" end="01:39:20.530" style="s2">and there&#39;s not much of a scientific</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.520" end="01:39:22.239" style="s2">story to tell about it at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.530" end="01:39:25.059" style="s2">it&#39;s not arrived</p>

<p begin="01:39:31.179" end="01:39:35.730" style="s2">my point is that it doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.480" end="01:39:38.079" style="s2">delusion either it doesn&#39;t require</p>

<p begin="01:39:43.690" end="01:39:49.480" style="s2">weren&#39;t you can get rid of 90% of what</p>

<p begin="01:40:35.199" end="01:40:38.650" style="s2">about becoming your best self or</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.849" end="01:40:40.900" style="s2">becoming more and more like the best</p>

<p begin="01:40:44.800" end="01:40:49.059" style="s2">stuff is worth thinking about and paying</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.230" end="01:40:51.639" style="s2">attention to and there is a there there</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.059" end="01:40:54.429" style="s2">I&#39;m not doubting that for a second what</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.639" end="01:40:59.019" style="s2">I&#39;m insisting upon however is that we</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.429" end="01:41:02.050" style="s2">need never step off the razor&#39;s edge of</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.019" end="01:41:04.869" style="s2">real honesty and conceptual integrity</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.050" end="01:41:06.969" style="s2">even for a moment in order to walk in</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.869" end="01:41:09.369" style="s2">that direction and that&#39;s as you said</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.969" end="01:41:11.559" style="s2">most New Agers see no problem in</p>

<p begin="01:41:15.579" end="01:41:19.749" style="s2">where it becomes startlingly</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.999" end="01:41:22.360" style="s2">unscientific and that&#39;s where someone</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.749" end="01:41:24.489" style="s2">like Deepak Chopra and I can&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.360" end="01:41:27.340" style="s2">about how to talk about things because</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.489" end="01:41:28.989" style="s2">the moment we start he hits me with you</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.340" end="01:41:31.059" style="s2">know you close your eyes and you feel at</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.989" end="01:41:33.400" style="s2">one with the universe that proves that</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.059" end="01:41:34.900" style="s2">you preceded the Big Bang your</p>

<p begin="01:41:35.860" end="01:41:39.130" style="s2">now of course it proves nothing of the</p>

<p begin="01:41:39.130" end="01:41:45.130" style="s2">scientist and so what I&#39;m arguing for is</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.080" end="01:41:46.960" style="s2">that we just remain attentive to honest</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.130" end="01:41:51.370" style="s2">talk about what we know about reality</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.960" end="01:41:53.230" style="s2">even while we have deep experiences and</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.370" end="01:41:54.970" style="s2">seek them out by whatever means and</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.230" end="01:41:57.460" style="s2">again I will grant you that there are</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.970" end="01:41:59.950" style="s2">means that would amount to a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.460" end="01:42:02.230" style="s2">internal costume party where you can</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.950" end="01:42:04.480" style="s2">think in terms of myth if you said to me</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.230" end="01:42:07.390" style="s2">Sam I want you to think of the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.480" end="01:42:10.510" style="s2">your day in terms of the hero archetype</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.390" end="01:42:12.670" style="s2">what are you doing today to slay the</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.510" end="01:42:15.100" style="s2">dragon and bring back that hoarded</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.670" end="01:42:17.440" style="s2">wealth to your community that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.100" end="01:42:20.320" style="s2">pattern of thought that I have no</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.440" end="01:42:22.240" style="s2">question could have some utility right</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.320" end="01:42:23.830" style="s2">well that&#39;s what we were doing today Sam</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.240" end="01:42:27.100" style="s2">right but again the crucial bit is that</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.830" end="01:42:30.100" style="s2">in doing that I&#39;m not making claims to</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.100" end="01:42:32.290" style="s2">knowledge about the ethereal existence</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.100" end="01:42:34.870" style="s2">of archetypes there&#39;s no you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.290" end="01:42:37.180" style="s2">Akashic record or collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.870" end="01:42:39.490" style="s2">I&#39;m not making claims of that kind at</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.180" end="01:42:41.590" style="s2">all in order to find this way of</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.490" end="01:42:44.500" style="s2">thinking useful and I&#39;m not aligning</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.590" end="01:42:48.280" style="s2">myself with any provincial tradition of</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.500" end="01:42:51.250" style="s2">myth making ie a religion and claiming</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.280" end="01:42:53.500" style="s2">that my religion is better than others</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.250" end="01:42:55.630" style="s2">which is you know as we see every time</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.500" end="01:42:57.400" style="s2">we open the newspaper a divisive game</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.630" end="01:43:00.280" style="s2">that we have to figure out some way of</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.400" end="01:43:02.380" style="s2">unravelling right we do and your</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.280" end="01:43:04.270" style="s2">emphasis on clear-headed thinking I mean</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.380" end="01:43:07.360" style="s2">this is part of the reason why I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.270" end="01:43:09.160" style="s2">to talk to you I mean certainly one of</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.360" end="01:43:10.900" style="s2">the things that you demonstrated the</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.160" end="01:43:12.400" style="s2">first time we talked was your capacity</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.900" end="01:43:14.410" style="s2">for clear-headed thinking I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.400" end="01:43:16.240" style="s2">you&#39;re crazily incisive and</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.410" end="01:43:18.340" style="s2">laser-focused and you know those are</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.240" end="01:43:20.200" style="s2">extraordinarily useful attributes and</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.340" end="01:43:21.790" style="s2">that&#39;s partly why I thought it would be</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.200" end="01:43:25.030" style="s2">so useful for us to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.790" end="01:43:28.330" style="s2">I&#39;m an advocate of critical thinking we</p>

<p begin="01:44:01.250" end="01:44:05.440" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about honest speech</p>

<p begin="01:45:28.670" end="01:45:34.099" style="s2">can chew on if you want so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.010" end="01:45:36.829" style="s2">idea that&#39;s paramount in Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.099" end="01:45:39.619" style="s2">which is a Creed I understand better</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.829" end="01:45:42.349" style="s2">than most mostly as a consequence of my</p>

<p begin="01:45:42.349" end="01:45:48.559" style="s2">a very weird idea in that and that is</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.300" end="01:45:51.500" style="s2">that at the beginning of time God spoke</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.559" end="01:45:54.770" style="s2">order out of chaos the chaos was like a</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.500" end="01:45:57.110" style="s2">potential and that it was the act of</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.770" end="01:45:59.360" style="s2">speaking truthfully that brought forth</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.110" end="01:46:01.010" style="s2">the proper kind of order and that was</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.360" end="01:46:01.830" style="s2">the paradisal order that Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.010" end="01:46:04.020" style="s2">inhabited</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.830" end="01:46:05.700" style="s2">there&#39;s this deep idea lurking in there</p>

<p begin="01:46:05.700" end="01:46:11.730" style="s2">the spoken truth is what transforms</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.840" end="01:46:15.180" style="s2">chaotic potential into habitable order</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.730" end="01:46:16.710" style="s2">and then weirdly enough what happened</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.180" end="01:46:19.410" style="s2">with that idea over the period of about</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.710" end="01:46:21.450" style="s2">3,000 years as Christianity emerged from</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.410" end="01:46:23.220" style="s2">Judaism was that by the time</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.450" end="01:46:26.880" style="s2">Christianity emerged there was an</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.220" end="01:46:29.130" style="s2">insistence that Christ was the word that</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.880" end="01:46:32.130" style="s2">God used at the beginning of time to</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.130" end="01:46:34.290" style="s2">extract habitable order from chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.130" end="01:46:37.640" style="s2">so the idea there it&#39;s one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.290" end="01:46:41.580" style="s2">brilliant ideas of mankind is that by</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.640" end="01:46:44.400" style="s2">speaking the truth you face the chaos of</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.580" end="01:46:47.190" style="s2">potential and bring forth the most</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.400" end="01:46:49.110" style="s2">benevolent possible type of order</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.190" end="01:46:51.480" style="s2">combined with that course correction</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.110" end="01:46:54.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re describing and I think</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.480" end="01:46:56.430" style="s2">that&#39;s the central idea of the West now</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.480" end="01:46:59.220" style="s2">you can find that idea echoed in other</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.430" end="01:47:01.350" style="s2">areas like in Buddhism for example and</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.220" end="01:47:03.600" style="s2">in other religions for that matter but I</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.350" end="01:47:06.180" style="s2">believe that it reached its highest</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.600" end="01:47:08.580" style="s2">imagistic development at least as far as</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.180" end="01:47:09.960" style="s2">I can tell in the West and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.580" end="01:47:13.380" style="s2">why we have societies that are</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.960" end="01:47:17.010" style="s2">predicated on the sacredness so to speak</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.380" end="01:47:20.640" style="s2">of the spoken truth yeah the question of</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.010" end="01:47:22.980" style="s2">why we value the spoken truth to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.640" end="01:47:26.370" style="s2">degree that we do is an interesting one</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.980" end="01:47:29.040" style="s2">I think it&#39;s largely it it is as much to</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.370" end="01:47:32.070" style="s2">do with a reaction against Western</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.040" end="01:47:34.320" style="s2">religion by science and philosophy as it</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.070" end="01:47:37.710" style="s2">does with anything that came from</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.320" end="01:47:40.850" style="s2">Western religion but I think it you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.710" end="01:47:43.710" style="s2">it is something that is unraveling in</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.850" end="01:47:46.350" style="s2">the strangest of places now so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.710" end="01:47:49.170" style="s2">insofar as you and I can make common</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.350" end="01:47:51.690" style="s2">cause in defending the necessity of</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.170" end="01:47:53.760" style="s2">protecting free speech across the board</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.690" end="01:47:55.110" style="s2">however unpopular I think practically</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.760" end="01:47:57.210" style="s2">speaking that&#39;s an extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.110" end="01:47:59.100" style="s2">useful thing to do yes well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.210" end="01:48:01.830" style="s2">best way at the moment that we can slay</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.100" end="01:48:03.900" style="s2">our respective dragons well listen</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.830" end="01:48:06.810" style="s2">Jordan it&#39;s a pleasure to talk to you a</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.900" end="01:48:09.570" style="s2">second time I hope people found</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.810" end="01:48:12.150" style="s2">something a value in it you would never</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.570" end="01:48:13.710" style="s2">imagine we disagreed as much as we did</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.150" end="01:48:15.580" style="s2">the first time around if you only heard</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.710" end="01:48:18.190" style="s2">this second conversation</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.580" end="01:48:20.320" style="s2">well sometimes it&#39;s sometimes some some</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.190" end="01:48:22.120" style="s2">stupid persistence is useful and you</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.320" end="01:48:24.340" style="s2">know I think the rabbit hole we went</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.120" end="01:48:28.270" style="s2">down was an interesting one even though</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.340" end="01:48:29.830" style="s2">it was painful and perhaps look it was</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.270" end="01:48:32.440" style="s2">productive because it got us to the</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.830" end="01:48:35.560" style="s2">second conversation and hooray for that</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.440" end="01:48:37.390" style="s2">and like if you if you feel inclined at</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.560" end="01:48:37.780" style="s2">some point to speak in the future with</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.390" end="01:48:39.880" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.780" end="01:48:42.010" style="s2">we&#39;ll see how people respond to this but</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.880" end="01:48:44.410" style="s2">you know I found the conversation very</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.010" end="01:48:46.180" style="s2">useful and hooray for that yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.410" end="01:48:48.400" style="s2">listen so I will invite people to</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.180" end="01:48:51.220" style="s2">respond yet again as I did the first</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.400" end="01:48:53.530" style="s2">time and I think you and I both pay</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.220" end="01:48:55.630" style="s2">attention to Twitter at least I pay</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.530" end="01:48:58.270" style="s2">attention to Twitter really exclusively</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.630" end="01:48:59.770" style="s2">in terms of social media so yeah me too</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.270" end="01:49:02.830" style="s2">pretty much Twitter is a good place to</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.770" end="01:49:05.080" style="s2">make noise at us we have these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.830" end="01:49:07.030" style="s2">conversations for you guys this as I</p>

<p begin="01:49:10.390" end="01:49:14.980" style="s2">factor of I don&#39;t know what but it was</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.250" end="01:49:17.590" style="s2">remarkable how many people wanted us to</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.980" end="01:49:20.380" style="s2">talk so we have now done it a second</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.590" end="01:49:22.380" style="s2">time and listen it&#39;s a pleasure and I</p>
