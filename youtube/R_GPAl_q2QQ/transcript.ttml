<p begin="00:00:09.800" end="00:00:11.650" style="s2"> I have been looking forward to this lecture for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.650" end="00:00:13.800" style="s2"> It’s not that I don’t care about other lectures</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.800" end="00:00:16.850" style="s2"> What I want to explore tonight is the story of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.200" end="00:00:19.975" style="s2"> Something that shocked me in particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.975" end="00:00:21.416" style="s2"> Especially the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.416" end="00:00:22.400" style="s2"> Hope to tell this story later</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.800" end="00:00:25.175" style="s2"> The length of the story is unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.175" end="00:00:26.475" style="s2"> Only about 10 to 11 lines</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.475" end="00:00:27.475" style="s2"> Hardly said anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.975" end="00:00:30.800" style="s2"> However, I found these short stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.800" end="00:00:32.875" style="s2"> But can reveal endless truths</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.250" end="00:00:34.575" style="s2"> I am not sure what caused this</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.125" end="00:00:39.175" style="s2"> Given that I decided to use as rational as possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.175" end="00:00:41.300" style="s2"> To analyze this problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.300" end="00:00:44.675" style="s2"> I think this stems from the &quot;Bible&quot; story for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.675" end="00:00:47.075" style="s2"> Intense refinement</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.075" end="00:00:48.225" style="s2"> In a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.225" end="00:00:51.425" style="s2"> The information in the Bible story is so compressed and refined</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.425" end="00:00:55.725" style="s2"> Make it difficult for people to come up with a corresponding explanation</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.400" end="00:00:58.200" style="s2"> It’s hard to come up with an explanation that convinces me</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.550" end="00:01:01.000" style="s2"> I think those old stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.000" end="00:01:04.975" style="s2"> The &quot;Bible&quot; story we discussed before is very old</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.625" end="00:01:08.375" style="s2"> One thing you can be sure of for these stories is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.800" end="00:01:11.275" style="s2"> All the memorable parts of the story have been remembered</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.900" end="00:01:12.625" style="s2"> to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.950" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2"> This is the same as Richard Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:16.175" style="s2"> The memetic theory is similar</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.225" end="00:01:17.900" style="s2"> This is why I always feel that Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.275" end="00:01:21.100" style="s2"> More mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.100" end="00:01:22.350" style="s2"> He would become Karl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.350" end="00:01:24.650" style="s2"> Because the theories of the two are incredibly similar</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.650" end="00:01:27.475" style="s2"> Memetic theory and the prototype of the collective subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.475" end="00:01:29.825" style="s2"> Are very similar views</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2"> But I think Jung’s views are much more profound</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:37.425" style="s2"> Indeed Jung thought more thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.800" end="00:01:42.650" style="s2"> Because Dawkins tends to think of memes as a kind of brainworm</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.850" end="00:01:45.550" style="s2"> It can erode the minds of many people</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.550" end="00:01:48.325" style="s2"> However I don’t think Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.325" end="00:01:49.950" style="s2"> Give enough attention to this view</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.425" end="00:01:53.225" style="s2"> He made a joke the last time he talked to Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.225" end="00:01:56.325" style="s2"> They talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.325" end="00:02:00.025" style="s2"> Is there a possibility of memes</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.225" end="00:02:01.125" style="s2"> As religious memes</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.125" end="00:02:03.100" style="s2"> Changed the evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.275" end="00:02:05.275" style="s2"> They immediately avoided that topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.275" end="00:02:06.475" style="s2"> With a burst of laughter</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.475" end="00:02:08.200" style="s2"> They decided to stay away from that topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.725" end="00:02:11.075" style="s2"> It&#39;s fun for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.125" end="00:02:17.275" style="s2"> Condensation of &quot;Bible&quot; story</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.275" end="00:02:19.475" style="s2"> Makes me very confused</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.950" end="00:02:21.675" style="s2"> It must be with people</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.675" end="00:02:26.200" style="s2"> Can&#39;t forget that the Bible story is related</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.450" end="00:02:29.250" style="s2"> This question can be empirically tested</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.250" end="00:02:30.700" style="s2"> I don’t know if anyone has done a similar experiment</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.800" end="00:02:34.025" style="s2"> You tell the unworldly two stories of equal length</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.025" end="00:02:36.475" style="s2"> One contains the prototype theme and the other does not</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:38.125" style="s2"> Wait until three months later</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.125" end="00:02:39.775" style="s2"> Let’s observe which story people remember more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.775" end="00:02:41.925" style="s2"> This kind of experiment is simple and straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:44.775" style="s2"> I haven&#39;t started the experiment yet, maybe I will try it in the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.775" end="00:02:46.550" style="s2"> But in short</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.025" end="00:02:50.225" style="s2"> I am very excited about this lecture</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.225" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2"> Because I will have the opportunity to talk about the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:54.425" style="s2"> And the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:02:56.050" style="s2"> I hope I can tell these two stories tonight</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.050" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2"> It&#39;s better to tell the story of Noah and the Tower of Babel</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:00.150" style="s2"> But given the progress in the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.500" end="00:03:03.625" style="s2"> I don&#39;t have much hope for this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.625" end="00:03:05.450" style="s2"> But it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.300" end="00:03:07.375" style="s2"> Hardship</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.025" end="00:03:11.855" style="s2"> Before you start</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.025" end="00:03:15.250" style="s2"> I want to explain</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.250" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2"> The psychological meaning of the concept of God</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:20.125" style="s2"> I thought a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.375" end="00:03:24.850" style="s2"> Because this series of lectures gave me a chance and forced me</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.850" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2"> Keep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.575" end="00:03:32.450" style="s2"> I have a hypothesis for the concept of the Trinity</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.450" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2"> This assumption is basically like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:38.200" style="s2"> The concept of the Trinity first vividly embodies</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.425" end="00:03:42.100" style="s2"> &quot;There is a deep cognitive structure that enables consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.100" end="00:03:45.125" style="s2"> &quot;There is also consciousness itself&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.175" end="00:03:48.825" style="s2"> I mean the concept of &quot;Holy Father&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.850" end="00:03:52.500" style="s2"> Similar to the &quot;transcendental structure that enables consciousness&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.500" end="00:03:54.450" style="s2"> the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.700" end="00:03:56.425" style="s2"> This is part of our birth</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.425" end="00:03:57.575" style="s2"> It is our structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.875" end="00:03:58.900" style="s2"> You can think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.900" end="00:04:02.375" style="s2"> The product of long-term evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.525" end="00:04:05.100" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s not completely related to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.100" end="00:04:08.700" style="s2"> Conflicting views in the first chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.700" end="00:04:11.625" style="s2"> At least from a metaphorical point of view</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.625" end="00:04:13.325" style="s2"> It is difficult to interpret the literal meaning of the story of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.275" end="00:04:16.325" style="s2"> For example, it emphasizes day and night</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:19.100" style="s2"> But if you understand it as</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.100" end="00:04:25.875" style="s2"> Clock on the 24-hour clock</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.875" end="00:04:29.925" style="s2"> It’s weird that day and night alternate</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.925" end="00:04:32.875" style="s2"> When you think about the construction of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.200" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2"> The literal meaning of the Bible is not reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.450" end="00:04:38.850" style="s2"> There is one more point</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.850" end="00:04:40.775" style="s2"> Many early Christian fathers</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.825" end="00:04:42.675" style="s2"> For example, Origen</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.975" end="00:04:44.825" style="s2"> As early as 300 AD</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.850" end="00:04:49.450" style="s2"> These ancient &quot;Bible&quot; stories should be regarded as metaphors of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.450" end="00:04:50.750" style="s2"> Should not be rigidly understood word by word</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.750" end="00:04:51.700" style="s2"> There is a saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.700" end="00:04:54.075" style="s2"> People who established Christian doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.450" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2"> All fundamentalists who strictly follow the literal meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.300" end="00:04:59.500" style="s2"> This is totally wrong in history</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.750" end="00:05:00.750" style="s2"> Some of them used to be like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.750" end="00:05:01.950" style="s2"> Still so</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.950" end="00:05:02.650" style="s2"> But this is not the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:03.975" style="s2"> Because most of them are not fundamentalists</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.225" end="00:05:06.600" style="s2"> People two thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.600" end="00:05:08.175" style="s2"> Not a fool</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.350" end="00:05:11.800" style="s2"> They are fully capable of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.800" end="00:05:14.175" style="s2"> Metaphorical content</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.300" end="00:05:17.000" style="s2"> They also know that fictional stories are to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:19.100" style="s2"> Can be regarded as an abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.100" end="00:05:23.100" style="s2"> This kind of abstraction can reveal the truth that some documentary works cannot express</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.275" end="00:05:25.100" style="s2"> Unless you think fictional works can only be pastime</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.100" end="00:05:28.550" style="s2"> This idea is ridiculously wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.325" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2"> Good to continue</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.625" end="00:05:35.450" style="s2"> In terms of the concept of the Father</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.450" end="00:05:38.350" style="s2"> This concept refers to in order to be able to understand the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.375" end="00:05:40.525" style="s2"> You must have a priori cognitive structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.600" end="00:05:43.550" style="s2"> I mentioned this last time by Immanuel Kant</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.975" end="00:05:47.825" style="s2"> Kant opposed the following argument</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.825" end="00:05:50.950" style="s2"> &quot;All the information we receive in our lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.950" end="00:05:53.025" style="s2"> &quot;Only input from sensory data&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.025" end="00:05:54.975" style="s2"> The reason why Kant criticized this argument is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.975" end="00:05:56.850" style="s2"> And his criticism is completely correct</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.850" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2"> Sensory data cannot be parsed without a priori structure</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.700" end="00:06:03.525" style="s2"> You can’t extract from sensory data</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.525" end="00:06:05.750" style="s2"> Used to parse the structure of sensory data</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.025" end="00:06:06.950" style="s2"> This is simply impossible</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.250" end="00:06:11.500" style="s2"> This has also been confirmed</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.750" end="00:06:13.150" style="s2"> Since the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.475" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2"> The first failure of artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:17.125" style="s2"> Is the best example of this view</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.650" end="00:06:19.850" style="s2"> Because scientists started looking forward in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.850" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2"> People will have practical autonomous robots</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.975" end="00:06:25.450" style="s2"> And artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.825" end="00:06:27.975" style="s2"> People didn’t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.975" end="00:06:30.975" style="s2"> This kept them stagnant until the 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.975" end="00:06:33.975" style="s2"> The difficulty of the problem of &quot;perception&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.975" end="00:06:36.075" style="s2"> Beyond anyone&#39;s understanding at the time</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.575" end="00:06:37.850" style="s2"> When you observe the world around you</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.850" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2"> Seems to have seen various objects</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.900" end="00:06:41.675" style="s2"> Actually what you see is not an object</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.675" end="00:06:43.900" style="s2"> But tools</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.900" end="00:06:45.925" style="s2"> The neurobiological principle of this phenomenon is clear</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.925" end="00:06:47.875" style="s2"> You are not observing the object and then speculating on its purpose</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.475" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2"> But after observing the purpose, we can see what we see</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.225" end="00:06:53.275" style="s2"> This is contrary to common sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.700" end="00:06:56.141" style="s2"> The key is no matter what people see</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.150" end="00:06:57.575" style="s2"> Is it an object or a tool with a certain purpose</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.800" end="00:06:59.500" style="s2"> You will see them when you look at the world around you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.575" end="00:07:00.875" style="s2"> You think the action of &quot;watching&quot; is easy</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.875" end="00:07:01.950" style="s2"> Because things can be seen everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.950" end="00:07:04.825" style="s2"> As long as you turn your head, things appear in your vision</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.125" end="00:07:09.000" style="s2"> This idea is ridiculously wrong</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.675" end="00:07:12.300" style="s2"> The problem of &quot;perception&quot; is particularly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:14.425" style="s2"> We haven’t built an autonomous robot yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.425" end="00:07:16.575" style="s2"> One reason is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.650" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2"> Although we are a lot better than in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:23.450" style="s2"> We found that you have to have a body first</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.450" end="00:07:24.550" style="s2"> Ability to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.550" end="00:07:25.775" style="s2"> more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.075" end="00:07:27.925" style="s2"> You have to have a body before you can observe</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.250" end="00:07:30.025" style="s2"> Because observation is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.025" end="00:07:32.450" style="s2"> Is the model of the material world</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.450" end="00:07:34.250" style="s2"> Mapped to the body pattern</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.575" end="00:07:36.350" style="s2"> It’s not that things existed here first</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.350" end="00:07:38.250" style="s2"> You see them and then you realize their existence</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.350" end="00:07:39.325" style="s2"> Then you evaluate them</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.325" end="00:07:40.525" style="s2"> Then you decide how to treat them</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.525" end="00:07:41.375" style="s2"> Finally you start</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.600" end="00:07:44.950" style="s2"> You can say that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.950" end="00:07:47.075" style="s2"> Mental processing and perception</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.400" end="00:07:49.025" style="s2"> But this is not the case</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.325" end="00:07:50.525" style="s2"> Like human eyes</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.800" end="00:07:55.125" style="s2"> Will map the light-sensitive signal to the spinal cord</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.125" end="00:07:57.025" style="s2"> Will leave a mark in the emotional system</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.025" end="00:07:59.150" style="s2"> So for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.650" end="00:08:03.975" style="s2"> People who are blind may still feel the facial expressions of others</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.150" end="00:08:07.200" style="s2"> In other words, patients with cortical blindness</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.500" end="00:08:10.200" style="s2"> Their visual cortex is damaged, usually caused by a stroke</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.200" end="00:08:12.325" style="s2"> They are physically invisible</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.750" end="00:08:15.350" style="s2"> But it can sense which hand the tester raised</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.525" end="00:08:18.450" style="s2"> When you show a picture of an angry or fearful face to the patient</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.700" end="00:08:20.525" style="s2"> Patients will be emotionally full of pictures</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.525" end="00:08:21.825" style="s2"> Skin conduction reaction</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.825" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2"> This is due to the following reasons</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.275" end="00:08:25.225" style="s2"> Assuming the world is composed of different patterns</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.400" end="00:08:25.925" style="s2"> In fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.225" end="00:08:27.500" style="s2"> Assuming these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.500" end="00:08:30.525" style="s2"> Propagate to you through electromagnetic signals or light</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.525" end="00:08:33.225" style="s2"> And after being replicated by the retina</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:36.075" style="s2"> Transmission along the optic nerve</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.300" end="00:08:38.975" style="s2"> Finally dispersed in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.975" end="00:08:42.700" style="s2"> Some of these patterns make up a conscious vision</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.875" end="00:08:45.425" style="s2"> Other modes only activate physical functions</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.675" end="00:08:48.725" style="s2"> For example, I look at this</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.775" end="00:08:53.192" style="s2"> What is the name of the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.225" end="00:08:58.250" style="s2"> I look at the bottle especially when I think about the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.625" end="00:08:59.750" style="s2"> I looked at the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.100" end="00:09:02.725" style="s2"> Bottle model</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.825" end="00:09:04.700" style="s2"> Activated the &quot;squeeze&quot; motion mechanism of my hand</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.725" end="00:09:11.050" style="s2"> Part of this perception process is to adjust my body movements</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.175" end="00:09:12.250" style="s2"> Including the &quot;squeeze&quot; movement of my hand</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.525" end="00:09:14.525" style="s2"> Make it the best way to perform grabbing actions</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:16.825" style="s2"> It’s not that I saw the bottle first in the process</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.825" end="00:09:19.025" style="s2"> Think about how to hold the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:20.150" style="s2"> That&#39;s too inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.275" end="00:09:23.675" style="s2"> But I use sports cortex to perceive the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.675" end="00:09:25.500" style="s2"> This process is independent of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.525" end="00:09:28.325" style="s2"> Look at the conscious experience of the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.025" end="00:09:34.500" style="s2"> So anyway what I want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.500" end="00:09:37.025" style="s2"> There are countless similar phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.225" end="00:09:38.925" style="s2"> Rodney Brooks has a say in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.925" end="00:09:40.450" style="s2"> He is a robotics engineer</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.450" end="00:09:41.625" style="s2"> In the 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.625" end="00:09:44.850" style="s2"> He invented the Roomba sweeping robot and other things</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.850" end="00:09:46.150" style="s2"> This man is really a genius</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.650" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2"> Brooks first pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.150" end="00:09:56.650" style="s2"> In order to give the machine enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.700" end="00:09:57.700" style="s2"> Perception ability to work normally</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.725" end="00:09:59.875" style="s2"> Machine body</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:02.900" style="s2"> The perception ability should be built from the body</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.900" end="00:10:06.675" style="s2"> Instead of building down from abstract cognitive consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:10.150" style="s2"> Later this view was confirmed</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.275" end="00:10:11.650" style="s2"> Brooks in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.650" end="00:10:13.625" style="s2"> Made many strange small mechanical devices</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.625" end="00:10:15.350" style="s2"> These devices have no actual brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.350" end="00:10:17.000" style="s2"> But it can behave like staying away from the light source</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.050" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2"> These devices can sense light</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.550" end="00:10:21.000" style="s2"> Their perception behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.000" end="00:10:23.375" style="s2"> The action of escaping from the light source</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.725" end="00:10:27.800" style="s2"> Perception is closely related to action</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.800" end="00:10:30.125" style="s2"> This is different from what people usually think</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.650" end="00:10:32.375" style="s2"> In short I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.375" end="00:10:36.425" style="s2"> If you are not reified, you cannot know the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.650" end="00:10:39.500" style="s2"> Your current way of representation has gone through</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.500" end="00:10:41.925" style="s2"> It took about 3.5 billion years to take shape</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.925" end="00:10:44.951" style="s2"> This process presupposes a lot of death</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.025" end="00:10:46.875" style="s2"> Formed the concrete form you have today</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.375" end="00:10:49.175" style="s2"> This process has gone through various trials and failures</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:50.550" style="s2"> Just created a human like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.675" end="00:10:52.900" style="s2"> Have enough ability to deal with the complex world</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.900" end="00:10:56.900" style="s2"> To spend a relatively short 80 years of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.300" end="00:11:00.675" style="s2"> So I think maybe my idea is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.675" end="00:11:05.050" style="s2"> But I think this is at least a useful assumption</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.100" end="00:11:08.400" style="s2"> I think the concept of the Father is similar to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.400" end="00:11:09.800" style="s2"> The birth of this view</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.925" end="00:11:12.900" style="s2"> There is an internal structure</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.825" end="00:11:15.825" style="s2"> Consciousness is born from it</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.825" end="00:11:17.525" style="s2"> This structure gives form to things</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.850" end="00:11:20.950" style="s2"> This idea is not necessarily right</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.950" end="00:11:21.875" style="s2"> But if this assumption is correct</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.875" end="00:11:26.250" style="s2"> It reflects what I described before</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.325" end="00:11:27.225" style="s2"> Factual truth</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.225" end="00:11:30.225" style="s2"> I also mentioned that I will</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.725" end="00:11:33.075" style="s2"> Holy Spirit and Son Concept</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.125" end="00:11:36.175" style="s2"> Especially in the form of Tao</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.400" end="00:11:42.525" style="s2"> As an active consciousness generated and used by internal structure</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.000" end="00:11:45.550" style="s2"> It not only conceives the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.725" end="00:11:47.000" style="s2"> We do imagine the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.000" end="00:11:49.425" style="s2"> At least imagine the world we see and experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.925" end="00:11:51.650" style="s2"> It also changes and adjusts the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.650" end="00:11:53.950" style="s2"> We undoubtedly did this</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.600" end="00:11:55.650" style="s2"> Partly with our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.675" end="00:11:58.173" style="s2"> Evolution makes our bodies suitable for these</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.275" end="00:11:59.375" style="s2"> This is why we have hands</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.375" end="00:12:00.425" style="s2"> And dolphins don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.425" end="00:12:02.175" style="s2"> Although they also have human-like large-capacity brains</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.175" end="00:12:03.550" style="s2"> But they can&#39;t change the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.900" end="00:12:06.875" style="s2"> Humans adapt to changing the world through evolution</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:11.975" style="s2"> Human words are an extension of hands-on ability</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.900" end="00:12:14.400" style="s2"> Our discourse system is</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.400" end="00:12:21.650" style="s2"> A well-developed motor skill</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.100" end="00:12:23.025" style="s2"> Generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.175" end="00:12:26.100" style="s2"> The brain hemisphere you use to control language</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.100" end="00:12:27.100" style="s2"> It&#39;s also the hemisphere of your dominant hand</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.800" end="00:12:28.850" style="s2"> People said and gestured with their hands</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.075" end="00:12:30.475" style="s2"> You saw me too</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:31.900" style="s2"> We can sign language</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.900" end="00:12:33.975" style="s2"> Hand use and language use</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.975" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2"> Closely related</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:39.550" style="s2"> Partly because language is a kind of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.675" end="00:12:42.175" style="s2"> And the hand is also one of the forces that transform the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.900" end="00:12:44.250" style="s2"> A priori structure</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.250" end="00:12:47.375" style="s2"> Very closely linked</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.375" end="00:12:49.275" style="s2"> Also closely related to the concrete structure</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.550" end="00:12:51.075" style="s2"> I think this part explains</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.100" end="00:12:54.300" style="s2"> Why the classic Christian doctrine is more than</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.625" end="00:12:56.325" style="s2"> Emphasize the divinity of the Holy Spirit</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.325" end="00:12:58.200" style="s2"> Also emphasizes the divinity of the body</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.550" end="00:13:00.850" style="s2"> And this is even more difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.075" end="00:13:02.525" style="s2"> Because you are more likely to think</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.025" end="00:13:04.600" style="s2"> If you have religious thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.875" end="00:13:06.700" style="s2"> You are more likely to think that there is something transcendent in your body</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.750" end="00:13:08.675" style="s2"> Not bound by a specific body</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.725" end="00:13:10.500" style="s2"> It will continue after death</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.550" end="00:13:11.250" style="s2"> And so on</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.275" end="00:13:13.750" style="s2"> But Christianity is especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.750" end="00:13:15.925" style="s2"> Emphasize that the body also has divinity</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.325" end="00:13:19.625" style="s2"> This view of &quot;there is implicit structure&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.950" end="00:13:22.325" style="s2"> Semi-patriarchal nature</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.325" end="00:13:24.575" style="s2"> The reason is complicated</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.600" end="00:13:27.475" style="s2"> But partly because it is a reflection of social structure</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.750" end="00:13:28.625" style="s2"> Is also a reflection of other things</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.625" end="00:13:31.675" style="s2"> And use awareness</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.725" end="00:13:32.625" style="s2"> Especially linguistic consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.625" end="00:13:35.950" style="s2"> The most important thing is to use sincere language</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.325" end="00:13:39.275" style="s2"> Able to construct the world in a &quot;good&quot; way</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.550" end="00:13:42.750" style="s2"> I think this is a powerful concept</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.975" end="00:13:45.025" style="s2"> especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.025" end="00:13:47.525" style="s2"> Sincere language can create good</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.525" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2"> This is a very fundamental moral proposition</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.075" end="00:13:51.700" style="s2"> I think this idea is difficult to refute</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.700" end="00:13:54.050" style="s2"> One thing I noticed is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.750" end="00:13:57.475" style="s2"> Of course not only I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.500" end="00:14:02.575" style="s2"> There is no denying that there are many tragedies in life</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.950" end="00:14:03.825" style="s2"> Many people i met</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.825" end="00:14:05.575" style="s2"> For example, patients in my clinical treatment</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.850" end="00:14:08.275" style="s2"> Overwhelmed by misfortune in life</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.625" end="00:14:10.675" style="s2"> But I also often see</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.675" end="00:14:13.925" style="s2"> The person who can&#39;t get out of intrigue</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.925" end="00:14:16.400" style="s2"> This deception network often lasts for generations</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.525" end="00:14:17.900" style="s2"> Let them down</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.050" end="00:14:23.775" style="s2"> Deception can cause extreme pain</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.875" end="00:14:26.250" style="s2"> This pain will last a long time</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.875" end="00:14:28.675" style="s2"> This is common sense in clinical practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.900" end="00:14:32.775" style="s2"> Freud pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.775" end="00:14:35.150" style="s2"> Cause pain</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.150" end="00:14:37.850" style="s2"> Or a cause of mental illness and depression</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.300" end="00:14:40.525" style="s2"> It&#39;s a lie deliberately concealed</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.525" end="00:14:42.400" style="s2"> It&#39;s quite correct to think so</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.400" end="00:14:44.625" style="s2"> Jung bluntly proposed</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.625" end="00:14:49.875" style="s2"> Psychotherapy efforts</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.075" end="00:14:51.675" style="s2"> And huge moral effort</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.675" end="00:14:52.725" style="s2"> Including telling the truth is essentially the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.025" end="00:14:55.100" style="s2"> He thinks that both are one thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.350" end="00:14:57.425" style="s2"> Carl Rogers, another great clinician</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.750" end="00:14:59.300" style="s2"> He was a Christian missionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.300" end="00:15:03.500" style="s2"> Later he became a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.750" end="00:15:06.400" style="s2"> Rogers believes that sincere dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.450" end="00:15:09.900" style="s2"> Will produce clinical transformation</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.925" end="00:15:15.150" style="s2"> Of course in clinical treatment</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.150" end="00:15:16.375" style="s2"> One of the prerequisites for true transformation is</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.375" end="00:15:19.875" style="s2"> Doctors and patients are sincere</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.950" end="00:15:20.650" style="s2"> otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.650" end="00:15:22.325" style="s2"> How can you know what happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.325" end="00:15:23.525" style="s2"> You can’t do without knowing what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.525" end="00:15:24.850" style="s2"> To solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.200" end="00:15:26.525" style="s2"> And only the other party tells you the truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.525" end="00:15:27.975" style="s2"> So you know where the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.325" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2"> If you want to improve your relationship with others</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:31.350" style="s2"> You should think about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.200" end="00:15:34.175" style="s2"> If you don’t tell the people around you the truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.175" end="00:15:35.325" style="s2"> They won&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.550" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2"> Maybe this is a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.725" end="00:15:40.350" style="s2"> Sometimes people lie for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.400" end="00:15:41.825" style="s2"> And not for trivial reasons</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.250" end="00:15:43.575" style="s2"> But you must also know</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.175" end="00:15:46.325" style="s2"> Unless you express the actual situation in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.325" end="00:15:47.850" style="s2"> You can&#39;t touch the real problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.200" end="00:15:49.725" style="s2"> If you can&#39;t reach the real problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.725" end="00:15:52.550" style="s2"> It is basically impossible for you to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.275" end="00:15:56.475" style="s2"> I&#39;m still thinking about another thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.250" end="00:16:02.025" style="s2"> The more i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.025" end="00:16:05.525" style="s2"> This point of view becomes clearer</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.525" end="00:16:08.125" style="s2"> This view is</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:13.125" style="s2"> This view is partly</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.925" end="00:16:16.700" style="s2"> Let me think about how to start well</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.200" end="00:16:19.100" style="s2"> I have a friend who is also my business partner</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.475" end="00:16:21.225" style="s2"> Also my thesis collaborator</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.225" end="00:16:22.200" style="s2"> He is very smart</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.250" end="00:16:26.400" style="s2"> I told you about him before and he accused me of using</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.400" end="00:16:27.875" style="s2"> The word &quot;dominant level&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.550" end="00:16:31.950" style="s2"> The term is used for creatures like chimpanzees and lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.575" end="00:16:33.625" style="s2"> It might not matter</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.900" end="00:16:36.525" style="s2"> But maybe it’s not even suitable for chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.350" end="00:16:39.175" style="s2"> He said something very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.250" end="00:16:41.425" style="s2"> He sees the concept of superiority level as</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.425" end="00:16:47.150" style="s2"> Similar to the Marxist assumptions of the early 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.425" end="00:16:50.050" style="s2"> A projection in animal society</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.650" end="00:16:52.950" style="s2"> For example, &quot;the chimpanzee mating level</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.950" end="00:16:56.925" style="s2"> &quot;Advantage hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.175" end="00:16:59.475" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s built on power.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:02.025" style="s2"> He believes that this view is actually a projection of a certain political ideology</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.050" end="00:17:05.225" style="s2"> His views troubled me for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.225" end="00:17:09.050" style="s2"> Because I have been using the term superiority level</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.575" end="00:17:11.225" style="s2"> After he told me this, I felt</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.425" end="00:17:13.450" style="s2"> Ah so annoying</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.450" end="00:17:14.875" style="s2"> Because what he said may be right</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.875" end="00:17:16.925" style="s2"> I spent a few months thinking about this problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.475" end="00:17:20.575" style="s2"> At the same time I am still reading Frans de Val</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.600" end="00:17:21.675" style="s2"> He is a primatologist</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.675" end="00:17:23.800" style="s2"> Still reading Jayak Panksip</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.800" end="00:17:26.150" style="s2"> An outstanding emotional neurologist</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.150" end="00:17:27.575" style="s2"> Unfortunately he just passed away</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.900" end="00:17:30.225" style="s2"> His &quot;Affective Neuroscience&quot; is very good and it mentions</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.675" end="00:17:32.525" style="s2"> The mice must play fairly</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.525" end="00:17:33.725" style="s2"> If it&#39;s unfair, the rats won&#39;t participate in the play</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.100" end="00:17:36.075" style="s2"> This is a shocking discovery</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.075" end="00:17:39.575" style="s2"> Because anything can prove</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.900" end="00:17:43.794" style="s2"> Specific examples of the origin of animal moral behavior</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.025" end="00:17:46.700" style="s2"> This is related to the evolution process</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.700" end="00:17:49.325" style="s2"> It is also the core of Panksaipu’s research</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.750" end="00:17:51.500" style="s2"> Can prove</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.500" end="00:17:53.325" style="s2"> Ethics that guide mankind</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:58.100" style="s2"> Not just the construction of sociology and paraphenomenism</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.100" end="00:17:59.450" style="s2"> But something more ingrained</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.550" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2"> And mice, if my god, they are just mice</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:02.550" style="s2"> You can&#39;t trust the mouse</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.550" end="00:18:04.200" style="s2"> But they also pay attention to fairness when playing games</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.625" end="00:18:06.875" style="s2"> Deval Discovery</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.225" end="00:18:08.825" style="s2"> Among the chimpanzees he studied</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.225" end="00:18:13.325" style="s2"> Savage orangutan ruled with an iron fist</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.350" end="00:18:14.875" style="s2"> Did not become a successful ruler</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.875" end="00:18:18.375" style="s2"> Because once the orangutan ruled with an iron fist leaks its decline</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.375" end="00:18:19.875" style="s2"> Will be despised and trampled by him</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.875" end="00:18:20.975" style="s2"> Chimpanzee companion torn to pieces</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.975" end="00:18:22.025" style="s2"> Will be divided by five apes</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.375" end="00:18:25.375" style="s2"> And a long-term orangutan leader</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.975" end="00:18:27.925" style="s2"> It rules the stable orangutan kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.100" end="00:18:31.525" style="s2"> They will be reciprocal to their &quot;friends&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.725" end="00:18:32.725" style="s2"> Orangutans also have friends</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.775" end="00:18:35.475" style="s2"> Their friendship can last a long time</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.625" end="00:18:38.950" style="s2"> When dealing with females and baby orangutans</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.950" end="00:18:40.650" style="s2"> They also take a lot of reciprocal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.800" end="00:18:44.375" style="s2"> Deval is a very wise man</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.850" end="00:18:46.950" style="s2"> I think this research is also basic scientific knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.075" end="00:18:51.050" style="s2"> Because you have to know</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.075" end="00:18:53.900" style="s2"> Factors that contribute to dominance in male dominance levels</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:54.925" style="s2"> Sorry for using the term &quot;male dominance level&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.000" end="00:18:57.400" style="s2"> Maybe it’s better to call it “authority”</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.400" end="00:18:59.625" style="s2"> Or to say it scaryly &quot;ability&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.625" end="00:19:01.300" style="s2"> It&#39;s better to think so</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:04.025" style="s2"> This factor is not just based on</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:06.575" style="s2"> Above barbaric power</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.025" end="00:19:09.750" style="s2"> I still think</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.750" end="00:19:13.000" style="s2"> The following view is a very absurd and dangerous political view</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.000" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2"> That is, &quot;in a law-abiding society</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.650" end="00:19:20.213" style="s2"> &quot;The male hierarchy is based on power.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:22.825" style="s2"> This view is very absurd</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.825" end="00:19:27.100" style="s2"> You just have to think about the last month</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.475" end="00:19:29.475" style="s2"> Not long</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.675" end="00:19:31.250" style="s2"> You can understand how absurd this view is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.800" end="00:19:34.050" style="s2"> Most authority</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.825" end="00:19:37.750" style="s2"> Are restricted by ethics</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.750" end="00:19:41.850" style="s2"> They are more restricted than other lower ranks</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.025" end="00:19:44.200" style="s2"> We can also understand this in business management books</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.200" end="00:19:45.850" style="s2"> Because in general</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.850" end="00:19:48.875" style="s2"> The pressure the manager receives from his subordinates</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.875" end="00:19:51.025" style="s2"> More pressure than the subordinates get from the manager</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.450" end="00:19:52.450" style="s2"> This is not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.450" end="00:19:55.275" style="s2"> Do you want to manage 200 people</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.500" end="00:19:56.550" style="s2"> Are you sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.550" end="00:19:57.800" style="s2"> This is a chore</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.050" end="00:19:59.725" style="s2"> I know the boss is usually annoying</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.900" end="00:20:02.275" style="s2"> Because you have to care about what the boss thinks</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.575" end="00:20:04.100" style="s2"> And your boss may be a bossy person</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.425" end="00:20:06.700" style="s2"> And bossy bosses are generally not particularly successful</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.875" end="00:20:09.375" style="s2"> But managing 200 people is really not a joke</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.375" end="00:20:11.875" style="s2"> Shoulder this responsibility and authority</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.175" end="00:20:13.950" style="s2"> You must always be careful</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.950" end="00:20:16.550" style="s2"> Because people will keep pointing out your mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.050" end="00:20:19.150" style="s2"> So it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.150" end="00:20:22.500" style="s2"> You are in a higher position in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.900" end="00:20:25.700" style="s2"> The moral restraint on you is less</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.925" end="00:20:27.025" style="s2"> Of course if you are a psychopath</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.025" end="00:20:28.525" style="s2"> That&#39;s another matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.825" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2"> But the psychopath has to be in a different hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:32.025" style="s2"> Keep running</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.300" end="00:20:33.900" style="s2"> Because people will soon see through psychopaths</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.425" end="00:20:36.225" style="s2"> Once they are ruined</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.750" end="00:20:38.875" style="s2"> Their tricks cannot continue to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.100" end="00:20:41.500" style="s2"> all in all</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.975" end="00:20:46.700" style="s2"> Behavior patterns are very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.025" end="00:20:51.375" style="s2"> Imagine how sexual selection is done</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.325" end="00:20:53.525" style="s2"> We know sexual selection</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.550" end="00:20:56.950" style="s2"> Is a very, very powerful biological force</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.225" end="00:20:59.950" style="s2"> Although after Charles Darwin created the theory of evolution,</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.950" end="00:21:02.025" style="s2"> Biologists have ignored sexual selection for more than 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.250" end="00:21:04.050" style="s2"> Only focus on natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.250" end="00:21:05.850" style="s2"> Biologists don&#39;t wait to see sexual choices</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.875" end="00:21:08.150" style="s2"> Because it will change the concept of mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.475" end="00:21:09.850" style="s2"> Join the evolution process</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:11.450" style="s2"> Because sexual selection involves the process of selection</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.825" end="00:21:15.775" style="s2"> Now imagine that there is a male hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.125" end="00:21:18.075" style="s2"> People at the top of this hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.075" end="00:21:20.225" style="s2"> Than those at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.225" end="00:21:21.150" style="s2"> Easier to reproduce successfully</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.225" end="00:21:22.925" style="s2"> This is especially true for men</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.250" end="00:21:24.675" style="s2"> Number of female ancestors of a person</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.675" end="00:21:26.225" style="s2"> Will be twice as many as its male ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.575" end="00:21:27.550" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to do calculations</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.850" end="00:21:29.325" style="s2"> Although this sounds unreasonable</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.325" end="00:21:31.225" style="s2"> But you can look through your own family tree</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.350" end="00:21:34.250" style="s2"> The actual situation happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.725" end="00:21:37.075" style="s2"> There are twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.125" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2"> Is due to the possibility that women will have offspring on average</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:42.175" style="s2"> Twice as much as men</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.350" end="00:21:45.650" style="s2"> Any male who reproduces</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.650" end="00:21:47.225" style="s2"> Tends to multiply</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.625" end="00:21:49.225" style="s2"> And the other group of males have zero reproductive opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.875" end="00:21:52.800" style="s2"> An average male who reproduces has two offspring</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.800" end="00:21:56.900" style="s2"> Of course, a male who has no chance of reproduction has zero offspring on average</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.775" end="00:22:00.725" style="s2"> An average female who reproduces has one offspring</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.375" end="00:22:05.225" style="s2"> In other words, in a person’s pedigree</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.225" end="00:22:05.975" style="s2"> There are twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.550" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2"> This matter is not trivial</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.725" end="00:22:10.350" style="s2"> Imagine something like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.350" end="00:22:17.575" style="s2"> Men choose a capable admirer</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.575" end="00:22:21.950" style="s2"> I can&#39;t say that this person is dominant</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.100" end="00:22:24.700" style="s2"> He is given authority and respect</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.900" end="00:22:25.925" style="s2"> Say so</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.050" end="00:22:27.325" style="s2"> Just like election</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.200" end="00:22:29.675" style="s2"> Can be democratically elected</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.675" end="00:22:32.325" style="s2"> But at least an election that everyone agrees</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.575" end="00:22:35.075" style="s2"> Or at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.075" end="00:22:36.275" style="s2"> &quot;We still have to keep him right now, let’s not kill it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.350" end="00:22:37.850" style="s2"> This is also a form of election</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.850" end="00:22:39.725" style="s2"> Is a form of tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.150" end="00:22:42.050" style="s2"> What happens next is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.275" end="00:22:43.550" style="s2"> Women as far as they are concerned</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.550" end="00:22:45.225" style="s2"> Will select partners from the top of the male hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.725" end="00:22:47.450" style="s2"> So there are two factors</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.450" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2"> Drives human sexual selection</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:52.600" style="s2"> A long-term evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.725" end="00:22:55.075" style="s2"> One is aimed at men by men</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.075" end="00:22:57.300" style="s2"> Election of who can get a position with greater breeding opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.625" end="00:22:59.675" style="s2"> The second is women from</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.675" end="00:23:01.975" style="s2"> The tendency of men to start selecting partners at the top of the male dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.975" end="00:23:04.975" style="s2"> This works well in every culture</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.450" end="00:23:09.325" style="s2"> Even if you evened out between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.325" end="00:23:10.250" style="s2"> Socioeconomic inequality</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.250" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2"> Such as the situation in Northern Europe</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.875" end="00:23:16.275" style="s2"> You can&#39;t effectively reduce women</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.275" end="00:23:18.450" style="s2"> The tendency to select a partner from the top of the male hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.800" end="00:23:19.850" style="s2"> You don&#39;t want to lower</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.850" end="00:23:20.875" style="s2"> Women are smart</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.050" end="00:23:24.975" style="s2"> Why don&#39;t they go</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.975" end="00:23:27.775" style="s2"> To pursue relationships with relatively successful men</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.025" end="00:23:30.950" style="s2"> Why don’t they let men define themselves first</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:33.325" style="s2"> What is success</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.050" end="00:23:34.675" style="s2"> It makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.800" end="00:23:36.650" style="s2"> If you want to figure out who is the best male</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.850" end="00:23:38.600" style="s2"> Why not let men compete on their own</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:40.825" style="s2"> No matter what kind of competition</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.825" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2"> The final winner</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.025" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2"> Is the best male by definition</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:45.500" style="s2"> How else would you define it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.475" end="00:23:48.750" style="s2"> Why i say this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.400" end="00:23:52.125" style="s2"> The reason is I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.125" end="00:23:56.750" style="s2"> Election of male dominance in the process of human evolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.050" end="00:24:00.175" style="s2"> And the victory of sexual selection</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.175" end="00:24:01.775" style="s2"> Have complex interactions</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:03.750" style="s2"> If it&#39;s true, it&#39;s no small matter</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.925" end="00:24:06.500" style="s2"> Because of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.825" end="00:24:08.225" style="s2"> With evolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.050" end="00:24:12.800" style="s2"> Males will be more and more optimized towards the apex of male rank</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.075" end="00:24:15.175" style="s2"> Because men who are not good at this way have no offspring</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.175" end="00:24:17.150" style="s2"> So it must be</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.475" end="00:24:19.925" style="s2"> But then there is more than one level system</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.200" end="00:24:22.125" style="s2"> Because it will produce a bunch of different levels</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.125" end="00:24:25.825" style="s2"> You will ask whether there are commonalities between different levels</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.350" end="00:24:27.975" style="s2"> This is a reasonable question</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.950" end="00:24:31.050" style="s2"> At least the different levels are not completely opposed</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.400" end="00:24:35.825" style="s2"> If you are relatively successful in a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.900" end="00:24:38.675" style="s2"> Then you are in another hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.675" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2"> The possibility of success will be greater</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.525" end="00:24:42.350" style="s2"> This is a right</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.350" end="00:24:44.625" style="s2"> A good definition of general intelligence or IQ</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.000" end="00:24:47.450" style="s2"> Intelligence is actually a factor in women choosing men</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.725" end="00:24:49.150" style="s2"> Of course men also choose women like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.150" end="00:24:51.875" style="s2"> But men are more pressured to choose than women</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.350" end="00:24:53.750" style="s2"> IQ can help you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.750" end="00:24:56.350" style="s2"> One of the factors to climb different dominance levels</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.350" end="00:24:58.775" style="s2"> Because it is a universal mechanism for solving problems</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.075" end="00:25:00.925" style="s2"> Another factor to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.925" end="00:25:02.150" style="s2"> Conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.375" end="00:25:05.075" style="s2"> There is evidence that women tend to choose conscientious men</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.950" end="00:25:07.250" style="s2"> It&#39;s reasonable, why not</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.250" end="00:25:10.800" style="s2"> Such men are trustworthy and work hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.900" end="00:25:12.050" style="s2"> These are advantages</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.525" end="00:25:13.225" style="s2"> Then you will think</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.225" end="00:25:17.175" style="s2"> Men have adapted to climbing the male dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.175" end="00:25:19.425" style="s2"> They adapted to climb</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.425" end="00:25:20.625" style="s2"> Various grade systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.625" end="00:25:23.825" style="s2"> Then you will think that there are so many different attributes</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.825" end="00:25:25.425" style="s2"> Can be put into practice</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.600" end="00:25:27.775" style="s2"> Can be reified</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.775" end="00:25:30.175" style="s2"> These attributes can increase successful summit</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.175" end="00:25:31.800" style="s2"> The possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.250" end="00:25:33.350" style="s2"> In the end you will think</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.350" end="00:25:35.800" style="s2"> As people get used to it</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.150" end="00:25:38.175" style="s2"> They will start to understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.175" end="00:25:39.725" style="s2"> What makes up this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.325" end="00:25:43.550" style="s2"> This becomes a multidimensional ability</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.550" end="00:25:46.075" style="s2"> Abstract representation</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.350" end="00:25:48.725" style="s2"> Such as the abstraction of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.050" end="00:25:51.975" style="s2"> All of these are not generated at will</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.200" end="00:25:55.450" style="s2"> But firmly rooted in the physiology</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:57.800" style="s2"> I think this view is difficult to refute</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.475" end="00:26:01.875" style="s2"> I have such a habit when I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.100" end="00:26:02.800" style="s2"> When i think about something</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.850" end="00:26:05.300" style="s2"> It will take a long time to figure out if your opinion is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.750" end="00:26:08.500" style="s2"> I will try to start from every possible angle</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.500" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2"> To examine whether this view is tenable</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:13.175" style="s2"> If it’s hard to get a foothold, then I’d rather discard it</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.175" end="00:26:14.150" style="s2"> Turn to thinking about better ideas</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.350" end="00:26:16.825" style="s2"> I spent a long time trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.825" end="00:26:18.225" style="s2"> What is wrong with this view</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.375" end="00:26:22.200" style="s2"> Because in my opinion it&#39;s quite unbreakable</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.050" end="00:26:24.250" style="s2"> This view is like this</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.300" end="00:26:26.775" style="s2"> Like when people watch a movie</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.775" end="00:26:28.375" style="s2"> And so on, when you read novels</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.550" end="00:26:29.775" style="s2"> Obviously people are good at</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.775" end="00:26:32.150" style="s2"> Distinguish between the pros and the villains</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.525" end="00:26:35.250" style="s2"> Villains are generally bad guys</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.250" end="00:26:39.925" style="s2"> It&#39;s the kind of deliberate deliberate for authority and high position</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.225" end="00:26:42.675" style="s2"> But people who fail in the end are generally like this</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.675" end="00:26:44.175" style="s2"> So he is a good negative example</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.900" end="00:26:47.825" style="s2"> If you take a child to watch a movie that is a party</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.025" end="00:26:50.650" style="s2"> He soon knew that he should not be a villain</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.100" end="00:26:54.875" style="s2"> And quickly focused on the positive person</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.225" end="00:26:57.575" style="s2"> this means</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.575" end="00:27:01.075" style="s2"> Models of good people in fictional works</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.175" end="00:27:03.725" style="s2"> There is an affinity with the child’s perception</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.500" end="00:27:06.225" style="s2"> I told my son when he was young</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.475" end="00:27:07.925" style="s2"> The movie I took him to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.925" end="00:27:10.125" style="s2"> Sometimes it’s really scary</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.475" end="00:27:12.875" style="s2"> What I told him was</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.175" end="00:27:14.650" style="s2"> I never tell him don&#39;t be afraid</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:16.975" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think this is good advice for children</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.450" end="00:27:19.150" style="s2"> I&#39;m talking about focusing on the hero character</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.050" end="00:27:21.350" style="s2"> I kept emphasizing this sentence with him</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.925" end="00:27:25.100" style="s2"> He looked very attentively and was often scared</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.100" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2"> Because some movies are really scary</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:29.750" style="s2"> Then he focused on good people and looked forward to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.750" end="00:27:31.325" style="s2"> You know it&#39;s like this when watching movies</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.325" end="00:27:33.450" style="s2"> Generally speaking, you want good people to win</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.475" end="00:27:37.425" style="s2"> Why do you think this way? Where does this idea come from</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.425" end="00:27:39.425" style="s2"> Have you noticed how deep-rooted this idea is in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.475" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2"> You line up to buy movie tickets to see how good people win</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.925" end="00:27:45.775" style="s2"> It&#39;s hard to understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.775" end="00:27:48.900" style="s2"> But people think it’s so self-evident that they don’t notice</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.900" end="00:27:50.500" style="s2"> This is actually a huge mystery</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.675" end="00:27:54.425" style="s2"> So is the following idea unreasonable</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.425" end="00:27:59.225" style="s2"> That is, we have concluded such a collective conclusion for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.225" end="00:28:02.875" style="s2"> What is the best good person</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.875" end="00:28:05.750" style="s2"> What is the worst bad guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.900" end="00:28:10.275" style="s2"> Archeologically speaking, I regard this opposition as hostile brothers</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.275" end="00:28:12.925" style="s2"> Like Christ and Satan or Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.100" end="00:28:16.575" style="s2"> Hostile brothers are a very common mythological theme</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.925" end="00:28:18.725" style="s2"> These are the prototypes of good people and bad people</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.050" end="00:28:24.975" style="s2"> For example, Satan’s definition is the worst bad guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.500" end="00:28:30.500" style="s2"> These are just conceptually speaking, the definition of Christ is</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.800" end="00:28:34.750" style="s2"> Is the best one can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.775" end="00:28:39.550" style="s2"> I am discussing this issue from a psychological and conceptual sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.500" end="00:28:44.075" style="s2"> Given our imagination and ability to invest in fictional works</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.375" end="00:28:47.575" style="s2"> Love for fiction and ability to dramatize things</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.575" end="00:28:52.675" style="s2"> And the love of heroism stories, disaster stories and good and evil stories</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.725" end="00:28:55.100" style="s2"> I can&#39;t think of any other explanation for this</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.425" end="00:29:00.825" style="s2"> This part drives the formation</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.825" end="00:29:02.975" style="s2"> The concept of &quot;the evolution of the concept of God&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.975" end="00:29:06.050" style="s2"> More specifically it drove the evolution of the concept of the Trinity</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.225" end="00:29:07.575" style="s2"> At least in part</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.625" end="00:29:11.125" style="s2"> God is an abstract ideal incarnation of its formation</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.125" end="00:29:13.925" style="s2"> Incarnation of ideal</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.925" end="00:29:17.500" style="s2"> Separated from any concrete avatar or ruler</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.650" end="00:29:19.700" style="s2"> There is also such a rule in the &quot;Bible&quot; story</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.100" end="00:29:23.150" style="s2"> I mentioned before that when people started to move existing rulers</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.150" end="00:29:28.400" style="s2"> When confused with abstract ideals</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.550" end="00:29:30.825" style="s2"> The country immediately fell into tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.825" end="00:29:31.925" style="s2"> Everything collapsed instantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.175" end="00:29:34.600" style="s2"> This is actually very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.975" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2"> What people found</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:37.900" style="s2"> It&#39;s actually hard to find</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.900" end="00:29:41.550" style="s2"> That is you have to put abstract concepts</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.550" end="00:29:44.675" style="s2"> Take it out of any specific power structure</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.125" end="00:29:46.700" style="s2"> And treat it as</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.700" end="00:29:48.375" style="s2"> An abstract concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.500" end="00:29:50.075" style="s2"> But it is also a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.375" end="00:29:52.725" style="s2"> It exists because it governs your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.725" end="00:29:55.475" style="s2"> And everyone’s actions including the sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.125" end="00:29:59.375" style="s2"> The monarch must also be responsible for this abstract ideal</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.575" end="00:30:02.600" style="s2"> You see this is really incredible</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.675" end="00:30:05.350" style="s2"> What did people think about 5000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.750" end="00:30:06.675" style="s2"> You can notice something</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.675" end="00:30:08.875" style="s2"> Often appears in the Old Testament of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.875" end="00:30:10.975" style="s2"> Let’s take the Israelis as an example</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.975" end="00:30:14.975" style="s2"> Whenever the king of Israel becomes omnipotent</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.825" end="00:30:19.075" style="s2"> The true God will appear and crush them</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.075" end="00:30:20.850" style="s2"> Then the whole country fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.850" end="00:30:21.950" style="s2"> For hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.600" end="00:30:26.700" style="s2"> I think what I want to teach us</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.950" end="00:30:28.825" style="s2"> We have not been able to clearly understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.025" end="00:30:30.525" style="s2"> This is still very implicit in the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.525" end="00:30:32.700" style="s2"> We haven&#39;t been able to figure out why this is the case</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.125" end="00:30:37.500" style="s2"> I find it difficult for you to ignore this argument</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.100" end="00:30:42.900" style="s2"> Ok we talked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.875" end="00:30:45.275" style="s2"> The concept of the Trinity is like this</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.425" end="00:30:52.225" style="s2"> The Holy Father should be said to be the basic structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.225" end="00:30:53.925" style="s2"> A dramatic performance</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.950" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2"> Or the concrete structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.350" end="00:30:59.525" style="s2"> Next is the Son, it is consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.525" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2"> But in a specific historical form</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:04.375" style="s2"> This point about the image of the Son is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.700" end="00:31:06.450" style="s2"> There is also a form of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.450" end="00:31:09.150" style="s2"> Can be seen as the inner spirit</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.600" end="00:31:12.750" style="s2"> These psychological thoughts must have a source</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.300" end="00:31:14.075" style="s2"> They have history</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.075" end="00:31:15.800" style="s2"> Didn&#39;t come out of thin air</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.025" end="00:31:18.875" style="s2"> They are derived from the dream hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.875" end="00:31:20.575" style="s2"> And artistic imagination</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.825" end="00:31:21.425" style="s2"> After a long period of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.750" end="00:31:24.250" style="s2"> Clarified as consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.650" end="00:31:27.400" style="s2"> We worked hard for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:33.525" style="s2"> Chimpanzees who only looked at each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.175" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2"> Developed to human</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.175" end="00:31:39.775" style="s2"> We all have a faculty called consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.975" end="00:31:41.475" style="s2"> It took a long time</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.475" end="00:31:43.050" style="s2"> Really long</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.050" end="00:31:44.950" style="s2"> And it must have gone through many stages in the development process</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.350" end="00:31:47.700" style="s2"> I really like a point of Jean Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.175" end="00:31:49.150" style="s2"> He is a developmental psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.150" end="00:31:53.775" style="s2"> He insisted that before children understand concepts</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.800" end="00:31:56.325" style="s2"> To be able to practice and dramatize these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.900" end="00:32:00.650" style="s2"> Merlin Donald is a psychologist at Queen&#39;s University</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.650" end="00:32:03.800" style="s2"> Based on this point of view, I have written a few interesting books</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.800" end="00:32:05.500" style="s2"> The book discusses how imitation</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.500" end="00:32:07.825" style="s2"> The important role played by human development of advanced cognition</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.375" end="00:32:10.700" style="s2"> This view is that we put our ideas into practice</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.700" end="00:32:12.500" style="s2"> We abstract the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.500" end="00:32:14.525" style="s2"> And make it clear before</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.525" end="00:32:16.275" style="s2"> This is a very strong point</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:18.800" style="s2"> I can&#39;t think of any better explanation</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.175" end="00:32:21.250" style="s2"> If you observe the children, you will understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:23.050" style="s2"> Think about it when the children play house</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.775" end="00:32:26.225" style="s2"> What are they doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.250" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2"> Children will play the role of father or mother</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.125" end="00:32:32.000" style="s2"> The interesting point here is</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.000" end="00:32:33.950" style="s2"> You will think this is too cute too</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.950" end="00:32:35.125" style="s2"> This little girl is imitating her mother</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.375" end="00:32:36.325" style="s2"> But not really</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.925" end="00:32:38.150" style="s2"> It&#39;s not like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.475" end="00:32:40.475" style="s2"> When your child imitates you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.475" end="00:32:41.325" style="s2"> Actually quite annoying</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.775" end="00:32:44.075" style="s2"> You move your arms and they follow you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.475" end="00:32:46.375" style="s2"> If you move your head, they still follow</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.800" end="00:32:49.900" style="s2"> No one likes this kind of direct imitation</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.150" end="00:32:52.600" style="s2"> But this is not what children do when they play</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.075" end="00:32:54.875" style="s2"> In fact, they observe the mother</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.625" end="00:32:58.875" style="s2"> Behavior in countless instantiation scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.550" end="00:33:00.900" style="s2"> And extract from it</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.900" end="00:33:03.375" style="s2"> A spirit called &quot;mother&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:05.550" style="s2"> This is the mother</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.550" end="00:33:07.425" style="s2"> Image in a variety of specific behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.775" end="00:33:10.600" style="s2"> Children internalize this model</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.600" end="00:33:13.625" style="s2"> And express it in the abstract world</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.825" end="00:33:15.150" style="s2"> It is very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.400" end="00:33:17.925" style="s2"> You actually did this when you played Jiajia</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.950" end="00:33:20.350" style="s2"> Or when playing tea and taking care of your doll</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.625" end="00:33:23.425" style="s2"> It’s not that you saw your mother taking care of a doll</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.700" end="00:33:24.900" style="s2"> That&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.175" end="00:33:26.475" style="s2"> But you have enough wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.475" end="00:33:29.800" style="s2"> To extract this concept and visualize it</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.100" end="00:33:31.850" style="s2"> There is no doubt that this child</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.875" end="00:33:34.200" style="s2"> Working hard to achieve this ideal</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.200" end="00:33:37.513" style="s2"> She didn&#39;t set the doll on fire</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.775" end="00:33:40.725" style="s2"> Of course it’s not like this</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.725" end="00:33:43.775" style="s2"> Generally we don’t encourage children to do this</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.650" end="00:33:48.275" style="s2"> So you can see this ability in children</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.450" end="00:33:52.425" style="s2"> And we also know</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.425" end="00:33:54.150" style="s2"> If the child does not to a large extent</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.150" end="00:33:55.700" style="s2"> To participate in this dramatic and hypothetical game</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.200" end="00:33:58.500" style="s2"> They cannot socialize properly</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.600" end="00:34:02.575" style="s2"> This is indeed a key factor in developing self-understanding</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.575" end="00:34:06.525" style="s2"> It can also help individuals develop the ability to get along with others</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.100" end="00:34:08.350" style="s2"> When you were young</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.350" end="00:34:09.900" style="s2"> Especially when he is about four years old</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.100" end="00:34:13.900" style="s2"> You build a shared virtual world with the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.600" end="00:34:16.275" style="s2"> For example, we played house together</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.625" end="00:34:20.050" style="s2"> Then you are in that shared virtual world</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.050" end="00:34:21.500" style="s2"> To play a shared role</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.175" end="00:34:24.775" style="s2"> This is a very advanced form of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.775" end="00:34:26.175" style="s2"> very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.500" end="00:34:28.400" style="s2"> This is the same thing I have observed and Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.400" end="00:34:32.825" style="s2"> Jung Floyd and Merlin Donald</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.075" end="00:34:35.575" style="s2"> These amazing observers have discovered</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.575" end="00:34:37.175" style="s2"> How cognition develops</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.350" end="00:34:40.200" style="s2"> They are very aware of this concrete imitation</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.200" end="00:34:43.425" style="s2"> And dramatic abstraction forms the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.425" end="00:34:46.975" style="s2"> So that more advanced abstract cognition can emerge from it</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.025" end="00:34:49.275" style="s2"> How could it not be this explanation</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.275" end="00:34:52.200" style="s2"> Obviously before we develop a complete mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.200" end="00:34:54.550" style="s2"> We mainly rely on the body</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:34:56.325" style="s2"> So long before we could understand certain ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.325" end="00:34:57.850" style="s2"> Can put these concepts into practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.025" end="00:35:00.475" style="s2"> Just like chimpanzees will practice the following concepts</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.475" end="00:35:03.700" style="s2"> If you are the chimpanzee leader</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.700" end="00:35:05.400" style="s2"> Your behavior must be sensible</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.400" end="00:35:07.400" style="s2"> Otherwise you will be torn to pieces</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.850" end="00:35:08.975" style="s2"> You can also observe from the wolf</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.975" end="00:35:11.275" style="s2"> When wolves fight for power</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.950" end="00:35:13.350" style="s2"> They will blow their hair at each other</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.350" end="00:35:14.100" style="s2"> Make yourself look huge</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.575" end="00:35:16.325" style="s2"> Will growl and bark</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.325" end="00:35:17.800" style="s2"> Will become very vicious</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:20.025" style="s2"> The inferior wolf will turn his body over to show weakness</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.025" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2"> Put your neck back up, body language like this is to show</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.375" end="00:35:23.550" style="s2"> &quot;Yes, I&#39;m so useless</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.550" end="00:35:25.700" style="s2"> &quot;You can kill me if you want.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.975" end="00:35:28.075" style="s2"> The wolf in the dominant position will say</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.325" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2"> &quot;Yes, you know you are pretty useless</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:32.250" style="s2"> &quot;I can tear your throat open but tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.250" end="00:35:34.600" style="s2"> &quot;We might use you when we hunt moose</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.900" end="00:35:36.450" style="s2"> &quot;So I will spare your life&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.775" end="00:35:40.475" style="s2"> They don’t think like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.075" end="00:35:42.950" style="s2"> They don’t have such thinking ability</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.950" end="00:35:45.175" style="s2"> But they put this idea into practice as a mode of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.575" end="00:35:48.550" style="s2"> If you are an anthropologist or behaviorist</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.825" end="00:35:50.300" style="s2"> Go and observe the behavior of the wolf</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.650" end="00:35:54.625" style="s2"> You would say they seem to act according to the law</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.175" end="00:35:57.150" style="s2"> I usually get confused about this because I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.175" end="00:36:01.353" style="s2"> Are there rules for wolves?</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.353" end="00:36:04.748" style="s2"> The so-called law of law is when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.748" end="00:36:06.600" style="s2"> What is constructed when accurately expressing a behavior pattern</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.175" end="00:36:09.125" style="s2"> We observe a stable behavior pattern</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.275" end="00:36:11.475" style="s2"> Then express it accurately, which is called the law</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.675" end="00:36:13.350" style="s2"> But it’s not a rule for wolves</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.475" end="00:36:15.525" style="s2"> That&#39;s just a stable behavior pattern</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.675" end="00:36:20.250" style="s2"> We behave like wolves or chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.100" end="00:36:25.325" style="s2"> Has lasted for tens of millions of years or even hundreds of millions of years</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.325" end="00:36:27.325" style="s2"> Until we have the ability</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.350" end="00:36:29.975" style="s2"> To change our behavior pattern</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.975" end="00:36:32.975" style="s2"> Tell it with stories or images</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.150" end="00:36:35.400" style="s2"> We can express it precisely as a set of moral codes</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.400" end="00:36:39.150" style="s2"> It took longer</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.375" end="00:36:41.350" style="s2"> I spent a long time explaining these</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.350" end="00:36:43.375" style="s2"> I know some of them I have talked about before</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.375" end="00:36:44.275" style="s2"> But these are really important</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.750" end="00:36:47.450" style="s2"> Some people are putting pressure</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.675" end="00:36:51.700" style="s2"> Especially those social constructivists</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.175" end="00:36:54.625" style="s2"> They think the existing moral system is random</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.850" end="00:36:59.325" style="s2"> Morality is relative human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.600" end="00:37:01.350" style="s2"> There is no fundamental biological basis</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.350" end="00:37:03.300" style="s2"> Ethics</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.700" end="00:37:06.125" style="s2"> First of all I think this is very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.125" end="00:37:08.125" style="s2"> Because this theory means what you want people to become</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.125" end="00:37:09.675" style="s2"> What a person can become</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.675" end="00:37:12.150" style="s2"> You better be careful with people who have such thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:14.550" style="s2"> Secondly, there is too much evidence</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.550" end="00:37:16.250" style="s2"> Explain that this view is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.575" end="00:37:18.650" style="s2"> We really shouldn&#39;t think like this anymore</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.100" end="00:37:22.150" style="s2"> This is why I’m from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.150" end="00:37:23.725" style="s2"> Part of the reason to criticize this view</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.900" end="00:37:26.975" style="s2"> There is growing evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.975" end="00:37:33.075" style="s2"> Moral and ethical standards are at least the most important ones</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:36.725" style="s2"> They have not only evolved and will be</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.725" end="00:37:38.650" style="s2"> Reemerged in children’s dramatic games</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.575" end="00:37:41.025" style="s2"> We have to take this seriously</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:45.475" style="s2"> Part of what we are doing now</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.650" end="00:37:55.850" style="s2"> There is a concept like this, at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.850" end="00:37:57.600" style="s2"> The Father Go and Let the Son</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.825" end="00:38:00.075" style="s2"> From the chaos to generate an indwellable order</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.425" end="00:38:03.600" style="s2"> At the same time I also think there may be</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.600" end="00:38:05.725" style="s2"> Closer to the real situation</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.300" end="00:38:09.825" style="s2"> There is an interesting point about men</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.775" end="00:38:13.625" style="s2"> Men are more criminal than women</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.375" end="00:38:17.600" style="s2"> This does not seem to be sociocultural</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.800" end="00:38:18.825" style="s2"> Part of the reason is that men’s criminal impulses</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.400" end="00:38:21.600" style="s2"> Peak testosterone secretion at around 14 years old</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.675" end="00:38:22.950" style="s2"> This impulse will rise quickly</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.275" end="00:38:27.150" style="s2"> And stay active until around 27 years old</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.050" end="00:38:29.650" style="s2"> The standard penalty theory says so</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.750" end="00:38:31.250" style="s2"> If you don’t know, let me explain</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.500" end="00:38:33.000" style="s2"> Suppose there is such a habitual offender</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.000" end="00:38:34.550" style="s2"> He keeps getting into trouble</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.725" end="00:38:36.300" style="s2"> Then you can put him in jail until he is 28 years old and then release him.</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.875" end="00:38:39.125" style="s2"> It&#39;s not that you are going to reform him or something</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.875" end="00:38:42.200" style="s2"> Only after he was 28, his passion for crime disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.775" end="00:38:45.350" style="s2"> Because his criminal impulse curve peaked around 15</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.575" end="00:38:48.850" style="s2"> And then began to decline around 27 years old and disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.125" end="00:38:53.250" style="s2"> By the way, men usually get married at this age</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.600" end="00:38:54.600" style="s2"> Settled and stabilized</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.900" end="00:38:57.875" style="s2"> It&#39;s also interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.875" end="00:39:01.725" style="s2"> The development of the male creativity curve is the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.125" end="00:39:04.650" style="s2"> The curve peaks when testosterone begins to secrete</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.025" end="00:39:06.925" style="s2"> And then began to decline around 27</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.325" end="00:39:08.925" style="s2"> The two curves are very, very close</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.300" end="00:39:10.925" style="s2"> This is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.450" end="00:39:13.575" style="s2"> The part about creativity</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.575" end="00:39:15.300" style="s2"> I am very interested</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.300" end="00:39:19.100" style="s2"> Because in all respects youth is the source of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.525" end="00:39:23.175" style="s2"> Look at this sentence carefully</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.725" end="00:39:26.525" style="s2"> If you strip it away from its religious context</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.625" end="00:39:30.500" style="s2"> You will see it is talking about older people</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.625" end="00:39:34.250" style="s2"> Use young people to generate innovative ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.250" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2"> And use it to update the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:36.550" style="s2"> That&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.575" end="00:39:40.275" style="s2"> We don’t know how many inventions and discoveries humans have</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.275" end="00:39:43.075" style="s2"> By children and teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:45.475" style="s2"> Found by the blind cat and dead mouse</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.150" end="00:39:50.800" style="s2"> Because young people are more adventurous</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.800" end="00:39:53.650" style="s2"> Less restricted by their existing knowledge structure</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.075" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2"> They will not be so conservative</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:39:58.700" style="s2"> So I think it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.850" end="00:40:03.748" style="s2"> And very important</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.875" end="00:40:08.475" style="s2"> It also means that if you are a father</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.225" end="00:40:11.625" style="s2"> There is such a meaning in it</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.650" end="00:40:13.325" style="s2"> This is one thing you should encourage your son to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.625" end="00:40:17.875" style="s2"> Because the father acts as an encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.050" end="00:40:19.500" style="s2"> It is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.550" end="00:40:20.775" style="s2"> And encouragement means</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.775" end="00:40:24.550" style="s2"> Go out, kid, face the unknown chaos</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.625" end="00:40:27.125" style="s2"> And the chaos hidden beneath everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.300" end="00:40:29.475" style="s2"> Go fight it because you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.125" end="00:40:31.700" style="s2"> You are as powerful as chaos itself</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.700" end="00:40:34.100" style="s2"> You have to recognize this and do something useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.525" end="00:40:35.400" style="s2"> Make your life better</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.400" end="00:40:36.725" style="s2"> And make people around me better</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.450" end="00:40:37.975" style="s2"> You can do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.575" end="00:40:41.975" style="s2"> This is what you should tell young men</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.650" end="00:40:44.300" style="s2"> What to say to young women is more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.300" end="00:40:46.900" style="s2"> Because they are facing</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.900" end="00:40:47.825" style="s2"> More complicated situation</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.200" end="00:40:50.225" style="s2"> Their lives are more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.300" end="00:40:54.475" style="s2"> But it&#39;s absolutely correct to tell your son that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.600" end="00:40:57.600" style="s2"> I recently discovered one thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.600" end="00:41:00.250" style="s2"> Especially since the seven or eight months since I gave the lecture</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.250" end="00:41:02.075" style="s2"> I found that my audience is mostly young men</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.000" end="00:41:08.650" style="s2"> I told them a lot about truth and responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.900" end="00:41:10.975" style="s2"> I think they are &quot;generating order from chaos&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.975" end="00:41:12.550" style="s2"> The factors behind</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.050" end="00:41:17.175" style="s2"> I see young men eager for words like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.475" end="00:41:19.075" style="s2"> These words are different from the topic of &quot;rights&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.925" end="00:41:21.025" style="s2"> Far apart</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.025" end="00:41:22.425" style="s2"> It is the counterpart of &quot;right&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.400" end="00:41:27.925" style="s2"> Life is difficult and chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.925" end="00:41:29.900" style="s2"> Definitely a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.075" end="00:41:33.325" style="s2"> No wonder you can choose to shrink in front of life</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.625" end="00:41:36.750" style="s2"> Because life is fatal and not child&#39;s play</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.525" end="00:41:39.575" style="s2"> Or you can face it calmly</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.900" end="00:41:41.075" style="s2"> Try to make some changes</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.225" end="00:41:42.750" style="s2"> Which option do you think is better</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:44.125" style="s2"> If you tell someone</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.125" end="00:41:45.325" style="s2"> You can do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.650" end="00:41:46.775" style="s2"> This is how people are</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.050" end="00:41:49.750" style="s2"> If you cheer up and face it bravely</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.950" end="00:41:52.850" style="s2"> You will find out soon</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.850" end="00:41:54.100" style="s2"> You can really do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.075" end="00:41:58.900" style="s2"> I think this is a very core religious message</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.100" end="00:42:02.975" style="s2"> And is deeply rooted in this idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.775" end="00:42:06.250" style="s2"> This is the point I have been conveying to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.975" end="00:42:10.025" style="s2"> The knowledge itself is also generated like this</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:14.225" style="s2"> There are many unknowns</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:16.375" style="s2"> You know nothing about them</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.875" end="00:42:18.275" style="s2"> Generally when you encounter something unknown</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.925" end="00:42:20.150" style="s2"> Your first reaction is never thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.025" end="00:42:22.025" style="s2"> But with an expression of horror like this</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.575" end="00:42:27.175" style="s2"> This is your first reaction to something absolutely unknown</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.725" end="00:42:29.675" style="s2"> What you encounter is beyond the scope of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.975" end="00:42:30.600" style="s2"> The unknown scares you</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2"> It is beyond your understanding</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:34.550" style="s2"> You can&#39;t perceive or understand it</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.575" end="00:42:35.700" style="s2"> But you still have to face it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.050" end="00:42:37.925" style="s2"> The way you face it is to stay still</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.500" end="00:42:41.000" style="s2"> The snake monster in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.350" end="00:42:43.050" style="s2"> That&#39;s how to deal with children</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.275" end="00:42:44.500" style="s2"> As soon as I see the snake demon children, they can’t move</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.025" end="00:42:48.725" style="s2"> This is the terrifying snake of chaos hidden beneath all things</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.950" end="00:42:52.150" style="s2"> You can&#39;t move when you see it because you are a prey</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.375" end="00:42:54.075" style="s2"> But while you are afraid, you are also curious</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.875" end="00:43:00.450" style="s2"> This is the first stage of your contact with the absolute unknown</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:03.875" style="s2"> A mixed emotion frozen in fear and curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:06.750" style="s2"> This is also reflected in the story about dragons</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.125" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2"> Dragons are terrible creatures living underneath</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.600" end="00:43:11.050" style="s2"> It is entrenched with gold and maidens</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.375" end="00:43:14.500" style="s2"> This behavior is also very strange for reptiles</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.975" end="00:43:18.300" style="s2"> But this is a symbolic representation</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.500" end="00:43:21.900" style="s2"> It represents the predatory nature of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.975" end="00:43:25.175" style="s2"> But the unknown can also</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:27.725" style="s2"> Generate new information</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.350" end="00:43:31.525" style="s2"> You can think of it as a characteristic of humans</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.525" end="00:43:32.725" style="s2"> Because we are prey</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.300" end="00:43:35.425" style="s2"> But we are also very adventurous</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.425" end="00:43:37.050" style="s2"> We are very good predators</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.250" end="00:43:39.375" style="s2"> We occupy such a weird cognitive position</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.675" end="00:43:41.225" style="s2"> One thing we learned from this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.475" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2"> If we muster up the courage to face the unknown fear</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:45.600" style="s2"> Although it is frightening</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:48.825" style="s2"> But you will continue to get huge rewards</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.775" end="00:43:54.200" style="s2"> This truth is too real</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.625" end="00:43:56.700" style="s2"> Have such a view</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.825" end="00:43:59.300" style="s2"> At the beginning of time, God extracted the inhabitable order from the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.300" end="00:44:03.050" style="s2"> There is a metaphor under this concept</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.050" end="00:44:08.300" style="s2"> This metaphor is a very old concept</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.750" end="00:44:11.575" style="s2"> God has encountered a monster like Leviathan</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.050" end="00:44:15.075" style="s2"> This is a chaotic beast like a python</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.150" end="00:44:17.075" style="s2"> Leviathan is one of the commonly used names in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.150" end="00:44:21.700" style="s2"> In addition to Leviathan, there is another called Behemoth</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.900" end="00:44:22.925" style="s2"> Yes it&#39;s the name</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.625" end="00:44:26.600" style="s2"> There is such a point of view that should come from</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.625" end="00:44:30.475" style="s2"> Mesopotamians think that whether God is</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.525" end="00:44:32.725" style="s2"> The image of the Father or the Son</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.725" end="00:44:36.275" style="s2"> He is the beast facing the terrible unknown chaos</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.450" end="00:44:38.975" style="s2"> And cut it to pieces</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.975" end="00:44:41.950" style="s2"> And will distribute its fragments to the people to raise them</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:44.175" style="s2"> Here you can also see a metaphor of hunting in it</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.225" end="00:44:45.250" style="s2"> But it’s actually more profound</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.875" end="00:44:51.050" style="s2"> So it’s absolutely unknown</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.050" end="00:44:53.125" style="s2"> It&#39;s something you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.125" end="00:44:54.600" style="s2"> The unknown is something outside of your campfire lighting</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.600" end="00:44:57.950" style="s2"> The longer it is, the thing outside the tree</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.950" end="00:45:00.075" style="s2"> Because we used to live on trees</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.325" end="00:45:02.100" style="s2"> It lurks somewhere you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.125" end="00:45:03.000" style="s2"> What&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.250" end="00:45:05.300" style="s2"> Crocodile snake raptor</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.300" end="00:45:07.600" style="s2"> Big cats</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.650" end="00:45:08.750" style="s2"> All the creatures that can eat you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.050" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2"> But go out and find out what is useful to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:14.725" style="s2"> Maybe you didn&#39;t kill the snake when you went out</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.725" end="00:45:16.375" style="s2"> But gave the snake nest</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.950" end="00:45:18.350" style="s2"> You will become very popular soon</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:19.500" style="s2"> This is what you deserve</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.675" end="00:45:24.450" style="s2"> Put it this way, it will boost your chances of reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.575" end="00:45:26.725" style="s2"> And we are the descendants of these people</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.900" end="00:45:28.675" style="s2"> We will have</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.675" end="00:45:30.075" style="s2"> The concept of &quot;the world is built like this&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.075" end="00:45:33.275" style="s2"> This is deeply rooted in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.275" end="00:45:36.925" style="s2"> Very, very deeply below the surface cognition</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.150" end="00:45:38.775" style="s2"> Deeply embedded in our limbic system</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.975" end="00:45:40.350" style="s2"> This is a very old part of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.350" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2"> Existed for 60 million years</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.425" end="00:45:44.325" style="s2"> Even billions of years or more</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.325" end="00:45:46.175" style="s2"> It is a very very old brain structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.675" end="00:45:47.875" style="s2"> So the first thing we do is</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.875" end="00:45:51.175" style="s2"> We go to meet the unknown world</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:53.650" style="s2"> The way to meet with</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.650" end="00:45:56.350" style="s2"> How is God described in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:45:58.850" style="s2"> At the beginning of time, the order that can be accommodated is extracted from the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.850" end="00:46:01.725" style="s2"> The approach taken is the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.025" end="00:46:05.750" style="s2"> I won’t tell you about other things for now</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.100" end="00:46:07.875" style="s2"> So we will first practice</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.300" end="00:46:12.325" style="s2"> Then we observe how others practice</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.350" end="00:46:14.625" style="s2"> Then you start to describe them</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.675" end="00:46:15.950" style="s2"> This is a story right</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.050" end="00:46:17.325" style="s2"> Maybe you still admire some stories</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.400" end="00:46:20.150" style="s2"> After a while you have collected a lot of stories</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.300" end="00:46:21.850" style="s2"> Then you can describe what they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.875" end="00:46:23.500" style="s2"> Can you describe them precisely as a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.500" end="00:46:27.000" style="s2"> This is what Nietzsche first summed up</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.000" end="00:46:30.100" style="s2"> Because before Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.275" end="00:46:31.675" style="s2"> He took the lead in achieving many achievements</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.675" end="00:46:32.800" style="s2"> Really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.350" end="00:46:34.300" style="s2"> Before Nietzsche some people thought</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.250" end="00:46:36.475" style="s2"> You think first and then act</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.225" end="00:46:38.650" style="s2"> Many people love to think so</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.125" end="00:46:41.350" style="s2"> But you know this is obviously pure bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.350" end="00:46:44.450" style="s2"> Because you can&#39;t imagine how impulsive you can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.475" end="00:46:46.275" style="s2"> You often start acting without thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.525" end="00:46:48.200" style="s2"> Although sometimes the effect is pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.325" end="00:46:50.650" style="s2"> &quot;Seeing first and then thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.675" end="00:46:52.225" style="s2"> Is the idea of ​​&quot;do something next&quot; true?</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.350" end="00:46:55.350" style="s2"> I&#39;m not like this anyway</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.950" end="00:46:58.275" style="s2"> As far as I know no one is like this</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.275" end="00:46:59.700" style="s2"> Actually people don’t do it at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.725" end="00:47:02.125" style="s2"> Especially when people are very emotional, they will act first</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:04.425" style="s2"> Nietzsche clearly expressed a point</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.500" end="00:47:07.925" style="s2"> Our thinking for thousands of years is</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.925" end="00:47:10.500" style="s2"> Conceived from our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.525" end="00:47:13.900" style="s2"> When philosophers put forward these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.925" end="00:47:17.125" style="s2"> They are not creating new ideas</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.125" end="00:47:20.625" style="s2"> They are just telling stories about human nature</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.475" end="00:47:22.450" style="s2"> These ideas already exist</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.450" end="00:47:23.900" style="s2"> Already rooted in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.075" end="00:47:25.925" style="s2"> Has already appeared in our behavior pattern</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.325" end="00:47:31.050" style="s2"> Nietzsche is a genius</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.050" end="00:47:36.325" style="s2"> This is just one of his countless extremely genius discoveries</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.725" end="00:47:39.750" style="s2"> You can think so too</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.100" end="00:47:42.075" style="s2"> First you encounter the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.075" end="00:47:43.900" style="s2"> And you act on it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.900" end="00:47:45.725" style="s2"> Then you will dream about your behavioral reaction</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.275" end="00:47:47.850" style="s2"> The same when you watch a movie</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.350" end="00:47:49.925" style="s2"> You will talk about it later</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.425" end="00:47:53.175" style="s2"> Of course once you start talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:54.375" style="s2"> This will in turn affect your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.375" end="00:47:56.075" style="s2"> Your dreams will also affect your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.225" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2"> Not all causality is one-way</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:02.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s not like that they circulate each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.575" end="00:48:05.500" style="s2"> But it still originated from the unknown through our bodies and imagination</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.500" end="00:48:07.750" style="s2"> Expressed by us</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.750" end="00:48:11.375" style="s2"> This is the basic mode of the generation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.075" end="00:48:15.575" style="s2"> You can easily see some clues from the perspective of evolutionary interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.575" end="00:48:17.550" style="s2"> You have the actual body first, right</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.075" end="00:48:19.550" style="s2"> Then you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.550" end="00:48:21.575" style="s2"> Imagination is the abstract expression of the flesh</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.575" end="00:48:22.950" style="s2"> Language</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.825" end="00:48:25.550" style="s2"> This is how we step by step</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.550" end="00:48:27.525" style="s2"> Because of our ability to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.100" end="00:48:29.400" style="s2"> Before we could speak</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.825" end="00:48:30.900" style="s2"> At least in theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.825" end="00:48:39.775" style="s2"> This is an illustration from my book &quot;Map of Meaning&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.100" end="00:48:43.475" style="s2"> This is unknown</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.475" end="00:48:44.975" style="s2"> Basic representation</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.375" end="00:48:46.250" style="s2"> It is semi-spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.600" end="00:48:48.575" style="s2"> Because the Rinku part looks like a bird</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.575" end="00:48:50.125" style="s2"> It is also semi-materialized</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.200" end="00:48:52.925" style="s2"> Because the parts on the ground are like snakes</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.475" end="00:48:56.475" style="s2"> When you don&#39;t know what&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.500" end="00:48:57.725" style="s2"> This is what you think it will look like</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.875" end="00:48:59.775" style="s2"> When you face the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.825" end="00:49:01.200" style="s2"> Your body will respond naturally</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.525" end="00:49:04.450" style="s2"> You know very well that when you are alone at night</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.525" end="00:49:07.600" style="s2"> Maybe for some reason you are a little upset</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.625" end="00:49:08.800" style="s2"> Maybe it’s because you just watched a horror movie</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.000" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2"> It happens that there are some strange noises in other rooms</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.550" end="00:49:12.275" style="s2"> It&#39;s dark outside</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:13.675" style="s2"> You&#39;ll know if you try it someday</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.325" end="00:49:15.300" style="s2"> Then you are so nervous</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.875" end="00:49:17.675" style="s2"> Then you think about or turn on the light</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.675" end="00:49:18.725" style="s2"> See what&#39;s going on in the room</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.725" end="00:49:19.600" style="s2"> Don&#39;t do this yet</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.600" end="00:49:20.825" style="s2"> You just need to open the door a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.875" end="00:49:21.575" style="s2"> Then put your hand in and try</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.125" end="00:49:24.100" style="s2"> Look at your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.350" end="00:49:26.075" style="s2"> Will tell you what&#39;s in the room</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.175" end="00:49:29.100" style="s2"> Then you can immediately remember when you were three years old</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.175" end="00:49:30.500" style="s2"> Lying alone in bed facing the dark fear</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.100" end="00:49:34.050" style="s2"> I recently read a book about dragons</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.050" end="00:49:38.075" style="s2"> There is a very interesting hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.475" end="00:49:40.675" style="s2"> The author did such a job</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.925" end="00:49:42.450" style="s2"> Sorry i don&#39;t remember his name</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.025" end="00:49:45.900" style="s2"> He tracked the universality of the image of &quot;dragon&quot; worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.975" end="00:49:49.075" style="s2"> It turns out that its universality is extremely surprising</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.225" end="00:49:55.225" style="s2"> He thinks it actually gathers predators of various primates</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.900" end="00:49:59.525" style="s2"> Predator is a strange category</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.525" end="00:50:02.275" style="s2"> There are crocodiles and lions inside</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.550" end="00:50:03.525" style="s2"> But they will eat you</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.525" end="00:50:04.300" style="s2"> Have nothing in common</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.600" end="00:50:05.975" style="s2"> So it is a functional category</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:09.375" style="s2"> This picture is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.375" end="00:50:11.275" style="s2"> Image representation of the functional category of predator</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.550" end="00:50:13.000" style="s2"> His predator theory is like this</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.300" end="00:50:14.075" style="s2"> If you are a monkey</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.075" end="00:50:16.525" style="s2"> Maybe a bird will kill you like an eagle</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.675" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2"> If it’s not an eagle, it’s okay to assume it’s a cat</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.225" end="00:50:25.575" style="s2"> Because they will climb trees and give you a fatal blow</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.800" end="00:50:26.875" style="s2"> If it’s not a cat</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.875" end="00:50:28.550" style="s2"> You come under the tree</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.575" end="00:50:29.225" style="s2"> The snake will kill you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.225" end="00:50:30.700" style="s2"> Or snakes can climb the tree</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.700" end="00:50:32.375" style="s2"> Snakes kind of like climbing trees, the result is the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.825" end="00:50:38.125" style="s2"> Basically, you can think of it as the archetype of &quot;tree cat snake&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.625" end="00:50:39.875" style="s2"> Or &quot;tree cat and snake bird&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.875" end="00:50:43.375" style="s2"> These are definitely things you want to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.375" end="00:50:44.900" style="s2"> You never want to run into any of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.100" end="00:50:47.950" style="s2"> In addition, the dragon can breathe fire</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.025" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2"> This is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.100" style="s2"> Because fire is man’s best friend</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.100" end="00:50:53.600" style="s2"> Also the worst enemy</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.900" end="00:50:55.600" style="s2"> We have learned to use fire proficiently for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.625" end="00:50:57.425" style="s2"> It may be 200 or more than 3 million years old</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.450" end="00:51:00.350" style="s2"> There is a man named Richard Langham</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.475" end="00:51:01.300" style="s2"> It should be Langham</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.600" end="00:51:03.250" style="s2"> He recently wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.175" end="00:51:04.875" style="s2"> I should remember his last name correctly</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.375" end="00:51:07.800" style="s2"> He wrote a book about when humans learned to cook</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.200" end="00:51:09.700" style="s2"> Humans learned to cook about 2 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.025" end="00:51:14.725" style="s2"> Cooking improves the utilization of food calories</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.150" end="00:51:17.050" style="s2"> Think about what a chimpanzee is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.875" end="00:51:18.750" style="s2"> They look ugly</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.750" end="00:51:20.325" style="s2"> Looks like a large bowling pin</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.425" end="00:51:23.925" style="s2"> Looks very fat and strong and short</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.925" end="00:51:28.325" style="s2"> Their intestines are almost three hundred miles long</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.325" end="00:51:31.125" style="s2"> Because they have to digest the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.750" end="00:51:32.900" style="s2"> You can try to run into the forest</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.150" end="00:51:34.700" style="s2"> Sitting and chewing leaves for a day</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.825" end="00:51:35.825" style="s2"> See what happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.425" end="00:51:38.150" style="s2"> There is no heat in the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.550" end="00:51:40.275" style="s2"> So chimps need to spend every day</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.925" end="00:51:44.000" style="s2"> I remember it was almost eight hours for chewing</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.375" end="00:51:47.500" style="s2"> Because what they eat has no nutritional value</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.500" end="00:51:49.475" style="s2"> So they need a huge digestive system</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.475" end="00:51:51.625" style="s2"> To extract anything valuable from it</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.875" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2"> However, at a certain moment, human beings suddenly opened up and thought that they couldn&#39;t bear it anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:55.150" style="s2"> Let&#39;s cook something to eat</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.400" end="00:51:57.050" style="s2"> So we traded the digestive system for the brain</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.250" end="00:51:59.000" style="s2"> How successful</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.000" end="00:52:01.275" style="s2"> I think it also makes us more attractive</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.750" end="00:52:05.950" style="s2"> The point here is this</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.950" end="00:52:08.875" style="s2"> This is the basic prototype of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.925" end="00:52:11.500" style="s2"> I really like St. George&#39;s version of the story about the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.500" end="00:52:12.375" style="s2"> Pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.375" end="00:52:15.375" style="s2"> Saint George lives in a castle</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.375" end="00:52:17.300" style="s2"> This castle is half collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.700" end="00:52:19.500" style="s2"> Partly because of the appearance of the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.800" end="00:52:21.000" style="s2"> This is an immortal dragon</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.000" end="00:52:22.825" style="s2"> It often disturbs everyone</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.025" end="00:52:24.100" style="s2"> This kind of thing always happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.100" end="00:52:26.575" style="s2"> Because the eternal dragon will always be ready</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.575" end="00:52:30.750" style="s2"> Add to our already difficult life</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.075" end="00:52:34.475" style="s2"> Saint George is the hero who bravely faced the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.775" end="00:52:37.150" style="s2"> He freed the girl from the claws of the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.175" end="00:52:39.825" style="s2"> I think this is a pretty straightforward story</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.825" end="00:52:43.651" style="s2"> It&#39;s about the sexual attraction of masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.651" end="00:52:45.825" style="s2"> This masculine person has the courage to face the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.075" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2"> In my opinion this is a very obvious biological characterization</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.575" end="00:52:52.825" style="s2"> This is a very old story</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.300" end="00:52:55.275" style="s2"> May be the oldest story we can record</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.275" end="00:52:57.900" style="s2"> The Creation Epic of Mesopotamian Mythology</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.900" end="00:52:58.600" style="s2"> &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.975" end="00:53:01.325" style="s2"> Basically telling the story</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.950" end="00:53:07.000" style="s2"> I bet some of you movie lovers</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.000" end="00:53:08.750" style="s2"> Especially those obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.750" end="00:53:12.425" style="s2"> The kind of fancy superhero movie guy</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.650" end="00:53:14.325" style="s2"> You may be in the past ten years</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.500" end="00:53:16.850" style="s2"> Have watched this St. George&#39;s story hundreds of times</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.100" end="00:53:18.200" style="s2"> And you are not tired of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.375" end="00:53:20.350" style="s2"> Because this is the core story of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.750" end="00:53:22.925" style="s2"> So this is unknown</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.850" end="00:53:26.650" style="s2"> You use your body’s instinct to face it</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.925" end="00:53:28.800" style="s2"> You show existential fear</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.925" end="00:53:31.650" style="s2"> And extreme curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.100" end="00:53:34.825" style="s2"> It’s like the so-called &quot;unknown unknown&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.450" end="00:53:38.150" style="s2"> What is the name of the politician under Bush?</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.050" end="00:53:39.975" style="s2"> By the way Rumsfeld</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.975" end="00:53:42.350" style="s2"> I think the reason this term is so popular is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.350" end="00:53:43.600" style="s2"> Rumsfeld interprets this prototype very well</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.975" end="00:53:45.175" style="s2"> &quot;Unknown unknown&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.175" end="00:53:46.375" style="s2"> And &quot;known unknown&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.675" end="00:53:48.300" style="s2"> The dragon here belongs to the &quot;unknown unknown&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.775" end="00:53:50.375" style="s2"> You have to know that you are facing</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.375" end="00:53:51.275" style="s2"> How to react when &quot;unknown unknown&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.275" end="00:53:52.300" style="s2"> Because it might give you a fatal blow</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.225" end="00:53:54.425" style="s2"> You can&#39;t use ignorance as an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.425" end="00:53:55.300" style="s2"> Because it is fatal</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.425" end="00:53:56.300" style="s2"> It won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.675" end="00:53:59.075" style="s2"> Human beings are such a creature when they are at a loss</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.075" end="00:54:00.600" style="s2"> They have to know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.400" end="00:54:02.625" style="s2"> This is contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.625" end="00:54:04.500" style="s2"> We must prepare for everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.025" end="00:54:06.000" style="s2"> We are always on guard</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:07.100" style="s2"> Get ready to face everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.100" end="00:54:08.375" style="s2"> This is a kind of high tension</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.650" end="00:54:10.050" style="s2"> But in a state of concentration</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.325" end="00:54:12.725" style="s2"> And it can strengthen your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:16.025" style="s2"> This kind of human reaction loop may be permanently opened</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.025" end="00:54:17.800" style="s2"> Because we know that people are mortal</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:19.300" style="s2"> No other animal knows this</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.700" end="00:54:21.050" style="s2"> Sometimes i feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.425" end="00:54:24.250" style="s2"> Our stress response circuit is always open</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:25.875" style="s2"> This explains partly</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.875" end="00:54:26.850" style="s2"> The reason for our strong consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.175" end="00:54:28.975" style="s2"> So you will encounter &quot;unknown unknown&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.975" end="00:54:32.550" style="s2"> Then you will have the real world</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.550" end="00:54:34.550" style="s2"> The unknown</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.550" end="00:54:38.750" style="s2"> For example, some mysteries in your partner</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.750" end="00:54:40.075" style="s2"> You will feel this way when you argue</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.075" end="00:54:42.100" style="s2"> who are you</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.075" end="00:54:44.425" style="s2"> You are not completely unknown to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.425" end="00:54:45.825" style="s2"> Because i still know you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.825" end="00:54:46.800" style="s2"> But now what you show</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.800" end="00:54:49.300" style="s2"> Completely foreign to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.075" end="00:54:53.825" style="s2"> This part is what we know</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.825" end="00:54:55.150" style="s2"> There are those who know</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.425" end="00:54:57.875" style="s2"> The known things here are given a symbolic representation</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.225" end="00:54:59.500" style="s2"> in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.800" end="00:55:02.875" style="s2"> In the form of the patriarchy of the masculine deity</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.900" end="00:55:06.250" style="s2"> And the unknown things you encounter are given a feminine form</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.875" end="00:55:09.225" style="s2"> We will not explain much in depth yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.225" end="00:55:10.600" style="s2"> But if you are interested</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.825" end="00:55:12.375" style="s2"> You can take a look at my &quot;Map of Meaning&quot; lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.375" end="00:55:13.850" style="s2"> You can read this book</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.325" end="00:55:19.000" style="s2"> I think it sums up the religious archetype very well</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.025" end="00:55:20.775" style="s2"> I studied for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.775" end="00:55:23.050" style="s2"> I feel it can be applied to Jung&#39;s ruler</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.250" end="00:55:25.525" style="s2"> It maps well to Joseph Campbell’s theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.525" end="00:55:28.375" style="s2"> But many of Campbell’s theories came from Jung</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.450" end="00:55:33.975" style="s2"> This can also be said from the perspective of biology and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.025" end="00:55:34.875" style="s2"> As far as I know it is like this</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.950" end="00:55:36.675" style="s2"> At least in my judgment</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.125" end="00:55:38.650" style="s2"> There are many examples of cross-validation</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.450" end="00:55:41.975" style="s2"> Okay, let’s go back to the dominant hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.200" end="00:55:43.800" style="s2"> Let&#39;s take a look at this picture</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.300" end="00:55:47.100" style="s2"> You may know that I am very obsessed with lobster</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.300" end="00:55:50.200" style="s2"> Because i found something about it</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.375" end="00:55:52.200" style="s2"> I really felt empowered when I discovered this</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.200" end="00:55:56.775" style="s2"> I have a lot of research on functional neurochemistry</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.775" end="00:55:59.150" style="s2"> Because I have studied alcohol addiction and drug abuse</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.700" end="00:56:01.750" style="s2"> To study alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.750" end="00:56:03.025" style="s2"> You must fully understand the brain</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.025" end="00:56:05.050" style="s2"> Because alcohol can penetrate all parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.200" end="00:56:06.750" style="s2"> It affects every neurochemical system</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.875" end="00:56:08.325" style="s2"> So if you want to study alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.525" end="00:56:11.500" style="s2"> You need general knowledge of neurochemistry</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.800" end="00:56:13.350" style="s2"> I have been studying neurochemistry for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.350" end="00:56:14.950" style="s2"> I am very fascinated by a book</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.525" end="00:56:17.250" style="s2"> The title of the book is &quot;Anxiety Neuropsychology&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.300" end="00:56:17.950" style="s2"> The author is Jeffrey Gray</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.950" end="00:56:21.075" style="s2"> This book is really a genius but it is also very difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.650" end="00:56:23.525" style="s2"> I don’t know how many references are used in this book</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.725" end="00:56:25.725" style="s2"> At least one thousand</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.375" end="00:56:27.825" style="s2"> Gray really read these references</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.200" end="00:56:29.700" style="s2"> Even understood them</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.200" end="00:56:33.050" style="s2"> Then he integrated these references into his book</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.075" end="00:56:33.850" style="s2"> Want to read &quot;Anxiety Neuropsychology&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.850" end="00:56:36.450" style="s2"> You must thoroughly master functional neurochemistry</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.700" end="00:56:41.175" style="s2"> Animal Behavior Motivation and Emotion and Neuroanatomy</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.200" end="00:56:43.775" style="s2"> This book is very difficult to understand but it is really rich in content</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.175" end="00:56:47.675" style="s2"> It took 40 years for psychologists to really understand it</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.800" end="00:56:50.600" style="s2"> One thing I learned in it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.600" end="00:56:53.000" style="s2"> Between human and animal neurochemistry</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.000" end="00:56:55.625" style="s2"> Have strong continuity</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.775" end="00:56:57.100" style="s2"> Really incredible</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.650" end="00:56:59.350" style="s2"> It makes evolution</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.650" end="00:57:02.300" style="s2"> Seems obvious</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.800" end="00:57:04.225" style="s2"> I do think it is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.550" end="00:57:06.575" style="s2"> But there are other reasons I will talk about later</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.825" end="00:57:12.700" style="s2"> I think when the environment is so complex that it exceeds our ability to understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.700" end="00:57:16.375" style="s2"> Random mutation and natural selection are</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:18.900" style="s2"> The only way to solve the problem of how to adapt to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.450" end="00:57:21.525" style="s2"> I think all you can do is produce countless variants</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.550" end="00:57:23.825" style="s2"> Because what will happen next moment is never known</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:27.125" style="s2"> Most of these variants will die because they are failures</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.350" end="00:57:28.575" style="s2"> One of the pair reproduces</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.750" end="00:57:32.225" style="s2"> The surrounding environment is constantly changing like a giant snake</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.225" end="00:57:33.525" style="s2"> You never know what it will do next</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.900" end="00:57:35.100" style="s2"> The best you can do</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.100" end="00:57:37.550" style="s2"> These 30 variants may survive</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.550" end="00:57:39.625" style="s2"> But 28 of them will die</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.175" end="00:57:43.725" style="s2"> For insects, the odds are much higher</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.700" end="00:57:46.175" style="s2"> Let&#39;s talk about lobster</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.175" end="00:57:51.525" style="s2"> They will fight for dominance</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.475" end="00:57:54.625" style="s2"> I think &quot;dominance&quot; is the correct way to understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.675" end="00:57:57.275" style="s2"> Lobsters do not have empathy and sociality</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.325" end="00:57:59.725" style="s2"> It really wins by strength</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.625" end="00:58:02.575" style="s2"> The interesting thing about lobster is</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.175" end="00:58:04.600" style="s2"> When a lobster wins</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.925" end="00:58:06.825" style="s2"> It stretches to appear taller</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.850" end="00:58:09.150" style="s2"> It shows higher because of winning</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.150" end="00:58:10.725" style="s2"> It’s like advertised</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.125" end="00:58:13.100" style="s2"> The neurochemical system that makes it stretch</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.100" end="00:58:15.250" style="s2"> Can affect serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.575" end="00:58:17.725" style="s2"> Do you think who cares what&#39;s the point?</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.925" end="00:58:18.900" style="s2"> I tell you what is the point</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.900" end="00:58:22.525" style="s2"> It is also a chemical substance affected by human antidepressants</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.525" end="00:58:23.825" style="s2"> If a person is depressed</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.850" end="00:58:25.225" style="s2"> Like a defeated lobster</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.225" end="00:58:26.600" style="s2"> Would curl up like this and seem to say</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.600" end="00:58:29.275" style="s2"> I am too weak and the world is too dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.500" end="00:58:30.300" style="s2"> I want to give up fighting</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.550" end="00:58:33.050" style="s2"> You give people an antidepressant and they will hold their heads up</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.325" end="00:58:35.875" style="s2"> Ready to fight the world again</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.225" end="00:58:39.675" style="s2"> If you give a lobster that has lost a fight a dose of serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.200" end="00:58:41.900" style="s2"> They will stretch again and fight again</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.850" end="00:58:46.425" style="s2"> From 350 to 600 million years ago on the time scale of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.425" end="00:58:49.125" style="s2"> We differentiated from creatures like lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.250" end="00:58:51.325" style="s2"> But our neurochemicals are no different</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.800" end="00:58:53.275" style="s2"> This is also the authority hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.275" end="00:58:57.375" style="s2"> Another proof of importance</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.025" end="00:59:01.000" style="s2"> It has survived since the lobster era</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.200" end="00:59:02.675" style="s2"> When the lobster first appeared on earth</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.675" end="00:59:06.300" style="s2"> There is no tree on earth</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.800" end="00:59:09.725" style="s2"> This means these hierarchies that I have been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.950" end="00:59:11.775" style="s2"> Older than the appearance of trees</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.250" end="00:59:17.100" style="s2"> There is a self-evident truth like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.175" end="00:59:19.125" style="s2"> From the perspective of Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.125" end="00:59:22.975" style="s2"> &quot;Reality&quot; is made up of things that last the longest</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.050" end="00:59:24.875" style="s2"> Because it has the longest time</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.875" end="00:59:26.550" style="s2"> To put pressure on natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.025" end="00:59:29.725" style="s2"> We learned that about 60 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.725" end="00:59:32.100" style="s2"> We live in the forest after evolution</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.350" end="00:59:36.325" style="s2"> This is one-tenth the length of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.700" end="00:59:40.100" style="s2"> The evolution of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.100" end="00:59:42.850" style="s2"> Pressure of natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.150" end="00:59:47.275" style="s2"> I think this view is beyond doubt</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.825" end="00:59:49.900" style="s2"> How it did it and what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.900" end="00:59:50.875" style="s2"> These issues can be discussed</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.125" end="00:59:55.250" style="s2"> But this biological continuity is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.475" end="00:59:58.950" style="s2"> This theory is not what I found but what I read</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.325" end="01:00:01.250" style="s2"> The interesting thing is when I review this theory</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.500" end="01:00:03.375" style="s2"> Talked about it with my graduate students</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.425" end="01:00:04.575" style="s2"> I often take them out for breakfast</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.100" end="01:00:07.525" style="s2"> They like to argue very much</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.900" end="01:00:10.550" style="s2"> Always want to be better than others</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.600" end="01:00:11.375" style="s2"> And also very smart</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.575" end="01:00:12.750" style="s2"> Before this becomes a bit annoying</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.850" end="01:00:14.050" style="s2"> In about six months</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.175" end="01:00:15.600" style="s2"> Every time someone does better than others</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.600" end="01:00:18.125" style="s2"> They will hold their heads up and hold their hands in a pliers</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.375" end="01:00:21.750" style="s2"> Really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.425" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2"> It’s amazing that lobsters do this kind of action</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.075" end="01:00:29.150" style="s2"> About Lobster</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.150" end="01:00:31.500" style="s2"> Another interesting thing is</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.900" end="01:00:33.975" style="s2"> Suppose you are a lobster who has been in power for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.975" end="01:00:35.475" style="s2"> But you are a little old</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.475" end="01:00:39.225" style="s2"> There is a young lobster that beats you up and down</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.600" end="01:00:40.975" style="s2"> You will become very depressed</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.125" end="01:00:42.725" style="s2"> Your brain is the ruler&#39;s brain</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.625" end="01:00:45.875" style="s2"> But not very developed because you are just a lobster</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.125" end="01:00:47.225" style="s2"> You lost the fight</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.225" end="01:00:48.100" style="s2"> What will you do</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.375" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2"> the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.350" end="01:00:50.600" style="s2"> Your brain will decline</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.150" end="01:00:52.975" style="s2"> Then you will grow a subordinate brain</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.850" end="01:00:57.125" style="s2"> This is worth thinking about for the following reasons</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.225" end="01:00:57.925" style="s2"> the first</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.975" end="01:01:01.700" style="s2"> If you have suffered a major setback in your life</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.100" end="01:01:03.250" style="s2"> You will know how it feels</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.800" end="01:01:06.875" style="s2"> It seems that life is better than death</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.125" end="01:01:08.125" style="s2"> If lucky</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:09.250" style="s2"> You will be reborn</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.475" end="01:01:11.175" style="s2"> Maybe you will be reborn as another person</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.175" end="01:01:13.625" style="s2"> This is what people with post-traumatic stress disorder experience</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.850" end="01:01:16.925" style="s2"> Their brain undergoes permanent neurological transformation</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.325" end="01:01:20.200" style="s2"> Then the world they live in will be more</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.200" end="01:01:21.975" style="s2"> More dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.300" end="01:01:23.325" style="s2"> We also know</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.325" end="01:01:25.450" style="s2"> If you suffer from traumatic stress disorder or depression</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.700" end="01:01:27.350" style="s2"> Your hippocampus shrinks</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.775" end="01:01:29.075" style="s2"> It will die and become smaller</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.475" end="01:01:31.250" style="s2"> Sometimes it can grow again</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.375" end="01:01:33.750" style="s2"> Your hippocampus shrinks and your amygdala grows</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.025" end="01:01:36.575" style="s2"> The amygdala increases emotional sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.675" end="01:01:39.275" style="s2"> The hippocampus inhibits emotional sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.425" end="01:01:40.850" style="s2"> So if you fail miserably</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.850" end="01:01:42.850" style="s2"> The hippocampus shrinks and the amygdala enlarges</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.525" end="01:01:44.675" style="s2"> If you come out of failure</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.225" end="01:01:46.825" style="s2"> The hippocampus becomes bigger again</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.025" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2"> Antidepressants can assist this process</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.350" end="01:01:51.100" style="s2"> But the amygdala never gets smaller</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.075" end="01:01:55.400" style="s2"> This is another lesson we learned from lobster</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.400" end="01:01:56.600" style="s2"> This is shocking</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.125" end="01:02:00.275" style="s2"> But the interesting thing is that you can understand the behavior pattern of lobster</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.375" end="01:02:03.025" style="s2"> &quot;I know what this poor crustacean is going through&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.750" end="01:02:08.900" style="s2"> Let&#39;s talk about mice</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.900" end="01:02:10.425" style="s2"> This is the study of Jayak Panksepp</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.450" end="01:02:12.775" style="s2"> He was the first person to find that mice can laugh</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.800" end="01:02:17.400" style="s2"> You might be wondering what is good for research</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.400" end="01:02:20.025" style="s2"> Why spend 50,000 research funds on giggling mice</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.000" end="01:02:25.100" style="s2"> He discovered the playful brain circuit of mammals</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.850" end="01:02:26.825" style="s2"> This is a major discovery</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.825" end="01:02:28.525" style="s2"> Just like discovering a new world</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.525" end="01:02:30.725" style="s2"> There are playful brain circuits in the mammalian brain</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.000" end="01:02:33.625" style="s2"> It is formed by nature rather than acquired socially</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.950" end="01:02:36.475" style="s2"> Here is where the biological mechanism comes into play</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.675" end="01:02:39.200" style="s2"> So what did Panksepp study about mice?</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.450" end="01:02:40.350" style="s2"> He found</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.600" end="01:02:43.175" style="s2"> If you isolate a young rat from its mother</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.250" end="01:02:43.925" style="s2"> It will die</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.025" end="01:02:44.900" style="s2"> Even if you feed it</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.950" end="01:02:46.400" style="s2"> Give it a suitable environment it will still die</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.675" end="01:02:48.025" style="s2"> If you rub it with the eraser at the end of the pencil</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.025" end="01:02:51.725" style="s2"> It won&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.600" end="01:02:54.725" style="s2"> Because mice need love to live</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.200" end="01:02:57.075" style="s2"> The same goes for human babies</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.300" end="01:02:59.675" style="s2"> In the Romanian orphanage after the Ceausescu disaster</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.900" end="01:03:01.675" style="s2"> We can observe this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.675" end="01:03:03.900" style="s2"> Those orphanages are full of abandoned babies</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.900" end="01:03:05.500" style="s2"> Because Ceausescu insists on pushing</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.500" end="01:03:07.325" style="s2"> All Romanian women must keep getting pregnant</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.725" end="01:03:09.950" style="s2"> So the orphanage is full of abandoned babies</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.000" end="01:03:11.525" style="s2"> Many abandoned babies don’t even have names</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.750" end="01:03:12.725" style="s2"> They are like goods being stored</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.000" end="01:03:15.775" style="s2"> They are given warm home food</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.300" end="01:03:17.150" style="s2"> Appalling</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.325" end="01:03:18.275" style="s2"> But many babies are still dead</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.275" end="01:03:20.225" style="s2"> Most abandoned babies die before one year old</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.350" end="01:03:24.025" style="s2"> The surviving baby suffers from permanent dysfunction</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.200" end="01:03:27.075" style="s2"> Because as a human, you must have physical contact</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.075" end="01:03:27.900" style="s2"> it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.100" end="01:03:29.400" style="s2"> You must have the experience of playing</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.500" end="01:03:30.800" style="s2"> This is also necessary</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.775" end="01:03:33.700" style="s2"> This is one of the necessary conditions for neurodevelopment</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.975" end="01:03:35.850" style="s2"> And you have to participate in the play fairly</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.675" end="01:03:40.025" style="s2"> Otherwise your child will be out of touch with society</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.025" end="01:03:42.850" style="s2"> He cannot notice the subtleties of social interaction</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.850" end="01:03:45.850" style="s2"> To some extent socializing is continuous play and reciprocity</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.100" end="01:03:48.150" style="s2"> So what did Panksepp find in the mouse</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.625" end="01:03:50.150" style="s2"> He noticed the male rat</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.325" end="01:03:51.800" style="s2"> Especially young male rats like fighting very much</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.150" end="01:03:55.125" style="s2"> They will fight like humans</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.125" end="01:03:56.075" style="s2"> They will pinch each other</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.075" end="01:03:57.000" style="s2"> My goodness</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.425" end="01:04:00.100" style="s2"> That mouse just lost and lost ten points</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.525" end="01:04:03.575" style="s2"> You can try some baby mice</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.700" end="01:04:05.175" style="s2"> Then see if they want to play</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.500" end="01:04:09.050" style="s2"> You can tie a spring to the mouse</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.725" end="01:04:10.925" style="s2"> They will try to escape</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.925" end="01:04:12.450" style="s2"> By measuring how long they pull the spring</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.800" end="01:04:14.450" style="s2"> I can see how much they want to escape</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.450" end="01:04:16.325" style="s2"> You can estimate how motivated they are</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.600" end="01:04:17.600" style="s2"> Then you will find</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.600" end="01:04:19.600" style="s2"> One without any worries</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.100" end="01:04:21.950" style="s2"> Thriving rat</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.950" end="01:04:26.375" style="s2"> Still try hard</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.375" end="01:04:27.650" style="s2"> Enter the place where it used to play</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.800" end="01:04:28.800" style="s2"> It will make an effort</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.900" end="01:04:30.300" style="s2"> In other words, this mouse is motivated</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.800" end="01:04:32.675" style="s2"> Two mice playing together</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.925" end="01:04:35.975" style="s2"> They will play like dogs</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.025" end="01:04:37.425" style="s2"> If you know a little bit about dogs</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.525" end="01:04:39.925" style="s2"> You know what that is like</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.225" end="01:04:41.500" style="s2"> They have this kind of action</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.625" end="01:04:42.700" style="s2"> Human children do the same</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.050" end="01:04:44.200" style="s2"> If you play with your wife occasionally</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.200" end="01:04:45.450" style="s2"> You will do the same</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.200" end="01:04:48.500" style="s2"> My poor wife</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.750" end="01:04:55.750" style="s2"> She was young and her brothers and sisters were older than her</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.750" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2"> So at the age she should play when she was young</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:04:58.650" style="s2"> She doesn&#39;t play enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.950" end="01:05:01.500" style="s2"> I used to be like this</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.650" end="01:05:02.550" style="s2"> For example, if you take a pillow</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.550" end="01:05:04.075" style="s2"> Then shake it like this three times</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.200" end="01:05:05.175" style="s2"> Means optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.175" end="01:05:06.575" style="s2"> I want to throw you a pillow</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.800" end="01:05:09.375" style="s2"> So I will throw one, two, three</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.775" end="01:05:12.250" style="s2"> She will be very surprised and puzzled</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.250" end="01:05:13.775" style="s2"> The expression is like saying what are you doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.100" end="01:05:18.700" style="s2"> I finally taught her the meaning of this action</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.225" end="01:05:25.750" style="s2"> There is another thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.050" end="01:05:28.075" style="s2"> Sometimes when we are playing</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.150" end="01:05:29.275" style="s2"> She will walk towards me like this</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.475" end="01:05:30.400" style="s2"> I will hold her wrist</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.450" end="01:05:34.925" style="s2"> Put her fists together joint to joint</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.000" end="01:05:37.150" style="s2"> She used to be very angry because of this</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.175" end="01:05:40.375" style="s2"> I think so</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.450" end="01:05:41.575" style="s2"> You have to do this</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.575" end="01:05:42.750" style="s2"> Open your hands</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.750" end="01:05:44.250" style="s2"> She doesn&#39;t know how it should be</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.550" end="01:05:45.725" style="s2"> When she was just a &quot;little mouse&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.725" end="01:05:46.875" style="s2"> She doesn&#39;t play enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.925" end="01:05:54.900" style="s2"> You let the mouse out to play</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.900" end="01:05:56.525" style="s2"> We assume that one of the mice</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.525" end="01:05:57.750" style="s2"> One-tenth the size of the other one</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.275" end="01:06:00.800" style="s2"> This larger mouse will win</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.400" end="01:06:03.375" style="s2"> Because one-tenth of the weight of a mouse</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.375" end="01:06:06.525" style="s2"> Enough to make you a winner instead of a loser</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.400" end="01:06:12.200" style="s2"> Rats beat mice</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.450" end="01:06:15.400" style="s2"> Then the rat becomes the dominant rat</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.175" end="01:06:18.925" style="s2"> Next time I play</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.150" end="01:06:21.475" style="s2"> Mice have to invite rats to play</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.550" end="01:06:23.025" style="s2"> The rat just stayed leisurely</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.275" end="01:06:24.400" style="s2"> The mouse emerged from nowhere</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.400" end="01:06:26.400" style="s2"> Find ways to invite rats to play together</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.700" end="01:06:28.575" style="s2"> Rats will condescend to play with him</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.950" end="01:06:30.600" style="s2"> But if you repeatedly group them together</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.875" end="01:06:33.850" style="s2"> Unless the rats let the mice win in a third of the time</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:36.025" style="s2"> Otherwise the mice will not invite the rats to play together</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.500" end="01:06:37.950" style="s2"> Panksepp discovered this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.150" end="01:06:40.250" style="s2"> I really felt enlightened after reading his research</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.825" end="01:06:42.500" style="s2"> It&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.550" end="01:06:46.000" style="s2"> First of all because this is in line with Piaget’s point of view</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.000" end="01:06:47.875" style="s2"> &quot;Human morality can arise from play behavior&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.875" end="01:06:49.575" style="s2"> Formed an analogy</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.575" end="01:06:50.550" style="s2"> This is really amazing</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.775" end="01:06:51.950" style="s2"> But on the mouse</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.950" end="01:06:54.875" style="s2"> This concept is established on the level of fighting</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.075" end="01:06:57.050" style="s2"> Rats are very social animals</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.275" end="01:06:59.050" style="s2"> They must learn how to get along with other rats</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.400" end="01:07:02.800" style="s2"> In the fight for majority dominance</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.075" end="01:07:06.025" style="s2"> They don’t want the fight to become bloody and violent</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.225" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2"> Suppose you are Rat One and I am Rat Two</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.450" end="01:07:10.125" style="s2"> In the fight for dominance</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.125" end="01:07:11.150" style="s2"> We tore each other to pieces</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.625" end="01:07:13.500" style="s2"> Three mice will make a profit</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.500" end="01:07:15.300" style="s2"> This is obviously not a good strategy</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.900" end="01:07:17.375" style="s2"> If we can peacefully</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.375" end="01:07:19.800" style="s2"> It would be better to seek common ground while reserving differences</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.100" end="01:07:25.525" style="s2"> Anyway, Panksepp found that mice can play</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.525" end="01:07:27.400" style="s2"> They not only play but also play fair</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.400" end="01:07:28.350" style="s2"> And they like fairness</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.350" end="01:07:30.300" style="s2"> He also found a little bit cool</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.675" end="01:07:35.150" style="s2"> If you give young rats a drug for attention deficit disorder</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.800" end="01:07:36.425" style="s2"> Ritalin</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.375" end="01:07:38.775" style="s2"> It inhibits mice from playing</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.050" end="01:07:41.200" style="s2"> This is worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.550" end="01:07:45.725" style="s2"> Why do we give children in school</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.350" end="01:07:48.825" style="s2"> Using amphetamine</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.075" end="01:07:50.500" style="s2"> Because children need play to grow up</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.700" end="01:07:52.125" style="s2"> But adults will say no to play</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.350" end="01:07:53.850" style="s2"> Don&#39;t play around</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.875" end="01:07:55.825" style="s2"> In my opinion this is &quot;oppression&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.950" end="01:07:57.375" style="s2"> Don&#39;t let them frolic</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.425" end="01:07:58.075" style="s2"> It&#39;s ok</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.350" end="01:07:59.425" style="s2"> Give them amphetamines</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.975" end="01:08:01.575" style="s2"> It inhibits the play circuit in their brain</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.875" end="01:08:02.925" style="s2"> Then the problem is coming</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.975" end="01:08:04.175" style="s2"> Panksepp Discovery</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.550" end="01:08:07.350" style="s2"> If you don’t let young male rats play</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.200" end="01:08:10.150" style="s2"> Their prefrontal cortex will not develop normally</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.875" end="01:08:11.875" style="s2"> I didn&#39;t expect it</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.875" end="01:08:12.925" style="s2"> You are restraining them from becoming mature</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.925" end="01:08:14.275" style="s2"> Otherwise what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.800" end="01:08:18.000" style="s2"> I think this is really worth pondering</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.025" end="01:08:21.650" style="s2"> These are a few wolves fooling around</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.700" end="01:08:23.375" style="s2"> just kidding</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:30.000" style="s2"> These wolves are fighting for authority</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.725" end="01:08:33.225" style="s2"> Professionally</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.825" end="01:08:36.300" style="s2"> Some wolves are pretending</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.325" end="01:08:39.725" style="s2"> Sociable wolf</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.925" end="01:08:42.325" style="s2"> Tend to not hurt other wolves in power struggles</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.325" end="01:08:45.375" style="s2"> The reason is obvious, hurting each other is too dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.925" end="01:08:47.775" style="s2"> They have other ways to prove</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.775" end="01:08:49.900" style="s2"> Who should give orders is authority</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.400" end="01:08:51.700" style="s2"> These chimpanzees are doing the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.950" end="01:08:55.150" style="s2"> If i remember correctly</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.525" end="01:08:57.625" style="s2"> This is a great photo</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.650" end="01:08:58.875" style="s2"> Because of this chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.975" end="01:09:00.475" style="s2"> By the way, orangutans hate snakes</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.125" end="01:09:01.925" style="s2"> So for example</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.925" end="01:09:03.475" style="s2"> If you have a chimpanzee who has never seen a snake</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.500" end="01:09:04.725" style="s2"> You show it a snake</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.825" end="01:09:05.650" style="s2"> It won&#39;t be happy</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.875" end="01:09:07.425" style="s2"> It will immediately run away from the snake</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.050" end="01:09:10.800" style="s2"> If you take an anesthetized chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.100" end="01:09:12.325" style="s2"> Sent to a room with many chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.325" end="01:09:13.975" style="s2"> These chimpanzees will stay far away</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.975" end="01:09:14.950" style="s2"> Then stared at the anesthetized chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.950" end="01:09:16.100" style="s2"> They don&#39;t like this either</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.900" end="01:09:19.125" style="s2"> If you put a huge snake in a chimpanzee cage</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.125" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2"> Even if the chimpanzee has never seen a snake</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:21.650" style="s2"> They will also go far</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.725" end="01:09:22.775" style="s2"> Then stare at the snake</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.000" end="01:09:24.475" style="s2"> Wild chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.975" end="01:09:26.325" style="s2"> If you see a huge snake</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.700" end="01:09:28.750" style="s2"> They will stand there and make a cry</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.800" end="01:09:30.250" style="s2"> Seems to be saying</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.250" end="01:09:31.875" style="s2"> &quot;My God, there is a big snake.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.550" end="01:09:35.025" style="s2"> It is indeed the case</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.025" end="01:09:36.000" style="s2"> I will tell you why later</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.125" end="01:09:42.275" style="s2"> They stand farther away and make this kind of call</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.275" end="01:09:43.875" style="s2"> It means &quot;Oh my God, look at this snake&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.100" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2"> Then they will stand there for about 24 hours</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:47.000" style="s2"> Just stare at that snake</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.275" end="01:09:51.375" style="s2"> Snakes are really a super stimulus for chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.375" end="01:09:52.425" style="s2"> It&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.425" end="01:09:55.075" style="s2"> This chimpanzee seems to have learned how to take this dead snake</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.075" end="01:09:56.725" style="s2"> To scare other chimps</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.850" end="01:10:00.750" style="s2"> This is also one of the ways it builds authority</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.275" end="01:10:04.575" style="s2"> Snake is a threat</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.575" end="01:10:07.100" style="s2"> If I were the orangutan beside this chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.100" end="01:10:08.425" style="s2"> I will take this threat seriously</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.425" end="01:10:09.850" style="s2"> Because snakes are not a joke</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.150" end="01:10:11.275" style="s2"> You can see the same thing in these monkeys</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.725" end="01:10:13.375" style="s2"> I don&#39;t remember what kind of monkey this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.625" end="01:10:15.600" style="s2"> Their behavior is radical</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.275" end="01:10:19.575" style="s2"> By the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.575" end="01:10:22.175" style="s2"> Recent research shows</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.175" end="01:10:23.575" style="s2"> Higher order primates</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.975" end="01:10:26.725" style="s2"> Snake detection circuits are naturally formed in the brain</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.450" end="01:10:28.525" style="s2"> This is not acquired</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.875" end="01:10:30.775" style="s2"> This is more profound than acquired</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.375" end="01:10:34.050" style="s2"> Psychologists knew that</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.050" end="01:10:37.850" style="s2"> Use pictures of snakes or snakes in condition experiments</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.850" end="01:10:41.250" style="s2"> Scared the subject</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.250" end="01:10:43.700" style="s2"> Much faster than pictures with guns or guns</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.200" end="01:10:47.025" style="s2"> We can quickly understand the fear of snakes</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.050" end="01:10:47.975" style="s2"> Also for spiders</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.225" end="01:10:49.250" style="s2"> Then people will think</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.250" end="01:10:50.825" style="s2"> Maybe we are prepared in advance</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.825" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2"> Build fear of such animals as snakes or spiders</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.425" end="01:10:57.500" style="s2"> More recent research shows</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.500" end="01:10:59.025" style="s2"> It&#39;s not just ready</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.500" end="01:11:02.700" style="s2"> But we have this kind of detection circuit innate</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.700" end="01:11:05.675" style="s2"> Why not</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.250" end="01:11:07.625" style="s2"> This is indeed a problem</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.625" end="01:11:09.500" style="s2"> It&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.675" end="01:11:11.900" style="s2"> Unless you think human beings are just a blank slate</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.900" end="01:11:13.175" style="s2"> If you really think so</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.650" end="01:11:15.250" style="s2"> how to say</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.250" end="01:11:17.100" style="s2"> You should have crawled out of the 16th century</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.100" end="01:11:19.175" style="s2"> This is my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.525" end="01:11:21.900" style="s2"> This view is really outdated</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.200" end="01:11:24.600" style="s2"> Simply wrong</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.125" end="01:11:30.350" style="s2"> You can think of this behavior as a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.350" end="01:11:36.325" style="s2"> But wolves also pursue credibility and ability</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.550" end="01:11:39.450" style="s2"> Chimpanzees don&#39;t like cruel tyrants</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.725" end="01:11:42.225" style="s2"> Then we will discuss it as a hierarchy of authority</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.600" end="01:11:45.525" style="s2"> The picture shows how it started to develop</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.875" end="01:11:49.850" style="s2"> These girls are discussing the family environment</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.975" end="01:11:51.225" style="s2"> How to do things properly</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.225" end="01:11:53.900" style="s2"> How to share turns etc.</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.250" end="01:11:56.525" style="s2"> They are discussing the hierarchy of authority</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.750" end="01:11:58.550" style="s2"> If you are good at mutual benefit</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.550" end="01:11:59.800" style="s2"> Sometimes you are an authority</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.800" end="01:12:01.725" style="s2"> Sometimes others are authority</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.775" end="01:12:03.100" style="s2"> It&#39;s fair right</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.700" end="01:12:04.900" style="s2"> These boys are doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.900" end="01:12:06.725" style="s2"> You can see them smiling</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.200" end="01:12:09.075" style="s2"> This looks like an attack</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.325" end="01:12:12.800" style="s2"> Not too careful</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.300" end="01:12:14.400" style="s2"> Paranoid</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.850" end="01:12:18.125" style="s2"> People who don&#39;t like humans</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.825" end="01:12:21.250" style="s2"> Confuse this with aggressive behavior</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.250" end="01:12:22.675" style="s2"> They will prohibit students from doing this in school</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.675" end="01:12:26.150" style="s2"> For example, when my child is in school</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.150" end="01:12:27.400" style="s2"> This is a long time ago</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.825" end="01:12:30.650" style="s2"> They are not allowed to touch snow</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.075" end="01:12:33.325" style="s2"> In case they throw snowballs</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.525" end="01:12:34.825" style="s2"> This is a terrible thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.275" end="01:12:36.550" style="s2"> So i told my son</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.550" end="01:12:39.575" style="s2"> He can use snowballs at will</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.700" end="01:12:42.025" style="s2"> Hit any teacher in the back of the head</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.025" end="01:12:45.525" style="s2"> As long as he is willing to bear the consequences of this behavior</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.525" end="01:12:47.719" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know if he really did it</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.719" end="01:12:50.175" style="s2"> But he was obviously very happy with the idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.175" end="01:12:51.700" style="s2"> I&#39;m very happy for him</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.375" end="01:12:57.400" style="s2"> Children need to play like this</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.400" end="01:13:01.500" style="s2"> They really need to do this</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.525" end="01:13:02.775" style="s2"> This makes them civilized and polite</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.400" end="01:13:05.650" style="s2"> They need to learn to be civilized and polite when they are two to four years old</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.650" end="01:13:06.875" style="s2"> Because if before the age of four</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.875" end="01:13:07.875" style="s2"> They still didn&#39;t learn to be polite</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.000" end="01:13:09.000" style="s2"> Then don&#39;t expect them to learn</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.625" end="01:13:11.625" style="s2"> This is a terrible statistic</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.625" end="01:13:13.500" style="s2"> But in the literature related to development</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.500" end="01:13:14.900" style="s2"> It is well proven</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.350" end="01:13:16.850" style="s2"> There are many aggressive two-year-olds in the literature</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.850" end="01:13:17.850" style="s2"> Many boys</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.625" end="01:13:20.500" style="s2"> If they are over four years old, they are still aggressive</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.500" end="01:13:22.225" style="s2"> They probably stay in this state for their entire lives</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.475" end="01:13:24.325" style="s2"> They have no friends to be rejected</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.350" end="01:13:25.725" style="s2"> They are more likely to become</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.725" end="01:13:28.325" style="s2"> Anti-social lawless juvenile delinquent and go to jail</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.100" end="01:13:32.775" style="s2"> Your child needs to socialize between two and four years old</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.125" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2"> Especially aggressive boys need</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.825" end="01:13:37.775" style="s2"> Most aggressive two-year-olds are boys</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.900" end="01:13:40.125" style="s2"> By the way, being offensive is not socializing</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.450" end="01:13:44.725" style="s2"> There is a more abstract way of expressing this matter</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.125" end="01:13:46.341" style="s2"> What i want to say is</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.922" end="01:13:49.354" style="s2"> The hierarchy of authority is from</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.354" end="01:13:52.875" style="s2"> Emerges from the matrix of a potential game-like</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.875" end="01:13:56.782" style="s2"> This is what makes Jean Piaget outstanding</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.782" end="01:13:59.150" style="s2"> This view is extremely clever he came up with</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.400" end="01:14:02.491" style="s2"> He is very interested in the biological origin of morality</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.491" end="01:14:08.238" style="s2"> He traced the origin of play</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.238" end="01:14:10.414" style="s2"> And the formation of morality in play</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.736" end="01:14:12.200" style="s2"> This view is very clever</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.200" end="01:14:14.525" style="s2"> It&#39;s incredible</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.525" end="01:14:19.600" style="s2"> Because morality is built from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.600" end="01:14:21.450" style="s2"> Piaget is a constructivist</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.450" end="01:14:23.728" style="s2"> He is also a social constructivist to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.728" end="01:14:26.032" style="s2"> He underestimated the important role of biology here</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.032" end="01:14:28.125" style="s2"> But this does not prove that his theory is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.125" end="01:14:30.237" style="s2"> Theory for him</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.088" end="01:14:32.425" style="s2"> It is not difficult to add a biological support</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.425" end="01:14:33.400" style="s2"> We now have enough biological knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.400" end="01:14:35.760" style="s2"> Can do this well</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.050" end="01:14:40.100" style="s2"> In fact, such as Panksepp</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.100" end="01:14:41.840" style="s2"> Can already recognize the play circuit in the human brain</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.840" end="01:14:43.824" style="s2"> This is a good start</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.824" end="01:14:45.936" style="s2"> Play has been with mankind for so long</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.936" end="01:14:47.344" style="s2"> So that we all have a brain circuit</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.344" end="01:14:49.392" style="s2"> Designed for play</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.392" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2"> This is a very very old topic</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:56.304" style="s2"> This is the abstract concept of the game</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.304" end="01:14:57.712" style="s2"> Then you got a</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.712" end="01:15:03.920" style="s2"> The most extreme abstraction and expression such as this picture</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.920" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2"> Even the terrain of the game is fictitious</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:10.640" style="s2"> Of course we have largely migrated to</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.640" end="01:15:13.392" style="s2"> In these fictitious environments</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.392" end="01:15:17.232" style="s2"> Fictional books, movies, video games</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.232" end="01:15:21.264" style="s2"> These are extensions of the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.264" end="01:15:24.025" style="s2"> Exercises for real life</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.025" end="01:15:26.448" style="s2"> Sometimes becomes a reality</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.225" end="01:15:33.950" style="s2"> These are also manifestations of the Father</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.950" end="01:15:35.375" style="s2"> I like these expressions</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.375" end="01:15:38.625" style="s2"> I also like the concept of triangles</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.830" end="01:15:41.198" style="s2"> I don’t know why God wears a triangle hat</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.198" end="01:15:42.798" style="s2"> This shape is a bit strange</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.798" end="01:15:45.166" style="s2"> But I think it is related to the concept of pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.166" end="01:15:46.425" style="s2"> And also and</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.425" end="01:15:48.150" style="s2"> Authority hierarchy related</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.425" end="01:15:49.775" style="s2"> I think this is why the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.775" end="01:15:52.151" style="s2"> Will put Pharaoh in the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.151" end="01:15:53.431" style="s2"> I know there are other reasons besides this</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.431" end="01:15:55.287" style="s2"> But I think there are some reasons</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.287" end="01:15:57.719" style="s2"> Related to the concept of this hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.395" end="01:16:00.775" style="s2"> This is obviously a guess</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.791" end="01:16:02.135" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to be too precise</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.135" end="01:16:04.503" style="s2"> But I can’t help thinking that the two are related</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.503" end="01:16:07.175" style="s2"> That picture is the pattern on the back of the US dollar bill</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.500" end="01:16:08.375" style="s2"> I like this picture very much</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.375" end="01:16:10.825" style="s2"> It resembles the Eye of Horus in Egyptian civilization</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.825" end="01:16:12.887" style="s2"> The idea is like</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.887" end="01:16:14.807" style="s2"> At the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.807" end="01:16:15.959" style="s2"> Is no longer</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.959" end="01:16:18.007" style="s2"> Part of this hierarchy, right?</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.007" end="01:16:19.600" style="s2"> So if you climb high enough in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.600" end="01:16:22.325" style="s2"> What will happen is you will get an ability</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.626" end="01:16:24.546" style="s2"> It is the result of your climbing in this hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.546" end="01:16:26.338" style="s2"> Can separate you far enough from this system</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.338" end="01:16:28.386" style="s2"> After that you are no longer part of it</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.386" end="01:16:30.754" style="s2"> So you can move in all kinds of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.325" end="01:16:33.897" style="s2"> What you really master is</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.169" end="01:16:36.409" style="s2"> attention</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.425" end="01:16:41.337" style="s2"> From a mythological perspective</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.337" end="01:16:43.193" style="s2"> It seems that it can be extracted from the chaos</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.193" end="01:16:45.561" style="s2"> Of the source of the applicable order</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.561" end="01:16:49.401" style="s2"> The concept of spoken language rivals</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.401" end="01:16:53.049" style="s2"> Is vision and attention</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.049" end="01:16:56.569" style="s2"> Such as the creator god of Marduk Mesopotamia civilization</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.569" end="01:16:58.873" style="s2"> From Mesopotamian civilization</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.873" end="01:17:00.153" style="s2"> Appear in the hierarchy of gods</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.153" end="01:17:01.561" style="s2"> Then climb to the top</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.561" end="01:17:03.097" style="s2"> He is the victor among the gods</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.097" end="01:17:04.633" style="s2"> He has eyes all over the head</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.633" end="01:17:06.425" style="s2"> He can say spells</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.425" end="01:17:09.177" style="s2"> I like this idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.177" end="01:17:10.969" style="s2"> The Egyptians also formed this idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.969" end="01:17:12.121" style="s2"> Because their god Horus is that eye</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.121" end="01:17:14.233" style="s2"> Everyone knows the Eye of Horus</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.233" end="01:17:16.985" style="s2"> The concept is so attractive</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.985" end="01:17:18.521" style="s2"> Spread to this day</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.521" end="01:17:20.377" style="s2"> Everyone has seen the Eye of Horus</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.377" end="01:17:21.849" style="s2"> Its pupils are completely open</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.617" end="01:17:24.473" style="s2"> The Egyptians recognized</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.473" end="01:17:27.929" style="s2"> Fully open eyes can regenerate a dead society</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.434" end="01:17:29.650" style="s2"> This view is really wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.657" end="01:17:30.350" style="s2"> So if your life is in chaos</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.361" end="01:17:31.577" style="s2"> What should you do</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.577" end="01:17:33.433" style="s2"> You better concentrate</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.433" end="01:17:34.777" style="s2"> This is different from thinking</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.777" end="01:17:35.550" style="s2"> It is a different process</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.125" end="01:17:40.345" style="s2"> In a sense, thinking is the result of structure execution</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.345" end="01:17:42.009" style="s2"> I know I oversimplified</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.009" end="01:17:43.609" style="s2"> But focus on one thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.609" end="01:17:46.105" style="s2"> Like looking at something you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.105" end="01:17:49.049" style="s2"> One thing I often recommend to guests in my clinic is</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.049" end="01:17:50.425" style="s2"> If they have family conflicts</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.425" end="01:17:52.400" style="s2"> The first thing to do is to shut up</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.850" end="01:17:55.385" style="s2"> Don&#39;t say any more of your own ideas</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.385" end="01:17:57.305" style="s2"> Not in a rude manner</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.369" end="01:17:59.353" style="s2"> Just stop talking about your own thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.353" end="01:18:03.449" style="s2"> Second, watch them like an eagle and listen carefully</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.449" end="01:18:04.857" style="s2"> If you persist long enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.857" end="01:18:07.097" style="s2"> They will tell you exactly what they want</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.097" end="01:18:08.505" style="s2"> They will tell you</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.505" end="01:18:09.849" style="s2"> What kind of person are you in their hearts</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.849" end="01:18:10.873" style="s2"> Then you will be shocked</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.873" end="01:18:13.305" style="s2"> Because generally speaking, the way they have you</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.305" end="01:18:15.161" style="s2"> Totally different from what you think you are</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.161" end="01:18:16.377" style="s2"> When they tell you</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.377" end="01:18:18.425" style="s2"> This is a revelation for you</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.425" end="01:18:21.241" style="s2"> Attention is incredibly powerful</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.241" end="01:18:23.161" style="s2"> You can also see it in psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.161" end="01:18:24.185" style="s2"> Because of the many things you do</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.185" end="01:18:26.361" style="s2"> In all repairable relationships</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.361" end="01:18:28.375" style="s2"> Are really focusing on the opposite person</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.025" end="01:18:30.278" style="s2"> Focus and listen</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.097" end="01:18:32.313" style="s2"> You will be surprised</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.313" end="01:18:34.553" style="s2"> What people will tell or reveal to you</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.553" end="01:18:35.769" style="s2"> If you watch them</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.769" end="01:18:37.305" style="s2"> Like you are listening</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.305" end="01:18:38.265" style="s2"> Instead of staring at them</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.265" end="01:18:42.105" style="s2"> In order to strengthen one&#39;s prejudice</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.105" end="01:18:44.153" style="s2"> People usually communicate like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.153" end="01:18:45.945" style="s2"> Like i want to always</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.945" end="01:18:47.481" style="s2"> Keep my opinion of you</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.481" end="01:18:50.588" style="s2"> So I want to filter out all the information that shakes my theory</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.588" end="01:18:52.163" style="s2"> This is not what i want to say</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.497" end="01:18:53.905" style="s2"> It&#39;s just that I want to watch you</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.905" end="01:18:55.505" style="s2"> And figure out what you want</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.505" end="01:18:56.913" style="s2"> Not in a rude way not at all</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.913" end="01:18:59.601" style="s2"> I just want to see what you are thinking</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.601" end="01:19:01.585" style="s2"> This is probably good for you</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.585" end="01:19:03.441" style="s2"> Also good for me</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.875" end="01:19:06.275" style="s2"> The concept is</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.275" end="01:19:09.457" style="s2"> Climbing up in the authority level can give you vision</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.457" end="01:19:12.900" style="s2"> This vision can go beyond the current hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.148" end="01:19:18.723" style="s2"> I think this is also the artists</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.723" end="01:19:20.579" style="s2"> Metaphysical space</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.579" end="01:19:22.307" style="s2"> Because artists do not exist in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.307" end="01:19:23.651" style="s2"> They exist outside the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.651" end="01:19:25.725" style="s2"> Most of you have seen &quot;The Lion King&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.500" end="01:19:29.375" style="s2"> It&#39;s like Shazu&#39;s little bird</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.375" end="01:19:30.350" style="s2"> That is the king&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.475" end="01:19:34.625" style="s2"> This is also connected with this concept</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.700" end="01:19:41.575" style="s2"> These figures also express the same concept of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.550" end="01:19:45.399" style="s2"> Gold, silver and copper</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.399" end="01:19:46.615" style="s2"> Why gold</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.615" end="01:19:48.279" style="s2"> Gold is the sun gold is pure</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.925" end="01:19:51.552" style="s2"> The concept is</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.552" end="01:19:54.060" style="s2"> Things at the top of the hierarchy are not corrodible</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.060" end="01:19:55.703" style="s2"> Because gold will not mix with other things</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.341" end="01:19:58.901" style="s2"> Gold will never be corroded</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.901" end="01:19:59.669" style="s2"> It is a noble metal</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.669" end="01:20:01.269" style="s2"> It will not be corroded</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.269" end="01:20:02.933" style="s2"> It shines like the sun</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.933" end="01:20:03.829" style="s2"> So it is with</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.829" end="01:20:05.813" style="s2"> Things at the top of the hierarchy are linked together</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.813" end="01:20:08.757" style="s2"> The gold medal is a disc like the sun</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.757" end="01:20:12.963" style="s2"> It will be rewarded</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.963" end="01:20:15.413" style="s2"> And the ideal person</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.550" end="01:20:19.189" style="s2"> I tell you a little story</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.189" end="01:20:20.963" style="s2"> Imagine you are watching an Olympic game</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.173" end="01:20:23.440" style="s2"> I often do this when I watch gymnastics</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.440" end="01:20:25.804" style="s2"> Because gymnasts are really incredible</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.450" end="01:20:28.200" style="s2"> Look at a gymnastics show</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.050" end="01:20:31.482" style="s2"> Athletes pulsate like a poem on the court</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.676" end="01:20:36.020" style="s2"> You can&#39;t even imagine this</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.020" end="01:20:37.108" style="s2"> Their skills are so perfect</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.108" end="01:20:38.388" style="s2"> You see this person</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.388" end="01:20:39.050" style="s2"> Complete the whole set of actions</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.050" end="01:20:43.344" style="s2"> They are simply perfect and flawless</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.344" end="01:20:45.136" style="s2"> At the end they stopped and thunderous applause</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.136" end="01:20:47.450" style="s2"> They are all very excited to see humans refresh their limits</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.795" end="01:20:49.459" style="s2"> This is why our audience watch the game</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.459" end="01:20:51.251" style="s2"> Because we want to see the limits of human physical fitness</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.251" end="01:20:54.323" style="s2"> Then the judges scored 9.8 9.8 9.8</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.323" end="01:20:55.475" style="s2"> Everyone is very excited</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.475" end="01:20:57.139" style="s2"> Then the next player on the field is like</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.139" end="01:20:59.443" style="s2"> They are basically done</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.443" end="01:21:01.275" style="s2"> The performance of the previous player is simply perfect</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.275" end="01:21:03.091" style="s2"> How can you surpass him</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.091" end="01:21:04.947" style="s2"> This is an interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.947" end="01:21:08.467" style="s2"> Because these pictures show</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.467" end="01:21:11.603" style="s2"> How do you go beyond perfection</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.603" end="01:21:12.563" style="s2"> you can do it</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.563" end="01:21:13.651" style="s2"> Here is how to do it</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.651" end="01:21:14.547" style="s2"> And you know these</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.547" end="01:21:16.083" style="s2"> Even if you don’t realize that you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.083" end="01:21:18.963" style="s2"> The next player is a little trembling</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.963" end="01:21:21.907" style="s2"> Because the standard has been raised</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.907" end="01:21:26.003" style="s2"> They pushed themselves to the edge of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.900" end="01:21:28.721" style="s2"> You can tell by observing their plight</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.721" end="01:21:33.137" style="s2"> They are at a critical juncture</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.137" end="01:21:35.650" style="s2"> They push themselves into the unexplored state</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.650" end="01:21:37.464" style="s2"> Just for perfection</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.464" end="01:21:40.088" style="s2"> Everyone in the hall is so nervous that they hold their breath</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.088" end="01:21:41.560" style="s2"> Silent needles can be heard</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.679" end="01:21:43.343" style="s2"> The athlete is turning around</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.343" end="01:21:46.671" style="s2"> Hit the mark</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.671" end="01:21:49.679" style="s2"> After the end, they held their heads up like this and opened their arms</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.679" end="01:21:52.303" style="s2"> A triumphant posture</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.303" end="01:21:55.695" style="s2"> Everyone immediately stood up and thunderous applause</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.745" end="01:21:56.875" style="s2"> why</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.875" end="01:21:57.500" style="s2"> what are you doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.500" end="01:21:59.350" style="s2"> What are you thinking now</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.696" end="01:22:02.232" style="s2"> You can&#39;t even hold on</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.232" end="01:22:04.280" style="s2"> It directly captures the core of your being</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.280" end="01:22:05.112" style="s2"> Then you stand up</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.112" end="01:22:07.608" style="s2"> This is just an act of worship</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.608" end="01:22:10.168" style="s2"> You see some people go beyond their own perfection</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.168" end="01:22:12.536" style="s2"> Entered the realm of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.536" end="01:22:14.776" style="s2"> And established order before your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.359" end="01:22:16.708" style="s2"> You will feel ecstatic</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.708" end="01:22:18.564" style="s2"> Think it&#39;s worth it</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.564" end="01:22:21.380" style="s2"> Cheers</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.572" end="01:22:24.900" style="s2"> This is definitely a strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.900" end="01:22:26.884" style="s2"> Sometimes that picture expresses</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.884" end="01:22:28.375" style="s2"> Sometimes this picture expresses</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.800" end="01:22:30.404" style="s2"> This is what we want to discuss</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.404" end="01:22:32.580" style="s2"> Because this is the culmination of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.580" end="01:22:34.850" style="s2"> You are not only doing what you should do</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.625" end="01:22:38.473" style="s2"> And it also makes you more likely</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.473" end="01:22:40.905" style="s2"> On this basis</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.050" end="01:22:44.628" style="s2"> The same idea another thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.400" end="01:22:47.000" style="s2"> I know we haven&#39;t told the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.800" end="01:22:52.912" style="s2"> You tell your kids to play fairly</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.321" end="01:22:55.433" style="s2"> You said winning or losing is not the point</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.433" end="01:22:56.713" style="s2"> The focus is on the way the game is played</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.713" end="01:22:59.081" style="s2"> You say that but you don&#39;t know the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.529" end="01:23:00.553" style="s2"> You feel a bit silly to say that</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.553" end="01:23:01.641" style="s2"> Even if you know it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.641" end="01:23:02.857" style="s2"> Your kids look at you too</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.857" end="01:23:03.753" style="s2"> It seems something is wrong with you</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.753" end="01:23:05.481" style="s2"> Because they don&#39;t know what you are talking about</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.481" end="01:23:07.209" style="s2"> But you know what you said is right</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.625" end="01:23:08.905" style="s2"> Let me talk about the reason</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.725" end="01:23:12.941" style="s2"> Life is not a game</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.475" end="01:23:14.947" style="s2"> But a series of games</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.657" end="01:23:19.325" style="s2"> The rule is not to win a game</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.325" end="01:23:22.148" style="s2"> Sacrificed long-term victory, right?</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.476" end="01:23:25.100" style="s2"> This is the meaning of &quot;play well&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.100" end="01:23:25.804" style="s2"> The way you want to play</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.804" end="01:23:27.404" style="s2"> Make others willing to invite you to keep playing</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.975" end="01:23:28.788" style="s2"> This is how you win</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.300" end="01:23:30.400" style="s2"> Your victory is through</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.400" end="01:23:33.825" style="s2"> To be invited to join as many games as possible</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.825" end="01:23:36.725" style="s2"> Specifically to show</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.725" end="01:23:38.600" style="s2"> You can play the game in a mutually beneficial way</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.625" end="01:23:41.350" style="s2"> This is true in every game even if you might lose</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.350" end="01:23:43.375" style="s2"> This is the way to keep you successful</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.825" end="01:23:45.025" style="s2"> We all know this</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.050" end="01:23:46.325" style="s2"> I teach my children this way</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.325" end="01:23:48.250" style="s2"> But we did not realize that we knew this</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.600" end="01:23:51.618" style="s2"> We did not adapt ourselves to ordinary games</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.618" end="01:23:52.642" style="s2"> Or adapted to win the game</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.642" end="01:23:54.490" style="s2"> But we adapt ourselves to the meta game</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.490" end="01:23:57.050" style="s2"> And adapt to a series of potential game victories</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.575" end="01:24:00.150" style="s2"> This is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.475" end="01:24:01.525" style="s2"> as far as I know</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.525" end="01:24:03.091" style="s2"> What these pictures want to express</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.091" end="01:24:04.883" style="s2"> The same idea</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.883" end="01:24:07.443" style="s2"> There is a mode of being</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.443" end="01:24:11.690" style="s2"> Features that can surpass local competition</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.350" end="01:24:14.041" style="s2"> This is another way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.041" end="01:24:17.883" style="s2"> Pursuing ethics is not to win the current competition</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.125" end="01:24:21.192" style="s2"> At the expense of future potential competition opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.775" end="01:24:24.299" style="s2"> Again, I don’t think this is arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.299" end="01:24:26.283" style="s2"> Not relative</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.283" end="01:24:29.931" style="s2"> There is an absolute moral position in the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.931" end="01:24:31.595" style="s2"> Everyone knows</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.595" end="01:24:34.795" style="s2"> I also think this is the secret of success</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.795" end="01:24:36.011" style="s2"> I also think it’s weird</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.011" end="01:24:37.931" style="s2"> It is similar to the following view</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.931" end="01:24:42.539" style="s2"> Good at being invited</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.539" end="01:24:47.343" style="s2"> People who participate in as many games as possible</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.343" end="01:24:49.793" style="s2"> I haven&#39;t figured it out yet</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.170" end="01:24:51.258" style="s2"> The precise relationship between these two views</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.258" end="01:24:54.266" style="s2"> At the same time proactively</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.266" end="01:24:55.930" style="s2"> Before the unknown came to the city in a hostile posture</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.930" end="01:24:59.386" style="s2"> Conquer the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.386" end="01:25:00.794" style="s2"> The two are exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.794" end="01:25:03.930" style="s2"> I haven&#39;t fully understood the reason yet</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.930" end="01:25:06.725" style="s2"> But i will know in the end</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.725" end="01:25:08.225" style="s2"> I will tell you when I know</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.575" end="01:25:10.200" style="s2"> If you are interested</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.418" end="01:25:13.658" style="s2"> There are some other ideas</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.658" end="01:25:17.626" style="s2"> About God as an authority figure in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.626" end="01:25:22.106" style="s2"> Discard your religious prejudice about what you observe</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.106" end="01:25:23.962" style="s2"> Simply observe what you see</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.026" end="01:25:25.306" style="s2"> This is a primate in the picture</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.306" end="01:25:27.738" style="s2"> He is looking up at the ruler</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.738" end="01:25:29.182" style="s2"> This is what you see</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.025" end="01:25:32.830" style="s2"> It is shown interestingly and symbolically</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.830" end="01:25:34.942" style="s2"> You can see the Father with the cross</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.942" end="01:25:38.275" style="s2"> I think it means there is a kind of cognition</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.275" end="01:25:44.050" style="s2"> The person with the highest authority in the picture</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.825" end="01:25:47.294" style="s2"> He accepted voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.294" end="01:25:48.958" style="s2"> The fact that suffering is also part of the being</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.150" end="01:25:50.550" style="s2"> This is what this picture wants to express</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.814" end="01:25:52.606" style="s2"> This authority figure holding a cross said</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.606" end="01:25:55.486" style="s2"> This is what you have to accept</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.486" end="01:25:59.582" style="s2"> This shocked bystanders</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.582" end="01:26:01.566" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.566" end="01:26:02.654" style="s2"> Is it true?</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.654" end="01:26:04.254" style="s2"> You think so first</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.254" end="01:26:06.942" style="s2"> Do you like the brave or the coward</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.942" end="01:26:08.606" style="s2"> Blunt enough</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.606" end="01:26:10.846" style="s2"> What is the limit of heroism</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.846" end="01:26:13.724" style="s2"> After accepting the fact that you are mortal and not everything</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.724" end="01:26:16.734" style="s2"> Can still live forever</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.734" end="01:26:20.702" style="s2"> This is the core of respectable quality</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.022" end="01:26:23.646" style="s2"> Why don&#39;t we assume that</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.094" end="01:26:25.438" style="s2"> This is how we acted</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.438" end="01:26:28.528" style="s2"> This is what everyone dreams of and hopes to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.375" end="01:26:32.375" style="s2"> The premise is that you have abandoned</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.375" end="01:26:33.500" style="s2"> The idea that you can live forever</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.500" end="01:26:37.000" style="s2"> Eternal life may be worth looking forward to, maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.000" end="01:26:38.850" style="s2"> Immortality is a long time</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.900" end="01:26:40.750" style="s2"> But you definitely want this</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.750" end="01:26:43.675" style="s2"> This painting says this is what you should be</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.675" end="01:26:46.775" style="s2"> We got the same scene as the sky hole before</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.800" end="01:26:49.300" style="s2"> That is a scene I have shown you before</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.300" end="01:26:50.675" style="s2"> This is a transcendent truth</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.675" end="01:26:53.950" style="s2"> Everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.025" end="01:26:56.850" style="s2"> Jung would say that this concept is rooted in your mind</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.975" end="01:27:01.325" style="s2"> Some elements of this are cultural</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.375" end="01:27:03.675" style="s2"> It doesn’t have to be a cross</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.750" end="01:27:05.625" style="s2"> Although the cross is a very old symbol</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.650" end="01:27:08.650" style="s2"> Far before it was used in Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.725" end="01:27:12.425" style="s2"> It is used in many religious expressions</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.450" end="01:27:16.025" style="s2"> The soul resonates with it</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.275" end="01:27:20.450" style="s2"> The picture on the right is Moses</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.500" end="01:27:25.775" style="s2"> Standing on the mountain and receiving the law</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.850" end="01:27:28.325" style="s2"> When we talk about &quot;Exodus&quot;, we will talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.450" end="01:27:34.400" style="s2"> Suppose</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.475" end="01:27:36.950" style="s2"> Suppose we can talk about &quot;Exodus&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.000" end="01:27:39.500" style="s2"> Where did this happen</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.500" end="01:27:41.400" style="s2"> Above the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.425" end="01:27:44.600" style="s2"> This is a pyramid right</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.700" end="01:27:46.500" style="s2"> High to the stratosphere</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.625" end="01:27:49.250" style="s2"> In the sky you look up</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.250" end="01:27:52.000" style="s2"> What happened to Moses</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.000" end="01:27:54.650" style="s2"> This is a clue I can think of</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.250" end="01:27:56.525" style="s2"> Read Jean Piaget&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.525" end="01:27:57.950" style="s2"> Let me figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.025" end="01:28:00.175" style="s2"> Piaget’s view on the child part is</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.175" end="01:28:02.150" style="s2"> They learned to play first</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.726" end="01:28:04.006" style="s2"> But they don&#39;t understand the rules</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.134" end="01:28:06.758" style="s2"> Means if there are a group of children together</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.758" end="01:28:07.974" style="s2"> They can play games</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.974" end="01:28:09.766" style="s2"> But if you pull out a young child</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.766" end="01:28:13.350" style="s2"> For example, when you are six years old and ask what the rules of the game are</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.350" end="01:28:15.654" style="s2"> They can only give you ambiguous descriptions</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.846" end="01:28:17.382" style="s2"> So you found out the first six-year-old child</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.574" end="01:28:18.918" style="s2"> He will tell you some rules</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.046" end="01:28:20.902" style="s2"> The second six-year-old will tell you some different rules</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.902" end="01:28:23.910" style="s2"> The third six-year-old will tell you something different</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.910" end="01:28:25.126" style="s2"> But if you put them together</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.126" end="01:28:26.278" style="s2"> They can play smoothly</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.278" end="01:28:28.838" style="s2"> They have concrete knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.838" end="01:28:31.206" style="s2"> Concretely individual or collective</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.206" end="01:28:33.638" style="s2"> This knowledge has not been extracted</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.638" end="01:28:34.790" style="s2"> Then they grow up</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.790" end="01:28:36.390" style="s2"> You can extract the rules</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.966" end="01:28:39.078" style="s2"> Then they can start playing the game according to the rules</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.078" end="01:28:40.806" style="s2"> Piaget’s final step is</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.806" end="01:28:42.982" style="s2"> Children don’t just play by the rules</p>

<p begin="01:28:47.270" end="01:28:48.166" style="s2"> First you can play</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.166" end="01:28:49.318" style="s2"> Then you can play according to the rules</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.318" end="01:28:51.046" style="s2"> Then you may realize</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.046" end="01:28:52.390" style="s2"> Because he doesn&#39;t think everyone can recognize this</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.390" end="01:28:54.758" style="s2"> You are actually the ruler</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.758" end="01:28:56.550" style="s2"> This is not to say that the rules are arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.126" end="01:29:00.838" style="s2"> It means you can be a rule maker</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.966" end="01:29:02.630" style="s2"> On the premise that you know how to play</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.694" end="01:29:05.190" style="s2"> Piaget thinks this is the path of moral development</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.190" end="01:29:06.854" style="s2"> I think this is exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.854" end="01:29:08.710" style="s2"> What happened to Moses in &quot;Exodus&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.710" end="01:29:11.590" style="s2"> Moses led all the Israelites</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.590" end="01:29:14.854" style="s2"> They have no laws and no legislators</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.854" end="01:29:16.134" style="s2"> They have tradition</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.134" end="01:29:17.862" style="s2"> They are very grumpy</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.862" end="01:29:19.462" style="s2"> Because they are in the desert</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.462" end="01:29:20.998" style="s2"> They were under tyranny before</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.998" end="01:29:22.534" style="s2"> Now in the desert</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.534" end="01:29:24.070" style="s2"> Not much better</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.070" end="01:29:26.054" style="s2"> So they are very angry about this</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.054" end="01:29:27.718" style="s2"> They worship the wrong idol</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.718" end="01:29:30.086" style="s2"> Disaster ensued</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.086" end="01:29:34.310" style="s2"> Then they asked Moses to preside over justice</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.310" end="01:29:37.638" style="s2"> He has been doing this for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.638" end="01:29:40.518" style="s2"> The grumpy Israelis complained to Moses</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.518" end="01:29:42.694" style="s2"> &quot;He did this and she did that.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.025" end="01:29:46.086" style="s2"> Moses had to figure out how to reconcile them</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.086" end="01:29:48.710" style="s2"> He did this for so long that his</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.710" end="01:29:50.054" style="s2"> I remember his father-in-law</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.054" end="01:29:51.334" style="s2"> Tell him to stop doing this</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.334" end="01:29:52.806" style="s2"> Because he&#39;s almost exhausting himself</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.806" end="01:29:55.174" style="s2"> You will think about what happened here</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.175" end="01:30:00.806" style="s2"> I am not assuming this is a true historical story</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.806" end="01:30:02.534" style="s2"> I think this is a condensed story</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.534" end="01:30:06.630" style="s2"> Every group has a set of customs</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.630" end="01:30:08.678" style="s2"> Like a pack of wolves</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.678" end="01:30:11.110" style="s2"> These customs are being revealed</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.110" end="01:30:13.222" style="s2"> There are some godsends observing and thinking</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.222" end="01:30:16.358" style="s2"> What are the rules for this situation</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.358" end="01:30:17.766" style="s2"> What are the rules for that situation</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.766" end="01:30:19.174" style="s2"> What about this situation</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.174" end="01:30:21.158" style="s2"> Then in his imagination</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.158" end="01:30:23.270" style="s2"> These rules become a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.270" end="01:30:25.702" style="s2"> Then climb the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.702" end="01:30:27.110" style="s2"> He would miss my goodness</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.110" end="01:30:29.862" style="s2"> This is the rule we have always lived by</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.862" end="01:30:32.678" style="s2"> This is the revelation of the commandment</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.678" end="01:30:34.278" style="s2"> What else</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.278" end="01:30:37.414" style="s2"> Is it because there are rules first and then fulfilled?</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.414" end="01:30:45.094" style="s2"> Wrong should be action and fulfillment first</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.094" end="01:30:47.014" style="s2"> Then you can understand the purpose of everyone doing this</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.014" end="01:30:48.742" style="s2"> You say that everyone sees this as your goal</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.742" end="01:30:51.750" style="s2"> Then everyone thinks it makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.750" end="01:30:54.566" style="s2"> Otherwise who follows these rules</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.566" end="01:30:55.782" style="s2"> No one will follow these rules</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.782" end="01:30:57.830" style="s2"> If they don’t match the established situation</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.830" end="01:30:59.878" style="s2"> You just think it&#39;s unfair</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.878" end="01:31:02.310" style="s2"> Here it is depicted as</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.310" end="01:31:05.190" style="s2"> An earth-shaking human event</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.190" end="01:31:08.262" style="s2"> Oh my God, we have always been just apes</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.262" end="01:31:10.246" style="s2"> We have lived in the authority hierarchy for so long</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.246" end="01:31:11.782" style="s2"> We are totally unaware of what we are doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.782" end="01:31:13.636" style="s2"> Suddenly it was dark</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.636" end="01:31:15.825" style="s2"> Wake up to the pen of God</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.899" end="01:31:19.203" style="s2"> We can say that this is the law</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.523" end="01:31:21.379" style="s2"> Do you say it was given by god</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.379" end="01:31:24.323" style="s2"> It depends on your definition of God</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.323" end="01:31:25.859" style="s2"> You can start from this preset</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.859" end="01:31:28.163" style="s2"> But it is definitely not made out of nothing</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.163" end="01:31:32.131" style="s2"> It’s interesting that Nietzsche observed something else</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.323" end="01:31:34.691" style="s2"> He said moral enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.691" end="01:31:39.235" style="s2"> It was formed after a very long process</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.235" end="01:31:42.627" style="s2"> From the initial structure to the later idea</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.755" end="01:31:45.955" style="s2"> This is tens of millions of years</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.211" end="01:31:48.125" style="s2"> Formed custom</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.125" end="01:31:52.425" style="s2"> Before you get the enlightenment of written law</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.817" end="01:31:55.185" style="s2"> What should the working mode be described as</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.377" end="01:31:58.065" style="s2"> What is the mode that works</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.065" end="01:32:00.369" style="s2"> It&#39;s a game you play with others</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.369" end="01:32:03.313" style="s2"> Never degenerate day after day</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.209" end="01:32:06.897" style="s2"> Piaget another insight</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.897" end="01:32:08.881" style="s2"> Is the concept of equilibrium</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.009" end="01:32:11.825" style="s2"> It is Immanuel Kant</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.825" end="01:32:13.361" style="s2"> The extension of the concept of universal axioms</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.361" end="01:32:15.473" style="s2"> Act in a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.473" end="01:32:17.201" style="s2"> So that every behavior can become a universal law</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.201" end="01:32:20.145" style="s2"> This is Kant&#39;s most basic moral axiom</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.145" end="01:32:21.809" style="s2"> Piaget changed a little</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.809" end="01:32:23.793" style="s2"> He said it&#39;s not exactly like this</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.921" end="01:32:27.057" style="s2"> Acting in a certain way for you</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.057" end="01:32:29.617" style="s2"> Now next week next month</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.617" end="01:32:32.177" style="s2"> The next year ten years later</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.177" end="01:32:34.097" style="s2"> Will still work</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.097" end="01:32:36.209" style="s2"> And to the people around you</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.209" end="01:32:38.001" style="s2"> And the whole society is effective</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.001" end="01:32:40.433" style="s2"> This is the state of balance</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.561" end="01:32:41.713" style="s2"> You can think of it as</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.713" end="01:32:45.169" style="s2"> A hint of heaven coming to the city of God</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.169" end="01:32:49.329" style="s2"> It is based on the idea that &quot;morality must be repeatable&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.329" end="01:32:52.145" style="s2"> There are many</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.145" end="01:32:56.753" style="s2"> Trading game simulated by artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.035" end="01:33:01.363" style="s2"> In the artificial intelligence system</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.363" end="01:33:02.899" style="s2"> People who study the emergence of moral behavior</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.899" end="01:33:04.627" style="s2"> Already discovered</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.627" end="01:33:06.163" style="s2"> One of the most important elements in moral analysis</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.163" end="01:33:08.800" style="s2"> Repeatability</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.275" end="01:33:11.222" style="s2"> You cannot participate in degraded games</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.286" end="01:33:14.230" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s degenerating</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.486" end="01:33:16.470" style="s2"> The game you want to play</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.470" end="01:33:18.902" style="s2"> At least stable over time</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.902" end="01:33:21.078" style="s2"> If you really do it properly</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.078" end="01:33:23.702" style="s2"> Maybe it will get better</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.702" end="01:33:25.750" style="s2"> Of course this is what you want your family to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.750" end="01:33:27.798" style="s2"> This is what you have been trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.798" end="01:33:31.659" style="s2"> Unless you want revenge and destruction</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.659" end="01:33:32.619" style="s2"> Is there a way</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.619" end="01:33:34.283" style="s2"> Can keep us playing together</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.283" end="01:33:36.483" style="s2"> Can make this common game better day by day</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.850" end="01:33:38.450" style="s2"> This is what you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.725" end="01:33:42.283" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think this is arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.283" end="01:33:43.627" style="s2"> This is why I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.627" end="01:33:46.507" style="s2"> These postmodernists are really wrong</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.507" end="01:33:51.499" style="s2"> They say there are countless ways to interpret this world</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.499" end="01:33:52.971" style="s2"> This is true</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.971" end="01:33:54.955" style="s2"> But the error is</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.955" end="01:33:55.723" style="s2"> they said</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.723" end="01:33:59.691" style="s2"> No way of explanation can be higher than the other</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.691" end="01:34:02.059" style="s2"> So wrong</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.635" end="01:34:05.387" style="s2"> This is the root of everything</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.387" end="01:34:07.371" style="s2"> The proper explanation must be</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.371" end="01:34:09.227" style="s2"> This is Piaget’s view</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.227" end="01:34:10.891" style="s2"> If you and I are going to play a game</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.891" end="01:34:13.003" style="s2"> Rule one we must all want to participate</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.835" end="01:34:16.011" style="s2"> Rule two others should allow us to play</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.139" end="01:34:18.315" style="s2"> Rule three we should make this game</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.315" end="01:34:21.195" style="s2"> Last long without letting it degenerate</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.195" end="01:34:22.347" style="s2"> Maybe rule four is</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.347" end="01:34:23.627" style="s2"> When we are participating in the game</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.627" end="01:34:25.163" style="s2"> This world won&#39;t kill us</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.275" end="01:34:27.975" style="s2"> There are not many proper games</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.975" end="01:34:30.539" style="s2"> You don&#39;t want your kids to play on the highway, right</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.539" end="01:34:33.355" style="s2"> They can&#39;t play hockey on the highway</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.355" end="01:34:34.955" style="s2"> Because the world will kill them</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.300" end="01:34:38.027" style="s2"> There are infinite ways to explain this world</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.027" end="01:34:40.331" style="s2"> But the solutions are not infinite</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.100" end="01:34:43.467" style="s2"> The solution is constrained in the real world</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.467" end="01:34:44.875" style="s2"> Constrained by our suffering in the world</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.325" end="01:34:48.300" style="s2"> Also constrained by the fact that we constrain others</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.499" end="01:34:52.683" style="s2"> I think this is the beginning of the big mistake</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.425" end="01:35:07.075" style="s2"> If you understand the meaning of these ancient paintings</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.075" end="01:35:08.225" style="s2"> They look very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.225" end="01:35:11.400" style="s2"> Recently I found</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.650" end="01:35:15.725" style="s2"> Once I understand the rationality behind it</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.925" end="01:35:17.300" style="s2"> The painter put a lot of effort into this</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.300" end="01:35:18.575" style="s2"> This is a print, isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.575" end="01:35:20.575" style="s2"> They spent a lot of time to carve this painting</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.575" end="01:35:22.000" style="s2"> They are serious about it</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.125" end="01:35:23.725" style="s2"> When you understand the meaning of the painting</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.475" end="01:35:32.725" style="s2"> These people are surrendered to the enlightenment of the law</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.725" end="01:35:34.375" style="s2"> This is not surprising</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.375" end="01:35:35.800" style="s2"> Try to break the rules and see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.800" end="01:35:37.725" style="s2"> You try to violate the universal moral law</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.725" end="01:35:38.525" style="s2"> See how it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.875" end="01:35:40.775" style="s2"> I can always see people in this situation</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.775" end="01:35:42.400" style="s2"> You have all seen everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.550" end="01:35:43.800" style="s2"> Maybe I have seen more than you</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.800" end="01:35:45.800" style="s2"> Because I am a clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.025" end="01:35:49.375" style="s2"> If the person who came to consult me ​​did not violate the universal law</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.400" end="01:35:50.800" style="s2"> Then i can be sure</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.800" end="01:35:51.875" style="s2"> Someone around him must have violated the universal law</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.875" end="01:35:53.425" style="s2"> This is not a joke</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.425" end="01:35:57.550" style="s2"> If you make a mistake, things get really bad</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.550" end="01:36:02.375" style="s2"> When the system that regulates our being is revealed</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.375" end="01:36:05.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s no surprise that you will feel frightened</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.200" end="01:36:07.775" style="s2"> One thing in the Old Testament is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.775" end="01:36:09.675" style="s2"> Nietzsche once commented on it</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.675" end="01:36:11.675" style="s2"> He highly praised the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.675" end="01:36:13.150" style="s2"> But the evaluation of the New Testament is average</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.150" end="01:36:16.275" style="s2"> He believes that Europe will use the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.275" end="01:36:18.275" style="s2"> It is sinful to merge with the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.275" end="01:36:19.825" style="s2"> Because Nietzsche believed that the Old Testament was</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.825" end="01:36:24.300" style="s2"> Accurate presentation of the phenomenology of &quot;being&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.300" end="01:36:27.875" style="s2"> It&#39;s like saying to stay awake and pay attention to words</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.875" end="01:36:30.475" style="s2"> Be honest and stay alert</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.475" end="01:36:32.150" style="s2"> Because of something you don&#39;t want to happen</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.150" end="01:36:34.375" style="s2"> Very likely to happen</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.375" end="01:36:35.850" style="s2"> Maybe not just you</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.850" end="01:36:37.300" style="s2"> Maybe everyone you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.300" end="01:36:38.800" style="s2"> Everything in your culture</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.800" end="01:36:42.800" style="s2"> Will be destroyed generation after generation</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.375" end="01:36:45.050" style="s2"> So it’s best to stay awake and alert</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.050" end="01:36:49.400" style="s2"> I think only when people are arrogant</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.400" end="01:36:50.950" style="s2"> Will turn a deaf ear to this</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.950" end="01:36:53.825" style="s2"> I think most people understand this truth deep in their hearts</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.825" end="01:36:55.675" style="s2"> When you become a bit self-righteous</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.675" end="01:36:57.075" style="s2"> This happens often</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.075" end="01:36:58.500" style="s2"> If you haven&#39;t lost your mind, you will think</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.500" end="01:37:01.500" style="s2"> I&#39;d better be careful and low-key</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.500" end="01:37:03.420" style="s2"> If i am too bloated</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.420" end="01:37:05.975" style="s2"> Things that make me stumble will happen</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.975" end="01:37:09.200" style="s2"> Everyone knows that arrogant soldiers will lose</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.950" end="01:37:11.500" style="s2"> So the Old Testament says</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.500" end="01:37:13.425" style="s2"> The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.250" end="01:37:17.275" style="s2"> During my years as a clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.275" end="01:37:19.275" style="s2"> The one thing that really scares me is</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.275" end="01:37:22.325" style="s2"> I have never seen anyone</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.325" end="01:37:25.650" style="s2"> Can get away with anything even once</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.525" end="01:37:27.725" style="s2"> There is an old saying</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.725" end="01:37:30.625" style="s2"> God has a book that records everything in heaven</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.625" end="01:37:34.975" style="s2"> Ok maybe it&#39;s not a book</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.375" end="01:37:38.475" style="s2"> But it’s useful to hold this idea</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.875" end="01:37:40.125" style="s2"> You may not agree</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.125" end="01:37:42.225" style="s2"> Think that people always get away with something</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.225" end="01:37:43.700" style="s2"> I tell you I have never seen such a fluke</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.700" end="01:37:46.150" style="s2"> What I see is when something happens</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.150" end="01:37:49.350" style="s2"> Someone distorted the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.350" end="01:37:51.475" style="s2"> And &quot;success&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.475" end="01:37:53.700" style="s2"> Because there was no rebound</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.700" end="01:37:55.050" style="s2"> Then for example two years later</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.050" end="01:37:57.625" style="s2"> The truth comes from the sky</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.625" end="01:37:59.625" style="s2"> They will think it&#39;s so unfair</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.625" end="01:38:01.225" style="s2"> Then let’s go back and analyze</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.425" end="01:38:03.475" style="s2"> What happened before this</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.625" end="01:38:05.100" style="s2"> Before this incident</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.100" end="01:38:06.650" style="s2"> What about before this</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.650" end="01:38:07.525" style="s2"> Go back further</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.525" end="01:38:11.925" style="s2"> Oh, it&#39;s the bane of this thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.925" end="01:38:17.700" style="s2"> You cannot not be bounced while distorting the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.700" end="01:38:20.075" style="s2"> The reality is not developing as you wish. Why</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.425" end="01:38:22.775" style="s2"> What are you going to do to distort the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.775" end="01:38:23.875" style="s2"> I do not think so</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.000" end="01:38:25.675" style="s2"> I think reality is stronger than you</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.675" end="01:38:28.325" style="s2"> And I think one thing people are often bewitched is</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.325" end="01:38:30.700" style="s2"> Do you think you can escape by chance</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.700" end="01:38:32.400" style="s2"> Okay you try</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.400" end="01:38:33.725" style="s2"> You see if it works</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.725" end="01:38:36.000" style="s2"> You can&#39;t escape anything</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.275" end="01:38:38.250" style="s2"> Realizing that this is the beginning of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.250" end="01:38:40.250" style="s2"> Something scares me</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.315" end="01:38:43.225" style="s2"> Since last September</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.225" end="01:38:45.800" style="s2"> I have received more public attention</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.800" end="01:38:48.500" style="s2"> One thing that keeps me scared is making mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.500" end="01:38:51.175" style="s2"> I know very well that no one can fault a sage</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.175" end="01:38:53.850" style="s2"> But thank god i haven&#39;t done one thing wrong</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.850" end="01:38:55.375" style="s2"> Or that no one has discovered yet</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.675" end="01:39:01.150" style="s2"> But we are walking on thin ice</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.150" end="01:39:02.375" style="s2"> At the same time fortunately</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.375" end="01:39:04.650" style="s2"> Things around us have not deteriorated to the point of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.650" end="01:39:07.775" style="s2"> And didn&#39;t get out of order quickly</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.775" end="01:39:10.325" style="s2"> Staying true to the right way is not easy</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.325" end="01:39:12.900" style="s2"> You know when you walk the right way</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.900" end="01:39:15.425" style="s2"> Because when you are on the right path</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.425" end="01:39:16.550" style="s2"> Things will become meaningful and fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.550" end="01:39:19.650" style="s2"> But if you don’t really feel</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.650" end="01:39:21.975" style="s2"> The terrible consequences of deviating</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.975" end="01:39:23.625" style="s2"> Then you haven&#39;t really awakened</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.025" end="01:39:26.475" style="s2"> This is what I saw in this painting</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.475" end="01:39:30.850" style="s2"> It seems to say be careful because there are rules in the world</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.000" end="01:39:34.025" style="s2"> If you go against it, no one can help you</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.625" end="01:39:46.425" style="s2"> So for me there is something to consider</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.425" end="01:39:49.025" style="s2"> I talked about something in the last Q&amp;A session</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.025" end="01:39:52.525" style="s2"> Combine the New Testament with the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.525" end="01:39:55.100" style="s2"> One of the benefits</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.100" end="01:39:57.375" style="s2"> Seems to be a change in morality</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.375" end="01:40:00.700" style="s2"> This is similar to Piaget’s idea which is</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.700" end="01:40:02.725" style="s2"> After you learn to play the game according to the rules</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.725" end="01:40:04.500" style="s2"> You will learn to make rules</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.500" end="01:40:06.500" style="s2"> To some extent i think</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.500" end="01:40:08.175" style="s2"> The transition between the Old Testament and the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.175" end="01:40:10.175" style="s2"> That&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.550" end="01:40:13.325" style="s2"> Most morals in the Old Testament are prohibitions</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.325" end="01:40:14.975" style="s2"> These things you shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.975" end="01:40:16.250" style="s2"> As it should be</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.250" end="01:40:17.975" style="s2"> You ask your child so</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.975" end="01:40:19.975" style="s2"> Always tell them not to do this or that</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.525" end="01:40:21.650" style="s2"> Especially when they have fun</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.650" end="01:40:24.225" style="s2"> You always remind them not to get overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.225" end="01:40:25.825" style="s2"> Because whatever they are doing will cause trouble</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.825" end="01:40:27.900" style="s2"> If you are a parent, you know this is a headache</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.900" end="01:40:30.325" style="s2"> But the first rule of morality is the prohibition</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.300" end="01:40:34.125" style="s2"> You have to control yourself to avoid trouble for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.125" end="01:40:35.925" style="s2"> If you remember this</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.925" end="01:40:36.725" style="s2"> And do well</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.725" end="01:40:38.875" style="s2"> Once you become self-disciplined</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.600" end="01:40:42.475" style="s2"> You can start doing something positive</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.475" end="01:40:44.800" style="s2"> In my opinion this shift</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.800" end="01:40:47.925" style="s2"> Is the New Testament and the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.925" end="01:40:49.625" style="s2"> A common basic feature</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.625" end="01:40:51.725" style="s2"> But looking at these images, they still seem to be prompting</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.725" end="01:40:54.525" style="s2"> Serve Tradition Serve God</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.525" end="01:40:57.875" style="s2"> From a psychological point of view</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.875" end="01:41:02.100" style="s2"> Support tradition because this is the foundation of your life</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.100" end="01:41:04.250" style="s2"> There is a book about Mesopotamian mythology</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.250" end="01:41:05.525" style="s2"> Called &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.525" end="01:41:08.125" style="s2"> If you are interested, you can read it</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.125" end="01:41:11.375" style="s2"> Improper behavior of the creation gods</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.375" end="01:41:12.450" style="s2"> They are like two year olds</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.450" end="01:41:14.450" style="s2"> In fact, many of them look like two-year-old children</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.750" end="01:41:18.325" style="s2"> They killed the primitive god Abozu</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.625" end="01:41:19.925" style="s2"> Abozu is the head of the gods</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.925" end="01:41:21.550" style="s2"> They killed him and tried to live on his body</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.250" end="01:41:23.425" style="s2"> This is what we all do</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.750" end="01:41:25.700" style="s2"> Because we live on the corpses of our ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.700" end="01:41:27.525" style="s2"> You can say living on our cultural corpse</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.525" end="01:41:30.325" style="s2"> It is dead and not a good place to live</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.325" end="01:41:31.600" style="s2"> You must constantly activate your culture</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.600" end="01:41:35.100" style="s2"> So that it can stay alive and sober</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.100" end="01:41:37.800" style="s2"> If you stay on the &quot;corpse&quot; for too long</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.800" end="01:41:40.800" style="s2"> The devil or Chaos Demon will make a comeback</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.800" end="01:41:42.575" style="s2"> Mesopotamian mythology tells such a story</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.575" end="01:41:44.900" style="s2"> It&#39;s like saying don&#39;t delusion</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.900" end="01:41:47.925" style="s2"> While staying on your ancestor’s corpse for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.925" end="01:41:52.400" style="s2"> Without contributing to the lasting update of the survival system</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.400" end="01:41:56.825" style="s2"> Because of all the constrained chaos</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.825" end="01:41:58.450" style="s2"> Will come back to you eventually</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.450" end="01:42:01.875" style="s2"> In stories like &quot;The Hobbit&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.875" end="01:42:04.075" style="s2"> Hobbits are very kind</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.075" end="01:42:05.850" style="s2"> They are short and fat</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.850" end="01:42:08.050" style="s2"> They are not smart but arrogant</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.050" end="01:42:10.675" style="s2"> They know nothing about the wider world outside</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.675" end="01:42:13.125" style="s2"> If you remember they were protected by big steppers</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.125" end="01:42:14.975" style="s2"> Striders are the king’s descendants</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.975" end="01:42:16.200" style="s2"> Looks like a tramp</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.200" end="01:42:17.975" style="s2"> The hobbit has nothing but looks down on the big stepper</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.975" end="01:42:19.525" style="s2"> Big stepper patrolling the border</p>

<p begin="01:42:21.400" end="01:42:25.450" style="s2"> But beyond the border</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.450" end="01:42:28.550" style="s2"> Chaos is forming</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.550" end="01:42:30.675" style="s2"> This is a prototype story</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.675" end="01:42:32.275" style="s2"> This is why people like it so much</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.275" end="01:42:35.125" style="s2"> That&#39;s how we are like hobbits</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.125" end="01:42:39.700" style="s2"> The spirit of our dead ancestors protects us from chaos</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.700" end="01:42:41.625" style="s2"> And we foolishly know nothing about it</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.625" end="01:42:43.625" style="s2"> We feel we don&#39;t need them anymore</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.625" end="01:42:47.850" style="s2"> This is exactly what the university is doing to the humanities</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.850" end="01:42:49.450" style="s2"> This is jaw-dropping</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.450" end="01:42:53.025" style="s2"> If we don’t wake up, we will pay for it</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.025" end="01:42:54.350" style="s2"> We have hope to awaken</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.350" end="01:42:56.350" style="s2"> It&#39;s better than paying</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.350" end="01:42:58.625" style="s2"> Although it is painful to stay awake</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.050" end="01:43:02.100" style="s2"> There was a picture in my mind once</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.100" end="01:43:07.225" style="s2"> I portray the world like this</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.225" end="01:43:09.300" style="s2"> I think the world is not a pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.300" end="01:43:11.575" style="s2"> It is not a single authority hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.575" end="01:43:12.850" style="s2"> It&#39;s not like this</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.850" end="01:43:15.650" style="s2"> It is a series of authority levels</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.650" end="01:43:17.550" style="s2"> You can imagine a vast expanse of plains</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.550" end="01:43:20.525" style="s2"> There are only one pyramid on this vast plain</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.525" end="01:43:23.200" style="s2"> Inside the pyramid are people of all levels</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.200" end="01:43:25.300" style="s2"> Everywhere in sight</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.300" end="01:43:27.800" style="s2"> Row upon row of these pyramids</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.800" end="01:43:28.700" style="s2"> Canine</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.700" end="01:43:30.850" style="s2"> The plain is endless</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.850" end="01:43:34.050" style="s2"> Here are all the positions you can climb to</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.050" end="01:43:36.975" style="s2"> Everyone is crowded inside the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.975" end="01:43:38.700" style="s2"> Strive for</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.700" end="01:43:41.125" style="s2"> Then there is such a possibility above everything</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.125" end="01:43:42.600" style="s2"> It can glide through the air</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.600" end="01:43:44.950" style="s2"> See the structure of the pyramid in action</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.950" end="01:43:48.100" style="s2"> This is the all-seeing eye above the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.100" end="01:43:49.850" style="s2"> It sees the structure of the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.850" end="01:43:53.550" style="s2"> The highest law of being is not at the top of the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.550" end="01:43:56.550" style="s2"> But when you work towards the top of the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.550" end="01:43:58.875" style="s2"> Obtained iron law and self-control</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.875" end="01:44:01.100" style="s2"> Liberate yourself from the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.100" end="01:44:02.525" style="s2"> Take it to the next level</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.525" end="01:44:06.300" style="s2"> I think this is the concept of &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.300" end="01:44:08.025" style="s2"> A form of being instantiated</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.950" end="01:44:14.100" style="s2"> I think this is similar to Sisyphus</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.100" end="01:44:16.375" style="s2"> About Sisyphus, if I remember correctly, Nietzsche said</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.375" end="01:44:18.875" style="s2"> &quot;One must imagine that Sisyphus is happy.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.900" end="01:44:21.900" style="s2"> If there is a rock at the foot of the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.900" end="01:44:23.550" style="s2"> You might as well push it up the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.550" end="01:44:24.750" style="s2"> If the rock slides down</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.750" end="01:44:26.600" style="s2"> Then you have something to do, right?</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.600" end="01:44:28.100" style="s2"> Push the annoying rock up the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.100" end="01:44:31.525" style="s2"> There is no shortage of rocks to be moved to the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.525" end="01:44:33.225" style="s2"> After all, this is the purpose</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.225" end="01:44:37.025" style="s2"> Let&#39;s deal with pushing annoying stones uphill</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.025" end="01:44:39.750" style="s2"> Maybe we will have enough confidence</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.750" end="01:44:41.450" style="s2"> And self-esteem</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.450" end="01:44:43.975" style="s2"> So we don’t have hatred and vengeance</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.975" end="01:44:45.500" style="s2"> And my heart is going to destroy the world</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.500" end="01:44:47.125" style="s2"> Because I think this is also a choice</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.700" end="01:44:49.600" style="s2"> Sisyphus is not cowardly</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.600" end="01:44:51.325" style="s2"> You can see this</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.925" end="01:44:56.500" style="s2"> A similar example is Atlas Hercules</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.500" end="01:44:58.750" style="s2"> He volunteered to lift the earth on his shoulders</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.750" end="01:45:02.475" style="s2"> It’s like Christ took all the sins in the world</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.475" end="01:45:05.325" style="s2"> The concept behind this is the same</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.325" end="01:45:07.525" style="s2"> The idea is that you should recognize</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.525" end="01:45:11.400" style="s2"> The horror of your own humanity and bear it</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.400" end="01:45:12.825" style="s2"> Exactly what it means</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.825" end="01:45:14.925" style="s2"> The interesting thing is</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.925" end="01:45:18.775" style="s2"> If you realize the horror of your own humanity</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.775" end="01:45:21.650" style="s2"> Than before</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.650" end="01:45:23.100" style="s2"> You will immediately have more respect for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.100" end="01:45:26.275" style="s2"> Knowing that you are a monster is great</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.275" end="01:45:27.825" style="s2"> Put it this way you are a monster</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.825" end="01:45:29.825" style="s2"> Doesn&#39;t mean you have to be a monster</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.825" end="01:45:32.650" style="s2"> But it’s useful to know that you are a monster</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.025" end="01:45:35.975" style="s2"> Jung realized one thing</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.975" end="01:45:39.150" style="s2"> This is also the magical thing I saw in his article</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.150" end="01:45:41.500" style="s2"> I think this makes him</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.500" end="01:45:42.575" style="s2"> Different from Joseph Campbell and others</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.575" end="01:45:44.575" style="s2"> Campbell once said &quot;whatever you like&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.575" end="01:45:47.950" style="s2"> And Jung’s view is the first step of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.950" end="01:45:49.650" style="s2"> Is to meet the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.075" end="01:45:51.675" style="s2"> What he meant by this sentence</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.925" end="01:45:54.525" style="s2"> Every terrible thing humans do</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.525" end="01:45:56.525" style="s2"> Are committed by humans</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.525" end="01:45:58.525" style="s2"> You are one of them</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.975" end="01:46:01.000" style="s2"> Don’t understand that the consequences can be serious</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.000" end="01:46:02.400" style="s2"> To really understand its meaning</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.400" end="01:46:05.600" style="s2"> To figure out why you can do evil</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.600" end="01:46:08.425" style="s2"> It&#39;s crumble to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.425" end="01:46:10.550" style="s2"> Try to imagine yourself as a</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.550" end="01:46:12.875" style="s2"> People involved in medieval torture</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.875" end="01:46:15.025" style="s2"> See how you can do this</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.025" end="01:46:17.025" style="s2"> See that you will be reborn</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.025" end="01:46:21.275" style="s2"> Rebirth after seeing clearly will be incredibly beneficial</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.275" end="01:46:24.125" style="s2"> When you know that you can do evil</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.125" end="01:46:25.800" style="s2"> You become a completely different you</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.800" end="01:46:28.575" style="s2"> I think this is what I learned from Jung</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.575" end="01:46:31.950" style="s2"> You can&#39;t be a good person until you understand</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.950" end="01:46:34.050" style="s2"> How evil is your heart</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.050" end="01:46:35.350" style="s2"> Impossible</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.350" end="01:46:37.700" style="s2"> Part of the reason is that you don&#39;t have this potential</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.375" end="01:46:41.000" style="s2"> If you are naive and kind</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.000" end="01:46:43.225" style="s2"> If you don’t harm even one fly</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.225" end="01:46:44.975" style="s2"> You do not have any of the above abilities</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.975" end="01:46:47.450" style="s2"> Why should others take you seriously</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.983" end="01:46:50.650" style="s2"> You are a domestic animal at best</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.650" end="01:46:52.925" style="s2"> And it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.925" end="01:46:54.650" style="s2"> This is weird</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.650" end="01:46:58.575" style="s2"> Because you don’t think about the revealing of evil</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.575" end="01:47:01.175" style="s2"> Is the prerequisite basis for goodness</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.175" end="01:47:04.325" style="s2"> First, if you don’t know the consequences of doing evil</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.325" end="01:47:06.325" style="s2"> Why should you care</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.325" end="01:47:10.400" style="s2"> Try to pursue good</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.225" end="01:47:14.200" style="s2"> You need to take these things seriously</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.200" end="01:47:17.100" style="s2"> This is not a child&#39;s game, is it</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.100" end="01:47:19.275" style="s2"> This is a game for mature adults</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.275" end="01:47:22.550" style="s2"> I realized this when I had children</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.700" end="01:47:24.700" style="s2"> There is a chapter in my new book called</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.700" end="01:47:27.375" style="s2"> &quot;Never let your kids do things that make you hate them&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.025" end="01:47:29.050" style="s2"> Why i say that</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.050" end="01:47:32.625" style="s2"> I wrote this after realizing I was a monster</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.082" end="01:47:35.825" style="s2"> I think i need to make sure i love my child</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.675" end="01:47:38.675" style="s2"> I want to make sure they behave appropriately by my side</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.675" end="01:47:39.700" style="s2"> So i can like them</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.700" end="01:47:41.700" style="s2"> I am much taller and older than them</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.700" end="01:47:43.975" style="s2"> More cruel and ruthless than them</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.975" end="01:47:47.775" style="s2"> My evil thoughts are far beyond their imagination</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.775" end="01:47:50.875" style="s2"> If they irritate me</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.300" end="01:47:53.575" style="s2"> I will definitely use evil thoughts on them</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.575" end="01:47:57.425" style="s2"> If you think you can’t do this</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.425" end="01:48:00.725" style="s2"> Then you must be the one doing this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.200" end="01:48:18.325" style="s2"> I&#39;m afraid we won&#39;t be able to tell the story of Adam and Eve today</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.175" end="01:48:22.000" style="s2"> I have watched a very good documentary</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.425" end="01:48:23.925" style="s2"> Called &quot;The &quot;Professional Killer&quot; Hart&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.050" end="01:48:25.425" style="s2"> This documentary is about Brett Hart</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.725" end="01:48:28.500" style="s2"> He was once the most famous Canadian in the world</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.625" end="01:48:32.350" style="s2"> He is a wrestler in the World Wrestling League</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.350" end="01:48:33.825" style="s2"> A good man</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.050" end="01:48:37.125" style="s2"> He comes from a famous wrestling family</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.150" end="01:48:38.450" style="s2"> Located in Alberta</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.475" end="01:48:39.800" style="s2"> I remember he had seven brothers in total</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.825" end="01:48:41.450" style="s2"> All wrestlers and seven sisters</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.500" end="01:48:43.125" style="s2"> All the sisters are also married to wrestlers</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.200" end="01:48:46.825" style="s2"> They are all children of Stuart Hart</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.875" end="01:48:51.000" style="s2"> Hart was a wrestling manager 40 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.400" end="01:48:53.400" style="s2"> This is a great documentary</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.400" end="01:48:55.400" style="s2"> Because i am always curious</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.400" end="01:49:00.250" style="s2"> Why people watch and believe in wrestling shows</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.750" end="01:49:04.050" style="s2"> Do you believe in movies when you watch movies?</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.950" end="01:49:06.475" style="s2"> This is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.475" end="01:49:07.627" style="s2"> You believe when you are watching</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.627" end="01:49:09.375" style="s2"> So when you watch a wrestling show</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.375" end="01:49:10.325" style="s2"> And is a fan</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.325" end="01:49:11.300" style="s2"> Do you believe in this show</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.300" end="01:49:12.925" style="s2"> In fact it’s not about believing</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.925" end="01:49:15.150" style="s2"> It&#39;s about whether you are immersed in the plot</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.150" end="01:49:17.350" style="s2"> There are many different levels of plots in the world</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.350" end="01:49:20.875" style="s2"> The wrestling story may not be</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.875" end="01:49:23.375" style="s2"> The most complicated plot</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.175" end="01:49:27.750" style="s2"> I&#39;m not saying this to be smart</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.225" end="01:49:31.475" style="s2"> Plots of different complexity are suitable for different people</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.475" end="01:49:33.025" style="s2"> This is why religious truth</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.025" end="01:49:35.350" style="s2"> Exist on multiple levels simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.350" end="01:49:37.375" style="s2"> To apply to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.375" end="01:49:40.700" style="s2"> It is difficult to build such a belief system</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.725" end="01:49:43.525" style="s2"> It is suitable for the most mature people</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.525" end="01:49:45.200" style="s2"> Also suitable for ordinary people</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.425" end="01:49:48.300" style="s2"> Back to wrestling Blatter Hart is a good guy</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.375" end="01:49:50.500" style="s2"> He fits the archetype of &quot;good guy&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.500" end="01:49:52.900" style="s2"> This is the subject of this documentary</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.925" end="01:49:54.150" style="s2"> It’s a bit too difficult for him to act as the prototype of a &quot;good guy&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.850" end="01:49:58.825" style="s2"> He manages an image very carefully</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.250" end="01:50:02.550" style="s2"> He knew that about 120 million people knew him</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.575" end="01:50:05.000" style="s2"> He will be regarded as a hero wherever he goes</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.025" end="01:50:07.250" style="s2"> Later he found that it was a big burden</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.250" end="01:50:09.400" style="s2"> You can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.450" end="01:50:12.100" style="s2"> He performed in the arena</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.125" end="01:50:14.375" style="s2"> Classic duel of good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.375" end="01:50:17.375" style="s2"> Not conceptually or verbally</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.375" end="01:50:19.925" style="s2"> It’s shown in practice</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.925" end="01:50:22.850" style="s2"> Like Thor and the Hulk</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.875" end="01:50:24.375" style="s2"> Just in front of your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.625" end="01:50:29.550" style="s2"> This is the same kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.550" end="01:50:32.475" style="s2"> We can think that hockey is more refined than wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.475" end="01:50:34.700" style="s2"> Maybe but I said before</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.700" end="01:50:38.800" style="s2"> My views on the above are not critical</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.800" end="01:50:40.475" style="s2"> I understand their purpose</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.475" end="01:50:42.250" style="s2"> I highly recommend everyone to watch this documentary</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.250" end="01:50:43.575" style="s2"> A very good work</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.600" end="01:50:45.600" style="s2"> This is the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.650" end="01:50:47.325" style="s2"> This is a silver cup</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.325" end="01:50:48.850" style="s2"> This person is a hero in a single team</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.925" end="01:50:51.300" style="s2"> This team is the hero of all teams</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.300" end="01:50:53.275" style="s2"> This is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.475" end="01:50:57.700" style="s2"> If you are a fan of the Toronto Blue Jays</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.750" end="01:50:59.100" style="s2"> Or a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.125" end="01:51:01.375" style="s2"> Of course you will rarely have this experience</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.375" end="01:51:02.175" style="s2"> If you are a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.175" end="01:51:03.000" style="s2"> Because they always lose</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.225" end="01:51:09.253" style="s2"> If you watch a game and the team you support wins</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.253" end="01:51:12.728" style="s2"> Test your testosterone level at this time it rises</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.728" end="01:51:16.675" style="s2"> If you watch a Toronto Maple Leafs game they lose</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.675" end="01:51:17.300" style="s2"> And you are their fan</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.300" end="01:51:19.325" style="s2"> Then your testosterone level will drop</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.375" end="01:51:20.825" style="s2"> This is really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.975" end="01:51:25.450" style="s2"> Can you see how deeply these plots affect people?</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.450" end="01:51:28.250" style="s2"> It can affect your biochemistry</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.250" end="01:51:30.450" style="s2"> Your testosterone level is like saying</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.450" end="01:51:32.525" style="s2"> &quot;Oh, my team lost.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.525" end="01:51:36.900" style="s2"> It’s like saying, &quot;Tonight is definitely not going to be strong anymore.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.800" end="01:51:59.375" style="s2"> Phenomenologically speaking, this is the universe</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.375" end="01:52:05.040" style="s2"> I realized</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.040" end="01:52:06.800" style="s2"> This is true</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.250" end="01:52:09.600" style="s2"> Is true not metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.600" end="01:52:11.650" style="s2"> This is much deeper than a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.075" end="01:52:14.750" style="s2"> The most true thing about life is</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.750" end="01:52:17.075" style="s2"> Known domain and unknown domain</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.475" end="01:52:20.675" style="s2"> You can call this the explored territory and the unexplored territory</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.675" end="01:52:23.225" style="s2"> It&#39;s true this has existed a long time ago</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.225" end="01:52:24.325" style="s2"> Early to the time when the lobster appeared</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.325" end="01:52:26.050" style="s2"> If you put the lobster in a new environment</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.100" end="01:52:28.225" style="s2"> They will patrol the territory first</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.225" end="01:52:29.350" style="s2"> Find hiding place</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.450" end="01:52:30.925" style="s2"> And build a nest</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.925" end="01:52:32.032" style="s2"> So the first thing they do is</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.032" end="01:52:36.325" style="s2"> Build the known from the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.375" end="01:52:37.100" style="s2"> This is the so-called real a</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.100" end="01:52:39.275" style="s2"> Is true from the perspective of Darwinism</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.300" end="01:52:40.500" style="s2"> We think it’s true from the perspective of Darwinism</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.500" end="01:52:43.375" style="s2"> True enough</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.375" end="01:52:44.775" style="s2"> Because we are all creatures</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.775" end="01:52:46.200" style="s2"> So the theory of evolution is closely related to us</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.975" end="01:52:48.725" style="s2"> This is the Taoist Tai Chi diagram</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.725" end="01:52:54.625" style="s2"> What it shows is what constitutes the experience since ancient times</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.625" end="01:52:57.675" style="s2"> Very simple chaos and order</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.500" end="01:53:01.250" style="s2"> Orderly existence in chaos</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.250" end="01:53:03.400" style="s2"> There is chaos in order</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.825" end="01:53:06.500" style="s2"> This is the way of life</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.500" end="01:53:07.425" style="s2"> This is life itself</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.425" end="01:53:08.575" style="s2"> You should always be</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.575" end="01:53:10.175" style="s2"> The boundary between order and chaos</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.175" end="01:53:11.600" style="s2"> why</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.600" end="01:53:15.325" style="s2"> Stable enough and focused enough</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.850" end="01:53:17.725" style="s2"> You are not only doing what you should do</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.725" end="01:53:20.157" style="s2"> And it also makes you more likely</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.157" end="01:53:21.557" style="s2"> Do better tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.050" end="01:53:25.575" style="s2"> You can feel the state of concentration</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.575" end="01:53:27.575" style="s2"> You are at the right time and place</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.575" end="01:53:31.250" style="s2"> Your nervous system will make you feel this</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.250" end="01:53:34.950" style="s2"> This is the meaning of transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.950" end="01:53:40.000" style="s2"> I also think that is the antidote to the pain of existentialism</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.150" end="01:53:42.100" style="s2"> The antidote to the pain of existentialism is</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.125" end="01:53:44.450" style="s2"> At the right time and place</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.825" end="01:53:47.325" style="s2"> Be professional</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.350" end="01:53:53.000" style="s2"> Anxiety and pain are the reality of existential pain</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.275" end="01:53:56.375" style="s2"> When you are at the right time and place</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.400" end="01:53:58.000" style="s2"> What will happen to your biochemistry</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.000" end="01:53:59.850" style="s2"> Dopamine secretion</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.875" end="01:54:00.975" style="s2"> What can it do</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.400" end="01:54:04.400" style="s2"> It can suppress anxiety and relieve pain</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.400" end="01:54:05.525" style="s2"> Not only that</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.525" end="01:54:07.425" style="s2"> Because dopamine also makes people happy</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.425" end="01:54:09.025" style="s2"> Make people willing to move forward</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.025" end="01:54:10.650" style="s2"> This is also the basis of creativity</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.150" end="01:54:14.075" style="s2"> So not only from a neurochemical perspective</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.075" end="01:54:15.550" style="s2"> You get a positive experience</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.550" end="01:54:20.750" style="s2"> Your pain and anxiety are also relieved</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.275" end="01:54:22.750" style="s2"> This is not an assumption</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.825" end="01:54:25.475" style="s2"> Dopamine system</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.475" end="01:54:26.925" style="s2"> Which is the system responsible for biological exploration</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.925" end="01:54:29.050" style="s2"> It is extremely ancient and far beyond imagination</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.050" end="01:54:32.650" style="s2"> The dopamine system will be very suitable for you</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.875" end="01:54:37.000" style="s2"> Motivated by receiving new information</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.025" end="01:54:38.025" style="s2"> This is human nature</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.050" end="01:54:39.925" style="s2"> We are hungry for information</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.925" end="01:54:41.600" style="s2"> We want to be safe</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.600" end="01:54:44.475" style="s2"> But at the same time, we must build on a sense of security</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.475" end="01:54:47.075" style="s2"> We want to do it for ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.075" end="01:54:48.150" style="s2"> We want to do this for others</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.150" end="01:54:49.686" style="s2"> We want to do this for the family</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.686" end="01:54:51.286" style="s2"> We also want to do this for society</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.286" end="01:54:54.636" style="s2"> We want to unite the world to achieve this goal</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.636" end="01:54:55.925" style="s2"> It makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.925" end="01:54:57.781" style="s2"> God knows if you really do this</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.781" end="01:54:59.531" style="s2"> How much suffering can the world reduce</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.531" end="01:55:02.175" style="s2"> We can’t think if we do everything well</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.200" end="01:55:04.350" style="s2"> How high can we achieve</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.350" end="01:55:05.850" style="s2"> Maybe we can stop a lot</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.850" end="01:55:07.325" style="s2"> Frustrating things in life</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.625" end="01:55:11.325" style="s2"> We have stopped many bad things in the past hundred years</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.325" end="01:55:14.375" style="s2"> Things are much better now than 100 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.375" end="01:55:15.950" style="s2"> Of course it&#39;s not perfect now</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.950" end="01:55:18.650" style="s2"> But 120 years ago compared to 100 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.650" end="01:55:20.625" style="s2"> At that time, the average person in the West</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.625" end="01:55:23.025" style="s2"> I live on less than one dollar a day</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.025" end="01:55:24.275" style="s2"> In today&#39;s dollar</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.275" end="01:55:25.800" style="s2"> You try to live like that for a week</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.800" end="01:55:27.250" style="s2"> See how fun it is</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.775" end="01:55:31.275" style="s2"> What does this Taoist Taiji picture mean?</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.275" end="01:55:33.925" style="s2"> This is the chaos before the universe was born</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.925" end="01:55:36.600" style="s2"> The Word of God at the Beginning of Time</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.600" end="01:55:38.025" style="s2"> The order that can be accommodated is extracted from it</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.025" end="01:55:40.700" style="s2"> It&#39;s all the same</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.700" end="01:55:44.125" style="s2"> We will discuss chaos later</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.125" end="01:55:47.000" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s complicated to describe</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.175" end="01:55:51.475" style="s2"> When the World Trade Center collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.475" end="01:55:52.675" style="s2"> What you are facing is &quot;Chaos&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.600" end="01:55:56.875" style="s2"> Do you still remember how you felt at that time?</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.400" end="01:56:00.775" style="s2"> Peace in the world on September 10</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.775" end="01:56:02.100" style="s2"> Everyone knows what the world is like</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.100" end="01:56:03.850" style="s2"> Then the 911 incident happened</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.850" end="01:56:07.175" style="s2"> Everyone was dumbfounded for three days</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.175" end="01:56:09.825" style="s2"> Because the World Trade Building fell</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.500" end="01:56:12.100" style="s2"> What if it falls</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.100" end="01:56:13.350" style="s2"> You can see the collapse of a building</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.500" end="01:56:14.650" style="s2"> You can understand</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.650" end="01:56:16.550" style="s2"> What happens when a building collapses</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.550" end="01:56:18.900" style="s2"> Then why are you all dumbfounded</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.900" end="01:56:21.125" style="s2"> When the building collapsed in the order we lived in</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.175" end="01:56:24.027" style="s2"> Chaos turned out</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.027" end="01:56:25.825" style="s2"> This is really a successful terrorist attack</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.825" end="01:56:28.900" style="s2"> Everyone was stunned and curious</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.900" end="01:56:31.625" style="s2"> Because this is a normal human response to the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.650" end="01:56:33.375" style="s2"> Like facing a shark</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.400" end="01:56:37.725" style="s2"> Remember the famous poster from the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.725" end="01:56:39.700" style="s2"> There is a woman swimming on the water</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.725" end="01:56:44.525" style="s2"> A terrifying giant shark is waiting for an opportunity below</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.525" end="01:56:45.475" style="s2"> This is life</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.500" end="01:56:46.675" style="s2"> This is the world</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.675" end="01:56:48.350" style="s2"> You will experience this from time to time</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.350" end="01:56:50.950" style="s2"> When something in your life collapses like the World Trade Center</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.000" end="01:56:53.100" style="s2"> You remember the abyss under your feet</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.125" end="01:56:55.100" style="s2"> The primitive abyss</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.100" end="01:56:58.950" style="s2"> So bottomless and you are fragile</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.975" end="01:57:01.050" style="s2"> When you are betrayed</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.100" end="01:57:03.600" style="s2"> Or when your dream is shattered, you can realize it</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.675" end="01:57:05.175" style="s2"> You encountered chaos</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.175" end="01:57:06.675" style="s2"> This chaos is the origin of the world</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.775" end="01:57:11.400" style="s2"> You have to pay attention, you have to do the Tao</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.400" end="01:57:13.250" style="s2"> To bring the world back to order</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.325" end="01:57:19.325" style="s2"> None of the above is superstition</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.375" end="01:57:20.900" style="s2"> The above is not even a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.125" end="01:57:22.550" style="s2"> All true</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.825" end="01:57:24.800" style="s2"> And more real than anything else</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.800" end="01:57:26.800" style="s2"> I think part of the reason is</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.675" end="01:57:30.200" style="s2"> Life has always been like this</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.250" end="01:57:35.625" style="s2"> This is the law of life since ancient times</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.825" end="01:57:39.050" style="s2"> This is the universe is reality</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.050" end="01:57:40.350" style="s2"> This is the environment we are in</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.200" end="01:57:44.575" style="s2"> The so-called neo-atheists</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.575" end="01:57:47.000" style="s2"> I don’t want to deviate too much from discussing new atheists</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.200" end="01:57:50.200" style="s2"> Because I think atheists are always very honest</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.200" end="01:57:52.200" style="s2"> And their analysis is consistent</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.175" end="01:57:57.700" style="s2"> But I don’t think they take this issue seriously</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.050" end="01:58:01.000" style="s2"> I think they are</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.000" end="01:58:05.500" style="s2"> Not serious enough</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.050" end="01:58:14.700" style="s2"> I don’t think you can deny such a point of view</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.700" end="01:58:19.950" style="s2"> The more profound the impact of a thing on the screening of life</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.950" end="01:58:21.600" style="s2"> The more real it is</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.075" end="01:58:25.550" style="s2"> This is the axiom of Darwinian biology</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.000" end="01:58:28.100" style="s2"> I think the Darwinian world is more</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.100" end="01:58:29.725" style="s2"> The physical world is more real</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.725" end="01:58:33.550" style="s2"> I tried to argue this point with Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.550" end="01:58:35.950" style="s2"> I&#39;m not doing well</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.950" end="01:58:37.525" style="s2"> But the second conversation is ok</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.075" end="01:58:41.025" style="s2"> Take this problem seriously</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.025" end="01:58:45.950" style="s2"> This is a very serious and meaningful proposition</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.900" end="01:58:48.325" style="s2"> Whether people know it or not</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.325" end="01:58:49.800" style="s2"> They are all playing roles and want to play roles</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.600" end="01:58:52.375" style="s2"> This picture is Marduk</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.275" end="01:58:56.225" style="s2"> Marduk&#39;s story</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.225" end="01:58:57.900" style="s2"> Let me talk briefly</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.525" end="01:59:02.725" style="s2"> At the beginning of time, Diamat and Abzu hugged and joined</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.750" end="01:59:06.450" style="s2"> They are the gods of salt water and fresh water</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.450" end="01:59:07.475" style="s2"> Chaos and order</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.325" end="01:59:10.175" style="s2"> They created yin and yang</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.200" end="01:59:12.725" style="s2"> They also created the world of gods</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.775" end="01:59:13.810" style="s2"> These gods to me</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.825" end="01:59:16.300" style="s2"> Just like the source of power at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.975" end="01:59:20.700" style="s2"> They are like anger and love etc.</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.700" end="01:59:23.025" style="s2"> Occupy us from ancient times to the present</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.025" end="01:59:24.375" style="s2"> Also floods the whole world</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.650" end="01:59:28.025" style="s2"> They murdered their father Abozu ignorantly</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.300" end="01:59:31.475" style="s2"> They lived a life of drunkenness and then killed Abozu</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.800" end="01:59:36.425" style="s2"> Diamatt learned of this, this picture shows Diamatt</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.850" end="01:59:38.750" style="s2"> Looks terrible</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.600" end="01:59:40.575" style="s2"> She is the mother of all things</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.575" end="01:59:43.075" style="s2"> She is very unhappy about it</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.800" end="01:59:47.300" style="s2"> Her children killed the structure itself</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.350" end="01:59:49.200" style="s2"> Besides, they are noisy and careless</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.200" end="01:59:50.225" style="s2"> She wants to do it</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.275" end="01:59:54.382" style="s2"> She is like God in Noah’s story</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.382" end="01:59:55.500" style="s2"> Similar to the Same Work</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.550" end="01:59:57.600" style="s2"> Diamatt is back and say yes you guys</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.625" end="01:59:58.875" style="s2"> It&#39;s endless, right?</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.925" end="02:00:00.325" style="s2"> I want to clean up you</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.350" end="02:00:02.875" style="s2"> She made a lot of monsters</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.925" end="02:00:06.875" style="s2"> Then pick the worst monster to lead them</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.925" end="02:00:10.300" style="s2"> The monster&#39;s name is &quot;Jin Gu&quot;, the predecessor of Satan</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.300" end="02:00:14.810" style="s2"> She let the gods know that she is coming for revenge</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.810" end="02:00:16.175" style="s2"> The gods are not happy about this</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.675" end="02:00:20.225" style="s2"> They are gods but she is Chaos itself</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.225" end="02:00:21.800" style="s2"> Mother of all things</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.825" end="02:00:23.125" style="s2"> This is not a joke</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.150" end="02:00:26.325" style="s2"> The gods challenged Diamat one by one</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.350" end="02:00:28.500" style="s2"> One by one</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.500" end="02:00:29.700" style="s2"> Powerless</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.700" end="02:00:31.725" style="s2"> One day a new god appeared</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.775" end="02:00:32.650" style="s2"> He is Marduk</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.150" end="02:00:36.175" style="s2"> The gods found him extraordinary as soon as he was born</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.500" end="02:00:37.550" style="s2"> To know that time</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.550" end="02:00:40.450" style="s2"> The tribes of Mesopotamia are coming together to become</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.475" end="02:00:43.250" style="s2"> One of the first great civilizations in history</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.250" end="02:00:44.939" style="s2"> The gods of these tribes</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.975" end="02:00:48.275" style="s2"> Also brought together to form a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.275" end="02:00:51.394" style="s2"> To figure out what traits can rule everything</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.375" end="02:00:54.225" style="s2"> Marduk was chosen by the gods</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.225" end="02:00:57.225" style="s2"> He said, &quot;I can challenge Diamat.&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.225" end="02:00:58.300" style="s2"> But one thing</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.325" end="02:01:00.325" style="s2"> From now on you all will follow me</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.325" end="02:01:01.575" style="s2"> I come to master destiny</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.575" end="02:01:03.050" style="s2"> I am the head of the gods</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.050" end="02:01:04.800" style="s2"> I&#39;m at the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.975" end="02:01:07.525" style="s2"> Other gods said, &quot;No problem</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.525" end="02:01:11.575" style="s2"> &quot;As long as you solve the chaos, we will only look forward to you.&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.575" end="02:01:14.125" style="s2"> Marduk&#39;s head is full of eyes</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.125" end="02:01:15.250" style="s2"> And can vomit spells</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.275" end="02:01:16.800" style="s2"> This is his main characteristic</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.950" end="02:01:21.025" style="s2"> He brought a net to challenge Diamat</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.325" end="02:01:24.975" style="s2"> Besie her in a net</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.975" end="02:01:25.975" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.975" end="02:01:27.425" style="s2"> Because the net represents generalization</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.550" end="02:01:29.275" style="s2"> This is a conceptual summary</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.400" end="02:01:32.725" style="s2"> He surrounded chaos itself with conceptual structure</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.750" end="02:01:35.350" style="s2"> He trapped Diamat in the net and cut into pieces</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.450" end="02:01:36.975" style="s2"> Then he created the world</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.975" end="02:01:44.100" style="s2"> He created mankind</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.100" end="02:01:45.325" style="s2"> They live and serve the gods in this world</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.900" end="02:01:48.500" style="s2"> He created mankind with Jin Gu&#39;s blood</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.925" end="02:01:50.400" style="s2"> Jin Gu is the head of all demons</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.125" end="02:01:53.725" style="s2"> Colin Dyan one of my students</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.725" end="02:01:54.675" style="s2"> Helped me understand the problem</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.675" end="02:01:57.200" style="s2"> I think this is really pessimistic</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.050" end="02:02:00.625" style="s2"> This is like a metaphor for &quot;fallen&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.675" end="02:02:02.650" style="s2"> A view of original sin</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.650" end="02:02:07.800" style="s2"> My common conclusion on this with Diyang is</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.200" end="02:02:10.200" style="s2"> Human beings are the only</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.200" end="02:02:13.800" style="s2"> A creature that is truly capable of deceiving</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.300" end="02:02:15.925" style="s2"> We have the ability to do evil</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.925" end="02:02:17.700" style="s2"> Like in the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.700" end="02:02:18.775" style="s2"> We can do those things</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.800" end="02:02:19.825" style="s2"> That&#39;s why we are</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.825" end="02:02:22.275" style="s2"> Made by the blood of the head of all demons</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.425" end="02:02:26.925" style="s2"> We are creatures that can deceive the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.325" end="02:02:31.225" style="s2"> There was an emperor in Mesopotamia</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.237" end="02:02:35.950" style="s2"> This emperor is the incarnation of Marduk</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.950" end="02:02:37.325" style="s2"> This is the reason why he took the throne of God</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.325" end="02:02:39.450" style="s2"> Only by becoming Marduk can you be emperor</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.450" end="02:02:40.950" style="s2"> He wants to be a good Marduk</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.075" end="02:02:43.725" style="s2"> That means he needs to challenge Diamatt, Chaos</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.900" end="02:02:46.500" style="s2"> Break it into pieces and create order with corpses</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.700" end="02:02:49.769" style="s2"> Every new year celebration</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.769" end="02:02:51.386" style="s2"> Mesopotamians will walk out of the siege</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.386" end="02:02:54.225" style="s2"> From explored area to unexplored area</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.225" end="02:02:56.650" style="s2"> From the Siege into Chaos</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.650" end="02:02:59.375" style="s2"> And bring all the sculptures representing the gods</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.375" end="02:03:00.775" style="s2"> They put it into practice</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.775" end="02:03:04.375" style="s2"> Because they have to figure out the meaning</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.425" end="02:03:05.325" style="s2"> They put it into practice</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.525" end="02:03:07.100" style="s2"> They called the emperor over</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.175" end="02:03:08.850" style="s2"> Then the priest would make the emperor kneel</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.025" end="02:03:14.100" style="s2"> Let him take off his robe</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.375" end="02:03:16.225" style="s2"> Let him kneel and humiliate him</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.225" end="02:03:17.225" style="s2"> Beat him with gloves</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.550" end="02:03:19.625" style="s2"> Then say, &quot;Why this year</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.625" end="02:03:21.100" style="s2"> &quot;You didn&#39;t make a good Marduk.&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.900" end="02:03:23.850" style="s2"> The king will reflect on everything</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.850" end="02:03:26.625" style="s2"> His shortcomings in the fight against chaos</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.650" end="02:03:28.000" style="s2"> Then they will start celebrating the new year</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.050" end="02:03:29.475" style="s2"> Marduk finally won</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.475" end="02:03:32.450" style="s2"> And have sex with a royal prostitute</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.425" end="02:03:35.925" style="s2"> St. George</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.925" end="02:03:37.300" style="s2"> Retake the virgin from the dragon</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.300" end="02:03:38.450" style="s2"> same</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.550" end="02:03:41.950" style="s2"> If you face the serpentine chaos bravely</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.950" end="02:03:44.200" style="s2"> You can get something out of it</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.400" end="02:03:46.200" style="s2"> If you unite it</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.250" end="02:03:47.400" style="s2"> You can produce a creative order</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.400" end="02:03:49.150" style="s2"> This is what they show through action</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.200" end="02:03:53.000" style="s2"> This is the source of inspiration for the sovereignty of the Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.050" end="02:03:55.975" style="s2"> Really smart</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.575" end="02:03:59.775" style="s2"> The Mesopotamians have a profound influence on later civilizations</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.775" end="02:04:01.775" style="s2"> This huge influence continues to this day</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.075" end="02:04:03.075" style="s2"> This is a lot about</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.075" end="02:04:05.825" style="s2"> An example of a story derived from the concept of ruling power</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.825" end="02:04:08.375" style="s2"> This is the evolution of the concept of &quot;God&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.400" end="02:04:09.700" style="s2"> This is a thinking angle</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.725" end="02:04:11.275" style="s2"> But more importantly</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.300" end="02:04:15.700" style="s2"> This is the evolution of the concept of human atonement</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.700" end="02:04:19.475" style="s2"> One of the results of this concept is the story of the Buddha</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.475" end="02:04:20.875" style="s2"> The other is the story of Christ</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.875" end="02:04:22.350" style="s2"> The concept of perfect individual</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.625" end="02:04:25.125" style="s2"> This is at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.125" end="02:04:27.350" style="s2"> &quot;Tao&quot; speaks the truth into chaos</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.400" end="02:04:30.225" style="s2"> The birth of a good order that can be accommodated</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.250" end="02:04:31.875" style="s2"> This is the point of this story</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.200" end="02:04:33.525" style="s2"> In addition</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.675" end="02:04:41.175" style="s2"> Show you these images</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.175" end="02:04:42.747" style="s2"> Because they are so interesting</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.747" end="02:04:44.147" style="s2"> Once you know what they mean</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.147" end="02:04:45.025" style="s2"> You know how powerful it is</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.025" end="02:04:46.725" style="s2"> This is a symbol of infinity</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.000" end="02:04:47.950" style="s2"> That&#39;s Hercules</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.950" end="02:04:48.700" style="s2"> And Lena Hydra</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.825" end="02:04:49.925" style="s2"> What is life like</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.050" end="02:04:52.050" style="s2"> What happens if one head is cut off?</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.250" end="02:04:54.275" style="s2"> Seven more heads</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.275" end="02:04:55.900" style="s2"> What can you do to escape home</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.925" end="02:04:57.375" style="s2"> Can&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.375" end="02:04:59.075" style="s2"> This is what you should do</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.075" end="02:05:00.300" style="s2"> You have to fight it</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.150" end="02:05:08.550" style="s2"> Hydra is like the ultimate chaos, constantly producing small chaos</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.550" end="02:05:10.675" style="s2"> But chaos also brings life back to life</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.675" end="02:05:12.475" style="s2"> Otherwise, life will stay the same</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.250" end="02:05:21.250" style="s2"> This picture shows the heads of Mercury and Hydra</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.450" end="02:05:22.625" style="s2"> Hydra will petrify you</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.625" end="02:05:24.050" style="s2"> The middle picture is Saint George</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.200" end="02:05:26.725" style="s2"> He is slaying dragons peacefully, which is very interesting</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.825" end="02:05:28.375" style="s2"> There is a blessing expression on his face</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.375" end="02:05:29.975" style="s2"> This is a very special way of expression</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.975" end="02:05:32.675" style="s2"> This is another painting of St. George&#39;s Virgin in the background</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.700" end="02:05:35.200" style="s2"> If I remember correctly, she might be Saint Anne</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.450" end="02:05:41.825" style="s2"> Saint George is the patron saint of England</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.675" end="02:05:48.025" style="s2"> This illustrates the habit of mankind towards war</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.050" end="02:05:51.250" style="s2"> This is a muslim warrior</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.250" end="02:05:54.250" style="s2"> It’s easy to imagine the enemy as a dragon</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.625" end="02:05:56.725" style="s2"> Because the enemy is always a predator</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.725" end="02:05:59.625" style="s2"> We demonize the enemy without thinking</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.650" end="02:06:01.575" style="s2"> Then we can start a war with indignation</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.925" end="02:06:03.725" style="s2"> Because why not kill the snake</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.150" end="02:06:06.975" style="s2"> The question is where is the snake</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.975" end="02:06:09.475" style="s2"> Maybe they are on the outside, maybe they are on the inside</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.500" end="02:06:10.675" style="s2"> Maybe in this room</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.825" end="02:06:12.700" style="s2"> What&#39;s more terrifying is maybe in your heart</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.700" end="02:06:15.400" style="s2"> Wisdom is when you know that evil is in your heart</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.325" end="02:06:21.125" style="s2"> Why she is unhappy about it</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.325" end="02:06:24.600" style="s2"> Especially when she had a baby</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.600" end="02:06:25.825" style="s2"> Very seriously</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.950" end="02:06:35.900" style="s2"> This is the visual god of Horus</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.900" end="02:06:41.075" style="s2"> He is a falcon because falcons have excellent vision</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.275" end="02:06:43.575" style="s2"> They can see everything clearly when they fly over the world</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.675" end="02:06:46.250" style="s2"> This is the Egyptian god of creation Horus</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.275" end="02:06:48.700" style="s2"> I will tell the story of Horus from now on</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.475" end="02:06:55.024" style="s2"> These pictures show what I once called</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.750" end="02:06:59.250" style="s2"> The emergence of meta heroes from heroes</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.525" end="02:07:01.325" style="s2"> There is someone you admire</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.325" end="02:07:03.900" style="s2"> Then there is a group of people you admire</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.925" end="02:07:06.350" style="s2"> Then there is a meta collection of admirable people</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.375" end="02:07:08.300" style="s2"> And the refinement of ideals</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.300" end="02:07:11.900" style="s2"> I think this is what these pictures are going to show</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.375" end="02:07:22.025" style="s2"> This picture is quite remarkable</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.025" end="02:07:23.100" style="s2"> Very inscrutable picture</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.175" end="02:07:28.600" style="s2"> Jesus has asymmetrical faces on both sides</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.050" end="02:07:31.350" style="s2"> One side is God and the other side is mortal</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.350" end="02:07:32.625" style="s2"> This is the meaning of this holy portrait</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.025" end="02:07:35.525" style="s2"> A fully grown person</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.525" end="02:07:37.550" style="s2"> This is in this way of expression</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.550" end="02:07:39.325" style="s2"> One of the oldest works we know</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.325" end="02:07:46.200" style="s2"> The implication is that there is a human ordinaryness</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.200" end="02:07:49.175" style="s2"> It is also closely connected with sacredness</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.175" end="02:07:52.200" style="s2"> Is also willing to take the initiative</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.200" end="02:07:56.150" style="s2"> Responsibility as a limited life</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.150" end="02:07:57.775" style="s2"> Resulting in such a combination</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.775" end="02:07:59.725" style="s2"> And this is also reflected in a book</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.725" end="02:08:02.925" style="s2"> This is the words associated with the Son</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.925" end="02:08:05.075" style="s2"> This is the correct way of being</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.725" end="02:08:12.425" style="s2"> I think this is the perfect example</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.425" end="02:08:15.650" style="s2"> The process of a prototype emerging from the masses</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.650" end="02:08:17.975" style="s2"> I think so</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.500" end="02:08:30.725" style="s2"> I think we have finished the first chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.725" end="02:08:32.525" style="s2"> Although it took three lessons</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.800" end="02:08:35.630" style="s2"> I have to say that God is really complicated</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.625" end="02:08:49.350" style="s2"> thank you all</p>
