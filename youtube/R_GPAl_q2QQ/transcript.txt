 The Psychological Significance of the "Bible" Story Third Lecture "Genesis" Chapter One Summary-God and Authority Hierarchy by Jordan B. Peterson
 I have been looking forward to this lecture for a long time
 It’s not that I don’t care about other lectures
 What I want to explore tonight is the story of the Bible
 Something that shocked me in particular
 Especially the story of Cain and Abel
 Hope to tell this story later
 The length of the story is unbelievable
 Only about 10 to 11 lines
 Hardly said anything
 However, I found these short stories
 But can reveal endless truths
 I am not sure what caused this
 Given that I decided to use as rational as possible
 To analyze this problem
 I think this stems from the "Bible" story for a long time
 Intense refinement
 In a nutshell
 The information in the Bible story is so compressed and refined
 Make it difficult for people to come up with a corresponding explanation
 It’s hard to come up with an explanation that convinces me
 I think those old stories
 The "Bible" story we discussed before is very old
 One thing you can be sure of for these stories is
 All the memorable parts of the story have been remembered
 to some extent
 This is the same as Richard Dawkins
 The memetic theory is similar
 This is why I always feel that Dawkins
 More mysticism
 He would become Karl Jung
 Because the theories of the two are incredibly similar
 Memetic theory and the prototype of the collective subconscious
 Are very similar views
 But I think Jung’s views are much more profound
 Indeed Jung thought more thoroughly
 Because Dawkins tends to think of memes as a kind of brainworm
 It can erode the minds of many people
 However I don’t think Dawkins
 Give enough attention to this view
 He made a joke the last time he talked to Sam Harris
 They talked about
 Is there a possibility of memes
 As religious memes
 Changed the evolutionary history
 They immediately avoided that topic
 With a burst of laughter
 They decided to stay away from that topic
 It's fun for me
 Condensation of "Bible" story
 Makes me very confused
 It must be with people
 Can't forget that the Bible story is related
 This question can be empirically tested
 I don’t know if anyone has done a similar experiment
 You tell the unworldly two stories of equal length
 One contains the prototype theme and the other does not
 Wait until three months later
 Let’s observe which story people remember more deeply
 This kind of experiment is simple and straightforward
 I haven't started the experiment yet, maybe I will try it in the future
 But in short
 I am very excited about this lecture
 Because I will have the opportunity to talk about the story of Adam and Eve
 And the story of Cain and Abel
 I hope I can tell these two stories tonight
 It's better to tell the story of Noah and the Tower of Babel
 But given the progress in the past
 I don't have much hope for this
 But it doesn't matter
 Hardship
 Before you start
 I want to explain
 The psychological meaning of the concept of God
 I thought a lot about this
 Because this series of lectures gave me a chance and forced me
 Keep thinking
 I have a hypothesis for the concept of the Trinity
 This assumption is basically like this
 The concept of the Trinity first vividly embodies
 "There is a deep cognitive structure that enables consciousness
 "There is also consciousness itself"
 I mean the concept of "Holy Father"
 Similar to the "transcendental structure that enables consciousness"
 the concept of
 This is part of our birth
 It is our structure
 You can think of it as
 The product of long-term evolution
 I think it's not completely related to
 Conflicting views in the first chapter of Genesis
 At least from a metaphorical point of view
 It is difficult to interpret the literal meaning of the story of the Bible
 For example, it emphasizes day and night
 But if you understand it as
 Clock on the 24-hour clock
 It’s weird that day and night alternate
 When you think about the construction of the universe
 The literal meaning of the Bible is not reasonable
 There is one more point
 Many early Christian fathers
 For example, Origen
 As early as 300 AD
 These ancient "Bible" stories should be regarded as metaphors of wisdom
 Should not be rigidly understood word by word
 There is a saying
 People who established Christian doctrine
 All fundamentalists who strictly follow the literal meaning
 This is totally wrong in history
 Some of them used to be like this
 Still so
 But this is not the point
 Because most of them are not fundamentalists
 People two thousand years ago
 Not a fool
 They are fully capable of understanding
 Metaphorical content
 They also know that fictional stories are to some extent
 Can be regarded as an abstraction
 This kind of abstraction can reveal the truth that some documentary works cannot express
 Unless you think fictional works can only be pastime
 This idea is ridiculously wrong
 Good to continue
 In terms of the concept of the Father
 This concept refers to in order to be able to understand the world
 You must have a priori cognitive structure
 I mentioned this last time by Immanuel Kant
 Kant opposed the following argument
 "All the information we receive in our lifetime
 "Only input from sensory data"
 The reason why Kant criticized this argument is
 And his criticism is completely correct
 Sensory data cannot be parsed without a priori structure
 You can’t extract from sensory data
 Used to parse the structure of sensory data
 This is simply impossible
 This has also been confirmed
 Since the 1960s
 The first failure of artificial intelligence
 Is the best example of this view
 Because scientists started looking forward in the 1960s
 People will have practical autonomous robots
 And artificial intelligence
 People didn’t realize that
 This kept them stagnant until the 1990s
 The difficulty of the problem of "perception"
 Beyond anyone's understanding at the time
 When you observe the world around you
 Seems to have seen various objects
 Actually what you see is not an object
 But tools
 The neurobiological principle of this phenomenon is clear
 You are not observing the object and then speculating on its purpose
 But after observing the purpose, we can see what we see
 This is contrary to common sense
 The key is no matter what people see
 Is it an object or a tool with a certain purpose
 You will see them when you look at the world around you
 You think the action of "watching" is easy
 Because things can be seen everywhere
 As long as you turn your head, things appear in your vision
 This idea is ridiculously wrong
 The problem of "perception" is particularly difficult
 We haven’t built an autonomous robot yet
 One reason is
 Although we are a lot better than in the 1960s
 We found that you have to have a body first
 Ability to think
 more importantly
 You have to have a body before you can observe
 Because observation is essentially
 Is the model of the material world
 Mapped to the body pattern
 It’s not that things existed here first
 You see them and then you realize their existence
 Then you evaluate them
 Then you decide how to treat them
 Finally you start
 You can say that this is the
 Mental processing and perception
 But this is not the case
 Like human eyes
 Will map the light-sensitive signal to the spinal cord
 Will leave a mark in the emotional system
 So for example
 People who are blind may still feel the facial expressions of others
 In other words, patients with cortical blindness
 Their visual cortex is damaged, usually caused by a stroke
 They are physically invisible
 But it can sense which hand the tester raised
 When you show a picture of an angry or fearful face to the patient
 Patients will be emotionally full of pictures
 Skin conduction reaction
 This is due to the following reasons
 Assuming the world is composed of different patterns
 In fact
 Assuming these patterns
 Propagate to you through electromagnetic signals or light
 And after being replicated by the retina
 Transmission along the optic nerve
 Finally dispersed in the brain
 Some of these patterns make up a conscious vision
 Other modes only activate physical functions
 For example, I look at this
 What is the name of the bottle
 I look at the bottle especially when I think about the bottle
 I looked at the bottle
 Bottle model
 Activated the "squeeze" motion mechanism of my hand
 Part of this perception process is to adjust my body movements
 Including the "squeeze" movement of my hand
 Make it the best way to perform grabbing actions
 It’s not that I saw the bottle first in the process
 Think about how to hold the bottle
 That's too inefficient
 But I use sports cortex to perceive the bottle
 This process is independent of
 Look at the conscious experience of the bottle
 So anyway what I want to say is
 There are countless similar phenomena
 Rodney Brooks has a say in this
 He is a robotics engineer
 In the 1990s
 He invented the Roomba sweeping robot and other things
 This man is really a genius
 Brooks first pointed out
 In order to give the machine enough
 Perception ability to work normally
 Machine body
 The perception ability should be built from the body
 Instead of building down from abstract cognitive consciousness
 Later this view was confirmed
 Brooks in the 90s
 Made many strange small mechanical devices
 These devices have no actual brain
 But it can behave like staying away from the light source
 These devices can sense light
 Their perception behavior is
 The action of escaping from the light source
 Perception is closely related to action
 This is different from what people usually think
 In short I mean
 If you are not reified, you cannot know the world
 Your current way of representation has gone through
 It took about 3.5 billion years to take shape
 This process presupposes a lot of death
 Formed the concrete form you have today
 This process has gone through various trials and failures
 Just created a human like you
 Have enough ability to deal with the complex world
 To spend a relatively short 80 years of life
 So I think maybe my idea is wrong
 But I think this is at least a useful assumption
 I think the concept of the Father is similar to
 The birth of this view
 There is an internal structure
 Consciousness is born from it
 This structure gives form to things
 This idea is not necessarily right
 But if this assumption is correct
 It reflects what I described before
 Factual truth
 I also mentioned that I will
 Holy Spirit and Son Concept
 Especially in the form of Tao
 As an active consciousness generated and used by internal structure
 It not only conceives the world
 We do imagine the world
 At least imagine the world we see and experience
 It also changes and adjusts the world
 We undoubtedly did this
 Partly with our bodies
 Evolution makes our bodies suitable for these
 This is why we have hands
 And dolphins don't
 Although they also have human-like large-capacity brains
 But they can't change the world
 Humans adapt to changing the world through evolution
 Human words are an extension of hands-on ability
 Our discourse system is
 A well-developed motor skill
 Generally speaking
 The brain hemisphere you use to control language
 It's also the hemisphere of your dominant hand
 People said and gestured with their hands
 You saw me too
 We can sign language
 Hand use and language use
 Closely related
 Partly because language is a kind of creativity
 And the hand is also one of the forces that transform the world
 A priori structure
 Very closely linked
 Also closely related to the concrete structure
 I think this part explains
 Why the classic Christian doctrine is more than
 Emphasize the divinity of the Holy Spirit
 Also emphasizes the divinity of the body
 And this is even more difficult to understand
 Because you are more likely to think
 If you have religious thinking
 You are more likely to think that there is something transcendent in your body
 Not bound by a specific body
 It will continue after death
 And so on
 But Christianity is especially
 Emphasize that the body also has divinity
 This view of "there is implicit structure"
 Semi-patriarchal nature
 The reason is complicated
 But partly because it is a reflection of social structure
 Is also a reflection of other things
 And use awareness
 Especially linguistic consciousness
 The most important thing is to use sincere language
 Able to construct the world in a "good" way
 I think this is a powerful concept
 especially
 Sincere language can create good
 This is a very fundamental moral proposition
 I think this idea is difficult to refute
 One thing I noticed is
 Of course not only I noticed
 There is no denying that there are many tragedies in life
 Many people i met
 For example, patients in my clinical treatment
 Overwhelmed by misfortune in life
 But I also often see
 The person who can't get out of intrigue
 This deception network often lasts for generations
 Let them down
 Deception can cause extreme pain
 This pain will last a long time
 This is common sense in clinical practice
 Freud pointed out
 Cause pain
 Or a cause of mental illness and depression
 It's a lie deliberately concealed
 It's quite correct to think so
 Jung bluntly proposed
 Psychotherapy efforts
 And huge moral effort
 Including telling the truth is essentially the same
 He thinks that both are one thing
 Carl Rogers, another great clinician
 He was a Christian missionary
 Later he became a scientist
 Rogers believes that sincere dialogue
 Will produce clinical transformation
 Of course in clinical treatment
 One of the prerequisites for true transformation is
 Doctors and patients are sincere
 otherwise
 How can you know what happened
 You can’t do without knowing what the problem is
 To solve the problem
 And only the other party tells you the truth
 So you know where the problem is
 If you want to improve your relationship with others
 You should think about this
 If you don’t tell the people around you the truth
 They won't know you
 Maybe this is a good idea
 Sometimes people lie for a reason
 And not for trivial reasons
 But you must also know
 Unless you express the actual situation in good faith
 You can't touch the real problem
 If you can't reach the real problem
 It is basically impossible for you to solve the problem
 I'm still thinking about another thing
 The more i think
 This point of view becomes clearer
 This view is
 This view is partly
 Let me think about how to start well
 I have a friend who is also my business partner
 Also my thesis collaborator
 He is very smart
 I told you about him before and he accused me of using
 The word "dominant level"
 The term is used for creatures like chimpanzees and lobsters
 It might not matter
 But maybe it’s not even suitable for chimpanzees
 He said something very interesting
 He sees the concept of superiority level as
 Similar to the Marxist assumptions of the early 20th century
 A projection in animal society
 For example, "the chimpanzee mating level
 "Advantage hierarchy
 "It's built on power."
 He believes that this view is actually a projection of a certain political ideology
 His views troubled me for a long time
 Because I have been using the term superiority level
 After he told me this, I felt
 Ah so annoying
 Because what he said may be right
 I spent a few months thinking about this problem
 At the same time I am still reading Frans de Val
 He is a primatologist
 Still reading Jayak Panksip
 An outstanding emotional neurologist
 Unfortunately he just passed away
 His "Affective Neuroscience" is very good and it mentions
 The mice must play fairly
 If it's unfair, the rats won't participate in the play
 This is a shocking discovery
 Because anything can prove
 Specific examples of the origin of animal moral behavior
 This is related to the evolution process
 It is also the core of Panksaipu’s research
 Can prove
 Ethics that guide mankind
 Not just the construction of sociology and paraphenomenism
 But something more ingrained
 And mice, if my god, they are just mice
 You can't trust the mouse
 But they also pay attention to fairness when playing games
 Deval Discovery
 Among the chimpanzees he studied
 Savage orangutan ruled with an iron fist
 Did not become a successful ruler
 Because once the orangutan ruled with an iron fist leaks its decline
 Will be despised and trampled by him
 Chimpanzee companion torn to pieces
 Will be divided by five apes
 And a long-term orangutan leader
 It rules the stable orangutan kingdom
 They will be reciprocal to their "friends"
 Orangutans also have friends
 Their friendship can last a long time
 When dealing with females and baby orangutans
 They also take a lot of reciprocal behavior
 Deval is a very wise man
 I think this research is also basic scientific knowledge
 Because you have to know
 Factors that contribute to dominance in male dominance levels
 Sorry for using the term "male dominance level"
 Maybe it’s better to call it “authority”
 Or to say it scaryly "ability"
 It's better to think so
 This factor is not just based on
 Above barbaric power
 I still think
 The following view is a very absurd and dangerous political view
 That is, "in a law-abiding society
 "The male hierarchy is based on power."
 This view is very absurd
 You just have to think about the last month
 Not long
 You can understand how absurd this view is
 Most authority
 Are restricted by ethics
 They are more restricted than other lower ranks
 We can also understand this in business management books
 Because in general
 The pressure the manager receives from his subordinates
 More pressure than the subordinates get from the manager
 This is not surprising
 Do you want to manage 200 people
 Are you sure
 This is a chore
 I know the boss is usually annoying
 Because you have to care about what the boss thinks
 And your boss may be a bossy person
 And bossy bosses are generally not particularly successful
 But managing 200 people is really not a joke
 Shoulder this responsibility and authority
 You must always be careful
 Because people will keep pointing out your mistakes
 So it's not that
 You are in a higher position in the hierarchy
 The moral restraint on you is less
 Of course if you are a psychopath
 That's another matter
 But the psychopath has to be in a different hierarchy
 Keep running
 Because people will soon see through psychopaths
 Once they are ruined
 Their tricks cannot continue to succeed
 all in all
 Behavior patterns are very interesting
 Imagine how sexual selection is done
 We know sexual selection
 Is a very, very powerful biological force
 Although after Charles Darwin created the theory of evolution,
 Biologists have ignored sexual selection for more than 100 years
 Only focus on natural selection
 Biologists don't wait to see sexual choices
 Because it will change the concept of mind
 Join the evolution process
 Because sexual selection involves the process of selection
 Now imagine that there is a male hierarchy
 People at the top of this hierarchy
 Than those at the bottom
 Easier to reproduce successfully
 This is especially true for men
 Number of female ancestors of a person
 Will be twice as many as its male ancestors
 I don't want to do calculations
 Although this sounds unreasonable
 But you can look through your own family tree
 The actual situation happens to be
 There are twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors
 Is due to the possibility that women will have offspring on average
 Twice as much as men
 Any male who reproduces
 Tends to multiply
 And the other group of males have zero reproductive opportunities
 An average male who reproduces has two offspring
 Of course, a male who has no chance of reproduction has zero offspring on average
 An average female who reproduces has one offspring
 In other words, in a person’s pedigree
 There are twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors
 This matter is not trivial
 Imagine something like this
 Men choose a capable admirer
 I can't say that this person is dominant
 He is given authority and respect
 Say so
 Just like election
 Can be democratically elected
 But at least an election that everyone agrees
 Or at least
 "We still have to keep him right now, let’s not kill it."
 This is also a form of election
 Is a form of tolerance
 What happens next is
 Women as far as they are concerned
 Will select partners from the top of the male hierarchy
 So there are two factors
 Drives human sexual selection
 A long-term evolutionary process
 One is aimed at men by men
 Election of who can get a position with greater breeding opportunities
 The second is women from
 The tendency of men to start selecting partners at the top of the male dominance hierarchy
 This works well in every culture
 Even if you evened out between men and women
 Socioeconomic inequality
 Such as the situation in Northern Europe
 You can't effectively reduce women
 The tendency to select a partner from the top of the male hierarchy
 You don't want to lower
 Women are smart
 Why don't they go
 To pursue relationships with relatively successful men
 Why don’t they let men define themselves first
 What is success
 It makes sense
 If you want to figure out who is the best male
 Why not let men compete on their own
 No matter what kind of competition
 The final winner
 Is the best male by definition
 How else would you define it
 Why i say this
 The reason is I think
 Election of male dominance in the process of human evolution
 And the victory of sexual selection
 Have complex interactions
 If it's true, it's no small matter
 Because of this
 With evolution
 Males will be more and more optimized towards the apex of male rank
 Because men who are not good at this way have no offspring
 So it must be
 But then there is more than one level system
 Because it will produce a bunch of different levels
 You will ask whether there are commonalities between different levels
 This is a reasonable question
 At least the different levels are not completely opposed
 If you are relatively successful in a hierarchy
 Then you are in another hierarchy
 The possibility of success will be greater
 This is a right
 A good definition of general intelligence or IQ
 Intelligence is actually a factor in women choosing men
 Of course men also choose women like this
 But men are more pressured to choose than women
 IQ can help you
 One of the factors to climb different dominance levels
 Because it is a universal mechanism for solving problems
 Another factor to some extent
 Conscientiousness
 There is evidence that women tend to choose conscientious men
 It's reasonable, why not
 Such men are trustworthy and work hard
 These are advantages
 Then you will think
 Men have adapted to climbing the male dominance hierarchy
 They adapted to climb
 Various grade systems
 Then you will think that there are so many different attributes
 Can be put into practice
 Can be reified
 These attributes can increase successful summit
 The possibility of
 In the end you will think
 As people get used to it
 They will start to understand
 What makes up this pattern
 This becomes a multidimensional ability
 Abstract representation
 Such as the abstraction of virtue
 All of these are not generated at will
 But firmly rooted in the physiology
 I think this view is difficult to refute
 I have such a habit when I think
 When i think about something
 It will take a long time to figure out if your opinion is wrong
 I will try to start from every possible angle
 To examine whether this view is tenable
 If it’s hard to get a foothold, then I’d rather discard it
 Turn to thinking about better ideas
 I spent a long time trying to figure out
 What is wrong with this view
 Because in my opinion it's quite unbreakable
 This view is like this
 Like when people watch a movie
 And so on, when you read novels
 Obviously people are good at
 Distinguish between the pros and the villains
 Villains are generally bad guys
 It's the kind of deliberate deliberate for authority and high position
 But people who fail in the end are generally like this
 So he is a good negative example
 If you take a child to watch a movie that is a party
 He soon knew that he should not be a villain
 And quickly focused on the positive person
 this means
 Models of good people in fictional works
 There is an affinity with the child’s perception
 I told my son when he was young
 The movie I took him to see
 Sometimes it’s really scary
 What I told him was
 I never tell him don't be afraid
 I don't think this is good advice for children
 I'm talking about focusing on the hero character
 I kept emphasizing this sentence with him
 He looked very attentively and was often scared
 Because some movies are really scary
 Then he focused on good people and looked forward to it
 You know it's like this when watching movies
 Generally speaking, you want good people to win
 Why do you think this way? Where does this idea come from
 Have you noticed how deep-rooted this idea is in your heart
 You line up to buy movie tickets to see how good people win
 It's hard to understand
 But people think it’s so self-evident that they don’t notice
 This is actually a huge mystery
 So is the following idea unreasonable
 That is, we have concluded such a collective conclusion for thousands of years
 What is the best good person
 What is the worst bad guy
 Archeologically speaking, I regard this opposition as hostile brothers
 Like Christ and Satan or Cain and Abel
 Hostile brothers are a very common mythological theme
 These are the prototypes of good people and bad people
 For example, Satan’s definition is the worst bad guy
 These are just conceptually speaking, the definition of Christ is
 Is the best one can be
 I am discussing this issue from a psychological and conceptual sense
 Given our imagination and ability to invest in fictional works
 Love for fiction and ability to dramatize things
 And the love of heroism stories, disaster stories and good and evil stories
 I can't think of any other explanation for this
 This part drives the formation
 The concept of "the evolution of the concept of God"
 More specifically it drove the evolution of the concept of the Trinity
 At least in part
 God is an abstract ideal incarnation of its formation
 Incarnation of ideal
 Separated from any concrete avatar or ruler
 There is also such a rule in the "Bible" story
 I mentioned before that when people started to move existing rulers
 When confused with abstract ideals
 The country immediately fell into tyranny
 Everything collapsed instantly
 This is actually very complicated
 What people found
 It's actually hard to find
 That is you have to put abstract concepts
 Take it out of any specific power structure
 And treat it as
 An abstract concept
 But it is also a real thing
 It exists because it governs your behavior
 And everyone’s actions including the sovereign
 The monarch must also be responsible for this abstract ideal
 You see this is really incredible
 What did people think about 5000 years ago
 You can notice something
 Often appears in the Old Testament of the Bible
 Let’s take the Israelis as an example
 Whenever the king of Israel becomes omnipotent
 The true God will appear and crush them
 Then the whole country fell apart
 For hundreds of years
 I think what I want to teach us
 We have not been able to clearly understand
 This is still very implicit in the narrative
 We haven't been able to figure out why this is the case
 I find it difficult for you to ignore this argument
 Ok we talked about this before
 The concept of the Trinity is like this
 The Holy Father should be said to be the basic structure of consciousness
 A dramatic performance
 Or the concrete structure of consciousness
 Next is the Son, it is consciousness
 But in a specific historical form
 This point about the image of the Son is quite interesting
 There is also a form of consciousness
 Can be seen as the inner spirit
 These psychological thoughts must have a source
 They have history
 Didn't come out of thin air
 They are derived from the dream hypothesis
 And artistic imagination
 After a long period of evolution
 Clarified as consciousness
 We worked hard for a long time
 Chimpanzees who only looked at each other
 Developed to human
 We all have a faculty called consciousness
 It took a long time
 Really long
 And it must have gone through many stages in the development process
 I really like a point of Jean Piaget
 He is a developmental psychologist
 He insisted that before children understand concepts
 To be able to practice and dramatize these concepts
 Merlin Donald is a psychologist at Queen's University
 Based on this point of view, I have written a few interesting books
 The book discusses how imitation
 The important role played by human development of advanced cognition
 This view is that we put our ideas into practice
 We abstract the idea
 And make it clear before
 This is a very strong point
 I can't think of any better explanation
 If you observe the children, you will understand
 Think about it when the children play house
 What are they doing
 Children will play the role of father or mother
 The interesting point here is
 You will think this is too cute too
 This little girl is imitating her mother
 But not really
 It's not like that
 When your child imitates you
 Actually quite annoying
 You move your arms and they follow you
 If you move your head, they still follow
 No one likes this kind of direct imitation
 But this is not what children do when they play
 In fact, they observe the mother
 Behavior in countless instantiation scenarios
 And extract from it
 A spirit called "mother"
 This is the mother
 Image in a variety of specific behaviors
 Children internalize this model
 And express it in the abstract world
 It is very complicated
 You actually did this when you played Jiajia
 Or when playing tea and taking care of your doll
 It’s not that you saw your mother taking care of a doll
 That's not the case
 But you have enough wisdom
 To extract this concept and visualize it
 There is no doubt that this child
 Working hard to achieve this ideal
 She didn't set the doll on fire
 Of course it’s not like this
 Generally we don’t encourage children to do this
 So you can see this ability in children
 And we also know
 If the child does not to a large extent
 To participate in this dramatic and hypothetical game
 They cannot socialize properly
 This is indeed a key factor in developing self-understanding
 It can also help individuals develop the ability to get along with others
 When you were young
 Especially when he is about four years old
 You build a shared virtual world with the outside world
 For example, we played house together
 Then you are in that shared virtual world
 To play a shared role
 This is a very advanced form of cognition
 very complicated
 This is the same thing I have observed and Piaget
 Jung Floyd and Merlin Donald
 These amazing observers have discovered
 How cognition develops
 They are very aware of this concrete imitation
 And dramatic abstraction forms the foundation
 So that more advanced abstract cognition can emerge from it
 How could it not be this explanation
 Obviously before we develop a complete mind
 We mainly rely on the body
 So long before we could understand certain ideas
 Can put these concepts into practice
 Just like chimpanzees will practice the following concepts
 If you are the chimpanzee leader
 Your behavior must be sensible
 Otherwise you will be torn to pieces
 You can also observe from the wolf
 When wolves fight for power
 They will blow their hair at each other
 Make yourself look huge
 Will growl and bark
 Will become very vicious
 The inferior wolf will turn his body over to show weakness
 Put your neck back up, body language like this is to show
 "Yes, I'm so useless
 "You can kill me if you want."
 The wolf in the dominant position will say
 "Yes, you know you are pretty useless
 "I can tear your throat open but tomorrow
 "We might use you when we hunt moose
 "So I will spare your life"
 They don’t think like this
 They don’t have such thinking ability
 But they put this idea into practice as a mode of behavior
 If you are an anthropologist or behaviorist
 Go and observe the behavior of the wolf
 You would say they seem to act according to the law
 I usually get confused about this because I think
 Are there rules for wolves?
 The so-called law of law is when we
 What is constructed when accurately expressing a behavior pattern
 We observe a stable behavior pattern
 Then express it accurately, which is called the law
 But it’s not a rule for wolves
 That's just a stable behavior pattern
 We behave like wolves or chimpanzees
 Has lasted for tens of millions of years or even hundreds of millions of years
 Until we have the ability
 To change our behavior pattern
 Tell it with stories or images
 We can express it precisely as a set of moral codes
 It took longer
 I spent a long time explaining these
 I know some of them I have talked about before
 But these are really important
 Some people are putting pressure
 Especially those social constructivists
 They think the existing moral system is random
 Morality is relative human behavior
 There is no fundamental biological basis
 Ethics
 First of all I think this is very dangerous
 Because this theory means what you want people to become
 What a person can become
 You better be careful with people who have such thoughts
 Secondly, there is too much evidence
 Explain that this view is wrong
 We really shouldn't think like this anymore
 This is why I’m from an evolutionary perspective
 Part of the reason to criticize this view
 There is growing evidence that
 Moral and ethical standards are at least the most important ones
 They have not only evolved and will be
 Reemerged in children’s dramatic games
 We have to take this seriously
 Part of what we are doing now
 There is a concept like this, at least in part
 The Father Go and Let the Son
 From the chaos to generate an indwellable order
 At the same time I also think there may be
 Closer to the real situation
 There is an interesting point about men
 Men are more criminal than women
 This does not seem to be sociocultural
 Part of the reason is that men’s criminal impulses
 Peak testosterone secretion at around 14 years old
 This impulse will rise quickly
 And stay active until around 27 years old
 The standard penalty theory says so
 If you don’t know, let me explain
 Suppose there is such a habitual offender
 He keeps getting into trouble
 Then you can put him in jail until he is 28 years old and then release him.
 It's not that you are going to reform him or something
 Only after he was 28, his passion for crime disappeared
 Because his criminal impulse curve peaked around 15
 And then began to decline around 27 years old and disappeared
 By the way, men usually get married at this age
 Settled and stabilized
 It's also interesting
 The development of the male creativity curve is the same
 The curve peaks when testosterone begins to secrete
 And then began to decline around 27
 The two curves are very, very close
 This is really interesting
 The part about creativity
 I am very interested
 Because in all respects youth is the source of creativity
 Look at this sentence carefully
 If you strip it away from its religious context
 You will see it is talking about older people
 Use young people to generate innovative ideas
 And use it to update the world
 That's right
 We don’t know how many inventions and discoveries humans have
 By children and teenagers
 Found by the blind cat and dead mouse
 Because young people are more adventurous
 Less restricted by their existing knowledge structure
 They will not be so conservative
 So I think it makes sense
 And very important
 It also means that if you are a father
 There is such a meaning in it
 This is one thing you should encourage your son to do
 Because the father acts as an encouragement
 It is obvious
 And encouragement means
 Go out, kid, face the unknown chaos
 And the chaos hidden beneath everything
 Go fight it because you can do it
 You are as powerful as chaos itself
 You have to recognize this and do something useful
 Make your life better
 And make people around me better
 You can do it
 This is what you should tell young men
 What to say to young women is more complicated
 Because they are facing
 More complicated situation
 Their lives are more complicated
 But it's absolutely correct to tell your son that
 I recently discovered one thing
 Especially since the seven or eight months since I gave the lecture
 I found that my audience is mostly young men
 I told them a lot about truth and responsibility
 I think they are "generating order from chaos"
 The factors behind
 I see young men eager for words like this
 These words are different from the topic of "rights"
 Far apart
 It is the counterpart of "right"
 Life is difficult and chaotic
 Definitely a challenge
 No wonder you can choose to shrink in front of life
 Because life is fatal and not child's play
 Or you can face it calmly
 Try to make some changes
 Which option do you think is better
 If you tell someone
 You can do it
 This is how people are
 If you cheer up and face it bravely
 You will find out soon
 You can really do it
 I think this is a very core religious message
 And is deeply rooted in this idea
 This is the point I have been conveying to you
 The knowledge itself is also generated like this
 There are many unknowns
 You know nothing about them
 Generally when you encounter something unknown
 Your first reaction is never thinking
 But with an expression of horror like this
 This is your first reaction to something absolutely unknown
 What you encounter is beyond the scope of understanding
 The unknown scares you
 It is beyond your understanding
 You can't perceive or understand it
 But you still have to face it
 The way you face it is to stay still
 The snake monster in "Harry Potter"
 That's how to deal with children
 As soon as I see the snake demon children, they can’t move
 This is the terrifying snake of chaos hidden beneath all things
 You can't move when you see it because you are a prey
 But while you are afraid, you are also curious
 This is the first stage of your contact with the absolute unknown
 A mixed emotion frozen in fear and curiosity
 This is also reflected in the story about dragons
 Dragons are terrible creatures living underneath
 It is entrenched with gold and maidens
 This behavior is also very strange for reptiles
 But this is a symbolic representation
 It represents the predatory nature of the unknown
 But the unknown can also
 Generate new information
 You can think of it as a characteristic of humans
 Because we are prey
 But we are also very adventurous
 We are very good predators
 We occupy such a weird cognitive position
 One thing we learned from this is
 If we muster up the courage to face the unknown fear
 Although it is frightening
 But you will continue to get huge rewards
 This truth is too real
 Have such a view
 At the beginning of time, God extracted the inhabitable order from the chaos
 There is a metaphor under this concept
 This metaphor is a very old concept
 God has encountered a monster like Leviathan
 This is a chaotic beast like a python
 Leviathan is one of the commonly used names in the Old Testament
 In addition to Leviathan, there is another called Behemoth
 Yes it's the name
 There is such a point of view that should come from
 Mesopotamians think that whether God is
 The image of the Father or the Son
 He is the beast facing the terrible unknown chaos
 And cut it to pieces
 And will distribute its fragments to the people to raise them
 Here you can also see a metaphor of hunting in it
 But it’s actually more profound
 So it’s absolutely unknown
 It's something you don't understand
 The unknown is something outside of your campfire lighting
 The longer it is, the thing outside the tree
 Because we used to live on trees
 It lurks somewhere you don't know
 What's out there
 Crocodile snake raptor
 Big cats
 All the creatures that can eat you
 But go out and find out what is useful to you
 Maybe you didn't kill the snake when you went out
 But gave the snake nest
 You will become very popular soon
 This is what you deserve
 Put it this way, it will boost your chances of reproduction
 And we are the descendants of these people
 We will have
 The concept of "the world is built like this"
 This is deeply rooted in our minds
 Very, very deeply below the surface cognition
 Deeply embedded in our limbic system
 This is a very old part of the brain
 Existed for 60 million years
 Even billions of years or more
 It is a very very old brain structure
 So the first thing we do is
 We go to meet the unknown world
 The way to meet with
 How is God described in the Bible
 At the beginning of time, the order that can be accommodated is extracted from the chaos
 The approach taken is the same
 I won’t tell you about other things for now
 So we will first practice
 Then we observe how others practice
 Then you start to describe them
 This is a story right
 Maybe you still admire some stories
 After a while you have collected a lot of stories
 Then you can describe what they are
 Can you describe them precisely as a pattern
 This is what Nietzsche first summed up
 Because before Nietzsche
 He took the lead in achieving many achievements
 Really amazing
 Before Nietzsche some people thought
 You think first and then act
 Many people love to think so
 But you know this is obviously pure bullshit
 Because you can't imagine how impulsive you can be
 You often start acting without thinking
 Although sometimes the effect is pretty good
 "Seeing first and then thinking
 Is the idea of ​​"do something next" true?
 I'm not like this anyway
 As far as I know no one is like this
 Actually people don’t do it at all
 Especially when people are very emotional, they will act first
 Nietzsche clearly expressed a point
 Our thinking for thousands of years is
 Conceived from our behavior
 When philosophers put forward these ideas
 They are not creating new ideas
 They are just telling stories about human nature
 These ideas already exist
 Already rooted in our minds
 Has already appeared in our behavior pattern
 Nietzsche is a genius
 This is just one of his countless extremely genius discoveries
 You can think so too
 First you encounter the unknown
 And you act on it
 Then you will dream about your behavioral reaction
 The same when you watch a movie
 You will talk about it later
 Of course once you start talking
 This will in turn affect your dreams
 Your dreams will also affect your behavior
 Not all causality is one-way
 It's not like that they circulate each other
 But it still originated from the unknown through our bodies and imagination
 Expressed by us
 This is the basic mode of the generation of wisdom
 You can easily see some clues from the perspective of evolutionary interpretation
 You have the actual body first, right
 Then you can imagine
 Imagination is the abstract expression of the flesh
 Language
 This is how we step by step
 Because of our ability to imagine
 Before we could speak
 At least in theory
 This is an illustration from my book "Map of Meaning"
 This is unknown
 Basic representation
 It is semi-spiritual
 Because the Rinku part looks like a bird
 It is also semi-materialized
 Because the parts on the ground are like snakes
 When you don't know what's there
 This is what you think it will look like
 When you face the unknown
 Your body will respond naturally
 You know very well that when you are alone at night
 Maybe for some reason you are a little upset
 Maybe it’s because you just watched a horror movie
 It happens that there are some strange noises in other rooms
 It's dark outside
 You'll know if you try it someday
 Then you are so nervous
 Then you think about or turn on the light
 See what's going on in the room
 Don't do this yet
 You just need to open the door a little bit
 Then put your hand in and try
 Look at your imagination
 Will tell you what's in the room
 Then you can immediately remember when you were three years old
 Lying alone in bed facing the dark fear
 I recently read a book about dragons
 There is a very interesting hypothesis
 The author did such a job
 Sorry i don't remember his name
 He tracked the universality of the image of "dragon" worldwide
 It turns out that its universality is extremely surprising
 He thinks it actually gathers predators of various primates
 Predator is a strange category
 There are crocodiles and lions inside
 But they will eat you
 Have nothing in common
 So it is a functional category
 This picture is
 Image representation of the functional category of predator
 His predator theory is like this
 If you are a monkey
 Maybe a bird will kill you like an eagle
 If it’s not an eagle, it’s okay to assume it’s a cat
 Because they will climb trees and give you a fatal blow
 If it’s not a cat
 You come under the tree
 The snake will kill you
 Or snakes can climb the tree
 Snakes kind of like climbing trees, the result is the same
 Basically, you can think of it as the archetype of "tree cat snake"
 Or "tree cat and snake bird"
 These are definitely things you want to avoid
 You never want to run into any of them
 In addition, the dragon can breathe fire
 This is very interesting
 Because fire is man’s best friend
 Also the worst enemy
 We have learned to use fire proficiently for a long time
 It may be 200 or more than 3 million years old
 There is a man named Richard Langham
 It should be Langham
 He recently wrote a book
 I should remember his last name correctly
 He wrote a book about when humans learned to cook
 Humans learned to cook about 2 million years ago
 Cooking improves the utilization of food calories
 Think about what a chimpanzee is like
 They look ugly
 Looks like a large bowling pin
 Looks very fat and strong and short
 Their intestines are almost three hundred miles long
 Because they have to digest the leaves
 You can try to run into the forest
 Sitting and chewing leaves for a day
 See what happens to you
 There is no heat in the leaves
 So chimps need to spend every day
 I remember it was almost eight hours for chewing
 Because what they eat has no nutritional value
 So they need a huge digestive system
 To extract anything valuable from it
 However, at a certain moment, human beings suddenly opened up and thought that they couldn't bear it anymore.
 Let's cook something to eat
 So we traded the digestive system for the brain
 How successful
 I think it also makes us more attractive
 The point here is this
 This is the basic prototype of the unknown
 I really like St. George's version of the story about the unknown
 Pretty cool
 Saint George lives in a castle
 This castle is half collapsed
 Partly because of the appearance of the dragon
 This is an immortal dragon
 It often disturbs everyone
 This kind of thing always happens
 Because the eternal dragon will always be ready
 Add to our already difficult life
 Saint George is the hero who bravely faced the dragon
 He freed the girl from the claws of the dragon
 I think this is a pretty straightforward story
 It's about the sexual attraction of masculinity
 This masculine person has the courage to face the unknown
 In my opinion this is a very obvious biological characterization
 This is a very old story
 May be the oldest story we can record
 The Creation Epic of Mesopotamian Mythology
 "Enuma Elish"
 Basically telling the story
 I bet some of you movie lovers
 Especially those obsessed with
 The kind of fancy superhero movie guy
 You may be in the past ten years
 Have watched this St. George's story hundreds of times
 And you are not tired of it
 Because this is the core story of mankind
 So this is unknown
 You use your body’s instinct to face it
 You show existential fear
 And extreme curiosity
 It’s like the so-called "unknown unknown"
 What is the name of the politician under Bush?
 By the way Rumsfeld
 I think the reason this term is so popular is
 Rumsfeld interprets this prototype very well
 "Unknown unknown"
 And "known unknown"
 The dragon here belongs to the "unknown unknown"
 You have to know that you are facing
 How to react when "unknown unknown"
 Because it might give you a fatal blow
 You can't use ignorance as an excuse
 Because it is fatal
 It won't work
 Human beings are such a creature when they are at a loss
 They have to know what to do
 This is contradictory
 We must prepare for everything
 We are always on guard
 Get ready to face everything
 This is a kind of high tension
 But in a state of concentration
 And it can strengthen your consciousness
 This kind of human reaction loop may be permanently opened
 Because we know that people are mortal
 No other animal knows this
 Sometimes i feel
 Our stress response circuit is always open
 This explains partly
 The reason for our strong consciousness
 So you will encounter "unknown unknown"
 Then you will have the real world
 The unknown
 For example, some mysteries in your partner
 You will feel this way when you argue
 who are you
 You are not completely unknown to me
 Because i still know you a little bit
 But now what you show
 Completely foreign to me
 This part is what we know
 There are those who know
 The known things here are given a symbolic representation
 in my opinion
 In the form of the patriarchy of the masculine deity
 And the unknown things you encounter are given a feminine form
 We will not explain much in depth yet
 But if you are interested
 You can take a look at my "Map of Meaning" lecture series
 You can read this book
 I think it sums up the religious archetype very well
 I studied for a long time
 I feel it can be applied to Jung's ruler
 It maps well to Joseph Campbell’s theory
 But many of Campbell’s theories came from Jung
 This can also be said from the perspective of biology and evolution
 As far as I know it is like this
 At least in my judgment
 There are many examples of cross-validation
 Okay, let’s go back to the dominant hierarchy
 Let's take a look at this picture
 You may know that I am very obsessed with lobster
 Because i found something about it
 I really felt empowered when I discovered this
 I have a lot of research on functional neurochemistry
 Because I have studied alcohol addiction and drug abuse
 To study alcohol
 You must fully understand the brain
 Because alcohol can penetrate all parts of the brain
 It affects every neurochemical system
 So if you want to study alcohol
 You need general knowledge of neurochemistry
 I have been studying neurochemistry for a long time
 I am very fascinated by a book
 The title of the book is "Anxiety Neuropsychology"
 The author is Jeffrey Gray
 This book is really a genius but it is also very difficult to understand
 I don’t know how many references are used in this book
 At least one thousand
 Gray really read these references
 Even understood them
 Then he integrated these references into his book
 Want to read "Anxiety Neuropsychology"
 You must thoroughly master functional neurochemistry
 Animal Behavior Motivation and Emotion and Neuroanatomy
 This book is very difficult to understand but it is really rich in content
 It took 40 years for psychologists to really understand it
 One thing I learned in it is
 Between human and animal neurochemistry
 Have strong continuity
 Really incredible
 It makes evolution
 Seems obvious
 I do think it is obvious
 But there are other reasons I will talk about later
 I think when the environment is so complex that it exceeds our ability to understand
 Random mutation and natural selection are
 The only way to solve the problem of how to adapt to the environment
 I think all you can do is produce countless variants
 Because what will happen next moment is never known
 Most of these variants will die because they are failures
 One of the pair reproduces
 The surrounding environment is constantly changing like a giant snake
 You never know what it will do next
 The best you can do
 These 30 variants may survive
 But 28 of them will die
 For insects, the odds are much higher
 Let's talk about lobster
 They will fight for dominance
 I think "dominance" is the correct way to understand
 Lobsters do not have empathy and sociality
 It really wins by strength
 The interesting thing about lobster is
 When a lobster wins
 It stretches to appear taller
 It shows higher because of winning
 It’s like advertised
 The neurochemical system that makes it stretch
 Can affect serotonin
 Do you think who cares what's the point?
 I tell you what is the point
 It is also a chemical substance affected by human antidepressants
 If a person is depressed
 Like a defeated lobster
 Would curl up like this and seem to say
 I am too weak and the world is too dangerous
 I want to give up fighting
 You give people an antidepressant and they will hold their heads up
 Ready to fight the world again
 If you give a lobster that has lost a fight a dose of serotonin
 They will stretch again and fight again
 From 350 to 600 million years ago on the time scale of evolution
 We differentiated from creatures like lobsters
 But our neurochemicals are no different
 This is also the authority hierarchy
 Another proof of importance
 It has survived since the lobster era
 When the lobster first appeared on earth
 There is no tree on earth
 This means these hierarchies that I have been talking about
 Older than the appearance of trees
 There is a self-evident truth like this
 From the perspective of Darwinism
 "Reality" is made up of things that last the longest
 Because it has the longest time
 To put pressure on natural selection
 We learned that about 60 million years ago
 We live in the forest after evolution
 This is one-tenth the length of the hierarchy
 The evolution of the hierarchy
 Pressure of natural selection
 I think this view is beyond doubt
 How it did it and what does it mean
 These issues can be discussed
 But this biological continuity is amazing
 This theory is not what I found but what I read
 The interesting thing is when I review this theory
 Talked about it with my graduate students
 I often take them out for breakfast
 They like to argue very much
 Always want to be better than others
 And also very smart
 Before this becomes a bit annoying
 In about six months
 Every time someone does better than others
 They will hold their heads up and hold their hands in a pliers
 Really interesting
 It’s amazing that lobsters do this kind of action
 About Lobster
 Another interesting thing is
 Suppose you are a lobster who has been in power for a long time
 But you are a little old
 There is a young lobster that beats you up and down
 You will become very depressed
 Your brain is the ruler's brain
 But not very developed because you are just a lobster
 You lost the fight
 What will you do
 the answer is
 Your brain will decline
 Then you will grow a subordinate brain
 This is worth thinking about for the following reasons
 the first
 If you have suffered a major setback in your life
 You will know how it feels
 It seems that life is better than death
 If lucky
 You will be reborn
 Maybe you will be reborn as another person
 This is what people with post-traumatic stress disorder experience
 Their brain undergoes permanent neurological transformation
 Then the world they live in will be more
 More dangerous
 We also know
 If you suffer from traumatic stress disorder or depression
 Your hippocampus shrinks
 It will die and become smaller
 Sometimes it can grow again
 Your hippocampus shrinks and your amygdala grows
 The amygdala increases emotional sensitivity
 The hippocampus inhibits emotional sensitivity
 So if you fail miserably
 The hippocampus shrinks and the amygdala enlarges
 If you come out of failure
 The hippocampus becomes bigger again
 Antidepressants can assist this process
 But the amygdala never gets smaller
 This is another lesson we learned from lobster
 This is shocking
 But the interesting thing is that you can understand the behavior pattern of lobster
 "I know what this poor crustacean is going through"
 Let's talk about mice
 This is the study of Jayak Panksepp
 He was the first person to find that mice can laugh
 You might be wondering what is good for research
 Why spend 50,000 research funds on giggling mice
 He discovered the playful brain circuit of mammals
 This is a major discovery
 Just like discovering a new world
 There are playful brain circuits in the mammalian brain
 It is formed by nature rather than acquired socially
 Here is where the biological mechanism comes into play
 So what did Panksepp study about mice?
 He found
 If you isolate a young rat from its mother
 It will die
 Even if you feed it
 Give it a suitable environment it will still die
 If you rub it with the eraser at the end of the pencil
 It won't die
 Because mice need love to live
 The same goes for human babies
 In the Romanian orphanage after the Ceausescu disaster
 We can observe this phenomenon
 Those orphanages are full of abandoned babies
 Because Ceausescu insists on pushing
 All Romanian women must keep getting pregnant
 So the orphanage is full of abandoned babies
 Many abandoned babies don’t even have names
 They are like goods being stored
 They are given warm home food
 Appalling
 But many babies are still dead
 Most abandoned babies die before one year old
 The surviving baby suffers from permanent dysfunction
 Because as a human, you must have physical contact
 it's necessary
 You must have the experience of playing
 This is also necessary
 This is one of the necessary conditions for neurodevelopment
 And you have to participate in the play fairly
 Otherwise your child will be out of touch with society
 He cannot notice the subtleties of social interaction
 To some extent socializing is continuous play and reciprocity
 So what did Panksepp find in the mouse
 He noticed the male rat
 Especially young male rats like fighting very much
 They will fight like humans
 They will pinch each other
 My goodness
 That mouse just lost and lost ten points
 You can try some baby mice
 Then see if they want to play
 You can tie a spring to the mouse
 They will try to escape
 By measuring how long they pull the spring
 I can see how much they want to escape
 You can estimate how motivated they are
 Then you will find
 One without any worries
 Thriving rat
 Still try hard
 Enter the place where it used to play
 It will make an effort
 In other words, this mouse is motivated
 Two mice playing together
 They will play like dogs
 If you know a little bit about dogs
 You know what that is like
 They have this kind of action
 Human children do the same
 If you play with your wife occasionally
 You will do the same
 My poor wife
 She was young and her brothers and sisters were older than her
 So at the age she should play when she was young
 She doesn't play enough
 I used to be like this
 For example, if you take a pillow
 Then shake it like this three times
 Means optimistic
 I want to throw you a pillow
 So I will throw one, two, three
 She will be very surprised and puzzled
 The expression is like saying what are you doing
 I finally taught her the meaning of this action
 There is another thing
 Sometimes when we are playing
 She will walk towards me like this
 I will hold her wrist
 Put her fists together joint to joint
 She used to be very angry because of this
 I think so
 You have to do this
 Open your hands
 She doesn't know how it should be
 When she was just a "little mouse"
 She doesn't play enough
 You let the mouse out to play
 We assume that one of the mice
 One-tenth the size of the other one
 This larger mouse will win
 Because one-tenth of the weight of a mouse
 Enough to make you a winner instead of a loser
 Rats beat mice
 Then the rat becomes the dominant rat
 Next time I play
 Mice have to invite rats to play
 The rat just stayed leisurely
 The mouse emerged from nowhere
 Find ways to invite rats to play together
 Rats will condescend to play with him
 But if you repeatedly group them together
 Unless the rats let the mice win in a third of the time
 Otherwise the mice will not invite the rats to play together
 Panksepp discovered this phenomenon
 I really felt enlightened after reading his research
 It's amazing
 First of all because this is in line with Piaget’s point of view
 "Human morality can arise from play behavior"
 Formed an analogy
 This is really amazing
 But on the mouse
 This concept is established on the level of fighting
 Rats are very social animals
 They must learn how to get along with other rats
 In the fight for majority dominance
 They don’t want the fight to become bloody and violent
 Suppose you are Rat One and I am Rat Two
 In the fight for dominance
 We tore each other to pieces
 Three mice will make a profit
 This is obviously not a good strategy
 If we can peacefully
 It would be better to seek common ground while reserving differences
 Anyway, Panksepp found that mice can play
 They not only play but also play fair
 And they like fairness
 He also found a little bit cool
 If you give young rats a drug for attention deficit disorder
 Ritalin
 It inhibits mice from playing
 This is worth thinking about
 Why do we give children in school
 Using amphetamine
 Because children need play to grow up
 But adults will say no to play
 Don't play around
 In my opinion this is "oppression"
 Don't let them frolic
 It's ok
 Give them amphetamines
 It inhibits the play circuit in their brain
 Then the problem is coming
 Panksepp Discovery
 If you don’t let young male rats play
 Their prefrontal cortex will not develop normally
 I didn't expect it
 You are restraining them from becoming mature
 Otherwise what do you think
 I think this is really worth pondering
 These are a few wolves fooling around
 just kidding
 These wolves are fighting for authority
 Professionally
 Some wolves are pretending
 Sociable wolf
 Tend to not hurt other wolves in power struggles
 The reason is obvious, hurting each other is too dangerous
 They have other ways to prove
 Who should give orders is authority
 These chimpanzees are doing the same
 If i remember correctly
 This is a great photo
 Because of this chimpanzee
 By the way, orangutans hate snakes
 So for example
 If you have a chimpanzee who has never seen a snake
 You show it a snake
 It won't be happy
 It will immediately run away from the snake
 If you take an anesthetized chimpanzee
 Sent to a room with many chimpanzees
 These chimpanzees will stay far away
 Then stared at the anesthetized chimpanzee
 They don't like this either
 If you put a huge snake in a chimpanzee cage
 Even if the chimpanzee has never seen a snake
 They will also go far
 Then stare at the snake
 Wild chimpanzee
 If you see a huge snake
 They will stand there and make a cry
 Seems to be saying
 "My God, there is a big snake."
 It is indeed the case
 I will tell you why later
 They stand farther away and make this kind of call
 It means "Oh my God, look at this snake"
 Then they will stand there for about 24 hours
 Just stare at that snake
 Snakes are really a super stimulus for chimpanzees
 It's really interesting
 This chimpanzee seems to have learned how to take this dead snake
 To scare other chimps
 This is also one of the ways it builds authority
 Snake is a threat
 If I were the orangutan beside this chimpanzee
 I will take this threat seriously
 Because snakes are not a joke
 You can see the same thing in these monkeys
 I don't remember what kind of monkey this is
 Their behavior is radical
 By the way
 Recent research shows
 Higher order primates
 Snake detection circuits are naturally formed in the brain
 This is not acquired
 This is more profound than acquired
 Psychologists knew that
 Use pictures of snakes or snakes in condition experiments
 Scared the subject
 Much faster than pictures with guns or guns
 We can quickly understand the fear of snakes
 Also for spiders
 Then people will think
 Maybe we are prepared in advance
 Build fear of such animals as snakes or spiders
 More recent research shows
 It's not just ready
 But we have this kind of detection circuit innate
 Why not
 This is indeed a problem
 It's not surprising
 Unless you think human beings are just a blank slate
 If you really think so
 how to say
 You should have crawled out of the 16th century
 This is my opinion
 This view is really outdated
 Simply wrong
 You can think of this behavior as a dominance hierarchy
 But wolves also pursue credibility and ability
 Chimpanzees don't like cruel tyrants
 Then we will discuss it as a hierarchy of authority
 The picture shows how it started to develop
 These girls are discussing the family environment
 How to do things properly
 How to share turns etc.
 They are discussing the hierarchy of authority
 If you are good at mutual benefit
 Sometimes you are an authority
 Sometimes others are authority
 It's fair right
 These boys are doing the same thing
 You can see them smiling
 This looks like an attack
 Not too careful
 Paranoid
 People who don't like humans
 Confuse this with aggressive behavior
 They will prohibit students from doing this in school
 For example, when my child is in school
 This is a long time ago
 They are not allowed to touch snow
 In case they throw snowballs
 This is a terrible thing
 So i told my son
 He can use snowballs at will
 Hit any teacher in the back of the head
 As long as he is willing to bear the consequences of this behavior
 I don't know if he really did it
 But he was obviously very happy with the idea
 I'm very happy for him
 Children need to play like this
 They really need to do this
 This makes them civilized and polite
 They need to learn to be civilized and polite when they are two to four years old
 Because if before the age of four
 They still didn't learn to be polite
 Then don't expect them to learn
 This is a terrible statistic
 But in the literature related to development
 It is well proven
 There are many aggressive two-year-olds in the literature
 Many boys
 If they are over four years old, they are still aggressive
 They probably stay in this state for their entire lives
 They have no friends to be rejected
 They are more likely to become
 Anti-social lawless juvenile delinquent and go to jail
 Your child needs to socialize between two and four years old
 Especially aggressive boys need
 Most aggressive two-year-olds are boys
 By the way, being offensive is not socializing
 There is a more abstract way of expressing this matter
 What i want to say is
 The hierarchy of authority is from
 Emerges from the matrix of a potential game-like
 This is what makes Jean Piaget outstanding
 This view is extremely clever he came up with
 He is very interested in the biological origin of morality
 He traced the origin of play
 And the formation of morality in play
 This view is very clever
 It's incredible
 Because morality is built from the bottom up
 Piaget is a constructivist
 He is also a social constructivist to some extent
 He underestimated the important role of biology here
 But this does not prove that his theory is wrong
 Theory for him
 It is not difficult to add a biological support
 We now have enough biological knowledge
 Can do this well
 In fact, such as Panksepp
 Can already recognize the play circuit in the human brain
 This is a good start
 Play has been with mankind for so long
 So that we all have a brain circuit
 Designed for play
 This is a very very old topic
 This is the abstract concept of the game
 Then you got a
 The most extreme abstraction and expression such as this picture
 Even the terrain of the game is fictitious
 Of course we have largely migrated to
 In these fictitious environments
 Fictional books, movies, video games
 These are extensions of the same thing
 Exercises for real life
 Sometimes becomes a reality
 These are also manifestations of the Father
 I like these expressions
 I also like the concept of triangles
 I don’t know why God wears a triangle hat
 This shape is a bit strange
 But I think it is related to the concept of pyramid
 And also and
 Authority hierarchy related
 I think this is why the Egyptians
 Will put Pharaoh in the pyramid
 I know there are other reasons besides this
 But I think there are some reasons
 Related to the concept of this hierarchy
 This is obviously a guess
 I don't want to be too precise
 But I can’t help thinking that the two are related
 That picture is the pattern on the back of the US dollar bill
 I like this picture very much
 It resembles the Eye of Horus in Egyptian civilization
 The idea is like
 At the top of the hierarchy
 Is no longer
 Part of this hierarchy, right?
 So if you climb high enough in the hierarchy
 What will happen is you will get an ability
 It is the result of your climbing in this hierarchy
 Can separate you far enough from this system
 After that you are no longer part of it
 So you can move in all kinds of hierarchy
 What you really master is
 attention
 From a mythological perspective
 It seems that it can be extracted from the chaos
 Of the source of the applicable order
 The concept of spoken language rivals
 Is vision and attention
 Such as the creator god of Marduk Mesopotamia civilization
 From Mesopotamian civilization
 Appear in the hierarchy of gods
 Then climb to the top
 He is the victor among the gods
 He has eyes all over the head
 He can say spells
 I like this idea
 The Egyptians also formed this idea
 Because their god Horus is that eye
 Everyone knows the Eye of Horus
 The concept is so attractive
 Spread to this day
 Everyone has seen the Eye of Horus
 Its pupils are completely open
 The Egyptians recognized
 Fully open eyes can regenerate a dead society
 This view is really wonderful
 So if your life is in chaos
 What should you do
 You better concentrate
 This is different from thinking
 It is a different process
 In a sense, thinking is the result of structure execution
 I know I oversimplified
 But focus on one thing
 Like looking at something you don't understand
 One thing I often recommend to guests in my clinic is
 If they have family conflicts
 The first thing to do is to shut up
 Don't say any more of your own ideas
 Not in a rude manner
 Just stop talking about your own thoughts
 Second, watch them like an eagle and listen carefully
 If you persist long enough
 They will tell you exactly what they want
 They will tell you
 What kind of person are you in their hearts
 Then you will be shocked
 Because generally speaking, the way they have you
 Totally different from what you think you are
 When they tell you
 This is a revelation for you
 Attention is incredibly powerful
 You can also see it in psychotherapy
 Because of the many things you do
 In all repairable relationships
 Are really focusing on the opposite person
 Focus and listen
 You will be surprised
 What people will tell or reveal to you
 If you watch them
 Like you are listening
 Instead of staring at them
 In order to strengthen one's prejudice
 People usually communicate like that
 Like i want to always
 Keep my opinion of you
 So I want to filter out all the information that shakes my theory
 This is not what i want to say
 It's just that I want to watch you
 And figure out what you want
 Not in a rude way not at all
 I just want to see what you are thinking
 This is probably good for you
 Also good for me
 The concept is
 Climbing up in the authority level can give you vision
 This vision can go beyond the current hierarchy
 I think this is also the artists
 Metaphysical space
 Because artists do not exist in the hierarchy
 They exist outside the hierarchy
 Most of you have seen "The Lion King"
 It's like Shazu's little bird
 That is the king's eye
 This is also connected with this concept
 These figures also express the same concept of hierarchy
 Gold, silver and copper
 Why gold
 Gold is the sun gold is pure
 The concept is
 Things at the top of the hierarchy are not corrodible
 Because gold will not mix with other things
 Gold will never be corroded
 It is a noble metal
 It will not be corroded
 It shines like the sun
 So it is with
 Things at the top of the hierarchy are linked together
 The gold medal is a disc like the sun
 It will be rewarded
 And the ideal person
 I tell you a little story
 Imagine you are watching an Olympic game
 I often do this when I watch gymnastics
 Because gymnasts are really incredible
 Look at a gymnastics show
 Athletes pulsate like a poem on the court
 You can't even imagine this
 Their skills are so perfect
 You see this person
 Complete the whole set of actions
 They are simply perfect and flawless
 At the end they stopped and thunderous applause
 They are all very excited to see humans refresh their limits
 This is why our audience watch the game
 Because we want to see the limits of human physical fitness
 Then the judges scored 9.8 9.8 9.8
 Everyone is very excited
 Then the next player on the field is like
 They are basically done
 The performance of the previous player is simply perfect
 How can you surpass him
 This is an interesting question
 Because these pictures show
 How do you go beyond perfection
 you can do it
 Here is how to do it
 And you know these
 Even if you don’t realize that you know
 The next player is a little trembling
 Because the standard has been raised
 They pushed themselves to the edge of chaos
 You can tell by observing their plight
 They are at a critical juncture
 They push themselves into the unexplored state
 Just for perfection
 Everyone in the hall is so nervous that they hold their breath
 Silent needles can be heard
 The athlete is turning around
 Hit the mark
 After the end, they held their heads up like this and opened their arms
 A triumphant posture
 Everyone immediately stood up and thunderous applause
 why
 what are you doing
 What are you thinking now
 You can't even hold on
 It directly captures the core of your being
 Then you stand up
 This is just an act of worship
 You see some people go beyond their own perfection
 Entered the realm of chaos
 And established order before your eyes
 You will feel ecstatic
 Think it's worth it
 Cheers
 This is definitely a strange thing
 Sometimes that picture expresses
 Sometimes this picture expresses
 This is what we want to discuss
 Because this is the culmination of the hierarchy
 You are not only doing what you should do
 And it also makes you more likely
 On this basis
 The same idea another thing
 I know we haven't told the story of Adam and Eve
 You tell your kids to play fairly
 You said winning or losing is not the point
 The focus is on the way the game is played
 You say that but you don't know the meaning
 You feel a bit silly to say that
 Even if you know it's right
 Your kids look at you too
 It seems something is wrong with you
 Because they don't know what you are talking about
 But you know what you said is right
 Let me talk about the reason
 Life is not a game
 But a series of games
 The rule is not to win a game
 Sacrificed long-term victory, right?
 This is the meaning of "play well"
 The way you want to play
 Make others willing to invite you to keep playing
 This is how you win
 Your victory is through
 To be invited to join as many games as possible
 Specifically to show
 You can play the game in a mutually beneficial way
 This is true in every game even if you might lose
 This is the way to keep you successful
 We all know this
 I teach my children this way
 But we did not realize that we knew this
 We did not adapt ourselves to ordinary games
 Or adapted to win the game
 But we adapt ourselves to the meta game
 And adapt to a series of potential game victories
 This is exactly
 as far as I know
 What these pictures want to express
 The same idea
 There is a mode of being
 Features that can surpass local competition
 This is another way of thinking
 Pursuing ethics is not to win the current competition
 At the expense of future potential competition opportunities
 Again, I don’t think this is arbitrary
 Not relative
 There is an absolute moral position in the world
 Everyone knows
 I also think this is the secret of success
 I also think it’s weird
 It is similar to the following view
 Good at being invited
 People who participate in as many games as possible
 I haven't figured it out yet
 The precise relationship between these two views
 At the same time proactively
 Before the unknown came to the city in a hostile posture
 Conquer the unknown
 The two are exactly the same
 I haven't fully understood the reason yet
 But i will know in the end
 I will tell you when I know
 If you are interested
 There are some other ideas
 About God as an authority figure in the hierarchy
 Discard your religious prejudice about what you observe
 Simply observe what you see
 This is a primate in the picture
 He is looking up at the ruler
 This is what you see
 It is shown interestingly and symbolically
 You can see the Father with the cross
 I think it means there is a kind of cognition
 The person with the highest authority in the picture
 He accepted voluntarily
 The fact that suffering is also part of the being
 This is what this picture wants to express
 This authority figure holding a cross said
 This is what you have to accept
 This shocked bystanders
 Because it's real
 Is it true?
 You think so first
 Do you like the brave or the coward
 Blunt enough
 What is the limit of heroism
 After accepting the fact that you are mortal and not everything
 Can still live forever
 This is the core of respectable quality
 Why don't we assume that
 This is how we acted
 This is what everyone dreams of and hopes to do
 The premise is that you have abandoned
 The idea that you can live forever
 Eternal life may be worth looking forward to, maybe not
 Immortality is a long time
 But you definitely want this
 This painting says this is what you should be
 We got the same scene as the sky hole before
 That is a scene I have shown you before
 This is a transcendent truth
 Everywhere
 Jung would say that this concept is rooted in your mind
 Some elements of this are cultural
 It doesn’t have to be a cross
 Although the cross is a very old symbol
 Far before it was used in Christianity
 It is used in many religious expressions
 The soul resonates with it
 The picture on the right is Moses
 Standing on the mountain and receiving the law
 When we talk about "Exodus", we will talk about it
 Suppose
 Suppose we can talk about "Exodus"
 Where did this happen
 Above the mountain
 This is a pyramid right
 High to the stratosphere
 In the sky you look up
 What happened to Moses
 This is a clue I can think of
 Read Jean Piaget's book
 Let me figure it out
 Piaget’s view on the child part is
 They learned to play first
 But they don't understand the rules
 Means if there are a group of children together
 They can play games
 But if you pull out a young child
 For example, when you are six years old and ask what the rules of the game are
 They can only give you ambiguous descriptions
 So you found out the first six-year-old child
 He will tell you some rules
 The second six-year-old will tell you some different rules
 The third six-year-old will tell you something different
 But if you put them together
 They can play smoothly
 They have concrete knowledge
 Concretely individual or collective
 This knowledge has not been extracted
 Then they grow up
 You can extract the rules
 Then they can start playing the game according to the rules
 Piaget’s final step is
 Children don’t just play by the rules
 They also recognize that they can make rules
 He thinks this is the path of moral development
 First you can play
 Then you can play according to the rules
 Then you may realize
 Because he doesn't think everyone can recognize this
 You are actually the ruler
 This is not to say that the rules are arbitrary
 It means you can be a rule maker
 On the premise that you know how to play
 Piaget thinks this is the path of moral development
 I think this is exactly what happened
 What happened to Moses in "Exodus"
 Moses led all the Israelites
 They have no laws and no legislators
 They have tradition
 They are very grumpy
 Because they are in the desert
 They were under tyranny before
 Now in the desert
 Not much better
 So they are very angry about this
 They worship the wrong idol
 Disaster ensued
 Then they asked Moses to preside over justice
 He has been doing this for a long time
 The grumpy Israelis complained to Moses
 "He did this and she did that."
 Moses had to figure out how to reconcile them
 He did this for so long that his
 I remember his father-in-law
 Tell him to stop doing this
 Because he's almost exhausting himself
 You will think about what happened here
 I am not assuming this is a true historical story
 I think this is a condensed story
 Every group has a set of customs
 Like a pack of wolves
 These customs are being revealed
 There are some godsends observing and thinking
 What are the rules for this situation
 What are the rules for that situation
 What about this situation
 Then in his imagination
 These rules become a hierarchy
 Then climb the mountain
 He would miss my goodness
 This is the rule we have always lived by
 This is the revelation of the commandment
 What else
 Is it because there are rules first and then fulfilled?
 Wrong should be action and fulfillment first
 Then you can understand the purpose of everyone doing this
 You say that everyone sees this as your goal
 Then everyone thinks it makes sense
 Otherwise who follows these rules
 No one will follow these rules
 If they don’t match the established situation
 You just think it's unfair
 Here it is depicted as
 An earth-shaking human event
 Oh my God, we have always been just apes
 We have lived in the authority hierarchy for so long
 We are totally unaware of what we are doing
 Suddenly it was dark
 Wake up to the pen of God
 We can say that this is the law
 Do you say it was given by god
 It depends on your definition of God
 You can start from this preset
 But it is definitely not made out of nothing
 It’s interesting that Nietzsche observed something else
 He said moral enlightenment
 It was formed after a very long process
 From the initial structure to the later idea
 This is tens of millions of years
 Formed custom
 Before you get the enlightenment of written law
 What should the working mode be described as
 What is the mode that works
 It's a game you play with others
 Never degenerate day after day
 Piaget another insight
 Is the concept of equilibrium
 It is Immanuel Kant
 The extension of the concept of universal axioms
 Act in a certain way
 So that every behavior can become a universal law
 This is Kant's most basic moral axiom
 Piaget changed a little
 He said it's not exactly like this
 Acting in a certain way for you
 Now next week next month
 The next year ten years later
 Will still work
 And to the people around you
 And the whole society is effective
 This is the state of balance
 You can think of it as
 A hint of heaven coming to the city of God
 It is based on the idea that "morality must be repeatable"
 There are many
 Trading game simulated by artificial intelligence
 In the artificial intelligence system
 People who study the emergence of moral behavior
 Already discovered
 One of the most important elements in moral analysis
 Repeatability
 You cannot participate in degraded games
 Because it's degenerating
 The game you want to play
 At least stable over time
 If you really do it properly
 Maybe it will get better
 Of course this is what you want your family to be
 This is what you have been trying to do
 Unless you want revenge and destruction
 Is there a way
 Can keep us playing together
 Can make this common game better day by day
 This is what you want to do
 I don't think this is arbitrary
 This is why I think
 These postmodernists are really wrong
 They say there are countless ways to interpret this world
 This is true
 But the error is
 they said
 No way of explanation can be higher than the other
 So wrong
 This is the root of everything
 The proper explanation must be
 This is Piaget’s view
 If you and I are going to play a game
 Rule one we must all want to participate
 Rule two others should allow us to play
 Rule three we should make this game
 Last long without letting it degenerate
 Maybe rule four is
 When we are participating in the game
 This world won't kill us
 There are not many proper games
 You don't want your kids to play on the highway, right
 They can't play hockey on the highway
 Because the world will kill them
 There are infinite ways to explain this world
 But the solutions are not infinite
 The solution is constrained in the real world
 Constrained by our suffering in the world
 Also constrained by the fact that we constrain others
 I think this is the beginning of the big mistake
 If you understand the meaning of these ancient paintings
 They look very interesting
 Recently I found
 Once I understand the rationality behind it
 The painter put a lot of effort into this
 This is a print, isn't it
 They spent a lot of time to carve this painting
 They are serious about it
 When you understand the meaning of the painting
 These people are surrendered to the enlightenment of the law
 This is not surprising
 Try to break the rules and see what happens
 You try to violate the universal moral law
 See how it turns out
 I can always see people in this situation
 You have all seen everywhere
 Maybe I have seen more than you
 Because I am a clinical psychologist
 If the person who came to consult me ​​did not violate the universal law
 Then i can be sure
 Someone around him must have violated the universal law
 This is not a joke
 If you make a mistake, things get really bad
 When the system that regulates our being is revealed
 It's no surprise that you will feel frightened
 One thing in the Old Testament is amazing
 Nietzsche once commented on it
 He highly praised the Old Testament
 But the evaluation of the New Testament is average
 He believes that Europe will use the New Testament
 It is sinful to merge with the Old Testament
 Because Nietzsche believed that the Old Testament was
 Accurate presentation of the phenomenology of "being"
 It's like saying to stay awake and pay attention to words
 Be honest and stay alert
 Because of something you don't want to happen
 Very likely to happen
 Maybe not just you
 Maybe everyone you know
 Everything in your culture
 Will be destroyed generation after generation
 So it’s best to stay awake and alert
 I think only when people are arrogant
 Will turn a deaf ear to this
 I think most people understand this truth deep in their hearts
 When you become a bit self-righteous
 This happens often
 If you haven't lost your mind, you will think
 I'd better be careful and low-key
 If i am too bloated
 Things that make me stumble will happen
 Everyone knows that arrogant soldiers will lose
 So the Old Testament says
 The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom
 During my years as a clinical psychologist
 The one thing that really scares me is
 I have never seen anyone
 Can get away with anything even once
 There is an old saying
 God has a book that records everything in heaven
 Ok maybe it's not a book
 But it’s useful to hold this idea
 You may not agree
 Think that people always get away with something
 I tell you I have never seen such a fluke
 What I see is when something happens
 Someone distorted the structure of reality
 And "success"
 Because there was no rebound
 Then for example two years later
 The truth comes from the sky
 They will think it's so unfair
 Then let’s go back and analyze
 What happened before this
 Before this incident
 What about before this
 Go back further
 Oh, it's the bane of this thing
 You cannot not be bounced while distorting the structure of reality
 The reality is not developing as you wish. Why
 What are you going to do to distort the structure of reality
 I do not think so
 I think reality is stronger than you
 And I think one thing people are often bewitched is
 Do you think you can escape by chance
 Okay you try
 You see if it works
 You can't escape anything
 Realizing that this is the beginning of wisdom
 Something scares me
 Since last September
 I have received more public attention
 One thing that keeps me scared is making mistakes
 I know very well that no one can fault a sage
 But thank god i haven't done one thing wrong
 Or that no one has discovered yet
 But we are walking on thin ice
 At the same time fortunately
 Things around us have not deteriorated to the point of chaos
 And didn't get out of order quickly
 Staying true to the right way is not easy
 You know when you walk the right way
 Because when you are on the right path
 Things will become meaningful and fascinating
 But if you don’t really feel
 The terrible consequences of deviating
 Then you haven't really awakened
 This is what I saw in this painting
 It seems to say be careful because there are rules in the world
 If you go against it, no one can help you
 So for me there is something to consider
 I talked about something in the last Q&A session
 Combine the New Testament with the Old Testament
 One of the benefits
 Seems to be a change in morality
 This is similar to Piaget’s idea which is
 After you learn to play the game according to the rules
 You will learn to make rules
 To some extent i think
 The transition between the Old Testament and the New Testament
 That's it
 Most morals in the Old Testament are prohibitions
 These things you shouldn't do
 As it should be
 You ask your child so
 Always tell them not to do this or that
 Especially when they have fun
 You always remind them not to get overwhelmed
 Because whatever they are doing will cause trouble
 If you are a parent, you know this is a headache
 But the first rule of morality is the prohibition
 You have to control yourself to avoid trouble for yourself
 If you remember this
 And do well
 Once you become self-disciplined
 You can start doing something positive
 In my opinion this shift
 Is the New Testament and the Old Testament
 A common basic feature
 But looking at these images, they still seem to be prompting
 Serve Tradition Serve God
 From a psychological point of view
 Support tradition because this is the foundation of your life
 There is a book about Mesopotamian mythology
 Called "Enuma Elish"
 If you are interested, you can read it
 Improper behavior of the creation gods
 They are like two year olds
 In fact, many of them look like two-year-old children
 They killed the primitive god Abozu
 Abozu is the head of the gods
 They killed him and tried to live on his body
 This is what we all do
 Because we live on the corpses of our ancestors
 You can say living on our cultural corpse
 It is dead and not a good place to live
 You must constantly activate your culture
 So that it can stay alive and sober
 If you stay on the "corpse" for too long
 The devil or Chaos Demon will make a comeback
 Mesopotamian mythology tells such a story
 It's like saying don't delusion
 While staying on your ancestor’s corpse for a long time
 Without contributing to the lasting update of the survival system
 Because of all the constrained chaos
 Will come back to you eventually
 In stories like "The Hobbit"
 Hobbits are very kind
 They are short and fat
 They are not smart but arrogant
 They know nothing about the wider world outside
 If you remember they were protected by big steppers
 Striders are the king’s descendants
 Looks like a tramp
 The hobbit has nothing but looks down on the big stepper
 Big stepper patrolling the border
 Provide safety for the stupid hobbit
 But beyond the border
 Chaos is forming
 This is a prototype story
 This is why people like it so much
 That's how we are like hobbits
 The spirit of our dead ancestors protects us from chaos
 And we foolishly know nothing about it
 We feel we don't need them anymore
 This is exactly what the university is doing to the humanities
 This is jaw-dropping
 If we don’t wake up, we will pay for it
 We have hope to awaken
 It's better than paying
 Although it is painful to stay awake
 There was a picture in my mind once
 I portray the world like this
 I think the world is not a pyramid
 It is not a single authority hierarchy
 It's not like this
 It is a series of authority levels
 You can imagine a vast expanse of plains
 There are only one pyramid on this vast plain
 Inside the pyramid are people of all levels
 Everywhere in sight
 Row upon row of these pyramids
 Canine
 The plain is endless
 Here are all the positions you can climb to
 Everyone is crowded inside the pyramid
 Strive for
 Then there is such a possibility above everything
 It can glide through the air
 See the structure of the pyramid in action
 This is the all-seeing eye above the pyramid
 It sees the structure of the pyramid
 The highest law of being is not at the top of the pyramid
 But when you work towards the top of the pyramid
 Obtained iron law and self-control
 Liberate yourself from the pyramid
 Take it to the next level
 I think this is the concept of "Holy Spirit"
 A form of being instantiated
 I think this is similar to Sisyphus
 About Sisyphus, if I remember correctly, Nietzsche said
 "One must imagine that Sisyphus is happy."
 If there is a rock at the foot of the mountain
 You might as well push it up the mountain
 If the rock slides down
 Then you have something to do, right?
 Push the annoying rock up the mountain
 There is no shortage of rocks to be moved to the mountain
 After all, this is the purpose
 Let's deal with pushing annoying stones uphill
 Maybe we will have enough confidence
 And self-esteem
 So we don’t have hatred and vengeance
 And my heart is going to destroy the world
 Because I think this is also a choice
 Sisyphus is not cowardly
 You can see this
 A similar example is Atlas Hercules
 He volunteered to lift the earth on his shoulders
 It’s like Christ took all the sins in the world
 The concept behind this is the same
 The idea is that you should recognize
 The horror of your own humanity and bear it
 Exactly what it means
 The interesting thing is
 If you realize the horror of your own humanity
 Than before
 You will immediately have more respect for yourself
 Knowing that you are a monster is great
 Put it this way you are a monster
 Doesn't mean you have to be a monster
 But it’s useful to know that you are a monster
 Jung realized one thing
 This is also the magical thing I saw in his article
 I think this makes him
 Different from Joseph Campbell and others
 Campbell once said "whatever you like"
 And Jung’s view is the first step of enlightenment
 Is to meet the shadow
 What he meant by this sentence
 Every terrible thing humans do
 Are committed by humans
 You are one of them
 Don’t understand that the consequences can be serious
 To really understand its meaning
 To figure out why you can do evil
 It's crumble to think about it
 Try to imagine yourself as a
 People involved in medieval torture
 See how you can do this
 See that you will be reborn
 Rebirth after seeing clearly will be incredibly beneficial
 When you know that you can do evil
 You become a completely different you
 I think this is what I learned from Jung
 You can't be a good person until you understand
 How evil is your heart
 Impossible
 Part of the reason is that you don't have this potential
 If you are naive and kind
 If you don’t harm even one fly
 You do not have any of the above abilities
 Why should others take you seriously
 You are a domestic animal at best
 And it doesn't matter
 This is weird
 Because you don’t think about the revealing of evil
 Is the prerequisite basis for goodness
 First, if you don’t know the consequences of doing evil
 Why should you care
 Try to pursue good
 You need to take these things seriously
 This is not a child's game, is it
 This is a game for mature adults
 I realized this when I had children
 There is a chapter in my new book called
 "Never let your kids do things that make you hate them"
 Why i say that
 I wrote this after realizing I was a monster
 I think i need to make sure i love my child
 I want to make sure they behave appropriately by my side
 So i can like them
 I am much taller and older than them
 More cruel and ruthless than them
 My evil thoughts are far beyond their imagination
 If they irritate me
 I will definitely use evil thoughts on them
 If you think you can’t do this
 Then you must be the one doing this kind of thing
 I'm afraid we won't be able to tell the story of Adam and Eve today
 I have watched a very good documentary
 Called "The "Professional Killer" Hart"
 This documentary is about Brett Hart
 He was once the most famous Canadian in the world
 He is a wrestler in the World Wrestling League
 A good man
 He comes from a famous wrestling family
 Located in Alberta
 I remember he had seven brothers in total
 All wrestlers and seven sisters
 All the sisters are also married to wrestlers
 They are all children of Stuart Hart
 Hart was a wrestling manager 40 years ago
 This is a great documentary
 Because i am always curious
 Why people watch and believe in wrestling shows
 Do you believe in movies when you watch movies?
 This is a problem
 You believe when you are watching
 So when you watch a wrestling show
 And is a fan
 Do you believe in this show
 In fact it’s not about believing
 It's about whether you are immersed in the plot
 There are many different levels of plots in the world
 The wrestling story may not be
 The most complicated plot
 I'm not saying this to be smart
 Plots of different complexity are suitable for different people
 This is why religious truth
 Exist on multiple levels simultaneously
 To apply to everyone
 It is difficult to build such a belief system
 It is suitable for the most mature people
 Also suitable for ordinary people
 Back to wrestling Blatter Hart is a good guy
 He fits the archetype of "good guy"
 This is the subject of this documentary
 It’s a bit too difficult for him to act as the prototype of a "good guy"
 He manages an image very carefully
 He knew that about 120 million people knew him
 He will be regarded as a hero wherever he goes
 Later he found that it was a big burden
 You can imagine
 He performed in the arena
 Classic duel of good and evil
 Not conceptually or verbally
 It’s shown in practice
 Like Thor and the Hulk
 Just in front of your eyes
 This is the same kind of thing
 We can think that hockey is more refined than wrestling
 Maybe but I said before
 My views on the above are not critical
 I understand their purpose
 I highly recommend everyone to watch this documentary
 A very good work
 This is the same thing
 This is a silver cup
 This person is a hero in a single team
 This team is the hero of all teams
 This is interesting
 If you are a fan of the Toronto Blue Jays
 Or a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs
 Of course you will rarely have this experience
 If you are a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs
 Because they always lose
 If you watch a game and the team you support wins
 Test your testosterone level at this time it rises
 If you watch a Toronto Maple Leafs game they lose
 And you are their fan
 Then your testosterone level will drop
 This is really interesting
 Can you see how deeply these plots affect people?
 It can affect your biochemistry
 Your testosterone level is like saying
 "Oh, my team lost."
 It’s like saying, "Tonight is definitely not going to be strong anymore."
 Phenomenologically speaking, this is the universe
 I realized
 This is true
 Is true not metaphor
 This is much deeper than a metaphor
 The most true thing about life is
 Known domain and unknown domain
 You can call this the explored territory and the unexplored territory
 It's true this has existed a long time ago
 Early to the time when the lobster appeared
 If you put the lobster in a new environment
 They will patrol the territory first
 Find hiding place
 And build a nest
 So the first thing they do is
 Build the known from the unknown
 This is the so-called real a
 Is true from the perspective of Darwinism
 We think it’s true from the perspective of Darwinism
 True enough
 Because we are all creatures
 So the theory of evolution is closely related to us
 This is the Taoist Tai Chi diagram
 What it shows is what constitutes the experience since ancient times
 Very simple chaos and order
 Orderly existence in chaos
 There is chaos in order
 This is the way of life
 This is life itself
 You should always be
 The boundary between order and chaos
 why
 Stable enough and focused enough
 You are not only doing what you should do
 And it also makes you more likely
 Do better tomorrow
 You can feel the state of concentration
 You are at the right time and place
 Your nervous system will make you feel this
 This is the meaning of transcendence
 I also think that is the antidote to the pain of existentialism
 The antidote to the pain of existentialism is
 At the right time and place
 Be professional
 Anxiety and pain are the reality of existential pain
 When you are at the right time and place
 What will happen to your biochemistry
 Dopamine secretion
 What can it do
 It can suppress anxiety and relieve pain
 Not only that
 Because dopamine also makes people happy
 Make people willing to move forward
 This is also the basis of creativity
 So not only from a neurochemical perspective
 You get a positive experience
 Your pain and anxiety are also relieved
 This is not an assumption
 Dopamine system
 Which is the system responsible for biological exploration
 It is extremely ancient and far beyond imagination
 The dopamine system will be very suitable for you
 Motivated by receiving new information
 This is human nature
 We are hungry for information
 We want to be safe
 But at the same time, we must build on a sense of security
 We want to do it for ourselves
 We want to do this for others
 We want to do this for the family
 We also want to do this for society
 We want to unite the world to achieve this goal
 It makes sense
 God knows if you really do this
 How much suffering can the world reduce
 We can’t think if we do everything well
 How high can we achieve
 Maybe we can stop a lot
 Frustrating things in life
 We have stopped many bad things in the past hundred years
 Things are much better now than 100 years ago
 Of course it's not perfect now
 But 120 years ago compared to 100 years ago
 At that time, the average person in the West
 I live on less than one dollar a day
 In today's dollar
 You try to live like that for a week
 See how fun it is
 What does this Taoist Taiji picture mean?
 This is the chaos before the universe was born
 The Word of God at the Beginning of Time
 The order that can be accommodated is extracted from it
 It's all the same
 We will discuss chaos later
 Because it's complicated to describe
 When the World Trade Center collapsed
 What you are facing is "Chaos"
 Do you still remember how you felt at that time?
 Peace in the world on September 10
 Everyone knows what the world is like
 Then the 911 incident happened
 Everyone was dumbfounded for three days
 Because the World Trade Building fell
 What if it falls
 You can see the collapse of a building
 You can understand
 What happens when a building collapses
 Then why are you all dumbfounded
 When the building collapsed in the order we lived in
 Chaos turned out
 This is really a successful terrorist attack
 Everyone was stunned and curious
 Because this is a normal human response to the unknown
 Like facing a shark
 Remember the famous poster from the movie "Jaws"
 There is a woman swimming on the water
 A terrifying giant shark is waiting for an opportunity below
 This is life
 This is the world
 You will experience this from time to time
 When something in your life collapses like the World Trade Center
 You remember the abyss under your feet
 The primitive abyss
 So bottomless and you are fragile
 When you are betrayed
 Or when your dream is shattered, you can realize it
 You encountered chaos
 This chaos is the origin of the world
 You have to pay attention, you have to do the Tao
 To bring the world back to order
 None of the above is superstition
 The above is not even a metaphor
 All true
 And more real than anything else
 I think part of the reason is
 Life has always been like this
 This is the law of life since ancient times
 This is the universe is reality
 This is the environment we are in
 The so-called neo-atheists
 I don’t want to deviate too much from discussing new atheists
 Because I think atheists are always very honest
 And their analysis is consistent
 But I don’t think they take this issue seriously
 I think they are
 Not serious enough
 I don’t think you can deny such a point of view
 The more profound the impact of a thing on the screening of life
 The more real it is
 This is the axiom of Darwinian biology
 I think the Darwinian world is more
 The physical world is more real
 I tried to argue this point with Sam Harris
 I'm not doing well
 But the second conversation is ok
 Take this problem seriously
 This is a very serious and meaningful proposition
 Whether people know it or not
 They are all playing roles and want to play roles
 This picture is Marduk
 Marduk's story
 Let me talk briefly
 At the beginning of time, Diamat and Abzu hugged and joined
 They are the gods of salt water and fresh water
 Chaos and order
 They created yin and yang
 They also created the world of gods
 These gods to me
 Just like the source of power at the beginning of time
 They are like anger and love etc.
 Occupy us from ancient times to the present
 Also floods the whole world
 They murdered their father Abozu ignorantly
 They lived a life of drunkenness and then killed Abozu
 Diamatt learned of this, this picture shows Diamatt
 Looks terrible
 She is the mother of all things
 She is very unhappy about it
 Her children killed the structure itself
 Besides, they are noisy and careless
 She wants to do it
 She is like God in Noah’s story
 Similar to the Same Work
 Diamatt is back and say yes you guys
 It's endless, right?
 I want to clean up you
 She made a lot of monsters
 Then pick the worst monster to lead them
 The monster's name is "Jin Gu", the predecessor of Satan
 She let the gods know that she is coming for revenge
 The gods are not happy about this
 They are gods but she is Chaos itself
 Mother of all things
 This is not a joke
 The gods challenged Diamat one by one
 One by one
 Powerless
 One day a new god appeared
 He is Marduk
 The gods found him extraordinary as soon as he was born
 To know that time
 The tribes of Mesopotamia are coming together to become
 One of the first great civilizations in history
 The gods of these tribes
 Also brought together to form a hierarchy
 To figure out what traits can rule everything
 Marduk was chosen by the gods
 He said, "I can challenge Diamat."
 But one thing
 From now on you all will follow me
 I come to master destiny
 I am the head of the gods
 I'm at the top of the hierarchy
 Other gods said, "No problem
 "As long as you solve the chaos, we will only look forward to you."
 Marduk's head is full of eyes
 And can vomit spells
 This is his main characteristic
 He brought a net to challenge Diamat
 Besie her in a net
 I think it's so funny
 Because the net represents generalization
 This is a conceptual summary
 He surrounded chaos itself with conceptual structure
 He trapped Diamat in the net and cut into pieces
 Then he created the world
 He created mankind
 They live and serve the gods in this world
 He created mankind with Jin Gu's blood
 Jin Gu is the head of all demons
 Colin Dyan one of my students
 Helped me understand the problem
 I think this is really pessimistic
 This is like a metaphor for "fallen"
 A view of original sin
 My common conclusion on this with Diyang is
 Human beings are the only
 A creature that is truly capable of deceiving
 We have the ability to do evil
 Like in the story of Adam and Eve
 We can do those things
 That's why we are
 Made by the blood of the head of all demons
 We are creatures that can deceive the structure of reality
 There was an emperor in Mesopotamia
 This emperor is the incarnation of Marduk
 This is the reason why he took the throne of God
 Only by becoming Marduk can you be emperor
 He wants to be a good Marduk
 That means he needs to challenge Diamatt, Chaos
 Break it into pieces and create order with corpses
 Every new year celebration
 Mesopotamians will walk out of the siege
 From explored area to unexplored area
 From the Siege into Chaos
 And bring all the sculptures representing the gods
 They put it into practice
 Because they have to figure out the meaning
 They put it into practice
 They called the emperor over
 Then the priest would make the emperor kneel
 Let him take off his robe
 Let him kneel and humiliate him
 Beat him with gloves
 Then say, "Why this year
 "You didn't make a good Marduk."
 The king will reflect on everything
 His shortcomings in the fight against chaos
 Then they will start celebrating the new year
 Marduk finally won
 And have sex with a royal prostitute
 St. George
 Retake the virgin from the dragon
 same
 If you face the serpentine chaos bravely
 You can get something out of it
 If you unite it
 You can produce a creative order
 This is what they show through action
 This is the source of inspiration for the sovereignty of the Mesopotamians
 Really smart
 The Mesopotamians have a profound influence on later civilizations
 This huge influence continues to this day
 This is a lot about
 An example of a story derived from the concept of ruling power
 This is the evolution of the concept of "God"
 This is a thinking angle
 But more importantly
 This is the evolution of the concept of human atonement
 One of the results of this concept is the story of the Buddha
 The other is the story of Christ
 The concept of perfect individual
 This is at the beginning of time
 "Tao" speaks the truth into chaos
 The birth of a good order that can be accommodated
 This is the point of this story
 In addition
 Show you these images
 Because they are so interesting
 Once you know what they mean
 You know how powerful it is
 This is a symbol of infinity
 That's Hercules
 And Lena Hydra
 What is life like
 What happens if one head is cut off?
 Seven more heads
 What can you do to escape home
 Can't do this
 This is what you should do
 You have to fight it
 Hydra is like the ultimate chaos, constantly producing small chaos
 But chaos also brings life back to life
 Otherwise, life will stay the same
 This picture shows the heads of Mercury and Hydra
 Hydra will petrify you
 The middle picture is Saint George
 He is slaying dragons peacefully, which is very interesting
 There is a blessing expression on his face
 This is a very special way of expression
 This is another painting of St. George's Virgin in the background
 If I remember correctly, she might be Saint Anne
 Saint George is the patron saint of England
 This illustrates the habit of mankind towards war
 This is a muslim warrior
 It’s easy to imagine the enemy as a dragon
 Because the enemy is always a predator
 We demonize the enemy without thinking
 Then we can start a war with indignation
 Because why not kill the snake
 The question is where is the snake
 Maybe they are on the outside, maybe they are on the inside
 Maybe in this room
 What's more terrifying is maybe in your heart
 Wisdom is when you know that evil is in your heart
 Why she is unhappy about it
 Especially when she had a baby
 Very seriously
 This is the visual god of Horus
 He is a falcon because falcons have excellent vision
 They can see everything clearly when they fly over the world
 This is the Egyptian god of creation Horus
 I will tell the story of Horus from now on
 These pictures show what I once called
 The emergence of meta heroes from heroes
 There is someone you admire
 Then there is a group of people you admire
 Then there is a meta collection of admirable people
 And the refinement of ideals
 I think this is what these pictures are going to show
 This picture is quite remarkable
 Very inscrutable picture
 Jesus has asymmetrical faces on both sides
 One side is God and the other side is mortal
 This is the meaning of this holy portrait
 A fully grown person
 This is in this way of expression
 One of the oldest works we know
 The implication is that there is a human ordinaryness
 It is also closely connected with sacredness
 Is also willing to take the initiative
 Responsibility as a limited life
 Resulting in such a combination
 And this is also reflected in a book
 This is the words associated with the Son
 This is the correct way of being
 I think this is the perfect example
 The process of a prototype emerging from the masses
 I think so
 I think we have finished the first chapter of Genesis
 Although it took three lessons
 I have to say that God is really complicated
 thank you all
