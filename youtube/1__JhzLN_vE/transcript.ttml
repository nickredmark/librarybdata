<p begin="00:01:40.640" end="00:01:44.870" style="s2">yeah the topic is staying inside which</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.580" end="00:01:46.550" style="s2">we&#39;re all supposed to be doing at this</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.870" end="00:01:48.710" style="s2">point in time some people have more</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.550" end="00:01:51.880" style="s2">trouble with that than than others and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.710" end="00:01:56.120" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk a little bit about that in in</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.880" end="00:01:58.280" style="s2">part of the presentation and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.120" end="00:02:00.470" style="s2">going to talk about is drawing on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.280" end="00:02:02.620" style="s2">number of different thinkers who all</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.470" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">I&#39;ll mention and give references to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.620" end="00:02:08.299" style="s2">anybody who wants to contact me later</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:10.970" style="s2">for follow-ups about well you know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.299" end="00:02:12.620" style="s2">talked about Rilke we&#39;re looking real</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.970" end="00:02:16.129" style="s2">good for that feel free to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.620" end="00:02:18.379" style="s2">so what I&#39;m going to run through most of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.129" end="00:02:20.060" style="s2">which is just me throwing ideas out</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.379" end="00:02:22.730" style="s2">there at you</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.060" end="00:02:25.279" style="s2">but the last two which will be a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.730" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">bit more interactive are the following</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.279" end="00:02:28.020" style="s2">first I want to talk about this notion</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.770" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.020" end="00:02:34.830" style="s2">your life and what it means and you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.770" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">why we would turn to philosophy to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.830" end="00:02:39.980" style="s2">understand it and then we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.290" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">why why it&#39;s good for us to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.980" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">interior life when it sounds like yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:48.210" style="s2">one more thing that we were supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:50.880" style="s2">be doing and then I&#39;ll talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.210" end="00:02:53.730" style="s2">the crisis that we&#39;re in and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.880" end="00:02:57.240" style="s2">opportunities that were given and some</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.730" end="00:02:59.850" style="s2">of the challenges as well then I also</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.240" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">want to explore something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.850" end="00:03:03.570" style="s2">connected with this this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:06.600" style="s2">solitude so you see that in the title</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.570" end="00:03:09.300" style="s2">well what is that well we&#39;ll go into</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.600" end="00:03:11.220" style="s2">that and I&#39;ll be bringing in some stoic</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.300" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">thinkers and some existentialist</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.220" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">thinkers to talk about that another</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:22.410" style="s2">closely related topic is something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:23.880" style="s2">we start to work on if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.410" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">ourselves and we find that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.880" end="00:03:28.710" style="s2">entirely happy with it which is this</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:30.450" style="s2">goal of integrating the self and and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.710" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">ties in well with you know what Peter</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.450" end="00:03:34.620" style="s2">was referencing in spiritual practices a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:37.380" style="s2">lot of those spiritual practices from</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.620" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">antiquity on are aimed at that an idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.380" end="00:03:41.790" style="s2">then solitude and integrating the self</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">fit in with each other then I&#39;ll I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.790" end="00:03:47.070" style="s2">consider an issue that I think is almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:48.600" style="s2">it automatically arises you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.070" end="00:03:51.510" style="s2">worry about well if I&#39;m if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.600" end="00:03:53.700" style="s2">retreating into myself then aren&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.510" end="00:03:56.910" style="s2">cutting off my relationships with others</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.700" end="00:03:59.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s a valid concern but one that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.910" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">turns out to be unnecessary if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.550" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">doing it right and then we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">some obstacles to cultivating solitude</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:07.830" style="s2">and and a rich interior life and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:09.900" style="s2">where we&#39;ll get a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.830" end="00:04:11.070" style="s2">interactive I&#39;ve got a few that I want</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.900" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">to bring up but I&#39;m sure that some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.070" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">you do as well and then I&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:19.350" style="s2">some recommendations that I have and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:20.520" style="s2">not I&#39;m not coming up with anything new</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.350" end="00:04:23.970" style="s2">this is all just coming from these</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.520" end="00:04:25.290" style="s2">authors who I&#39;m referencing but we might</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.970" end="00:04:28.190" style="s2">come up with some some other good</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.290" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">practices for supporting and maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.190" end="00:04:35.500" style="s2">solitude so interior life this is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:36.640" style="s2">of a technical term in and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.500" end="00:04:38.710" style="s2">you could call them traditions of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.640" end="00:04:40.390" style="s2">spiritual developments there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.710" end="00:04:43.060" style="s2">other synonyms for this we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.390" end="00:04:46.860" style="s2">about the inner world of one&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.060" end="00:04:49.540" style="s2">person interior already gets used a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.860" end="00:04:52.150" style="s2">Stoics like to use this concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.540" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">inner citadel which comes from Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.150" end="00:04:55.210" style="s2">Aurelius if you actually look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:57.580" style="s2">epictetus he says watch out for inner</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.210" end="00:04:58.810" style="s2">Citadel&#39;s because that&#39;s where not all</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.580" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">of them are great that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.810" end="00:05:04.690" style="s2">sometimes what the vise is set up within</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">us with Rilke we have this space of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.690" end="00:05:08.980" style="s2">solitude or Hinds ohm kite that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:10.330" style="s2">going to talk about in a bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.980" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s made its way into popular</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.330" end="00:05:16.810" style="s2">culture I remember in the Sherlock</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:19.330" style="s2">Holmes show that that BBC put out in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.810" end="00:05:21.970" style="s2">last five years or so he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.330" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">retreating to his interior castle or</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.970" end="00:05:26.169" style="s2">inner castle or mind castle it&#39;s how he</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:29.290" style="s2">framed it right and all of these are</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.169" end="00:05:31.330" style="s2">really touching on the same idea all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.290" end="00:05:33.340" style="s2">us have the beginnings of this just by</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.330" end="00:05:34.870" style="s2">being human beings it&#39;s part of normal</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.340" end="00:05:37.480" style="s2">human development if you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.870" end="00:05:40.870" style="s2">some sort of interior already that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.480" end="00:05:43.260" style="s2">that&#39;s you on your own you really</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.870" end="00:05:48.100" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be able to function well and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.260" end="00:05:49.570" style="s2">it&#39;s been a major topic of focus in many</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.100" end="00:05:52.060" style="s2">of the ancient traditions of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.570" end="00:05:54.610" style="s2">ethics so we can think about Platonism</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.060" end="00:05:57.760" style="s2">aristotelianism stoicism as being the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.610" end="00:05:59.470" style="s2">heavy hitters in that respect but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.760" end="00:06:03.669" style="s2">also something that the existentialist</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.470" end="00:06:06.100" style="s2">gave a lot of attention to various other</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.669" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">you know wisdom traditions whether</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.100" end="00:06:11.560" style="s2">philosophical or they just have have</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:14.729" style="s2">spent a lot of time on discussing this</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.560" end="00:06:17.620" style="s2">and some forms of psychotherapy as well</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.729" end="00:06:19.000" style="s2">now some psychological perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.620" end="00:06:21.250" style="s2">would rule this out if any of you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.000" end="00:06:24.010" style="s2">remember behaviorism which is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.250" end="00:06:26.740" style="s2">dead thing at this time you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.010" end="00:06:29.380" style="s2">no interior already at all well it turns</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.740" end="00:06:32.620" style="s2">out that was that was quite false many</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.380" end="00:06:35.020" style="s2">many other forms of psychotherapy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.620" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">psychology have you know viewed this as</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.020" end="00:06:41.320" style="s2">something quite important so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:44.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a you could say it&#39;s a concept that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.320" end="00:06:46.300" style="s2">corresponds to an experience but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.260" end="00:06:48.950" style="s2">not a simple one it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.300" end="00:06:50.840" style="s2">complex and it&#39;s a little bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.950" end="00:06:52.700" style="s2">funny that we can talk about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.840" end="00:06:54.830" style="s2">general because if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.700" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">it correctly there it exists in you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.830" end="00:07:00.260" style="s2">you and you and me and it exists in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:02.650" style="s2">sort of independent though similar way</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.260" end="00:07:05.300" style="s2">in all of us so there&#39;s some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.650" end="00:07:06.920" style="s2">problems that get raised by that which</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.300" end="00:07:08.630" style="s2">we can talk about a little bit later on</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.920" end="00:07:10.580" style="s2">but the point is we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.630" end="00:07:13.670" style="s2">understand it and we can develop it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.580" end="00:07:14.450" style="s2">we can use it because it is not just a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.670" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">part of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.450" end="00:07:21.620" style="s2">it is us this is us understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:25.220" style="s2">ourselves in the depth of our being so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.620" end="00:07:27.830" style="s2">why do we need to develop interior life</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.220" end="00:07:30.950" style="s2">and not just interior life but interior</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.830" end="00:07:33.980" style="s2">life of a certain kind I wanted to begin</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.950" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">with with Blaise Pascal&#39;s dictum he says</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.980" end="00:07:37.730" style="s2">that and there&#39;s a little bit over</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:39.350" style="s2">playing his hand here but but it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.730" end="00:07:41.780" style="s2">true in many respects humanities</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.350" end="00:07:44.360" style="s2">problems stem from human beings</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.780" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">inability to sit quietly in a room alone</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.360" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">I think you&#39;ve all heard that before and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:51.620" style="s2">it&#39;s quite true you know people seek out</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:55.970" style="s2">distractions oftentimes seek out</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.620" end="00:07:59.240" style="s2">conflicts and they do so in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.970" end="00:08:03.860" style="s2">sometimes are not particularly good for</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.240" end="00:08:06.710" style="s2">them so why do we need solitude why do</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.860" end="00:08:09.260" style="s2">we need an interior life it helps us to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.710" end="00:08:12.620" style="s2">develop a kind of independence and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.260" end="00:08:16.210" style="s2">self-sufficiency that that&#39;s needed in</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.620" end="00:08:18.620" style="s2">order to be autonomous human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.210" end="00:08:21.320" style="s2">be able to you know sit quietly in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.620" end="00:08:23.390" style="s2">room alone or a waiting room or wherever</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.320" end="00:08:27.800" style="s2">else we&#39;re supposed to be and it also</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.390" end="00:08:29.960" style="s2">allows us to develop a responsiveness</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.800" end="00:08:33.830" style="s2">and attentiveness that we otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.960" end="00:08:35.330" style="s2">might be lacking and not just to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.830" end="00:08:37.099" style="s2">going on within ourselves but also</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.330" end="00:08:40.010" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with with other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.099" end="00:08:43.370" style="s2">to be able to take note of when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.010" end="00:08:44.840" style="s2">else is struggling and say the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.370" end="00:08:47.510" style="s2">that could be helpful at that point in</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.840" end="00:08:51.500" style="s2">time or to be able to share in the joys</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.510" end="00:08:54.540" style="s2">or sorrows of another and so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.500" end="00:08:56.459" style="s2">sounds kind of paradoxical in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.540" end="00:08:57.720" style="s2">you&#39;re withdrawing from things but</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.459" end="00:09:00.750" style="s2">you&#39;re withdrawing so that you can come</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.720" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">back to them we also I think need this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.750" end="00:09:06.540" style="s2">and you know the again this will sound a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:09.000" style="s2">little counterintuitive we&#39;re all stuck</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.540" end="00:09:11.910" style="s2">at home so you can take a break whenever</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.000" end="00:09:14.610" style="s2">you want to right you can sleep in if</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.910" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">you&#39;d like to there are the essential</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.610" end="00:09:19.410" style="s2">people have to go off to work but many</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:23.910" style="s2">of us are doing work from home or were</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.410" end="00:09:26.420" style="s2">just staying at home well you can wear</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.910" end="00:09:29.579" style="s2">yourself out even even on a vacation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.420" end="00:09:32.550" style="s2">so what we&#39;re talking about is solitude</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.579" end="00:09:36.149" style="s2">here is needed for sort of recharging</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.550" end="00:09:38.579" style="s2">and reconnecting to deeper and more</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.149" end="00:09:41.399" style="s2">important things getting away from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.579" end="00:09:43.829" style="s2">superficial aspects of life and into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.399" end="00:09:47.240" style="s2">deeper aspects of life and this leads us</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.829" end="00:09:50.130" style="s2">to be able to engage in self-discovery</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.240" end="00:09:51.319" style="s2">in a variety of different ways and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.130" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">not the sort of navel-gazing</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.319" end="00:09:57.630" style="s2">narcissistic self-discovery that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:58.920" style="s2">would then announce itself on social</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.630" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">media to everybody Hey look what I found</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.920" end="00:10:03.949" style="s2">in my solitude or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">but so you know being able to honestly</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.949" end="00:10:10.019" style="s2">assess who we are and get to know</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:11.610" style="s2">ourselves better and that includes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.019" end="00:10:14.190" style="s2">of things that we might not be entirely</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.610" end="00:10:15.630" style="s2">happy with I&#39;ll talk about that in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.190" end="00:10:18.319" style="s2">but this is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.630" end="00:10:21.180" style="s2">Rilke is probably the person who has</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.319" end="00:10:23.010" style="s2">identified this that the best it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.180" end="00:10:25.290" style="s2">necessary in order to generate a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.010" end="00:10:28.319" style="s2">depth within ourselves and the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.290" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">that depth is part of why Pascal is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.319" end="00:10:32.190" style="s2">right about about many people or even</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:35.339" style="s2">about those who are developing it but</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.190" end="00:10:37.050" style="s2">aren&#39;t using it at the right time and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.339" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">if we&#39;re if we&#39;re cultivating this it</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.050" end="00:10:43.740" style="s2">can lead to better relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:45.689" style="s2">others and to the world as a whole or to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.740" end="00:10:50.310" style="s2">other things we might think about nature</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.689" end="00:10:52.949" style="s2">we might think about you know animals or</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.310" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">all sorts of other things that were in</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.949" end="00:10:58.199" style="s2">relation to and now we&#39;re presented with</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">some some very interesting opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.199" end="00:11:04.170" style="s2">and challenges in the present one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">these of course is staying inside you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.170" end="00:11:07.970" style="s2">know because of the pandemic those of us</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:10.269" style="s2">who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.970" end="00:11:12.439" style="s2">following stay-at-home orders</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.269" end="00:11:14.060" style="s2">understandably there there are some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.439" end="00:11:15.769" style="s2">our states here in America where the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.060" end="00:11:17.990" style="s2">governor&#39;s haven&#39;t actually declared</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.769" end="00:11:20.509" style="s2">stay-at-home workers unfortunately but</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.990" end="00:11:22.459" style="s2">you know the ones that that are on track</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.509" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">have told us all to stay inside and when</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.459" end="00:11:25.459" style="s2">we&#39;re outside</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">we&#39;re isolated from each other we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.459" end="00:11:29.300" style="s2">engaging in social distancing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:33.370" style="s2">supposed to be wearing masks</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.300" end="00:11:36.379" style="s2">which already hide a good portion of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.370" end="00:11:37.879" style="s2">face that we would use to understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.379" end="00:11:40.459" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with other key people</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.879" end="00:11:42.680" style="s2">from each other yeah I remember when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.459" end="00:11:44.689" style="s2">first started walking our dog with a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.680" end="00:11:46.339" style="s2">mask she was kind of upset about it she</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.689" end="00:11:47.779" style="s2">didn&#39;t she didn&#39;t like the fact that she</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.339" end="00:11:50.029" style="s2">couldn&#39;t see what was going on on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.779" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">but in my eyes and I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.029" end="00:11:54.889" style="s2">of that with people so there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:57.170" style="s2">lot of isolation going on and some</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.889" end="00:11:59.569" style="s2">people look at this with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.170" end="00:12:02.269" style="s2">hostility you know who are you to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.569" end="00:12:05.149" style="s2">interrupt my activities and tell me I</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.269" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">can&#39;t be next to people and do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.149" end="00:12:09.170" style="s2">I want to do there&#39;s other you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:11.810" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing some interesting protests</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.170" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">going on right now a lot of which I</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.810" end="00:12:16.309" style="s2">think are driven by ideological you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">ideological judgments on their parts</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.309" end="00:12:23.089" style="s2">some people are very driven by fear for</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:27.379" style="s2">their own self but I think this offers</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.089" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">us an opportunity to look at the things</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.379" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">that we&#39;re supposed to be doing in terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:34.550" style="s2">of justice towards other people we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">want to get other people sick and a kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.550" end="00:12:40.490" style="s2">of decency and that&#39;s that&#39;s one topic</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:43.879" style="s2">and we could explore that more but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.490" end="00:12:46.879" style="s2">what do we do we&#39;re even if we have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.879" end="00:12:49.250" style="s2">right sort of mindset were stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.879" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">these constrained spaces unless you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.250" end="00:12:53.569" style="s2">celebrity I don&#39;t know if any of you saw</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:56.350" style="s2">the celebrity video with all of them in</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.569" end="00:12:58.550" style="s2">their palatial homes singing imagine</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.350" end="00:13:00.110" style="s2">they have got a lot of backlash from</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.550" end="00:13:01.819" style="s2">that because people are like man I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.110" end="00:13:02.389" style="s2">stuck in my studio apartment look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.819" end="00:13:04.550" style="s2">these people</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.389" end="00:13:06.769" style="s2">so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re not a celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.550" end="00:13:08.209" style="s2">and you&#39;re stuck in something but</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.769" end="00:13:12.319" style="s2">smaller you might you might have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.209" end="00:13:16.339" style="s2">of being stir-crazy or isolated and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.319" end="00:13:19.009" style="s2">we&#39;re also stuck with other people you</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.810" end="00:14:08.630" style="s2">something that maybe some of us have</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.710" end="00:14:15.529" style="s2">myself and we have this opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.400" end="00:14:18.080" style="s2">learn from from ancient and medieval and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.529" end="00:14:21.290" style="s2">modern thinkers about the resources for</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.080" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">developing a rich interior life so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.290" end="00:14:26.210" style="s2">want to talk about this conception of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:28.100" style="s2">solitude in German it&#39;s a Nizam kite</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.210" end="00:14:32.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the word that that Rilke and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.100" end="00:14:34.700" style="s2">Nietzsche use and in Greek it&#39;s animals</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.050" end="00:14:36.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the word that Epictetus use is</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.700" end="00:14:38.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the word by the way that we get</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.680" end="00:14:41.450" style="s2">hermit from a hermit is somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.600" end="00:14:44.390" style="s2">goes off into maybe the desert or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.450" end="00:14:46.520" style="s2">wasteland to be alone and so so it has</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.390" end="00:14:50.410" style="s2">to do with this being alone and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.520" end="00:14:53.180" style="s2">good and bad valence --is to these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.410" end="00:14:55.910" style="s2">it can also be translated as loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.180" end="00:14:58.280" style="s2">and even in Rilke Rilke has two</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.910" end="00:15:00.470" style="s2">different poems that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.280" end="00:15:02.960" style="s2">referencing eye exam one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.470" end="00:15:04.820" style="s2">about these two lovers that can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.960" end="00:15:06.500" style="s2">along with each other and having laying</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.820" end="00:15:08.360" style="s2">in bed with back-to-back with each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.500" end="00:15:11.170" style="s2">and they are totally alone even though</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.360" end="00:15:15.020" style="s2">they&#39;re in the same room with each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.170" end="00:15:17.330" style="s2">and the way it&#39;s translated in the lobe</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.020" end="00:15:19.580" style="s2">I think is the old father translation of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.330" end="00:15:22.010" style="s2">epictetus is forlorn this which is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.580" end="00:15:23.930" style="s2">nice English term and epictetus devotes</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.010" end="00:15:26.270" style="s2">some some attention to it so you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.930" end="00:15:27.950" style="s2">what makes this bad for other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.270" end="00:15:30.140" style="s2">what are we experiencing that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.950" end="00:15:32.060" style="s2">negative right now part of it could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.140" end="00:15:33.020" style="s2">disconnection from others and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.060" end="00:15:34.730" style="s2">when we want</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.020" end="00:15:39.290" style="s2">actions with others and we can&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.730" end="00:15:43.010" style="s2">so you know for example I get with my</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.290" end="00:15:45.620" style="s2">children who live two states away by</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.010" end="00:15:47.450" style="s2">phone and text and you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.620" end="00:15:49.700" style="s2">sort of thing it would be nice to be in</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.450" end="00:15:52.940" style="s2">the same room with them at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.700" end="00:15:56.200" style="s2">I haven&#39;t seen them since Christmas time</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.940" end="00:15:58.640" style="s2">and who knows how long the quarantines</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.200" end="00:16:00.080" style="s2">right but you know we&#39;re still able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.640" end="00:16:01.480" style="s2">maintain some connection I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.080" end="00:16:03.710" style="s2">a lot of people who just are</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.480" end="00:16:05.590" style="s2">disconnected entirely from those who</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.710" end="00:16:09.470" style="s2">they would want to be connected with</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.590" end="00:16:11.150" style="s2">another thing that epictetus picks out</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.470" end="00:16:15.200" style="s2">he says what is it that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.150" end="00:16:16.550" style="s2">like about being on their own that makes</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.200" end="00:16:18.890" style="s2">them feel that it&#39;s a negative</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.550" end="00:16:20.840" style="s2">experience and he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.890" end="00:16:23.300" style="s2">perception that you&#39;re without resources</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.840" end="00:16:24.950" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have what you need to to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.300" end="00:16:27.530" style="s2">deal with things to cope with things and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.950" end="00:16:29.330" style="s2">I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a common thing is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.530" end="00:16:31.940" style="s2">but you know worries of that well what</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.330" end="00:16:35.180" style="s2">if something happens to me who&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.940" end="00:16:36.860" style="s2">to take care of me and then another</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.180" end="00:16:40.370" style="s2">thing that that could be the case for</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.860" end="00:16:43.460" style="s2">those who are in you know quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.370" end="00:16:45.560" style="s2">with others but are still experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.460" end="00:16:47.960" style="s2">the negative side of items on kite or</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.560" end="00:16:52.190" style="s2">solitude would be not being able to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.960" end="00:16:55.370" style="s2">understood by others being sort of cut</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.190" end="00:16:57.020" style="s2">off from not being recognized or</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.370" end="00:16:58.670" style="s2">acknowledged in the way that say you</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.020" end="00:17:00.260" style="s2">know Hagel talks about in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.670" end="00:17:02.150" style="s2">phenomenology where that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.260" end="00:17:04.970" style="s2">the central thing driving that at work</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.150" end="00:17:08.290" style="s2">by the way is drive for recognition from</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.970" end="00:17:12.440" style="s2">other people for being acknowledged and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.290" end="00:17:15.320" style="s2">those are the negative sides of it there</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.440" end="00:17:17.900" style="s2">are some very positive sides to solitude</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.320" end="00:17:21.800" style="s2">as well and epictetus talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.900" end="00:17:23.720" style="s2">in in a chapter in his discourses and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.800" end="00:17:26.450" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of representative of an</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.720" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">ancient view on solitude it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.450" end="00:17:32.540" style="s2">to be able to be on one&#39;s own that is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:36.710" style="s2">goal for a fully developed human being</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.540" end="00:17:38.990" style="s2">and he uses Zeus being and of course we</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.990" end="00:17:42.890" style="s2">of the Stoics believe there was a world</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.790" end="00:17:52.370" style="s2">and Epicurus why me Azusa and lonely and</p>

<p begin="00:18:14.660" end="00:18:19.490" style="s2">of course has this metaphor of the inner</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.670" end="00:19:54.350" style="s2">letters to a young poet but also in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.350" end="00:19:56.900" style="s2">of his other works is developed to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.350" end="00:19:58.790" style="s2">greatest degree and he talks about at</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.900" end="00:19:59.810" style="s2">the very first this you know letter to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.790" end="00:20:02.570" style="s2">this young man he said</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.810" end="00:20:04.130" style="s2">drawn to yourself and enter into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.570" end="00:20:07.010" style="s2">space of solitude where you can identify</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.130" end="00:20:08.420" style="s2">what your real desires are and see</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.010" end="00:20:10.160" style="s2">whether you need to write whether you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.420" end="00:20:13.610" style="s2">need to be a poet if not do something</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.160" end="00:20:15.890" style="s2">else and if you can&#39;t think of topics to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.610" end="00:20:17.630" style="s2">write enter into your solitude and think</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.890" end="00:20:19.010" style="s2">about your childhood now he&#39;s telling</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.630" end="00:20:21.050" style="s2">him to think about his childhood because</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.010" end="00:20:23.300" style="s2">the man is a young man we can say think</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.050" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">about your other memories you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.300" end="00:20:27.710" style="s2">nearly 50 so I can think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:30.140" style="s2">what was going on with one of our dogs</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.710" end="00:20:32.600" style="s2">that we&#39;ve lost and the memories of him</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.140" end="00:20:33.430" style="s2">from just a few years ago but enter into</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.600" end="00:20:36.590" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.430" end="00:20:40.250" style="s2">Andrea propriate those and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.590" end="00:20:42.410" style="s2">always have material to work on and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.250" end="00:20:45.650" style="s2">we&#39;ll go suggest this not just for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.410" end="00:20:50.150" style="s2">you know the purpose of creativity but</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.650" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">to get to know who you are and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.150" end="00:20:55.270" style="s2">the other key ideas with this is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:58.430" style="s2">notion of integration of oneself</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.270" end="00:21:01.220" style="s2">integration of who you are what do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.430" end="00:21:02.510" style="s2">find when we go inside this is one</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.220" end="00:21:06.290" style="s2">reason a lot of people don&#39;t want to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.510" end="00:21:08.930" style="s2">inside we find that we&#39;re a mess I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.290" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">you know virtue ethics is not about</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.930" end="00:21:14.150" style="s2">telling us the perfect blueprint for how</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:16.670" style="s2">we ought to be and then we just snap to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.150" end="00:21:19.400" style="s2">it and you know impose that upon</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.670" end="00:21:21.410" style="s2">ourselves what we find out whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.400" end="00:21:23.390" style="s2">taking a university liyan path or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.410" end="00:21:25.250" style="s2">stoical path or an existentialist path</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.390" end="00:21:28.780" style="s2">or some sort of monastic Christian path</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.250" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">is that we are a battleground of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.780" end="00:21:35.780" style="s2">different ideas and desires and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:38.090" style="s2">assumptions and they war with each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.780" end="00:21:40.130" style="s2">Epictetus actually uses this this term</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.090" end="00:21:42.860" style="s2">that gets translated as contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.130" end="00:21:46.550" style="s2">it&#39;s really Maki it means conflict it</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.860" end="00:21:49.790" style="s2">means fighting and this the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.550" end="00:21:53.090" style="s2">goal is to become less like that and why</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.790" end="00:21:55.880" style="s2">you know because it makes us happier to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.090" end="00:21:58.100" style="s2">be like that and so when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.880" end="00:22:00.650" style="s2">about integrating ourself we have this</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.100" end="00:22:03.050" style="s2">experience over and over again of only</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.650" end="00:22:04.460" style="s2">partial integration and a conflict we</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.050" end="00:22:06.650" style="s2">might even realize that we&#39;re in some</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.460" end="00:22:08.780" style="s2">respects bad people and then we&#39;re posed</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.650" end="00:22:10.700" style="s2">with the question well do I just simply</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.780" end="00:22:11.710" style="s2">embrace that and say I&#39;m a person</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.700" end="00:22:14.140" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.710" end="00:22:16.210" style="s2">or deny it and repress it and project it</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.140" end="00:22:18.669" style="s2">out on to others or do we say wow I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.210" end="00:22:20.590" style="s2">got stuff to work on I better like pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.669" end="00:22:24.250" style="s2">more attention to this entering into</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.590" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">solitude being by oneself offers</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.250" end="00:22:28.809" style="s2">possibilities for doing this provided</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:30.850" style="s2">one uses resources that are available</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.809" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">rather than trying to reinvent the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.850" end="00:22:37.210" style="s2">and we might also think about what are</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.679" end="00:22:38.770" style="s2">we actually aiming at when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.210" end="00:22:41.230" style="s2">about integrating the self are we</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.770" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">looking at this higher kind of self that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.230" end="00:22:45.970" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve got you know think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:48.010" style="s2">plato&#39;s try parts on tripartite so if</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.970" end="00:22:50.350" style="s2">you&#39;ve got reason dictating everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.010" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">down to everybody else and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.350" end="00:22:54.250" style="s2">fall in line that&#39;s not even like a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:22:57.580" style="s2">read of Plato by the way but that is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.250" end="00:23:00.549" style="s2">common portrayal of it or is it rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.580" end="00:23:03.100" style="s2">than we want to allow the different</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.549" end="00:23:04.570" style="s2">parts of ourselves to communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.100" end="00:23:07.029" style="s2">each other to make their cases to each</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.570" end="00:23:10.120" style="s2">other and to have their legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.029" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">places but also limitations placed on</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.120" end="00:23:14.950" style="s2">each other this is what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:16.750" style="s2">Rilke suggests we would be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.950" end="00:23:19.390" style="s2">and this is what epictetus suggests we</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.750" end="00:23:21.820" style="s2">would be able to do through engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.390" end="00:23:24.039" style="s2">a bit of analysis and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.820" end="00:23:28.090" style="s2">presupposes that we make the space from</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.039" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">that analysis ideally for Rilke if any</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.090" end="00:23:31.570" style="s2">of you haven&#39;t read the letters to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.750" style="s2">young poet what you see him talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.570" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">about is the discovery of his self and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.750" end="00:23:40.299" style="s2">the the the development of his self who</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.080" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t just by itself but within that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.299" end="00:23:46.120" style="s2">space finds sort of organic connections</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:48.309" style="s2">with with nature with God with plants</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.120" end="00:23:51.340" style="s2">and animals other people places</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.309" end="00:23:53.169" style="s2">experiences and even metaphysical things</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.340" end="00:23:57.970" style="s2">here the things he calls the big things</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.169" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">like fate and death and so you know he</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.970" end="00:24:03.399" style="s2">actually we can talk about a metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:06.610" style="s2">of solitude he says we all belong to one</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.399" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">vast solitude sort of like when we go</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.610" end="00:24:12.399" style="s2">down we find some common roots or</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:14.230" style="s2">bedrock that we all share with it now I</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.399" end="00:24:16.299" style="s2">noticed I&#39;m taking up quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.230" end="00:24:18.730" style="s2">time go through this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.299" end="00:24:20.830" style="s2">quicker one main concern I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.730" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">of people would have in hearing this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.830" end="00:24:24.230" style="s2">okay well this sounds really great I go</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:26.660" style="s2">into myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.230" end="00:24:28.220" style="s2">and I cultivate this space of solitude</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.660" end="00:24:30.169" style="s2">and okay I&#39;ve got these thinkers that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.220" end="00:24:31.910" style="s2">can help me out with that but isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.169" end="00:24:34.910" style="s2">going to isolate me more from other</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.910" end="00:24:38.059" style="s2">people in my life and the answer would</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.910" end="00:24:39.860" style="s2">be well if you&#39;re doing it wrong yes if</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.059" end="00:24:42.169" style="s2">you&#39;re I mean let&#39;s say you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.860" end="00:24:44.390" style="s2">being a jerk to everybody so they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.169" end="00:24:46.370" style="s2">bother you and you know they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.390" end="00:24:47.150" style="s2">intrude into your private time or</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.370" end="00:24:49.700" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.150" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">you punish them for that that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.700" end="00:24:59.290" style="s2">screw things up but ideally becoming</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:25:02.179" style="s2">solitary in this way self-sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.290" end="00:25:04.760" style="s2">spontaneous more able to know who you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.179" end="00:25:07.240" style="s2">are should allow you to have more</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.760" end="00:25:10.549" style="s2">genuine relationships with others which</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.240" end="00:25:13.400" style="s2">is dependent on them of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.549" end="00:25:14.900" style="s2">if you can&#39;t have a really great genuine</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.400" end="00:25:19.460" style="s2">relationship with somebody who is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.900" end="00:25:21.650" style="s2">terrible person but you know I think in</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.460" end="00:25:24.140" style="s2">a lot of cases we often get in our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.650" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">way in our relationships with people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.140" end="00:25:29.059" style="s2">aren&#39;t terrible persons and we can have</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:31.660" style="s2">good relationships with them and Rilke</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.059" end="00:25:35.960" style="s2">again has a really wonderful way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.660" end="00:25:38.390" style="s2">framing this in I believe it&#39;s letter</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.960" end="00:25:40.760" style="s2">seven he when he&#39;s talking about love</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.390" end="00:25:42.590" style="s2">and how it fits in with solitude and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.760" end="00:25:51.049" style="s2">need for developing ourselves before</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.590" end="00:25:53.900" style="s2">love commit ourselves to others you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.049" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">in loving relationships he says that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.900" end="00:26:00.049" style="s2">that love is at its highest two</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:02.120" style="s2">solitudes that protect and border and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.049" end="00:26:04.669" style="s2">greet each other so the idea would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.120" end="00:26:06.380" style="s2">that love is not a fusion where you lose</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.669" end="00:26:08.419" style="s2">yourself and the other person or</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.380" end="00:26:10.970" style="s2">anything like that it&#39;s two people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.419" end="00:26:12.830" style="s2">can actually be on their own but choose</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.970" end="00:26:16.610" style="s2">to be with each other somebody else who</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.830" end="00:26:19.850" style="s2">talks about this by the way similar way</p>

<p begin="00:26:49.869" end="00:26:54.129" style="s2">think building ourselves developing</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.129" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">can very well equip us for doing the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.149" end="00:27:01.570" style="s2">things you need to do for others</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:05.049" style="s2">particularly in this crisis you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.570" end="00:27:08.979" style="s2">many of us have others who are dependent</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.049" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">on us psychologically financially in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.979" end="00:27:12.729" style="s2">other ways in the case of my students</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.729" end="00:27:18.340" style="s2">getting guidance and so by by being able</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.269" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">to build ourselves up and understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.340" end="00:27:23.259" style="s2">ourselves better and pare away at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:26.409" style="s2">parts of ourselves that we want to to</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.259" end="00:27:27.759" style="s2">fix and improve in this space of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.409" end="00:27:30.700" style="s2">Solitude we can actually be more</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.700" end="00:27:36.849" style="s2">obstacles here&#39;s where I think we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.999" end="00:27:39.009" style="s2">take you know a bit of back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.849" end="00:27:43.330" style="s2">discussion I think one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.009" end="00:27:45.629" style="s2">obstacles is distraction and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.330" end="00:27:47.440" style="s2">social media can be a big part of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.629" end="00:27:50.529" style="s2">people are spending a lot more time</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:52.869" style="s2">online and getting in fights on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.529" end="00:27:56.710" style="s2">I know this just looking at my own</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.869" end="00:27:59.229" style="s2">Twitter stream I&#39;ve done a lot of muting</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.710" end="00:28:02.349" style="s2">of people myself so that I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.229" end="00:28:03.999" style="s2">like watch the endless bickering the</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.999" end="00:28:08.979" style="s2">who are spending an awful lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.559" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">gaming or consuming streaming content</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.979" end="00:28:12.309" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing inherently bad about</p>

<p begin="00:28:12.309" end="00:28:17.019" style="s2">there might be ways to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.960" end="00:28:18.820" style="s2">other people but they can also be ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.019" end="00:28:23.159" style="s2">in which we lose ourselves when we try</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.159" end="00:28:28.690" style="s2">could otherwise be spending on this</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.070" end="00:28:31.629" style="s2">another thing that I think and I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.690" end="00:28:33.940" style="s2">this coming from social media is this</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.859" end="00:28:39.690" style="s2">think some of you have seen the memes</p>

<p begin="00:28:41.130" end="00:28:44.970" style="s2">started a business or done this or that</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.100" end="00:28:52.950" style="s2">the point is you&#39;re a loser right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.980" end="00:28:54.300" style="s2">these are very counterproductive as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.950" end="00:28:57.420" style="s2">matter of fact it doesn&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.300" end="00:28:59.850" style="s2">go to those sort of toxic memes I have</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.420" end="00:29:01.410" style="s2">students who say you know I&#39;m seeing</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.220" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">for not doing it I you know I did a</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:15.240" style="s2">you do that&#39;s that&#39;s something you know</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.580" end="00:29:21.450" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of an enemy to the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.920" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">solitude that we&#39;re talking about where</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:29.300" style="s2">yourself as the measure you take you</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.550" end="00:29:31.710" style="s2">know classic spiritual directors or</p>

<p begin="00:29:35.160" end="00:29:39.570" style="s2">big obstacle is not being able to go out</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:41.310" style="s2">in nature very easily I get to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.570" end="00:29:44.340" style="s2">outside three times a day to walk our</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.310" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">dog and we do have a little park across</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.340" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">the street but I live in downtown</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:50.430" style="s2">Milwaukee and we have a lot of green</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:54.420" style="s2">space here in Milwaukee because of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.430" end="00:29:57.150" style="s2">socialist mayor&#39;s past but I can&#39;t at</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.420" end="00:29:59.430" style="s2">this point in time go and enjoy it oh I</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.150" end="00:30:02.100" style="s2">I would you know normally be spending</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.430" end="00:30:03.720" style="s2">quite a lot of time outside and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.100" end="00:30:06.060" style="s2">this may be the case for many of you as</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.720" end="00:30:08.580" style="s2">well so then we have to focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.060" end="00:30:10.980" style="s2">things that we can do you know maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.580" end="00:30:14.100" style="s2">spend more time hanging out with my cat</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.980" end="00:30:18.180" style="s2">who is a part of nature noticing just</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.100" end="00:30:21.540" style="s2">how many fuzzy she is in comparison to</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.180" end="00:30:23.580" style="s2">the dark you know or we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.540" end="00:30:27.210" style="s2">other things I can I we have a nice</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.580" end="00:30:29.850" style="s2">window fortunately so I can I can open</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.210" end="00:30:33.390" style="s2">it and get a breeze I can watch the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.850" end="00:30:34.800" style="s2">birds fly our home and another obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.390" end="00:30:38.630" style="s2">I think would be other people in our</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.800" end="00:30:41.910" style="s2">households particularly if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.630" end="00:30:43.530" style="s2">especially you know attention-seeking of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.910" end="00:30:48.650" style="s2">their meeting needy that might make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.530" end="00:30:51.690" style="s2">difficult to cultivate solitude so what</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.650" end="00:30:53.200" style="s2">if Peters amenable to this what are some</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.690" end="00:30:58.090" style="s2">of the obstacles that year</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.200" end="00:31:00.639" style="s2">are facing besides those want to open it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.090" end="00:31:02.139" style="s2">up to the room for that yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.639" end="00:31:03.610" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk about some suggestions and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.139" end="00:31:06.610" style="s2">then other people can get suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.610" end="00:31:08.260" style="s2">too sure yeah I feel like this group has</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.610" end="00:31:12.090" style="s2">discernment so feel free just to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.260" end="00:31:12.090" style="s2">yourself and then you can say</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.460" end="00:31:26.830" style="s2">I&#39;m Greg how does this play out if</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.900" end="00:31:29.929" style="s2">you&#39;re an introvert versus an extrovert</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.830" end="00:31:32.270" style="s2">during these times why don&#39;t I take that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.929" end="00:31:34.900" style="s2">sort of question afterwards okay in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.270" end="00:31:42.410" style="s2">Q&amp;A I&#39;m looking for any sort of other</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.900" end="00:31:47.270" style="s2">obstacles that people are having one</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.410" end="00:31:51.470" style="s2">obstacle could possibly be broken up</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.270" end="00:31:56.390" style="s2">sleep times I&#39;m trying I&#39;m you running a</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.470" end="00:31:57.520" style="s2">set of procedures kind of like stop what</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.390" end="00:32:00.470" style="s2">am i doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.520" end="00:32:03.429" style="s2">there are three possible things I could</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.470" end="00:32:07.340" style="s2">be doing right now studying philosophy I</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.429" end="00:32:09.049" style="s2">could be exercising or I could be</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.340" end="00:32:11.900" style="s2">meditating those are like the three</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.049" end="00:32:16.309" style="s2">things right the meditation is the one</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.900" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the weakest so as I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.309" end="00:32:23.299" style="s2">youtube videos of philosophy lectures it</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.970" end="00:32:26.650" style="s2">turns into I don&#39;t know what that cliche</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.299" end="00:32:29.570" style="s2">or trope cats playing piano &#39;he&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.650" end="00:32:31.340" style="s2">so then watching that for a while as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.570" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">refreshment I suddenly realize hey wait</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.340" end="00:32:36.940" style="s2">a minute I&#39;m spending too much time on</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:40.400" style="s2">this right so that&#39;s two things the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.940" end="00:32:43.010" style="s2">breaking up of sleep I&#39;m not sleeping as</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.400" end="00:32:46.460" style="s2">regularly as I could that affects my</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.010" end="00:32:49.370" style="s2">concentration so then now I have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.460" end="00:32:51.020" style="s2">manage my concentration and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.370" end="00:32:54.919" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing something that is of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.020" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">value to me for me philosophy is of high</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.919" end="00:33:01.510" style="s2">value so I try to put that high in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:04.549" style="s2">priorities but there still are multiple</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.510" end="00:33:07.070" style="s2">distractions so it&#39;s about concentration</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.549" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">and distraction for me yeah I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.070" end="00:33:11.870" style="s2">sleep thing is definitely an issue I</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:13.610" style="s2">know if I don&#39;t get I can operate on</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.870" end="00:33:15.710" style="s2">like six or seven hours of sleep if I</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.610" end="00:33:18.919" style="s2">get less than that I&#39;m pretty much shot</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.710" end="00:33:21.169" style="s2">for the next day but what I hear you</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.919" end="00:33:23.470" style="s2">saying the other obstacle would be sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.169" end="00:33:26.780" style="s2">of like picking between different things</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.470" end="00:33:29.090" style="s2">which one you use you ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.780" end="00:33:33.560" style="s2">doing and then having to prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.090" end="00:33:35.450" style="s2">between them I wonder too if there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.560" end="00:33:38.300" style="s2">it kind of when it comes to spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.450" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">practices I think all of you have heard</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.300" end="00:33:43.460" style="s2">of FOMO fear of missing out is this</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:45.680" style="s2">worried that well if I&#39;m not if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.460" end="00:33:48.050" style="s2">doing this I&#39;m not able to do this at</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.680" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">the same time and I think that can also</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.050" end="00:33:54.410" style="s2">be disabling so it&#39;s that many of us it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:56.270" style="s2">keeps us from being able to give</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.410" end="00:34:01.100" style="s2">ourselves entirely to the one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.270" end="00:34:09.379" style="s2">we are doing any other any other</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.100" end="00:34:11.570" style="s2">challenges people are facing good yes I</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.379" end="00:34:13.879" style="s2">this is a very brief one I have a friend</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.570" end="00:34:16.760" style="s2">on the East Coast who is infected with</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.879" end="00:34:19.340" style="s2">the virus and he&#39;s Ahnold like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.760" end="00:34:20.870" style="s2">lockdown that is perhaps more extreme</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.340" end="00:34:23.480" style="s2">than the rest of us we can move around</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.870" end="00:34:25.790" style="s2">our homes we can open a window he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.480" end="00:34:28.909" style="s2">really locked in one room he lives with</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.790" end="00:34:30.649" style="s2">his daughter and but he&#39;s you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.909" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">quite old and he feels like he&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.649" end="00:34:36.500" style="s2">prison because he&#39;s infected he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:39.560" style="s2">even leave his room yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.500" end="00:34:43.100" style="s2">very tough one and as a matter of fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.560" end="00:34:47.600" style="s2">that reminds me I teach classes online</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.100" end="00:34:50.750" style="s2">for prisoners here in Wisconsin and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.600" end="00:34:53.330" style="s2">only seen a few of my students recently</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.750" end="00:34:56.030" style="s2">and see that means being able to chat</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.330" end="00:34:58.220" style="s2">with them electronically because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.030" end="00:35:00.170" style="s2">all in lockdown now and they can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.220" end="00:35:02.210" style="s2">know they came to recharge their their</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.170" end="00:35:03.890" style="s2">tablets that they use for their classes</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.210" end="00:35:08.090" style="s2">and so it&#39;s real it&#39;s real isolation</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.890" end="00:35:09.320" style="s2">yeah I think that so to say to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.090" end="00:35:11.240" style="s2">like that oh well you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.320" end="00:35:16.040" style="s2">opportunity to cultivate solitude almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.240" end="00:35:18.040" style="s2">seems like a slap in the face right so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.040" end="00:35:20.810" style="s2">don&#39;t know that this this advice is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.040" end="00:35:22.990" style="s2">particularly helpful for extreme cases</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.810" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.990" end="00:35:28.580" style="s2">but let&#39;s talk about some suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:30.530" style="s2">then so I can tell you the things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.580" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve found helpful for doing this and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.530" end="00:35:34.610" style="s2">think many of you as I&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:37.160" style="s2">about this you probably recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.610" end="00:35:40.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve done things you know like that as</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.160" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">well and that you&#39;re engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.359" end="00:35:44.109" style="s2">in cultivating this interior space so</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:46.839" style="s2">you might say what&#39;s been helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.109" end="00:35:50.200" style="s2">you for me obviously drawing on other</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.839" end="00:35:52.359" style="s2">authors who have things to say about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.200" end="00:35:54.279" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s always helpful for me and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.359" end="00:35:56.650" style="s2">exploring you know for example what</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.279" end="00:35:58.989" style="s2">Rilke has to say about solitude in his</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.650" end="00:36:01.749" style="s2">letters to a young poet in his poems in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.989" end="00:36:03.880" style="s2">his novels and then in his other letters</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.749" end="00:36:06.069" style="s2">to other people it places me in</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.880" end="00:36:07.660" style="s2">communication with Rilke and helps me to</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.069" end="00:36:09.880" style="s2">sort of figure out what&#39;s going along</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.660" end="00:36:13.150" style="s2">and I find myself quite emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.880" end="00:36:14.829" style="s2">involved when I when I when I read and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.150" end="00:36:18.309" style="s2">then when I teach Rilke because I teach</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.829" end="00:36:19.720" style="s2">them routinely to my classes there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.309" end="00:36:21.249" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a connection there and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.720" end="00:36:25.029" style="s2">there&#39;s probably people like that for</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.249" end="00:36:26.589" style="s2">you as well I think you know maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.029" end="00:36:27.609" style="s2">and this will mark is talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.589" end="00:36:30.819" style="s2">a little bit - the need for</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.609" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">concentration this deliberate focus on</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.819" end="00:36:37.059" style="s2">on what is really essential and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:39.309" style="s2">you know at least for that space and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.059" end="00:36:41.140" style="s2">time sort of pushing other things to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.309" end="00:36:44.589" style="s2">side trying to eliminate the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.140" end="00:36:46.950" style="s2">distractions that we have for myself as</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.589" end="00:36:50.559" style="s2">well and maybe some of you are like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.950" end="00:36:53.950" style="s2">if you&#39;re somebody who is often over</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.559" end="00:36:59.289" style="s2">scheduled and has a lot of things on</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.950" end="00:37:02.049" style="s2">their their to-do list every day then</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.289" end="00:37:04.809" style="s2">when you find yourself with these these</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.049" end="00:37:06.730" style="s2">moments where you&#39;re daydreaming or just</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.809" end="00:37:08.650" style="s2">kind of thing following out a train of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.730" end="00:37:11.380" style="s2">thought or thinking about an experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.650" end="00:37:12.519" style="s2">you can recognize that and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.380" end="00:37:14.319" style="s2">like cutting a lot of trip you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.519" end="00:37:17.769" style="s2">almost like let&#39;s not turn off the valve</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.319" end="00:37:19.660" style="s2">you just let it flow because there</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.769" end="00:37:21.789" style="s2">you&#39;re actually entering into this this</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.660" end="00:37:25.299" style="s2">place of solitude the way that you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.789" end="00:37:26.799" style="s2">these thinkers had conceived a bit that</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.299" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">may not be a challenge for many of you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.799" end="00:37:31.210" style="s2">maybe some of you have no problems doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:34.869" style="s2">that myself I actually have to like make</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.210" end="00:37:39.519" style="s2">a deliberate effort not to cut off that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.869" end="00:37:42.339" style="s2">space of Solitude the other thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.519" end="00:37:44.980" style="s2">think is important is making time for it</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.339" end="00:37:47.380" style="s2">maybe you pick out a particular hour of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.980" end="00:37:49.660" style="s2">the day mark mentioned meditation that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.380" end="00:37:52.089" style="s2">can be a great way to do this as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.660" end="00:37:53.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different modes and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.089" end="00:37:55.660" style="s2">ways of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.590" end="00:37:57.310" style="s2">other people you know what one thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.660" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">that I don&#39;t do that I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.310" end="00:38:01.030" style="s2">other people find it incredibly helpful</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:02.860" style="s2">is journaling and the only reason I</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.030" end="00:38:04.990" style="s2">don&#39;t do journaling is because my</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.860" end="00:38:08.080" style="s2">writing is terrible and I find it to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.990" end="00:38:09.400" style="s2">a lot of effort and I don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.080" end="00:38:10.780" style="s2">that much much time for it but I know</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.400" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">that a lot of people find that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.780" end="00:38:14.920" style="s2">incredibly helpful for getting to know</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:18.730" style="s2">who they are and bringing things to</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.920" end="00:38:20.050" style="s2">lights and and many of these great</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.730" end="00:38:22.600" style="s2">thinkers who were talking about Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.050" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">Aurelius right he&#39;s writing a journal to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.600" end="00:38:28.690" style="s2">himself I don&#39;t know if any have been</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:30.550" style="s2">reading Peters own sort of replication</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.690" end="00:38:33.190" style="s2">of that he&#39;s doing something similar to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.550" end="00:38:36.250" style="s2">that in his letters so that can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.190" end="00:38:41.320" style="s2">good it looks like we have a question in</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.250" end="00:38:43.330" style="s2">the chat about so this ties in with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.320" end="00:38:45.700" style="s2">obstacles how about the surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.330" end="00:38:47.770" style="s2">environment yeah we make the connection</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.700" end="00:38:49.390" style="s2">that our houses are a place of rest a</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.770" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">lot of study or work it makes it hard to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.390" end="00:38:54.550" style="s2">study in our home so two different</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.280" end="00:38:56.470" style="s2">things going on there yeah if we&#39;ve if</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.550" end="00:38:59.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the mindset that our houses</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.470" end="00:39:01.990" style="s2">are a refuge a place of rest maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.890" end="00:39:03.430" style="s2">have to do a mindset shift to make them</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.990" end="00:39:05.770" style="s2">a place of study or work and this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.430" end="00:39:07.690" style="s2">probably one reason why it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.770" end="00:39:10.750" style="s2">difficult for many people to transition</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.690" end="00:39:15.100" style="s2">to working from home for me I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.750" end="00:39:18.940" style="s2">working from home you know as a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.100" end="00:39:20.620" style="s2">my entire time you do so much work at</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.940" end="00:39:22.750" style="s2">home and then you go to wherever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.620" end="00:39:25.030" style="s2">teaching but there&#39;s also another really</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.750" end="00:39:27.100" style="s2">good point to that like we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.030" end="00:39:29.890" style="s2">construction going on around us</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.100" end="00:39:31.690" style="s2">constantly because one thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.890" end="00:39:34.810" style="s2">can still spend money on during this</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.690" end="00:39:36.370" style="s2">covent pandemic is construction work and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.810" end="00:39:38.140" style="s2">it&#39;s a good idea it keeps people</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.370" end="00:39:40.510" style="s2">employed right the construction workers</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.140" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">tend to spend their money quite a bit so</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.510" end="00:39:45.010" style="s2">and there&#39;s less people on the street so</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:50.650" style="s2">I&#39;m not knocking it but it does create</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.010" end="00:39:53.320" style="s2">for a good bit of noise and distraction</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.650" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">from from time to time and I think there</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.320" end="00:39:58.570" style="s2">could be similar things going around</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:40:01.630" style="s2">with other people as well you know like</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.570" end="00:40:04.090" style="s2">what if that great me you know all you</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.630" end="00:40:05.740" style="s2">saw the Italians singing on their</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.090" end="00:40:07.630" style="s2">balconies did any</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.740" end="00:40:09.340" style="s2">you see the meme where somebody tried</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.630" end="00:40:10.660" style="s2">doing that in New York and his neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:13.060" style="s2">like opened up their windows and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.660" end="00:40:15.100" style="s2">like shut the hell up you know not</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.060" end="00:40:19.630" style="s2">everybody likes that that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.100" end="00:40:22.090" style="s2">thing kind of kind of based on cultural</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.630" end="00:40:24.430" style="s2">assumptions I&#39;d say so let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.090" end="00:40:27.880" style="s2">the suggestions thing what other</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.430" end="00:40:30.430" style="s2">suggestions do any of you have for how</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.880" end="00:40:34.510" style="s2">to you know cultivate this this interior</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.430" end="00:40:36.850" style="s2">space well one thing is coming up Greg</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.510" end="00:40:39.160" style="s2">is what we were talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.850" end="00:40:43.900" style="s2">when the people in is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.160" end="00:40:45.460" style="s2">reconnecting with old friends and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.900" end="00:40:47.290" style="s2">mentioned how I&#39;m sort of viewing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.460" end="00:40:49.540" style="s2">as a spiritual practice reconnecting</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.290" end="00:40:51.880" style="s2">with friends in high school and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.540" end="00:40:54.100" style="s2">university and you kind of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.880" end="00:40:55.210" style="s2">like a sense I get like you kind of know</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.100" end="00:40:56.680" style="s2">which ones you need to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.210" end="00:40:57.850" style="s2">because there&#39;s like this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.680" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">unfinished business there</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.850" end="00:41:01.990" style="s2">yeah and I&#39;ve connected with like three</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:04.930" style="s2">or four people who haven&#39;t talked to in</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.990" end="00:41:08.950" style="s2">years and we reconnected you know shared</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.930" end="00:41:11.080" style="s2">our stories and it was beautiful so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.950" end="00:41:13.210" style="s2">I think that like connecting with people</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.080" end="00:41:14.770" style="s2">being in right relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.210" end="00:41:16.960" style="s2">people you were called to be in right</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.770" end="00:41:19.930" style="s2">relationship with is quite an</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:21.160" style="s2">opportunity right now yeah and again we</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.930" end="00:41:22.840" style="s2">were talking about this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.160" end="00:41:24.609" style="s2">before we started and I was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.840" end="00:41:26.830" style="s2">Peter should do some writing about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.609" end="00:41:29.200" style="s2">because I think that actually is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.830" end="00:41:33.190" style="s2">legitimate spiritual practice it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:35.490" style="s2">some sort of structured procedures to it</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.190" end="00:41:38.170" style="s2">you might say there&#39;s some definite ends</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.490" end="00:41:41.350" style="s2">there&#39;s probably ways to do it not to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.170" end="00:41:44.950" style="s2">it so I think I think that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.350" end="00:41:46.570" style="s2">good suggestion Maria has do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.950" end="00:41:49.090" style="s2">read what Maria answered do you want me</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.070" end="00:42:19.330" style="s2">don&#39;t know how successful it is but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.859" end="00:42:22.210" style="s2">waking up in the more</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.330" end="00:42:24.280" style="s2">instead of leaping out of bed and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.210" end="00:42:27.490" style="s2">rushing to get into the car in order to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.280" end="00:42:30.430" style="s2">make it to work on time I&#39;m laying in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.490" end="00:42:34.660" style="s2">bed and it&#39;s not sleeping it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.430" end="00:42:37.890" style="s2">dreaming I&#39;m awake but I can imagine and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.660" end="00:42:40.630" style="s2">remember because I have lots of time and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.890" end="00:42:44.350" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been trying to do is remember</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.630" end="00:42:46.750" style="s2">key points in my life there are times in</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.350" end="00:42:49.090" style="s2">my life when my memories are very not</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.750" end="00:42:50.950" style="s2">quite vivid but the fact that I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.090" end="00:42:53.050" style="s2">remember them now tells me that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.950" end="00:42:55.750" style="s2">were vivid at the time right I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.050" end="00:42:57.970" style="s2">concerned about memory do I remember the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.750" end="00:43:00.520" style="s2">original event or do I remember the last</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.970" end="00:43:02.680" style="s2">time I remembered it right we got a copy</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.520" end="00:43:05.880" style="s2">theory perhaps in there that after what</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.680" end="00:43:09.310" style="s2">jumped but regardless of that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.880" end="00:43:11.500" style="s2">looking at past times that I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.310" end="00:43:15.850" style="s2">actually remember in the first person</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.500" end="00:43:18.040" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering why do I remember</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.850" end="00:43:21.340" style="s2">these I&#39;m also trying to link them</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.040" end="00:43:23.560" style="s2">sequentially after trying to put them in</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.340" end="00:43:26.080" style="s2">a rough order remember this is so vague</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.560" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">I question how well I&#39;m doing this then</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.080" end="00:43:32.020" style="s2">I&#39;m looking back at that time and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:33.910" style="s2">trying to see why am i what am I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.020" end="00:43:38.110" style="s2">remembering why do I remember this</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.910" end="00:43:39.880" style="s2">what&#39;s the importance of that was I part</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.110" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">of it it was you know was I too hard on</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.880" end="00:43:45.160" style="s2">myself did I expect too much of myself</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">when you&#39;re younger you kind of have an</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.160" end="00:43:50.230" style="s2">idea of maybe the goal of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:52.090" style="s2">person you&#39;d want to be right how does</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.230" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">that happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.090" end="00:43:58.420" style="s2">how far did I go along the road you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:44:01.030" style="s2">that sort of thing so on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.420" end="00:44:06.160" style="s2">there&#39;s the first-person memory at that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.030" end="00:44:08.140" style="s2">time on the second hand there&#39;s the that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.160" end="00:44:10.180" style="s2">first-person memory of me now</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.140" end="00:44:13.180" style="s2">remembering it and trying to order them</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.180" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">then there&#39;s an attempt to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.180" end="00:44:19.000" style="s2">and put it in context right I won&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:21.250" style="s2">into too long because if I went I could</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.000" end="00:44:24.430" style="s2">this could hours and who wants to listen</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.250" end="00:44:26.020" style="s2">to that right but you know like being 8</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.430" end="00:44:27.460" style="s2">years old and expecting that I should</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.020" end="00:44:31.960" style="s2">work and take care of myself was</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.460" end="00:44:34.599" style="s2">somewhat unreasonable ok yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.960" end="00:44:36.849" style="s2">that that&#39;s the sort of thing that Rilke</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.599" end="00:44:39.070" style="s2">is is referencing what he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.849" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">about you know going back into your past</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.070" end="00:44:45.460" style="s2">and he talks about is this like vast</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:48.040" style="s2">treasure that that we have and then you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.460" end="00:44:50.650" style="s2">know you engage you sort of like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.040" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">connect up with the the previous you who</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.650" end="00:44:55.210" style="s2">you know is you but of course a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:58.089" style="s2">different person than you are now you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.210" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">know the one thing the one thing for me</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.089" end="00:45:04.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:07.030" style="s2">recontextualize because when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.150" end="00:45:07.780" style="s2">I had no real understanding of the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.030" end="00:45:11.410" style="s2">around me</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.780" end="00:45:13.690" style="s2">yeah providing a frame of reference yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.410" end="00:45:15.670" style="s2">right so what I wind up doing is I wind</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.690" end="00:45:19.060" style="s2">up going back to the first person</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.670" end="00:45:22.060" style="s2">experienced as a kid and then looking at</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.060" end="00:45:24.490" style="s2">like what little history I know and try</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.060" end="00:45:27.369" style="s2">to get like I won&#39;t use cosmic view that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.490" end="00:45:31.480" style="s2">sounds too grandiose or something but</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.369" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2">like a multiple contextual view of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.480" end="00:45:36.210" style="s2">would my my little experience would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:38.980" style="s2">nested in that whether I knew it or not</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.210" end="00:45:40.810" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s finding I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.980" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">often talk about like trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.810" end="00:45:45.490" style="s2">meaning right and a lot of our finding</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:50.500" style="s2">meaning is just that putting things into</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.490" end="00:45:53.530" style="s2">a context where we can we can think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.500" end="00:45:55.839" style="s2">well this is probably not all BS right</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.530" end="00:45:58.599" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something really true</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.839" end="00:46:00.609" style="s2">going on here this is often a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.599" end="00:46:04.780" style="s2">difficult thing to articulate but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.609" end="00:46:06.369" style="s2">know you see a lot of authors talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.780" end="00:46:07.720" style="s2">about this including psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.369" end="00:46:10.300" style="s2">authors this this by the way is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.720" end="00:46:12.070" style="s2">what Lacan E and analysis is about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.300" end="00:46:15.760" style="s2">not about like trying to cure somebody</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.070" end="00:46:17.589" style="s2">or you know make them a perfect person</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.760" end="00:46:20.500" style="s2">or anything like that it&#39;s to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.589" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">narratives that actually make sense put</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.500" end="00:46:24.760" style="s2">things into perspective allow us to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:28.119" style="s2">able to exercise some agency where we</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.760" end="00:46:30.609" style="s2">need to and to be okay with the past</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.119" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">without calling everything great that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.609" end="00:46:38.230" style="s2">wasn&#39;t wasn&#39;t great let me take let me</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:40.180" style="s2">look at its cause response how about how</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.230" end="00:46:42.450" style="s2">about doing as Jewish people do have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.180" end="00:46:44.810" style="s2">day dedicated to solitude no electron</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.450" end="00:46:47.460" style="s2">almost necessary and no work either</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.810" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a really nice thing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.460" end="00:46:51.450" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:55.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to work towards that so</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.450" end="00:46:59.070" style="s2">as my wife for about five years and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.010" end="00:47:02.250" style="s2">we&#39;re still not able to have a Sabbath</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.070" end="00:47:07.470" style="s2">day that&#39;s but the goal is to try to</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.250" end="00:47:09.480" style="s2">reach that this this summer you know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.470" end="00:47:11.609" style="s2">no electronics almost necessary is</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.480" end="00:47:16.770" style="s2">actually a great idea because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.609" end="00:47:19.560" style="s2">easy to get sucked in to the world of</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.109" end="00:47:53.670" style="s2">that we can talk about differences</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:56.040" style="s2">between like extroverts way at the</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.700" end="00:48:36.510" style="s2">because I put a lot of what I do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.560" end="00:48:39.720" style="s2">like almost like actors for a performing</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.510" end="00:48:42.119" style="s2">on stage you know I&#39;m making Plato speak</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.720" end="00:48:44.099" style="s2">or something like that but but I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:48:44.099" end="00:48:47.520" style="s2">seek out those sorts of things and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.290" end="00:48:51.410" style="s2">notice there&#39;s that there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.520" end="00:48:51.410" style="s2">there and how we handle the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.490" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">inside my wife is quite frankly</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.880" end="00:49:09.970" style="s2">settings that that she is happy about</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.030" end="00:49:11.530" style="s2">you know and and you know we have also</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.970" end="00:49:13.600" style="s2">discovered that there are many meetings</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.530" end="00:49:15.670" style="s2">that could be an email she&#39;s she&#39;s happy</p>

<p begin="00:49:17.470" end="00:49:23.590" style="s2">the most in part because I and like you</p>

<p begin="00:49:23.590" end="00:49:26.740" style="s2">enjoy engaging with them but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.210" end="00:49:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that&#39;s really like</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.960" end="00:49:33.670" style="s2">think there are some people who are</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.280" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">probably really needing that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.670" end="00:49:38.170" style="s2">human stimulation like they&#39;d like to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:40.780" style="s2">going to sports events and now you know</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.780" end="00:49:46.210" style="s2">that&#39;s really wearing on them and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.750" end="00:49:48.869" style="s2">know there is a there is a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.210" end="00:49:53.170" style="s2">place for that sort of stuff in life</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.390" end="00:50:08.890" style="s2">completely right and and like you know I</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.850" end="00:50:10.869" style="s2">mentioned daydreaming in the middle of</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.869" end="00:50:16.690" style="s2">wander I think that&#39;s another way to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.020" end="00:50:20.290" style="s2">access that as well and sometimes it can</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.690" end="00:50:21.940" style="s2">be object focus like you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.290" end="00:50:23.830" style="s2">looking outside and watching the birds</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.900" end="00:50:29.410" style="s2">anything with that you&#39;re just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.340" end="00:50:32.140" style="s2">like letting your mind pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.410" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">particular objects I think that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.140" end="00:50:38.140" style="s2">of what Rilke suggests viewing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:41.770" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of what Epictetus or</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.140" end="00:50:44.619" style="s2">Aristotle would say is being able to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.770" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">by yourself and just enjoy yourself you</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.900" end="00:51:02.619" style="s2">question-and-answer and we only have</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.100" end="00:51:04.240" style="s2">seven minutes so maybe I&#39;ll close with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.619" end="00:51:09.010" style="s2">question for you</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.240" end="00:51:10.180" style="s2">sure and yeah maybe it&#39;s a statement on</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.010" end="00:51:13.030" style="s2">maybe I can tease a question out of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.180" end="00:51:15.130" style="s2">but what&#39;s coming up is Zach Stein was</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.030" end="00:51:17.470" style="s2">at the stove a couple weeks ago and he</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.130" end="00:51:18.670" style="s2">was talking about how this is an</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.470" end="00:51:21.580" style="s2">opportunity to be in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.670" end="00:51:23.530" style="s2">with being at home it&#39;s similar what</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.580" end="00:51:26.800" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about and how sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.530" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">like in these uh slates play</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.800" end="00:51:31.450" style="s2">capitalistic stages how we almost</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:33.880" style="s2">instrumentalize the home it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.450" end="00:51:37.270" style="s2">the home like we used a home as a place</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.880" end="00:51:39.430" style="s2">to like eat and sleep to go to work</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.270" end="00:51:43.300" style="s2">to be productive and build these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.430" end="00:51:45.010" style="s2">fragile castles right and then now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.300" end="00:51:46.180" style="s2">forced at home and now this is an</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.010" end="00:51:48.630" style="s2">opportunity to build the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.180" end="00:51:51.010" style="s2">with it and what&#39;s coming up is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.630" end="00:51:52.990" style="s2">another environmentalist or some some of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.010" end="00:51:55.180" style="s2">them calling rewilding like rewilding</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.990" end="00:51:58.170" style="s2">things and it&#39;s almost like the term</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.180" end="00:51:59.860" style="s2">rehoming like we gotta every home things</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.170" end="00:52:01.480" style="s2">so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if I have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.860" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">question there but just anything came</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.480" end="00:52:08.980" style="s2">alive or not when I said that I think it</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">is it is a big shift for for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.980" end="00:52:13.090" style="s2">people and actually this ties in well</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:19.000" style="s2">with with a question that can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.090" end="00:52:20.890" style="s2">deepen this from actually a Pathak major</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.000" end="00:52:22.930" style="s2">restriction on solitude is domestic</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.890" end="00:52:25.090" style="s2">abuse child abuse conditions out here in</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.930" end="00:52:26.740" style="s2">India get worse when there&#39;s a pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.090" end="00:52:28.750" style="s2">and redressal mechanism that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.740" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">essential services do I think the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.750" end="00:52:32.590" style="s2">celebration of solitude is a first-world</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:35.100" style="s2">phenomenon I would say definitely not I</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.590" end="00:52:39.790" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s found in almost every</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.100" end="00:52:41.860" style="s2">spiritual path or tradition going way</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.790" end="00:52:45.820" style="s2">back into ancient times and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.860" end="00:52:47.860" style="s2">major problem here in Milwaukee where we</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.820" end="00:52:50.490" style="s2">live you know all these kids being home</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.860" end="00:52:53.410" style="s2">we know that child abuse has has spiked</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.490" end="00:52:55.180" style="s2">and same thing with domestic abuse we</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.410" end="00:52:58.690" style="s2">have some of the poorest ZIP codes in</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.180" end="00:53:00.130" style="s2">the United States in this city so you</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.690" end="00:53:03.700" style="s2">know what I mean what I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.130" end="00:53:07.120" style="s2">here isn&#39;t something that&#39;s meant to</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.700" end="00:53:10.150" style="s2">address that I mean when it comes to to</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.120" end="00:53:12.100" style="s2">any sort of like personal development or</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.150" end="00:53:13.630" style="s2">spiritual path there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.100" end="00:53:15.170" style="s2">different components to it this</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.630" end="00:53:20.720" style="s2">component is not meant to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.170" end="00:53:24.320" style="s2">try to address that that said having had</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.720" end="00:53:26.120" style="s2">quite a few students who have dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.320" end="00:53:29.050" style="s2">these sorts of issues and having had a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.120" end="00:53:32.270" style="s2">lot of family members sometimes those</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.050" end="00:53:34.790" style="s2">those experiences which are very</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.270" end="00:53:37.280" style="s2">negative and shouldn&#39;t happen can also</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.790" end="00:53:39.980" style="s2">be part of what gets gets used and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.280" end="00:53:47.810" style="s2">transformed within with it that solitude</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.980" end="00:53:49.580" style="s2">as well so yeah so we have about four</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.810" end="00:53:52.370" style="s2">minutes so I think it&#39;s prudent to close</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.580" end="00:53:54.110" style="s2">here do you have any closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.370" end="00:53:55.760" style="s2">for anyone on the subject or things you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.110" end="00:53:58.160" style="s2">can direct them to to read more about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.760" end="00:53:59.630" style="s2">well so there&#39;s a few questions here</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.160" end="00:54:03.980" style="s2">about like well with what medieval</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.630" end="00:54:05.780" style="s2">authors and and mark is right the Desert</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.980" end="00:54:09.560" style="s2">Fathers who you know would include say</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.780" end="00:54:12.320" style="s2">John Cassian and Evagrius Ponte cos you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.560" end="00:54:15.380" style="s2">know the whole monastic tradition is is</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.320" end="00:54:19.700" style="s2">worth checking out in part because they</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.380" end="00:54:21.800" style="s2">made developing an interior life as part</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.700" end="00:54:24.620" style="s2">of the structured life depending on what</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.800" end="00:54:28.220" style="s2">order they were in honest Terry central</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.620" end="00:54:30.890" style="s2">to what they were doing and you know so</p>

<p begin="00:54:33.740" end="00:54:37.520" style="s2">interesting book for looking at going</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.180" end="00:54:41.780" style="s2">going within there&#39;s a lot of other</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.780" end="00:54:46.310" style="s2">and it became more and more of a thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.970" end="00:54:48.590" style="s2">as we get into late the late medieval</p>
