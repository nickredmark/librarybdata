<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.350" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just read out the question to</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.580" end="00:00:05.730" style="s2">quote you from the last session I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.350" end="00:00:07.589" style="s2">really care that much about how the</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.730" end="00:00:11.880" style="s2">Federal Reserve works because it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.589" end="00:00:14.160" style="s2">away really quick so that&#39;s true who or</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.880" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">what is going to replace things like</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:18.260" style="s2">that not specifically the Federal</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:20.939" style="s2">Reserve but think of it in the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.260" end="00:00:23.430" style="s2">like things like that there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.939" end="00:00:25.140" style="s2">systems gonna replace them and do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.430" end="00:00:31.260" style="s2">know groups that are actually working on</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.140" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">those problems specifically well we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.260" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">talk about that thinking maybe two</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">languages so I&#39;ll talk about it in mmm</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">this way to put this shenanigans all</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">right there we go so there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:48.750" style="s2">approach to alternate call shenanigans</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:50.899" style="s2">there lots of shenanigans going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.750" end="00:00:53.100" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.899" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">those are folks who are in positions of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">power folks in positions of power</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">looking at the current Federal Reserve</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">structure and you learn awesome this</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">looks fantastic I see something I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">make very pliable and then up gradient</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">the kinds of things I&#39;d like to see and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">we&#39;ve already seen that like right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">the thing that we used to call the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">Federal Reserve guess what it&#39;s gone I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.960" end="00:01:12.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know you guys know but the changes</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">that were made in the past couple of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.630" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">days so radically change the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:18.630" style="s2">that construct that it&#39;s called the Fed</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">Reserve in name only and those are</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.630" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">serious shenanigans like that is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">massive change the underlying financial</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">structure of this country so check it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">over shenanigans done that is over folks</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">who are trying to work some shenanigans</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">to show will ask what happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">Fed oh well just do a little brief it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take too much energy so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:43.259" style="s2">Federal Reserve is very very limited in</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">the kinds of things that&#39;s allowed to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.259" end="00:01:46.020" style="s2">by the way it&#39;s actual amended its</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">miniscule compared to what it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.020" end="00:01:50.280" style="s2">doing recently but most fundamentally it</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">can only operate through a very small</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.280" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">number of primary lenders these big</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">banks the too big to fail banks the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">reason why they&#39;re too big to fail is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">because they&#39;re the way the Federal</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">Reserve hits the real economy so if they</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">failed the head of the Federal Reserve</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">would have no interface with the real</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:03.450" style="s2">economy and they could only engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:06.390" style="s2">very small number of kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.450" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2">transactions with them it could take we</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.390" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">called repo actions this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:13.239" style="s2">give very esoteric very quick but some</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:15.489" style="s2">time not long ago like three four days</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.239" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">ago a complete restructure has put in</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.489" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">place where a series of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:21.010" style="s2">called special purpose vehicles were</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:22.659" style="s2">created managed by a private firm called</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.010" end="00:02:25.569" style="s2">Blackrock which is the world&#39;s largest</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.659" end="00:02:27.430" style="s2">asset manager and direct interface to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.569" end="00:02:30.579" style="s2">the United States Treasury which to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.430" end="00:02:32.889" style="s2">US Treasury now is able to and on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.579" end="00:02:35.439" style="s2">hook for put in Treasuries which is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.889" end="00:02:37.569" style="s2">kind of assets that Fed can count as</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.439" end="00:02:40.719" style="s2">being real things into these specialist</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.569" end="00:02:43.209" style="s2">special-purpose vehicles the SPV s can</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.719" end="00:02:45.730" style="s2">then use those assets to acquire almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.209" end="00:02:47.980" style="s2">any kind of financial security which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.730" end="00:02:49.870" style="s2">safe equities like shares and companies</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.980" end="00:02:51.970" style="s2">and what&#39;s called corporate paper so</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.870" end="00:02:53.349" style="s2">bonds and companies put them on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.970" end="00:02:56.379" style="s2">books of the special-purpose vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.349" end="00:02:58.180" style="s2">and the Treasury&#39;s assets are what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.379" end="00:03:00.819" style="s2">called first law loser which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.180" end="00:03:03.790" style="s2">that if the price to say an SP V buy</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.819" end="00:03:06.700" style="s2">shares in uber an uber goes from 40 to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.790" end="00:03:09.609" style="s2">20 the United States Treasury takes that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.700" end="00:03:11.560" style="s2">loss so what that means is that as of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.609" end="00:03:13.450" style="s2">right now two things have changed one</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:15.729" style="s2">the Treasury can now inject the quid aid</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.450" end="00:03:17.829" style="s2">directly into the into the economy at</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.729" end="00:03:19.510" style="s2">the most almost the most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.829" end="00:03:21.909" style="s2">level not quite down to human beings but</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.510" end="00:03:23.709" style="s2">we&#39;re getting there real quick and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.909" end="00:03:25.780" style="s2">US Treasury is actually now more or less</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.709" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">driving the show they&#39;re actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.780" end="00:03:29.439" style="s2">other side of that actually being able</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:31.569" style="s2">to pressure things and I would be very</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.439" end="00:03:34.090" style="s2">surprised if at this point now Secretary</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.569" end="00:03:35.620" style="s2">of Muchin and the president are not able</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.090" end="00:03:37.599" style="s2">to actually just do the things they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.620" end="00:03:39.099" style="s2">to do directly to the tune of trillions</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.599" end="00:03:41.049" style="s2">of dollars so that&#39;s what happened to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.099" end="00:03:42.759" style="s2">the Fed now I would say that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.049" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">high quality level of shenanigans all</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.759" end="00:03:47.530" style="s2">right now let&#39;s look on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">yes there are groups that are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.530" end="00:03:54.009" style="s2">what might replace it I am associated</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:55.109" style="s2">with some of these groups have been for</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.009" end="00:03:59.729" style="s2">quite some time</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.109" end="00:03:59.729" style="s2">alternatives actually look like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.910" end="00:04:04.900" style="s2">radical devolution of authority and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.800" end="00:04:07.900" style="s2">power from the existing institutional</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.900" end="00:04:10.870" style="s2">structures using a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.900" end="00:04:14.170" style="s2">principles to design new models so for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.870" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">example one principle is to push as much</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.170" end="00:04:19.180" style="s2">choice making authority down to the edge</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:21.280" style="s2">as possible so ubi it&#39;s this very simple</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.180" end="00:04:23.200" style="s2">example and I don&#39;t mean ubi from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.280" end="00:04:24.970" style="s2">point of view of means I mean ubi from</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.200" end="00:04:26.830" style="s2">the point of view of how do you make a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.970" end="00:04:27.910" style="s2">functional economy actually know it we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:31.930" style="s2">just throw this out there let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.910" end="00:04:33.490" style="s2">people think about it take collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.930" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">intelligence as the metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.490" end="00:04:37.090" style="s2">market the market is opposed to provide</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:38.770" style="s2">a really high-quality function of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.090" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">collective intelligence I had a price</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.770" end="00:04:42.940" style="s2">function supply and demand function</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:44.410" style="s2">supposed to tell us stuff a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.940" end="00:04:46.540" style="s2">stuff about what the very large number</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.410" end="00:04:48.640" style="s2">of people out there are perceiving is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.540" end="00:04:52.510" style="s2">what is needful and are able to provide</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.640" end="00:04:54.460" style="s2">to that to that need but we have at</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.510" end="00:04:56.650" style="s2">least two major problems with our</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.460" end="00:04:59.620" style="s2">collective intelligence as it exists</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.650" end="00:05:01.180" style="s2">right now one problem is we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.620" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">getting the right kind of signal balance</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.180" end="00:05:06.730" style="s2">from the from the nodes now if if Bill</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:08.470" style="s2">Gates has all the dollars then our</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.730" end="00:05:10.360" style="s2">market is getting all of its signals</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.470" end="00:05:12.190" style="s2">from one node now he doesn&#39;t but he has</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.360" end="00:05:14.110" style="s2">a lot of them and every other node that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.190" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">may actually have real significant</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.110" end="00:05:17.350" style="s2">perception that it needs to inject into</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:18.640" style="s2">that collective intelligence if it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.350" end="00:05:20.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the right amount of signal</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.640" end="00:05:23.169" style="s2">they were actually getting a very warped</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.500" end="00:05:24.640" style="s2">sense of reality and so this the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.169" end="00:05:25.480" style="s2">that Piketty looked at he kind of looked</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.640" end="00:05:28.060" style="s2">at it from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.480" end="00:05:29.620" style="s2">injustice I&#39;m going to look at it from</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.060" end="00:05:31.480" style="s2">the point of view of a malfunctioning</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.620" end="00:05:33.040" style="s2">sense making system we&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.480" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">getting the sense thinking from our</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.040" end="00:05:35.650" style="s2">system that we&#39;re supposed to be getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:36.690" style="s2">because the network topology is all</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.650" end="00:05:40.120" style="s2">fucked up</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.120" end="00:05:45.100" style="s2">element of that is to correct that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.560" end="00:05:46.870" style="s2">need to inject an adequate amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.100" end="00:05:48.940" style="s2">signal which in this case is money and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.870" end="00:05:50.980" style="s2">every node to make sure I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.940" end="00:05:52.630" style="s2">getting signals from my entire network</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.980" end="00:05:54.280" style="s2">if I get that then I&#39;ve actually got a</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.280" end="00:05:57.340" style="s2">as to maximize the collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.419" end="00:05:58.900" style="s2">intelligence and that just is a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.340" end="00:06:00.100" style="s2">effective more powerful machine so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.900" end="00:06:03.040" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have be worrying too much</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.100" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">about things like equity and fairness at</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.040" end="00:06:05.380" style="s2">least not first-order I just need to be</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.380" end="00:06:08.830" style="s2">to do and then I&#39;ve got another one</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:12.210" style="s2">there&#39;s other one I think is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.830" end="00:06:12.210" style="s2">powerful people grasp it</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:16.490" style="s2">this is very well known but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.870" end="00:06:19.069" style="s2">shocking how much economists don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.490" end="00:06:21.259" style="s2">it into account if I&#39;m looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.069" end="00:06:23.599" style="s2">the supply and demand function we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.259" end="00:06:28.280" style="s2">that we have a massive cliff like a</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.280" end="00:06:34.340" style="s2">threshold of privation and so if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.150" end="00:06:36.680" style="s2">got enough money that I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.340" end="00:06:37.940" style="s2">somebody all right so somebody comes to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.680" end="00:06:40.280" style="s2">me and says I would like you to clean</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.940" end="00:06:41.569" style="s2">the toilets in my office building and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.280" end="00:06:43.430" style="s2">say all right well what are you willing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.569" end="00:06:46.460" style="s2">to offer and they say bucks an hour</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.430" end="00:06:47.270" style="s2">my response is fuck you because I&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.270" end="00:06:51.050" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible offer ain&#39;t willing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.949" end="00:06:53.150" style="s2">do it but there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.050" end="00:06:55.669" style="s2">can&#39;t say fuck you and the problem is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.150" end="00:06:57.560" style="s2">our particular economy if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.669" end="00:06:59.449" style="s2">fuck you money then you&#39;ve got oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.560" end="00:07:01.190" style="s2">about to get fucked money you just have</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.449" end="00:07:02.750" style="s2">to say yes to whatever offer is made so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.190" end="00:07:05.509" style="s2">you got a whole lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.750" end="00:07:07.219" style="s2">radically being underbid their the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.509" end="00:07:09.259" style="s2">price signal and demand signal or</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.219" end="00:07:12.460" style="s2">asymmetric because of this non-linearity</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.259" end="00:07:15.560" style="s2">and the ability to say no to an offer so</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.460" end="00:07:18.289" style="s2">by replacing people&#39;s ability to say no</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.560" end="00:07:20.090" style="s2">to an offer you actually reestablish the</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.090" end="00:07:24.169" style="s2">demand function now imagine what happens</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.169" end="00:07:27.020" style="s2">currently being paid minimum wage to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.580" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">clean the toilets and JP Morgan&#39;s office</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.020" end="00:07:30.370" style="s2">building just says fuck you I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:32.569" style="s2">gonna go home and plant a garden instead</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.370" end="00:07:33.529" style="s2">then the boys of JP Morgan have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.569" end="00:07:35.240" style="s2">figure out how they&#39;re gonna get their</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.529" end="00:07:36.469" style="s2">toilets cleaned they got probably three</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.240" end="00:07:37.810" style="s2">choices right now they can clean their</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.469" end="00:07:40.130" style="s2">own damn toilets which is perfectly fine</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.810" end="00:07:41.990" style="s2">or they can pay a fair wage which will</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.130" end="00:07:43.190" style="s2">probably be in the order of like $85,000</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.990" end="00:07:45.319" style="s2">it&#39;s just how much you have to pay me to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.190" end="00:07:47.419" style="s2">clean their toilets and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.319" end="00:07:49.610" style="s2">really actually what the price signal</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.419" end="00:07:51.650" style="s2">should be that&#39;s how much value this</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.610" end="00:07:53.180" style="s2">this actual work actually has if the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.650" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">market was doing its job fairly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.180" end="00:07:58.069" style="s2">what you&#39;d see then you get option three</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.419" style="s2">if people are paying ninety thousand</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.069" end="00:08:01.610" style="s2">dollars to get their toilets clean guess</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.610" end="00:08:05.330" style="s2">building electric cars he&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">peeling building toilet cleaning robots</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.330" end="00:08:08.900" style="s2">boom our economy is actually doing the</p>

<p begin="00:08:08.900" end="00:08:13.460" style="s2">time all right if you think about ubi as</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.389" end="00:08:14.449" style="s2">a mechanism for solving the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.460" end="00:08:16.250" style="s2">the fact that the collective</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.370" end="00:08:22.880" style="s2">to make sure that the signal we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:24.919" style="s2">getting from the pricing and demand side</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.880" end="00:08:26.750" style="s2">is actually right then you&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.919" end="00:08:27.380" style="s2">got your head on straight if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.850" end="00:08:32.780" style="s2">kind of thinking right it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.470" end="00:08:34.190" style="s2">creating a network construct that gets</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.780" end="00:08:35.750" style="s2">the right kind of signal through the</p>

<p begin="00:08:35.750" end="00:08:39.110" style="s2">get maximum collective intelligence then</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.970" end="00:08:42.050" style="s2">you can design something that actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.110" end="00:08:43.700" style="s2">works yes there are groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.050" end="00:08:44.390" style="s2">trying to do things like that on that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.700" end="00:08:46.850" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.390" end="00:08:48.350" style="s2">with any luck we and/or they will start</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.850" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">releasing proposals over the next couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.350" end="00:08:50.120" style="s2">of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:53.930" style="s2">because the opportunity for actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.120" end="00:08:55.310" style="s2">doing is pretty high right now all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.930" end="00:08:56.810" style="s2">so that&#39;s some stuff again I said a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.310" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">of words I can go on forever about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.810" end="00:09:00.440" style="s2">but it feels like hopping about seems to</p>
