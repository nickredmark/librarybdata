<p begin="00:00:01.159" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">hello YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:10.200" style="s2">I am by myself today as far as on video</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.620" end="00:00:12.150" style="s2">goes hopefully someone will be watching</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:14.429" style="s2">soon and can let me know if the sound</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.150" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">was working I did test it as best I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.429" end="00:00:17.520" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:19.529" style="s2">with technology before coming in stream</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.520" end="00:00:22.279" style="s2">yard Bentley isn&#39;t joining me today</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.529" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">because he had life events come up as</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.279" end="00:00:27.300" style="s2">happens that&#39;s one of the reasons we</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">want to grow this board this group of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.300" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">people that is committed to creating the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2">tech cooperative so that when life comes</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.000" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">up there the project doesn&#39;t stop right</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.059" end="00:00:39.480" style="s2">they the entity this does kind of stop</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.250" end="00:00:41.760" style="s2">the project because there&#39;s two of us so</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.480" end="00:00:45.239" style="s2">in 50% of us aren&#39;t here clearly quorum</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.760" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">as it met I put a call out taking be</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.239" end="00:00:49.020" style="s2">people and as well as just Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">periscope in general for people to come</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.020" end="00:00:52.860" style="s2">and join to see if they wanted to join</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:57.090" style="s2">on camera there was more interest in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.860" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">joining the viewership and commenting so</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.090" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna see how this works this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:02.250" style="s2">what I did for the first month that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">did these things at this time before</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">Bentley joined me and it is not as easy</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">for me as being part of a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.240" end="00:01:14.119" style="s2">because a lot of times I have to like</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.549" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">guess into what people are asking or</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.119" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">actually saying when they&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:21.890" style="s2">they&#39;re typing things out but I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">to do it to the best of my ability on</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.890" end="00:01:28.369" style="s2">that I&#39;m capable of showing up on today</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">so we&#39;re creating a tech cooperative I</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.369" end="00:01:34.979" style="s2">released a video series just over a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:37.970" style="s2">month ago explaining the why why a tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.979" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">cooperative as power is important and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.970" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">basically you don&#39;t want to watch half</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">an hour videos it is that technology is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">powerful we have a handful of companies</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">with a lot of data and a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">starting to change our laws and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">politics even technology is powerful</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:59.189" style="s2">we&#39;re having this conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:02:02.130" style="s2">technology technology is also risky it</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.189" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">to come up with a new idea hey Colleen</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.130" end="00:02:06.390" style="s2">and put it out into the world comes up</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">with it a lot of risk especially if</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.390" end="00:02:10.619" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it in I wanna say secret</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">but that&#39;s not quite the right word when</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.619" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it in the normal</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:14.849" style="s2">conventional capitalist way we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:17.129" style="s2">you&#39;re coming up with an idea and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.849" end="00:02:18.840" style="s2">releasing it onto the market it&#39;s risky</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.129" end="00:02:20.819" style="s2">you spend a lot of money and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.840" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">time creating it and then chances are</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.819" end="00:02:24.930" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to go anywhere and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">your failure means future people also</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.930" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">already have something working against</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.950" style="s2">them where&#39;s all the customers that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:33.420" style="s2">signed up for your technology or gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.950" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">be less likely to sign up for technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.420" end="00:02:38.120" style="s2">in the future so technology&#39;s powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:40.410" style="s2">technology is risky but together</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.120" end="00:02:42.690" style="s2">technology&#39;s more powerful because we</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.410" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">can trust in it and we can create it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.690" end="00:02:46.200" style="s2">a way that we trust it we can create it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">in a way that it&#39;s transparent and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.200" end="00:02:53.220" style="s2">it has it empowers us without being</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">empowered over us in doing so we also</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.220" end="00:02:59.220" style="s2">can make it less risky when we share in</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.140" end="00:03:00.690" style="s2">the cost when we share in the ingenuity</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.220" end="00:03:02.280" style="s2">when we decide to come together and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.690" end="00:03:04.799" style="s2">create something that we already know we</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.280" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">want that is what together tech is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.799" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">trying to do is figuring out how do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:11.459" style="s2">create how do we collaborate to create a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">collaboration platform once we have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.459" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">collaboration platform how do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:18.420" style="s2">continually improve it and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:20.630" style="s2">also use it to empower all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.420" end="00:03:23.579" style="s2">individuals to create their projects so</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.630" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">we have our project raising our second</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.579" end="00:03:28.019" style="s2">one is tomorrow on Saturdays on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">channel two hours before this thing</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.060" end="00:03:38.069" style="s2">week we raised we collections my brother</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">Adrian&#39;s project and this week we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.069" end="00:03:44.910" style="s2">raising J cousins project call all all</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:47.510" style="s2">being home and there&#39;s a link in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.910" end="00:03:52.250" style="s2">description as to what that is in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.510" end="00:03:57.000" style="s2">description box of that video so that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.250" end="00:03:59.310" style="s2">the idea Cafe this and that are what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.000" end="00:04:00.690" style="s2">am doing to create game be to create a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.310" end="00:04:01.889" style="s2">world that works for me in a world that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.690" end="00:04:04.470" style="s2">works for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.889" end="00:04:08.250" style="s2">I see technologies a very powerful tool</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.470" end="00:04:10.470" style="s2">that we can use to do everything at once</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.250" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">no one person can hold all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.470" end="00:04:13.470" style="s2">information no one person can do all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:15.510" style="s2">the things that need to be done</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.470" end="00:04:18.570" style="s2">simultaneously on this planet to correct</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.510" end="00:04:20.039" style="s2">a lot of the stuff that we as a species</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.570" end="00:04:23.630" style="s2">have done to this planet each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.039" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">ourselves but collectively we can if we</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.630" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">just take on what we have ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">to us and were empowered with the tools</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:34.610" style="s2">to be able to more effectively take on</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:37.850" style="s2">that work so if you have an idea you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.610" end="00:04:40.340" style="s2">go and get people to work on it if it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.850" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">resonates with them if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.340" end="00:04:46.460" style="s2">problem we can crowdsource a solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:50.570" style="s2">and creating that platform is what what</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.460" end="00:04:52.100" style="s2">we are focused on but what I&#39;m currently</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.570" end="00:04:56.380" style="s2">struggling with and maybe people can</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.100" end="00:04:59.479" style="s2">help me out here is the idea Cafe</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.380" end="00:05:01.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t struggle to get people when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.479" end="00:05:02.870" style="s2">host one for that we enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.100" end="00:05:04.970" style="s2">conversation people are just showing up</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">for a conversation around a question</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.970" end="00:05:08.630" style="s2">right now we&#39;re only hosting them for</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:10.010" style="s2">game because that&#39;s just my world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.630" end="00:05:10.970" style="s2">what I want to talk about whenever I try</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.010" end="00:05:12.919" style="s2">to put it out to the mental health</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.970" end="00:05:14.720" style="s2">community or the autistic community or</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.919" end="00:05:16.669" style="s2">the queer community there just isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">much interest in having one weekly and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.669" end="00:05:20.570" style="s2">don&#39;t want to spend my spoons coming up</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.550" style="s2">with a new a new group every every week</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.570" end="00:05:24.650" style="s2">so I don&#39;t have problem getting people</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.550" end="00:05:26.270" style="s2">to the idea cafe it looks like we also</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.650" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">don&#39;t have problems getting people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.270" end="00:05:32.840" style="s2">the project raising it&#39;s a new project</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.639" end="00:05:34.340" style="s2">every week and I don&#39;t know we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.840" end="00:05:35.810" style="s2">gonna be in our second week so maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.340" end="00:05:37.699" style="s2">should wait to talk about maybe we will</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.810" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">have trouble both getting projects there</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.699" end="00:05:41.660" style="s2">because there&#39;s more projects that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.199" end="00:05:45.880" style="s2">have weeks to fulfill already and people</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.660" end="00:05:49.099" style="s2">come and participate in it but this I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.880" end="00:05:51.889" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to get people not even to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.099" end="00:05:53.870" style="s2">come to this timeslot but like we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.889" end="00:05:55.699" style="s2">to collaborate to create a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.870" end="00:05:58.580" style="s2">platform it can&#39;t be created in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.699" end="00:06:00.020" style="s2">backend it without public view and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.580" end="00:06:02.510" style="s2">release to the public and somehow be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.020" end="00:06:04.370" style="s2">solution part of what we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.510" end="00:06:06.320" style="s2">project raising for is because we want</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.370" end="00:06:07.909" style="s2">it we want to support all of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.320" end="00:06:10.610" style="s2">amazing projects are coming from people</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.909" end="00:06:12.440" style="s2">but also we want to find the common pain</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.610" end="00:06:14.599" style="s2">like what is it that would help move</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.440" end="00:06:16.520" style="s2">those projects forward so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.599" end="00:06:19.430" style="s2">solve that problem together is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.520" end="00:06:21.770" style="s2">funding is it marketing is it getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.430" end="00:06:24.590" style="s2">people on board whether to work or like</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.770" end="00:06:26.990" style="s2">whether it&#39;s customers or employees or</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.590" end="00:06:28.760" style="s2">partners what what happens to be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.990" end="00:06:30.949" style="s2">sticking point and then solving a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.760" end="00:06:32.990" style="s2">those problems together that is the one</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.949" end="00:06:36.440" style="s2">of the reasons I focused on technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.990" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">is that I know all of those sticking</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.440" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">points I&#39;m a very low risk individual I</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:44.590" style="s2">cannot take on risk find out</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:48.100" style="s2">emotionally it just does not work so</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.590" end="00:06:50.500" style="s2">well and so I have thought up a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.100" end="00:06:53.460" style="s2">that&#39;s risk basically risk-free I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.500" end="00:06:55.900" style="s2">showing up here my egos on the line my</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.460" end="00:06:58.570" style="s2">butt nothing else I don&#39;t have money on</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.900" end="00:06:59.980" style="s2">the line there&#39;s no my time is here I am</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.570" end="00:07:01.510" style="s2">I&#39;m okay with this I&#39;m okay with</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.980" end="00:07:04.210" style="s2">sacrificing looking like an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.510" end="00:07:05.110" style="s2">sacrificing getting it wrong on the path</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.210" end="00:07:07.240" style="s2">to getting it right</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.110" end="00:07:08.980" style="s2">and I&#39;m looking for we are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.240" end="00:07:12.250" style="s2">other people who also want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.980" end="00:07:13.630" style="s2">not necessarily technology people not</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.250" end="00:07:16.930" style="s2">people who know how to code because we</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.630" end="00:07:19.720" style="s2">can pay those people we can crowd fun</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.930" end="00:07:24.310" style="s2">and get employees on board what we need</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.720" end="00:07:26.860" style="s2">is the passion and the ingenuity for</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.310" end="00:07:29.080" style="s2">like what tech do we want and so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.860" end="00:07:31.210" style="s2">question I posed to the game be space</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.080" end="00:07:33.330" style="s2">this week that I thought would entice</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.210" end="00:07:35.980" style="s2">people to come and maybe his that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.330" end="00:07:38.620" style="s2">what would a platformer need to be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.980" end="00:07:40.450" style="s2">collaboration platform so if Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.620" end="00:07:41.980" style="s2">was designed for collaboration and for</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.450" end="00:07:46.690" style="s2">actually getting projects out into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.980" end="00:07:48.820" style="s2">world what would that look like but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.690" end="00:07:52.030" style="s2">for you to participate in it what would</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.820" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">make it fun and exciting and part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.030" end="00:07:56.380" style="s2">that also is we need a funding model our</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:57.820" style="s2">current funding model that we&#39;ve is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.380" end="00:07:59.650" style="s2">people pay ten bucks a month into a pool</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.820" end="00:08:01.930" style="s2">we vote on what we do with that money</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.650" end="00:08:03.130" style="s2">creating the collaboration platform</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.930" end="00:08:04.600" style="s2">itself and then we have a pool with</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.130" end="00:08:06.280" style="s2">money to create all of the projects that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.600" end="00:08:08.770" style="s2">we want we vote on which one sort have</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.280" end="00:08:12.220" style="s2">the most stem residents with us and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.770" end="00:08:15.700" style="s2">there&#39;s an infinite number of ways to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.220" end="00:08:20.380" style="s2">that so what would make a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.700" end="00:08:22.150" style="s2">platform worth $10 a month to you what</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.380" end="00:08:23.830" style="s2">would make you want to put in $10 a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.150" end="00:08:27.130" style="s2">month to get what it has to offer</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.830" end="00:08:29.530" style="s2">I understand nobody is paying $10 lent</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.130" end="00:08:32.500" style="s2">for Facebook that and we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.530" end="00:08:34.300" style="s2">gotten Facebook and it&#39;s free so that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.500" end="00:08:35.620" style="s2">our level of integrity are also not</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.300" end="00:08:36.790" style="s2">going to pay for Wikipedia we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.620" end="00:08:38.170" style="s2">going to pay for information because</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.790" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s already available even if we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.170" end="00:08:42.729" style="s2">improve on it people generally aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.350" style="s2">going to pay that but people do pay and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.729" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of tech out there that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.350" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">for project management that is for time</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:50.260" style="s2">coordination that scheduling groups it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:52.930" style="s2">doing that level and most of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.260" end="00:08:54.180" style="s2">things cost $10 a month per person and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.930" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">as a person involved in</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.180" end="00:08:59.070" style="s2">of all or trying to be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:00.810" style="s2">multiple projects there isn&#39;t a way for</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.070" end="00:09:02.670" style="s2">me as an individual to keep those things</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.810" end="00:09:04.910" style="s2">organized and that is a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.670" end="00:09:07.380" style="s2">platforms like project management meets</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.910" end="00:09:10.500" style="s2">communication tool and scheduler and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.380" end="00:09:12.690" style="s2">also as a person I can go on and find a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.500" end="00:09:14.670" style="s2">project to work on as a person with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.690" end="00:09:18.570" style="s2">project I can go on and find people to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.670" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">to work on my project with me and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.570" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">that is the question I pose to all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.110" style="s2">you which you&#39;ll have to type out</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:27.209" style="s2">because that there&#39;s or if you would</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.110" end="00:09:28.589" style="s2">like you can also join me here I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.209" end="00:09:29.580" style="s2">gonna put this here even though no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.589" end="00:09:33.209" style="s2">going to type this out and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.580" end="00:09:35.940" style="s2">I just make things clickable yet but if</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.209" end="00:09:39.300" style="s2">you want to join me on camera you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.940" end="00:09:43.350" style="s2">also it take the camera out and just be</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.300" end="00:09:45.240" style="s2">a voice you can throw it to that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.350" end="00:09:47.250" style="s2">not really that long someone could</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.240" end="00:09:48.360" style="s2">actually type that out I go but I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.250" end="00:09:49.890" style="s2">the people watching are probably the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.360" end="00:09:53.070" style="s2">people who don&#39;t want to be on camera in</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.890" end="00:09:54.750" style="s2">voice but it is you are welcome so what</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.070" end="00:09:59.250" style="s2">Bentley and I were going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.750" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">today was making this just like our</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.250" end="00:10:04.500" style="s2">Saturday conversation has become a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:08.850" style="s2">project raising for other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.500" end="00:10:11.070" style="s2">projects where we are brainstorming how</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.850" end="00:10:13.080" style="s2">to meet their aspirations right the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.070" end="00:10:14.130" style="s2">person brings their project tells us</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.080" end="00:10:17.310" style="s2">what they want to get out of that hour</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.130" end="00:10:20.490" style="s2">and we try we try to help them as best</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:30.870" style="s2">see is this something they want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.250" end="00:10:32.339" style="s2">participate in but but more so like</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.870" end="00:10:33.540" style="s2">you&#39;re not committing in any way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.339" end="00:10:35.490" style="s2">just showing up for that hour and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.540" end="00:10:37.620" style="s2">helping us move it forward offering</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.490" end="00:10:38.970" style="s2">ideas and opinions on you know if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.620" end="00:10:40.440" style="s2">talking about funding that week what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.970" end="00:10:43.260" style="s2">a funding model if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.440" end="00:10:46.470" style="s2">the communication tool how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:48.120" style="s2">we collaborate on on that using existing</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.470" end="00:10:51.089" style="s2">technology and creating the technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.120" end="00:10:53.010" style="s2">that bridges the gap between what exists</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.089" end="00:10:54.990" style="s2">like zum-zum exists and we can use it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.010" end="00:10:57.270" style="s2">and it&#39;s free for a certain number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.990" end="00:10:58.829" style="s2">people if we can create this what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.270" end="00:11:02.250" style="s2">been talking about in these spaces is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.829" end="00:11:05.590" style="s2">the scheduling tool to get people to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.250" end="00:11:10.810" style="s2">conversation then we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.590" end="00:11:12.580" style="s2">can like that is what what we were once</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.810" end="00:11:14.670" style="s2">we have that then we can use zoom we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.580" end="00:11:16.750" style="s2">don&#39;t need to recreate video</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.670" end="00:11:18.730" style="s2">conversations we can use what already</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.750" end="00:11:21.070" style="s2">exists so that what we can create is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.730" end="00:11:22.660" style="s2">very beta and very cheap and then see</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.070" end="00:11:28.750" style="s2">how do we improve it right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.660" end="00:11:30.220" style="s2">continually improve it I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.750" end="00:11:31.390" style="s2">put your comment to pure Colleen knowing</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.220" end="00:11:34.510" style="s2">what you&#39;re supporting is important in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.390" end="00:11:36.490" style="s2">funding yes no and that is like right</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.510" end="00:11:39.190" style="s2">now Bentley and I are talking about well</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.490" end="00:11:40.930" style="s2">well what is the word I wanna say token</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.190" end="00:11:43.000" style="s2">but that&#39;s not quite right like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.930" end="00:11:45.250" style="s2">gonna be putting $20 a month in right</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.000" end="00:11:46.870" style="s2">it&#39;s just me and him right now the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.250" end="00:11:49.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t that that $20 a month is really</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.870" end="00:11:50.980" style="s2">gonna do anything it&#39;s that we Bentley</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.980" end="00:11:54.220" style="s2">at the moment are the ones who decide</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.750" end="00:11:55.930" style="s2">what that money goes to right so in</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.220" end="00:11:59.380" style="s2">third people the fourth person comes on</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.930" end="00:12:00.940" style="s2">that that is part of the democracy the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.380" end="00:12:03.790" style="s2">the collaboration of what do we spend</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.940" end="00:12:06.310" style="s2">those funds on we&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.790" end="00:12:07.900" style="s2">sending them on one-off projects that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.310" end="00:12:09.850" style="s2">aren&#39;t the tech cooperative right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.900" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">not going to be spending them on cube</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.850" end="00:12:14.230" style="s2">spawn as much as cube spawn is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:16.150" style="s2">amazing project later on when we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.230" end="00:12:20.230" style="s2">the collaboration platform and we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.150" end="00:12:22.330" style="s2">in excess of money that is what we we</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.230" end="00:12:23.890" style="s2">will then as a community vote on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.330" end="00:12:25.690" style="s2">our priority right as climate change our</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.770" end="00:12:38.740" style="s2">important piece is that if you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.640" end="00:13:05.500" style="s2">talk about five things at once so I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.670" end="00:13:09.190" style="s2">talking with with Jasper Skye this last</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.500" end="00:13:11.650" style="s2">week about fractal democracy and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.190" end="00:13:13.480" style="s2">idea that you get seven people together</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.650" end="00:13:16.360" style="s2">and in every level it&#39;s 7 to the power</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.480" end="00:13:18.340" style="s2">of whatever level that is so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.360" end="00:13:19.420" style="s2">horrible explanation so many people</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.340" end="00:13:21.790" style="s2">getting together having too</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.420" end="00:13:22.990" style="s2">conversation about climate change they</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.790" end="00:13:24.340" style="s2">can&#39;t really do anything because they</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.990" end="00:13:26.140" style="s2">have 70 bucks a month and that&#39;s if they</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.340" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">spend all of their money but at every</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.140" end="00:13:28.960" style="s2">level where you can see well wait there</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:30.700" style="s2">isn&#39;t just one group of seven people</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.960" end="00:13:32.230" style="s2">there are thousands of groups of seven</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.700" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">people which means you can definitely</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.230" end="00:13:36.220" style="s2">form the old two layer which would be 49</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:40.900" style="s2">and the old three layer which is 49</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.220" end="00:13:42.640" style="s2">times seven roughly 350 and at each</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.900" end="00:13:44.590" style="s2">layer you know what your budget is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.640" end="00:13:46.300" style="s2">because you know how much money is being</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.590" end="00:13:47.800" style="s2">passed off to the next level and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.300" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">much money you actually have to work on</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.800" end="00:13:53.260" style="s2">so if you get an L seven you have a ton</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:54.760" style="s2">of money to work on climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.260" end="00:13:56.410" style="s2">then everyone at all those levels is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.760" end="00:13:57.790" style="s2">voting you&#39;re keeping 25 percent of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.410" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">to spend in your group of seven as ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.790" end="00:14:04.420" style="s2">you want your group of 49 your group of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:05.650" style="s2">roughly 350 that&#39;s one iteration that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.420" end="00:14:07.780" style="s2">could be used for a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.650" end="00:14:09.490" style="s2">platform that&#39;s both funding and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.780" end="00:14:10.750" style="s2">needs to have the way for you to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.490" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">find those seven people have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.750" end="00:14:14.190" style="s2">conversation with those seven people and</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.300" style="s2">then form the higher-level groups and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.190" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">keep feeding back into the system what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.300" end="00:14:22.300" style="s2">working what&#39;s not working the point</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:24.220" style="s2">with all of this this whole technology</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.300" end="00:14:25.870" style="s2">cooperative is basically everything is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.220" end="00:14:27.850" style="s2">chicken and egg it&#39;s like well in order</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.870" end="00:14:28.960" style="s2">to be able to collaborate on a project</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.850" end="00:14:30.550" style="s2">you need the tools to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.960" end="00:14:34.120" style="s2">collaborate to find the people to fund</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.550" end="00:14:36.760" style="s2">it to put out work that you need done</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.120" end="00:14:38.470" style="s2">right like we&#39;re talking on our project</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.760" end="00:14:40.660" style="s2">or who we&#39;d like next to join us right</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.470" end="00:14:43.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s like basically anyone who wants</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.660" end="00:14:45.250" style="s2">to but if we could pick somebody with</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.000" end="00:14:47.560" style="s2">admin work someone who can actually I</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.250" end="00:14:49.060" style="s2">can show up in for this conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.560" end="00:14:50.710" style="s2">the writing out the descriptions the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.060" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">writing out a lot of things they keep an</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.710" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">email but keeping the website going is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:57.910" style="s2">not my strong suit in any way so having</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">somebody join us that has those skill</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.910" end="00:15:01.150" style="s2">sets if we have a collaboration platform</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:02.620" style="s2">that&#39;s easy to find these people put in</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.150" end="00:15:04.450" style="s2">their skill sets and you say hey people</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.620" end="00:15:06.340" style="s2">the skill set does this project resonate</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.450" end="00:15:09.370" style="s2">with you do you want to be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.340" end="00:15:11.560" style="s2">and similarly if there&#39;s no one no one</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.370" end="00:15:14.040" style="s2">within min you know degree it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.560" end="00:15:16.630" style="s2">well I&#39;m willing to take on that role is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.040" end="00:15:18.550" style="s2">good enough right now right like well</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.630" end="00:15:19.930" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to try the admitting to try</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.550" end="00:15:23.200" style="s2">and make a spreadsheet am willing to try</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.930" end="00:15:25.720" style="s2">those things having a culture it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.200" end="00:15:27.570" style="s2">about perfection it&#39;s about getting it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.720" end="00:15:29.560" style="s2">wrong and learning on repeat as</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.570" end="00:15:31.480" style="s2">individuals and collectively together</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.560" end="00:15:32.520" style="s2">until we get it right we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.480" end="00:15:34.620" style="s2">getting it wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.520" end="00:15:38.100" style="s2">so many ways on the planet that that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.620" end="00:15:41.400" style="s2">a lot of what a technology cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.100" end="00:15:42.840" style="s2">can give us is the space to fail without</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.400" end="00:15:45.240" style="s2">it being catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.840" end="00:15:47.940" style="s2">this is experiments that are safe enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.240" end="00:15:49.770" style="s2">to try and so what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.940" end="00:15:51.630" style="s2">what does it look like to have a new</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.770" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">project come up and have its own funding</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.630" end="00:15:55.950" style="s2">model and its own governance model and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:57.960" style="s2">have it feedback into the system what</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.950" end="00:16:00.540" style="s2">works and what doesn&#39;t when it does fail</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.960" end="00:16:03.770" style="s2">or when it has micro failures right like</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.540" end="00:16:03.770" style="s2">when things go wrong they improve it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.260" end="00:16:09.840" style="s2">mentoring I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.460" end="00:16:12.990" style="s2">question is regarding what we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.840" end="00:16:14.700" style="s2">mentoring on the site it&#39;s possibly an</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.990" end="00:16:17.160" style="s2">answer to my question if that was worth</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.700" end="00:16:18.180" style="s2">$10 a month to you like that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.160" end="00:16:19.470" style="s2">something we can do it but how much</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.180" end="00:16:22.020" style="s2">would that then goes to the mentor</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.470" end="00:16:24.420" style="s2">versus but the truth is a mentor might</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.020" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">be willing to mentor know that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.420" end="00:16:27.450" style="s2">cool because there&#39;s this idea like</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:29.400" style="s2">there&#39;s people tons of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.450" end="00:16:32.730" style="s2">willing to do work for free but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.400" end="00:16:34.980" style="s2">this when you&#39;re doing work for free</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.730" end="00:16:37.080" style="s2">people aren&#39;t as into it as when they</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.980" end="00:16:38.520" style="s2">pay for it so if you do counseling</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.080" end="00:16:40.020" style="s2">you&#39;re paid 100 bucks an hour and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.520" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">they&#39;re paying you $100 an hour they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.020" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">going to show up because they have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:43.980" style="s2">pay you hundred dollars an hour whether</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:46.740" style="s2">they show up or not if it&#39;s for free</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.980" end="00:16:48.570" style="s2">they&#39;re less likely to show up and so if</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.740" end="00:16:50.580" style="s2">people are paying $10 a month into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.570" end="00:16:51.750" style="s2">system to get mentored but the mentor is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.580" end="00:16:53.670" style="s2">not getting because it&#39;s going to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.750" end="00:16:55.110" style="s2">system the mentor is working for free</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.670" end="00:16:56.490" style="s2">they&#39;re choosing to be there for free so</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.110" end="00:16:59.730" style="s2">you know you&#39;re getting there like full</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.490" end="00:17:03.030" style="s2">spirit not their paid for-profit spirit</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.730" end="00:17:04.620" style="s2">and yet the person pain is paying for it</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.030" end="00:17:06.420" style="s2">right so there they are showing up you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.620" end="00:17:09.420" style="s2">know they&#39;re both people are committed</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.420" end="00:17:10.890" style="s2">more so than if it was you don&#39;t even I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.420" end="00:17:14.700" style="s2">like it I like it but I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.890" end="00:17:16.680" style="s2">that looks like and it this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.700" end="00:17:20.600" style="s2">because I&#39;m a very non hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.680" end="00:17:24.209" style="s2">person or at least I want to be is I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.600" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">mean if he&#39;s called it there because it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.209" end="00:17:31.130" style="s2">was in between safe enough to try yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:33.030" style="s2">that&#39;s what a lot of this is based on my</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.130" end="00:17:34.620" style="s2">thinking just sitting thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.030" end="00:17:35.820" style="s2">capitalism versus communism and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.620" end="00:17:38.970" style="s2">went wrong with one and what&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.820" end="00:17:40.590" style="s2">going on with another and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.970" end="00:17:44.130" style="s2">projects that are out there amazing but</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.590" end="00:17:46.300" style="s2">they&#39;re not safe enough to try a debt</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.130" end="00:17:48.670" style="s2">Jubilee is not safe enough to try</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.300" end="00:17:50.860" style="s2">they can catastrophic ly destroy our</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.990" end="00:18:06.460" style="s2">enough to try and that&#39;s where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.790" end="00:18:09.250" style="s2">people want to get like a city going or</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.460" end="00:18:11.160" style="s2">a village or a community because they</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.160" end="00:18:15.010" style="s2">which is fine and there&#39;s nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.150" end="00:18:17.050" style="s2">with that but especially when you want a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.010" end="00:18:19.660" style="s2">city an existing city or an existing</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.050" end="00:18:23.230" style="s2">state or an existing country to take on</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.660" end="00:18:25.600" style="s2">a new model to see if it works that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.230" end="00:18:28.030" style="s2">already not safe enough to try like this</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.600" end="00:18:30.520" style="s2">failing at a Canadian level or a british</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.030" end="00:18:33.370" style="s2">columbian or a vancouver level isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.520" end="00:18:35.920" style="s2">safe enough to try whereas a company</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.370" end="00:18:38.200" style="s2">level it is because that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.920" end="00:18:40.780" style="s2">companies are designed for is to be safe</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.200" end="00:18:44.260" style="s2">enough to try for the people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.780" end="00:18:45.610" style="s2">creating them and a cooperative is no</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.260" end="00:18:48.460" style="s2">different except that it brings in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.610" end="00:18:49.570" style="s2">democracy piece to it it brings in more</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.460" end="00:18:54.730" style="s2">trust to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.570" end="00:18:56.350" style="s2">so having a corporation that&#39;s open and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.730" end="00:18:58.360" style="s2">transparent so if and when we fail</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.350" end="00:19:00.010" style="s2">whether it&#39;s micro and we learn and grow</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.360" end="00:19:01.300" style="s2">which is hopefully what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.010" end="00:19:03.610" style="s2">hopefully there isn&#39;t a catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.300" end="00:19:06.520" style="s2">failure but if there even if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.610" end="00:19:08.410" style="s2">catastrophic failure you can see what</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.520" end="00:19:10.930" style="s2">went wrong for the next iteration right</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.410" end="00:19:13.180" style="s2">if me and Bentley have a horrible blow</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.930" end="00:19:14.350" style="s2">up fight and it&#39;s right now so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.180" end="00:19:16.780" style="s2">you know maybe there&#39;s no one else</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.350" end="00:19:19.990" style="s2">involved and we split we split ways you</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.780" end="00:19:21.310" style="s2">can see that that happens and so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.990" end="00:19:22.810" style="s2">don&#39;t I mean we can see well what what</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.310" end="00:19:24.220" style="s2">went wrong and I both Bentley and I are</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.810" end="00:19:25.330" style="s2">not probably not going to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.220" end="00:19:27.610" style="s2">we&#39;re probably also the type of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.330" end="00:19:29.260" style="s2">personalities who would at least have</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.610" end="00:19:30.730" style="s2">another session to figure out what went</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.260" end="00:19:32.050" style="s2">wrong there might not be those people</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.730" end="00:19:33.970" style="s2">involved so they might never want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.050" end="00:19:35.020" style="s2">talk but you I can still learn right I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.970" end="00:19:38.830" style="s2">can still learn and grow for those</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.020" end="00:19:43.570" style="s2">experiences a village is safe but if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.830" end="00:19:48.130" style="s2">build it a sustainable substantial</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.570" end="00:19:50.380" style="s2">principle a substantial right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.130" end="00:19:52.840" style="s2">know a substantial produce principle is</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.380" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s not big right but then you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.840" end="00:19:55.960" style="s2">lands right you need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:57.100" style="s2">follow the rules of the law and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.960" end="00:19:58.390" style="s2">it&#39;s only big enough for a certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.100" end="00:20:00.010" style="s2">number of people so how do you decide</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.390" end="00:20:02.380" style="s2">who gets to live there</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.010" end="00:20:03.910" style="s2">the people living there arts it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.380" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">safe enough to try because it&#39;s risky</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.910" end="00:20:09.640" style="s2">and finances right it&#39;s not free to buy</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:12.160" style="s2">land it&#39;s not free to grow it to build</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.640" end="00:20:14.679" style="s2">and you can do all of that much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.160" end="00:20:16.780" style="s2">cheaply but no outside funder is going</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.679" end="00:20:18.460" style="s2">to come and do it right no probably no</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.780" end="00:20:19.809" style="s2">billionaires gonna come and be like yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.460" end="00:20:21.429" style="s2">I will find your village for you so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.809" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">people creating it needs to be the ones</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.429" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">to fund it and it&#39;s physical and it land</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.660" style="s2">is already really expensive building</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.280" end="00:20:31.960" style="s2">materials can be pretty expensive you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.660" end="00:20:34.330" style="s2">don&#39;t know where and how to acquire them</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.960" end="00:20:36.910" style="s2">and use them in that way so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.330" end="00:20:38.620" style="s2">there is risk there is risk there but if</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.910" end="00:20:41.140" style="s2">it fails it doesn&#39;t bring down our whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.620" end="00:20:43.570" style="s2">entire system so if you can find that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.140" end="00:20:45.340" style="s2">that finance money it&#39;s absolutely safe</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.570" end="00:20:46.390" style="s2">enough to try and just with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.340" end="00:20:49.390" style="s2">understanding that right what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.390" end="00:20:51.850" style="s2">putting in can go horrifically wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.390" end="00:20:53.740" style="s2">are we comfortable with that right like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.850" end="00:20:55.720" style="s2">Bentley and I aren&#39;t putting in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.740" end="00:20:57.220" style="s2">children&#39;s college education I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.720" end="00:20:59.350" style="s2">have money so my kids college education</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.220" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">Who am I kidding but like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.350" end="00:21:02.770" style="s2">what&#39;s on the line here what&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:05.590" style="s2">line here is an hour of our time on</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.770" end="00:21:07.419" style="s2">Fridays and finding people like if there</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.590" end="00:21:08.830" style="s2">was ten thousand of us who wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.419" end="00:21:10.929" style="s2">collaborate on creating a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.830" end="00:21:12.460" style="s2">platform who are willing to put in ten</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.929" end="00:21:13.990" style="s2">thousand ten thousand dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.460" end="00:21:16.360" style="s2">that&#39;s all just ten thousand dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.990" end="00:21:17.830" style="s2">month that you do to ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.360" end="00:21:19.390" style="s2">willing to put in ten dollars but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.830" end="00:21:22.990" style="s2">a hundred thousand dollars we have that</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.390" end="00:21:24.669" style="s2">we&#39;re all responsible for deciding how</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.990" end="00:21:26.860" style="s2">that gets spent right what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.669" end="00:21:29.380" style="s2">way to use that money to hire someone to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.860" end="00:21:30.850" style="s2">create a platform we don&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.380" end="00:21:33.490" style="s2">people nor we couldn&#39;t have those people</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.850" end="00:21:35.169" style="s2">until we have a beta and so everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.490" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">is chicken-and-egg everything is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.169" end="00:21:39.370" style="s2">well if we had the collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:40.929" style="s2">platform I wouldn&#39;t need to create the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.370" end="00:21:43.210" style="s2">collaboration platform I would just be</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.929" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">starting projects and going on and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.210" end="00:21:47.980" style="s2">seeing if people were interested in them</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:49.150" style="s2">if we had the communication platform we</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.980" end="00:21:50.770" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need to create it I would just</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.150" end="00:21:55.179" style="s2">be on here having conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.770" end="00:21:57.790" style="s2">everyone and but once we have that once</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.179" end="00:22:00.940" style="s2">we have a basic collaboration tool it</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.790" end="00:22:05.559" style="s2">unlocks everything because then isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.940" end="00:22:07.780" style="s2">just our collective that&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.559" end="00:22:09.970" style="s2">forward it&#39;s anyone with an idea for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.780" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">project what we&#39;re doing for a project</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.970" end="00:22:13.630" style="s2">raising on Saturdays is one hour of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.630" end="00:22:18.190" style="s2">we can only have up to five people on</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:21.610" style="s2">video people can watch and participate</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.190" end="00:22:23.220" style="s2">as well but there&#39;s a real barrier right</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.610" end="00:22:25.690" style="s2">like you can&#39;t afford them by people</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.220" end="00:22:27.940" style="s2">playing you can only have one project at</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.690" end="00:22:30.220" style="s2">a time and it&#39;s only one hour a week if</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.940" end="00:22:32.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a platform design for that or</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.220" end="00:22:34.510" style="s2">you can bring any idea at any stage to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.380" end="00:22:35.980" style="s2">to the collective and they can help</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.510" end="00:22:39.270" style="s2">improve it they could help fund it if</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.980" end="00:22:46.390" style="s2">there&#39;s enough if there&#39;s enough um</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.270" end="00:22:47.830" style="s2">what&#39;s wanting to fund it puzzle and put</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.390" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">follow it is a matter of finding the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.830" end="00:22:53.350" style="s2">right combination of people that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:58.150" style="s2">work synergistically who will for 10</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.350" end="00:22:59.770" style="s2">euros per month yes no no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.150" end="00:23:03.070" style="s2">there&#39;s ways to do it I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.770" end="00:23:04.659" style="s2">that there&#39;s not like um if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.070" end="00:23:06.370" style="s2">living there right they&#39;re not living at</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.659" end="00:23:08.289" style="s2">the village so they&#39;re just funding it</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.370" end="00:23:12.130" style="s2">why are they funding yours over theirs</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.289" end="00:23:14.200" style="s2">right like why they might be just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.130" end="00:23:16.210" style="s2">philanthropist that&#39;s ready to like give</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.200" end="00:23:17.559" style="s2">out like hey we&#39;re gonna start ten</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.210" end="00:23:19.299" style="s2">communities and see which one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.559" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">safe enough right like that&#39;s safe</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.299" end="00:23:28.419" style="s2">enough for them because they have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:30.130" style="s2">money it&#39;s not a huge risk of how the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.419" end="00:23:32.679" style="s2">one I have a coffin I must still be</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.130" end="00:23:35.490" style="s2">talking a lot it is the one they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.679" end="00:23:37.870" style="s2">gonna have to talk to the entire hour</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.490" end="00:23:39.100" style="s2">like they probably have a vision of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.870" end="00:23:40.450" style="s2">you have a vision right of what your</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.100" end="00:23:41.890" style="s2">village looks like what your community</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.450" end="00:23:43.240" style="s2">looks like there&#39;s gonna be things that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.890" end="00:23:44.289" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to compromise on and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.240" end="00:23:47.650" style="s2">things you&#39;re not willing to compromise</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.289" end="00:23:49.240" style="s2">on they&#39;re gonna want the things they</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.650" end="00:23:51.010" style="s2">are not willing to compromise on in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.240" end="00:23:52.210" style="s2">village right even if they&#39;re not living</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.010" end="00:23:55.080" style="s2">there with the idea they might live</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.210" end="00:23:57.490" style="s2">there someday and so they&#39;re gonna put</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.080" end="00:23:59.260" style="s2">stipulations probably on the money given</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.490" end="00:24:00.730" style="s2">right unless they&#39;re not if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.260" end="00:24:02.740" style="s2">someone out there who&#39;s just like hey I</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:37.030" style="s2">why it actually works because the people</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.940" end="00:24:38.380" style="s2">there knew we wanted to have collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.030" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">meals and they were a rather big</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.750" end="00:25:09.190" style="s2">are there to be an intentional community</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.309" end="00:25:12.220" style="s2">right to co-create what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.190" end="00:25:13.510" style="s2">not me like not a vegan a vegan could</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:15.130" style="s2">start to be like I only want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.510" end="00:25:17.409" style="s2">with vegan people and there would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.130" end="00:25:23.860" style="s2">less conflict around the vegan s but not</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.409" end="00:25:25.659" style="s2">necessarily the rest of it a problem to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.860" end="00:25:29.700" style="s2">be solved you&#39;re wanting to solve some</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.620" end="00:25:41.770" style="s2">platform to be able to have that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.120" end="00:25:44.140" style="s2">conversation on to say I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.770" end="00:25:45.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve been looking for it involved with</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.140" end="00:25:48.070" style="s2">intentional communities for I would say</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.850" end="00:25:49.570" style="s2">at least a decade now I have a book on</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.070" end="00:25:52.059" style="s2">like finding them and there&#39;s ones that</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.530" end="00:26:06.640" style="s2">cohousing that I&#39;m part of is amazing it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.059" end="00:26:09.070" style="s2">also has some drawbacks you own a house</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.640" end="00:26:11.140" style="s2">there so you&#39;ve got both entices you to</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.070" end="00:26:12.250" style="s2">deal with conflict resolution because</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.140" end="00:26:15.340" style="s2">these are your neighbors you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.250" end="00:26:17.770" style="s2">living with them for decades but also if</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.340" end="00:26:19.659" style="s2">someone stops a level of conflict that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.770" end="00:26:21.460" style="s2">needs to happen to get there because</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.659" end="00:26:23.049" style="s2">these are your neighbors what if we hate</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.460" end="00:26:24.580" style="s2">each other we can&#39;t get into that like</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.049" end="00:26:26.429" style="s2">what if there is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.580" end="00:26:29.049" style="s2">head-butting</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.429" end="00:26:32.110" style="s2">having an online community like game be</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.049" end="00:26:34.210" style="s2">for me a little bit isn&#39;t safe enough to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.110" end="00:26:35.980" style="s2">fail for me personally I&#39;m like I really</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.210" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">like it I really want it to exist I</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.980" end="00:26:39.280" style="s2">really like having a community to go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:40.930" style="s2">who I can talk about these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.280" end="00:26:42.310" style="s2">because before the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.930" end="00:26:47.070" style="s2">I was just alienate everyone in my life</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.310" end="00:26:49.120" style="s2">talking about them but if it went away I</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.070" end="00:26:50.800" style="s2">now know what it could look like and</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.120" end="00:26:53.830" style="s2">could may be more likely to recreate it</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.800" end="00:26:55.300" style="s2">then before before it gave me existed</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.830" end="00:26:56.860" style="s2">before I had the language before when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.300" end="00:26:58.270" style="s2">was still in gay because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.860" end="00:27:00.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing this for like four years</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.270" end="00:27:03.520" style="s2">now creating what I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.790" end="00:27:12.040" style="s2">dismantling capitalism I only heard</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.520" end="00:27:13.480" style="s2">about game be it September 13th I guess</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.040" end="00:27:15.640" style="s2">is a big part helping people to find</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.480" end="00:27:17.560" style="s2">meaningful work synergistically is huge</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.640" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">and that to me is what a technology</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.560" end="00:27:21.850" style="s2">cooperative can do because not that not</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:23.830" style="s2">that a village can&#39;t because that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.850" end="00:27:25.000" style="s2">also like saying hey do you want to come</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.830" end="00:27:26.770" style="s2">work off the land that&#39;s gonna draw in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.000" end="00:27:30.010" style="s2">people who want to do whatever work is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.770" end="00:27:31.900" style="s2">there to do but having a tool a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.010" end="00:27:34.030" style="s2">technology tool that can help you figure</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.900" end="00:27:35.170" style="s2">out who are you what are your skills</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.480" end="00:27:44.290" style="s2">help you find people to that what does</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.670" end="00:27:48.730" style="s2">work together well synergistically I</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.290" end="00:27:50.590" style="s2">guess and it&#39;s you know like instead of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.730" end="00:27:52.510" style="s2">going on being like well hey you group</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.590" end="00:27:54.010" style="s2">of people you you&#39;re poor and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.510" end="00:27:56.560" style="s2">starving so you have to come and work</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.010" end="00:28:00.100" style="s2">this land to me isn&#39;t necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.560" end="00:28:03.730" style="s2">solution but having people being part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.100" end="00:28:05.500" style="s2">hey what if you won the lottery what do</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.730" end="00:28:08.740" style="s2">you want to do what would you spend your</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.500" end="00:28:09.580" style="s2">time doing if we lived in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.740" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">you didn&#39;t have to help other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.580" end="00:28:14.020" style="s2">because everyone could help themselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">what do you spend your time doing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.020" end="00:28:17.920" style="s2">then co-creating solutions that actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:20.410" style="s2">look like that that actually look like</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.920" end="00:28:21.880" style="s2">how do you live your best life how do I</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.410" end="00:28:23.860" style="s2">live my best life and what does that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.880" end="00:28:25.900" style="s2">look like what does our food system look</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.860" end="00:28:31.090" style="s2">like our clothing system look like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.900" end="00:28:32.500" style="s2">isn&#39;t its current iteration and isn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.090" end="00:28:36.160" style="s2">get to dictate what it looks like for</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.500" end="00:28:39.910" style="s2">everyone like where the the options are</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.160" end="00:28:42.370" style="s2">diverse but the system that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.910" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">efficient is one system so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.370" end="00:28:46.690" style="s2">information and the people are in one</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:49.000" style="s2">spot but the options to be involved are</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.690" end="00:28:50.230" style="s2">infinite or nearly infinite someone has</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.000" end="00:28:52.060" style="s2">to come up with one for it to be added</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.230" end="00:28:54.490" style="s2">but the potential of someone coming up</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.060" end="00:28:58.930" style="s2">with one is infinite</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.490" end="00:29:01.150" style="s2">I was just before this morning I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.930" end="00:29:04.450" style="s2">gonna butcher his name if he if I say it</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.030" end="00:29:14.800" style="s2">actually did work so I clicked on an</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.070" end="00:29:16.900" style="s2">i-32 slaves working for me the issue</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.800" end="00:29:18.220" style="s2">with a lot of those things are one you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.900" end="00:29:20.410" style="s2">have to know that that website exists to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.220" end="00:29:21.670" style="s2">go there and use it but even once that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.410" end="00:29:23.620" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t tell me how to not use those</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.670" end="00:29:28.870" style="s2">slaves it doesn&#39;t give me another option</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:30.910" style="s2">my options what use the like farmers</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.060" end="00:29:38.500" style="s2">next to nothing like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.370" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">necessarily ethical and I can&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.500" end="00:29:42.760" style="s2">it so like there has to be a solution we</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:44.380" style="s2">can find for feeding ourselves that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.760" end="00:29:48.010" style="s2">isn&#39;t relying on other people&#39;s labor</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.380" end="00:29:50.290" style="s2">that isn&#39;t relying on but it&#39;s starting</p>

<p begin="00:29:50.290" end="00:29:53.920" style="s2">where do I currently get my food and how</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.970" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">do i improve it how do I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.920" end="00:29:58.360" style="s2">truth of where my food comes from and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:30:00.090" style="s2">make it better and I can&#39;t do it by</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.360" end="00:30:02.620" style="s2">myself</p>

<p begin="00:36:30.890" end="00:36:34.930" style="s2">people comments you like it is here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:37.540" style="s2">about actually us having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.930" end="00:36:41.480" style="s2">not everyone&#39;s comfortable with that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.540" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">there&#39;s this a lot of like issues in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.480" end="00:36:47.540" style="s2">marketing that we&#39;ve talked about of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:49.910" style="s2">introverts who participated in it find</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.540" end="00:36:52.339" style="s2">it very meaningful they enjoy that</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.910" end="00:36:54.760" style="s2">process it&#39;s in fact almost tailor-made</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.339" end="00:36:57.349" style="s2">for introverts</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.760" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">but having it live on YouTube not</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.349" end="00:37:00.740" style="s2">tailor-made for introverts and most</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:01.970" style="s2">introverts don&#39;t know they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.740" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">part of it until they&#39;ve been part of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.970" end="00:37:05.690" style="s2">and tried a bit like oh yeah I liked</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:08.150" style="s2">that that was not confrontational that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.690" end="00:37:10.540" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the same way that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.150" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">experienced other group conversations</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.540" end="00:37:17.440" style="s2">and so a lot of what we&#39;re solving</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:20.140" style="s2">in-game be and all the projects our</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:22.760" style="s2">problems people don&#39;t know they have and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.140" end="00:37:26.329" style="s2">so marketing comes into play</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.760" end="00:37:28.190" style="s2">huge many projects especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.329" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">tech place that is their their thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.190" end="00:37:30.710" style="s2">that falls through is they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:32.510" style="s2">have the right people on board at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.710" end="00:37:34.280" style="s2">right time so you needed 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.510" end="00:37:37.790" style="s2">to have a threshold for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.280" end="00:37:39.050" style="s2">actually usable like Wikipedia is</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.790" end="00:37:40.310" style="s2">awesome it wouldn&#39;t have went anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.050" end="00:37:43.250" style="s2">if there weren&#39;t enough people to put in</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.310" end="00:37:45.290" style="s2">to put in content and to read it</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.250" end="00:37:46.520" style="s2">and therefore propagated and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.290" end="00:37:49.369" style="s2">we started believing it and more people</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.520" end="00:37:50.930" style="s2">came in and did that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.369" end="00:37:52.280" style="s2">things are a snowball right once it</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.930" end="00:37:54.740" style="s2">starts and starts rolling downhill it</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.280" end="00:37:59.300" style="s2">grows and rose and grows and grows but</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.740" end="00:38:01.190" style="s2">it has to start and if we can create the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.300" end="00:38:04.970" style="s2">platform that&#39;s the snowball starter for</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.190" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">all projects because it&#39;s yes if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.970" end="00:38:10.220" style="s2">actually solving a problem for people we</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:12.230" style="s2">want them to know about it as a person</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.220" end="00:38:13.910" style="s2">who has problems I want to know if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.230" end="00:38:17.390" style="s2">have a solution to it even if I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.910" end="00:38:18.859" style="s2">thought about that problem with our</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.390" end="00:38:20.420" style="s2">collaboration platform once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.859" end="00:38:22.550" style="s2">actually a collaboration platform I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.420" end="00:38:25.010" style="s2">sure we will be concentrating on issues</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.550" end="00:38:26.990" style="s2">that are important to most of us like</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.010" end="00:38:30.260" style="s2">food like health care things that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.990" end="00:38:32.390" style="s2">nearly universal we all need them but</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.260" end="00:38:34.609" style="s2">there will also be niche groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.390" end="00:38:37.670" style="s2">like for me my disability comes into</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.609" end="00:38:39.560" style="s2">play a lot regular everyday able-bodied</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.670" end="00:38:40.819" style="s2">people aren&#39;t necessarily gonna be part</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.560" end="00:38:42.079" style="s2">of that conversation because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.819" end="00:38:43.579" style="s2">even gonna see it they&#39;re not even going</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.079" end="00:38:45.770" style="s2">to read but the things we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.579" end="00:38:47.300" style="s2">in that space having those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.770" end="00:38:49.010" style="s2">for like what tools we make for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.300" end="00:38:52.160" style="s2">neuro-diverse book tools for people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.010" end="00:38:54.410" style="s2">have brain damage which rules can we</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:57.950" style="s2">make for people who don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.410" end="00:38:59.930" style="s2">energy those tools will also help people</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.950" end="00:39:01.250" style="s2">who didn&#39;t know they had energy problems</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.930" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">who didn&#39;t know they had memory problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.250" end="00:39:05.480" style="s2">who didn&#39;t know that that these things</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:07.869" style="s2">could exist because they because the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.480" end="00:39:10.040" style="s2">world was working well enough for them</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.869" end="00:39:12.380" style="s2">but in order for it to work for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.040" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">truly deeply needed those people with</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.380" end="00:39:16.040" style="s2">chronic brain injury those people with</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:19.640" style="s2">autism and ATD in order for them to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.040" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">able to utilize it like a group of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.640" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">people has to come together to make it</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:24.770" style="s2">right so ideally that would be a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:26.810" style="s2">of neurodiverse people but how do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.770" end="00:39:28.970" style="s2">get them there to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.810" end="00:39:30.470" style="s2">and so a collaboration platform can</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.970" end="00:39:32.599" style="s2">solve that piece because it&#39;s like who</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.470" end="00:39:33.710" style="s2">do you need to talk to in your a case</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.599" end="00:39:34.790" style="s2">Khali if you&#39;re looking to create a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.710" end="00:39:36.020" style="s2">village you might want to talk to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.790" end="00:39:38.690" style="s2">bunch of people who&#39;ve already lived in</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.020" end="00:39:39.710" style="s2">one right to ask them your questions and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.690" end="00:39:41.869" style="s2">all you&#39;re doing is putting out that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.710" end="00:39:42.950" style="s2">question and people are seeing whether</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.869" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">or not they want to come on board right</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.950" end="00:39:46.099" style="s2">now good luck with that that&#39;s what I do</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:48.589" style="s2">all the time if you put that out on</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.099" end="00:39:49.910" style="s2">Twitter or even in the game be space you</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.589" end="00:39:51.290" style="s2">might have two or three people be part</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.910" end="00:39:52.670" style="s2">of a conversation but it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.290" end="00:39:55.220" style="s2">be a thousand people who come be part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.670" end="00:39:57.700" style="s2">a conversation but there&#39;s enough people</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.220" end="00:40:01.010" style="s2">I know who&#39;ve lived an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.700" end="00:40:02.420" style="s2">who if I was able to target them</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.010" end="00:40:04.700" style="s2">specifically and they put it on their</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.420" end="00:40:05.720" style="s2">Facebook group you would automatically</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.700" end="00:40:07.069" style="s2">get those in that group of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.720" end="00:40:08.300" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.069" end="00:40:10.220" style="s2">it&#39;s more targeted it&#39;s not Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.300" end="00:40:11.750" style="s2">targeting them it&#39;s me worm calling them</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.220" end="00:40:14.150" style="s2">being like hey this person wants to find</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.750" end="00:40:16.430" style="s2">out about intentional communities like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.150" end="00:40:19.089" style="s2">know one of the architects who helped</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.430" end="00:40:19.089" style="s2">create the cohousing</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.020" end="00:40:24.260" style="s2">and wrote the book on cohousing I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.059" end="00:40:25.550" style="s2">know if he would be interested to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.260" end="00:40:28.490" style="s2">part of a video conversation but like</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.550" end="00:40:31.250" style="s2">those kind of that&#39;s my point</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.490" end="00:40:33.859" style="s2">how mean one collaboration space where</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.250" end="00:40:35.930" style="s2">people are so that you can who want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.859" end="00:40:37.670" style="s2">need listen they want to help right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.930" end="00:40:40.940" style="s2">they want to say hey here&#39;s my skill set</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.940" end="00:40:46.339" style="s2">like right now in this facing game be in</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.160" end="00:40:47.780" style="s2">all spaces we&#39;re all very highly</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.339" end="00:40:50.750" style="s2">triggered by other people not doing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.780" end="00:40:52.460" style="s2">work we&#39;ve already done and people doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.750" end="00:40:54.650" style="s2">the work we&#39;ve already done like all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.460" end="00:40:56.839" style="s2">it all of it is triggering we all</p>

<p begin="00:40:56.839" end="00:41:01.099" style="s2">to be able like if I don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.819" end="00:41:03.109" style="s2">something I imagine nobody wants to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.099" end="00:41:04.430" style="s2">it but that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.109" end="00:41:06.380" style="s2">what I was talking to people about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.430" end="00:41:08.780" style="s2">idea before it was ever kind of together</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.380" end="00:41:11.119" style="s2">tech and how we find people find</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.780" end="00:41:12.799" style="s2">synergistic work I was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.119" end="00:41:14.210" style="s2">like everyone has a genius and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.799" end="00:41:15.380" style="s2">has passion and we want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.210" end="00:41:16.940" style="s2">working in that passion and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.380" end="00:41:19.609" style="s2">things that like nobody wants to do like</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.940" end="00:41:21.710" style="s2">cleaning toilets the first person I used</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.609" end="00:41:23.030" style="s2">that analogy with she was like I like</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.710" end="00:41:24.950" style="s2">cleaning toilets I was like you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.030" end="00:41:26.270" style="s2">broke it all I&#39;m like why why do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.950" end="00:41:27.950" style="s2">like cleaning toilets and I was like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.270" end="00:41:30.650" style="s2">don&#39;t like cleaning toilets I would not</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.950" end="00:41:32.750" style="s2">like thinking other people&#39;s toilets but</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.650" end="00:41:34.700" style="s2">I would be okay making beds like even</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.750" end="00:41:36.410" style="s2">though I don&#39;t like making my own bed if</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.700" end="00:41:37.490" style="s2">I if that was the one thing I did and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.410" end="00:41:39.049" style="s2">just went down the block and made</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.490" end="00:41:40.190" style="s2">everyone&#39;s done for the week okay I</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.049" end="00:41:42.380" style="s2">guess I&#39;d do that and I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.190" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the solutions were creating I</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.380" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we want to piecemeal art</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:47.170" style="s2">or house work and then how people come</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.440" end="00:41:50.390" style="s2">in and out of our house it&#39;s doing it</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.170" end="00:41:54.140" style="s2">but to have the platform to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.390" end="00:41:57.530" style="s2">have an idea and have people jump on</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.140" end="00:42:00.099" style="s2">board and workshop it is what would be</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.530" end="00:42:00.099" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.270" end="00:42:05.570" style="s2">starting with production cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.010" end="00:42:08.750" style="s2">and creating meaningful and synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.570" end="00:42:10.070" style="s2">work production cooperatives what do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.750" end="00:42:11.690" style="s2">mean by a production cooperative because</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.070" end="00:42:15.380" style="s2">I like I know cooperatives and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.690" end="00:42:16.580" style="s2">generally like three types of the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.380" end="00:42:18.890" style="s2">one emerging which were kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.580" end="00:42:21.470" style="s2">fourth one is worker cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.890" end="00:42:24.200" style="s2">consumer cooperatives or producer</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.470" end="00:42:27.890" style="s2">cooperatives so producer cooperatives is</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.200" end="00:42:29.570" style="s2">like Ocean Spray where all the cranberry</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.890" end="00:42:31.400" style="s2">farmers are like part of it and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.570" end="00:42:33.110" style="s2">that&#39;s a cooperative even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.400" end="00:42:35.480" style="s2">still on the market it&#39;s not benefiting</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.110" end="00:42:36.980" style="s2">me that they were cooperative we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.480" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">cooperative my friends in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.980" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">woodshop cooperative they&#39;re part</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:42.740" style="s2">they&#39;re not even carpenters people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:44.270" style="s2">like working with wood we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.740" end="00:42:45.410" style="s2">wood and they&#39;re they&#39;re setting their</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.270" end="00:42:47.120" style="s2">own wage and they&#39;re finding their own</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.410" end="00:42:51.050" style="s2">work and they&#39;re doing within this</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.120" end="00:42:52.370" style="s2">cooperative credit unions and Mountain</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.050" end="00:42:53.750" style="s2">Equipment co-op are consumer</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.370" end="00:42:55.880" style="s2">cooperatives where it&#39;s good person</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.750" end="00:42:58.850" style="s2">buying the good that is the membership</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.880" end="00:43:00.980" style="s2">that they care about there&#39;s also a new</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.850" end="00:43:04.190" style="s2">emergent cooperative called a platform</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.980" end="00:43:05.960" style="s2">cooperative which is basically any of</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.190" end="00:43:09.140" style="s2">those that facilitated by an online</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.960" end="00:43:10.580" style="s2">platform so if Facebook was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.140" end="00:43:12.530" style="s2">cooperative it would be like the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.580" end="00:43:13.640" style="s2">who are using us the people where the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.530" end="00:43:15.830" style="s2">ownership it would be a member of</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.640" end="00:43:18.050" style="s2">coopera it would be like that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.830" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">platform isn&#39;t its own thing because the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.050" end="00:43:22.310" style="s2">ones that exist right now I can never</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:24.260" style="s2">remember it there&#39;s a photography one</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.310" end="00:43:26.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a photography platform that is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.260" end="00:43:28.610" style="s2">cooperative and the photographer&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.150" end="00:43:32.030" style="s2">ones that are members so it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.610" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">a worker cooperative so finding so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.030" end="00:43:39.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you mean by production</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:40.700" style="s2">cooperative like whether that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.080" end="00:43:42.140" style="s2">people needing the product are they the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.700" end="00:43:46.460" style="s2">ones collaborating or the people making</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.140" end="00:43:47.780" style="s2">the products there&#39;s also hybrids of but</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.460" end="00:43:49.610" style="s2">there are also generally needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.780" end="00:43:52.850" style="s2">like an overarching to some degree which</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.610" end="00:43:54.590" style="s2">one&#39;s the bigger piece like van City is</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.850" end="00:43:57.020" style="s2">a great place to work but it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.590" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">worker cooperative you have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.020" end="00:44:00.610" style="s2">member to work there but you&#39;re a member</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:04.850" style="s2">of the credit union</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.610" end="00:44:06.200" style="s2">you&#39;re not mech is the same thing like</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.850" end="00:44:07.640" style="s2">the workers it&#39;s a good place to work</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.200" end="00:44:09.200" style="s2">they have good benefits that gave them</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.640" end="00:44:11.320" style="s2">well but they&#39;re not a worker</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.200" end="00:44:11.320" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.250" end="00:44:17.120" style="s2">similarly the woodwork the wood shop is</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.020" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.120" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">has really good pricing like that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">of their model is that they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:28.250" style="s2">able to give people good wood objects at</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:30.350" style="s2">not an ikea price but not a high-end</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.250" end="00:44:32.450" style="s2">price either and have it be specially</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.350" end="00:44:33.800" style="s2">made so they&#39;re not pricing them at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.450" end="00:44:34.820" style="s2">high-end even though they possibly could</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.800" end="00:44:38.530" style="s2">because they&#39;re amazing</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.820" end="00:44:41.030" style="s2">they&#39;re pricing them at the midpoint so</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.530" end="00:44:43.790" style="s2">generally one comes into play and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.030" end="00:44:44.840" style="s2">other one but not so I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.790" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">you mean by production cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.840" end="00:44:48.350" style="s2">unless you are talking about like Ocean</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:50.660" style="s2">Spray like it&#39;s just my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.350" end="00:44:52.190" style="s2">bias those funds is like in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.660" end="00:44:53.390" style="s2">co-operative meetings like the BC</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.190" end="00:44:54.620" style="s2">co-operative ones I&#39;m like and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.390" end="00:44:56.630" style="s2">producer one&#39;s like what are they even</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.620" end="00:44:57.950" style="s2">here for like I don&#39;t they&#39;re not I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.630" end="00:44:58.910" style="s2">don&#39;t care when I go to a grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.950" end="00:44:59.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t care that it&#39;s the dairy</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.910" end="00:45:02.330" style="s2">co-operative</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.950" end="00:45:03.770" style="s2">I care about mom-and-pop dairies a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.330" end="00:45:05.900" style="s2">mom-and-pop farms and I want to help</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.770" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">them but when you get together become a</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.900" end="00:45:18.080" style="s2">cooperative aren&#39;t you now just a new</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:20.660" style="s2">cool all right issues more production so</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.080" end="00:45:27.020" style="s2">the village okay so the village itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.660" end="00:45:29.360" style="s2">is producing goods that are being sold</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.020" end="00:45:30.950" style="s2">and those things sold the profit goes to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.360" end="00:45:36.710" style="s2">like the entire village is that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.950" end="00:45:38.090" style="s2">basic concept so it&#39;s like a that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.710" end="00:45:40.490" style="s2">kind of a new type of cooperative like</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.090" end="00:45:41.840" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a and yet not cuz like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:43.850" style="s2">the Amish the Hutterites</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.840" end="00:45:46.670" style="s2">all of them like already do that but</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.850" end="00:45:48.350" style="s2">it&#39;s not the it&#39;s dinner wouldn&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.670" end="00:45:50.570" style="s2">it a cooperative like that&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.350" end="00:45:53.150" style="s2">it&#39;s both been here since the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.570" end="00:45:54.740" style="s2">of time since we started having villages</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.150" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">and working together like every tribe</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.740" end="00:45:59.090" style="s2">ever was basically that right you work</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:05.770" style="s2">together to and you share in the balance</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.090" end="00:46:08.060" style="s2">you create together but yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.770" end="00:46:11.560" style="s2">an incubator of generative businesses</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.060" end="00:46:13.730" style="s2">holistic health generative agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.560" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely interested in hearing</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.730" end="00:46:18.940" style="s2">more because I have tons of questions on</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:18.940" style="s2">how that would how that would work</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.570" end="00:46:22.609" style="s2">incubator</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:24.470" style="s2">incubator for regenerative businesses</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.609" end="00:46:26.390" style="s2">because those that&#39;s important but like</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.470" end="00:46:27.589" style="s2">who who decides that what it is where</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.390" end="00:46:29.180" style="s2">does the funding come where it is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.589" end="00:46:30.890" style="s2">all the same issues were dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.180" end="00:46:33.710" style="s2">right here of like the tech cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.890" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">because my first iteration which was not</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.710" end="00:46:36.619" style="s2">a tech Robert and but it had tech in it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:38.930" style="s2">I was like we&#39;re gonna recreate the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.619" end="00:46:40.640" style="s2">entire means of production we were going</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.930" end="00:46:43.130" style="s2">to because a cooperative that&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:45.530" style="s2">for purpose instead of profit can take</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.130" end="00:46:47.630" style="s2">over every industry when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.530" end="00:46:49.640" style="s2">transparent and democratic where I get</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.630" end="00:46:51.260" style="s2">to choose whether or not I use it but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.640" end="00:46:53.450" style="s2">also get to have a say in what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.260" end="00:46:54.530" style="s2">better and help improve it then it</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.450" end="00:46:55.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter where it starts it</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.530" end="00:46:59.960" style="s2">generally becomes better than whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.970" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">is currently out there wasn&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.960" end="00:47:06.020" style="s2">that oh and then we went back to tech</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:08.119" style="s2">like I was like tech is where we start</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.020" end="00:47:11.180" style="s2">because you need the tech to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.119" end="00:47:13.640" style="s2">else and technology is already on me</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.180" end="00:47:15.920" style="s2">when like if you&#39;re creating tables and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.640" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">somebody comes to you and says I would</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.920" end="00:47:18.470" style="s2">love your table but I don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:20.150" style="s2">money to pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.470" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">there are ways you can help them right</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.150" end="00:47:23.900" style="s2">you can help them do the woodworking you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:27.859" style="s2">know they can trade labor for it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.900" end="00:47:30.530" style="s2">other issues or other solutions but</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.859" end="00:47:32.810" style="s2">there&#39;s still a cost to that table a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.530" end="00:47:34.220" style="s2">real cost that you know they have to put</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.810" end="00:47:36.230" style="s2">in or you someone else has to put in and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.220" end="00:47:38.180" style="s2">give it to them whereas the technology</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.230" end="00:47:39.890" style="s2">most of the cost comes at like third</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.180" end="00:47:42.080" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s ongoing costs like</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.890" end="00:47:43.970" style="s2">servers but it&#39;s on a per person thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.080" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like someone else coming on board</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.970" end="00:47:48.650" style="s2">might cost pennies but they generate</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:50.060" style="s2">dollars and they bring with them omni</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.650" end="00:47:51.530" style="s2">wind solutions they bring with them</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.060" end="00:47:53.990" style="s2">their purpose their passion their genius</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.530" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">their challenges their you know like</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.990" end="00:47:58.550" style="s2">they bring with them all of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">every new person that comes on board is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.550" end="00:48:02.750" style="s2">a win for everybody like right now our</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:05.170" style="s2">third person coming on board with</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.750" end="00:48:07.220" style="s2">Bentley and I will be like right now our</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.170" end="00:48:11.450" style="s2">used to be just me you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.220" end="00:48:13.580" style="s2">50/50 it&#39;ll be like 33 3333 it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.450" end="00:48:14.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not like real ownership where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.580" end="00:48:16.460" style="s2">like the next person comes on board</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.599" end="00:48:19.420" style="s2">brings it to 25 if that was actual</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.460" end="00:48:23.240" style="s2">ownership every person dilutes our</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.420" end="00:48:24.830" style="s2">potential but it&#39;s not that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.240" end="00:48:26.930" style="s2">the work that needs to get done a</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.830" end="00:48:28.910" style="s2">hundred percent Bentley and I okay well</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.930" end="00:48:30.470" style="s2">and we&#39;re never going to do 50/50 this</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.910" end="00:48:32.300" style="s2">is a thing that needs to have dozens</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.470" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">hundreds of people having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.300" end="00:48:35.570" style="s2">and there will naturally be people</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:40.130" style="s2">arise with you the 80 person the 20</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.570" end="00:48:41.900" style="s2">percentage of the 80% but more people</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.130" end="00:48:46.970" style="s2">coming on board doesn&#39;t cost us it gives</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.900" end="00:48:49.970" style="s2">to us and that&#39;s why it&#39;s great it does</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.970" end="00:48:51.620" style="s2">need to rebuild the entire system yes we</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.970" end="00:48:53.570" style="s2">do need to rebuild the entire entire</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.620" end="00:48:56.450" style="s2">system and yet it&#39;s that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.570" end="00:48:59.270" style="s2">colossal thing to do and so there had</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.450" end="00:49:01.940" style="s2">happened in my opinion it needs from the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.270" end="00:49:05.090" style="s2">individual themselves it has to be fun</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.940" end="00:49:06.800" style="s2">to do it has to give them something for</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.090" end="00:49:08.510" style="s2">me that&#39;s it being fun and easy because</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.800" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">if it&#39;s enjoyable and I&#39;m having a blast</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.510" end="00:49:12.500" style="s2">doing game B and doing all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:13.490" style="s2">even this where wooden Bentley was like</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.500" end="00:49:14.660" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna make it tomorrow I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.490" end="00:49:15.830" style="s2">like maybe we&#39;ll move it it was like</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.660" end="00:49:17.150" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t really work because you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.830" end="00:49:18.980" style="s2">want people knowing that we&#39;re at 11</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.150" end="00:49:21.560" style="s2">a.m. and I was hoping other people would</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.980" end="00:49:23.390" style="s2">come on board to be on video because</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.560" end="00:49:25.550" style="s2">that is what we&#39;re looking to do maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.390" end="00:49:27.350" style="s2">this forward is having guest speakers</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.550" end="00:49:29.840" style="s2">the one so like guest bored me members</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.350" end="00:49:32.900" style="s2">they aren&#39;t taking ownership they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.840" end="00:49:34.820" style="s2">need to take on 33% of the work and be</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.900" end="00:49:37.070" style="s2">the third board member they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.820" end="00:49:43.550" style="s2">offering their opinions and ideas during</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.070" end="00:49:45.790" style="s2">that conversation itself oh I&#39;m paying</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.550" end="00:49:48.110" style="s2">the price for talking for an hour later</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.790" end="00:49:54.290" style="s2">but sitting here in silence it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.110" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">gonna work so up so we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.290" end="00:50:01.190" style="s2">like what we&#39;re looking to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:04.160" style="s2">on a collaboration platform that is all</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.190" end="00:50:05.870" style="s2">and everything but there&#39;s only two of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.160" end="00:50:07.490" style="s2">us two people can&#39;t collaborate you</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.870" end="00:50:09.050" style="s2">don&#39;t a collaboration platform so we</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.490" end="00:50:11.180" style="s2">need more people to come and be part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.050" end="00:50:14.060" style="s2">the conversation to say what works for</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.180" end="00:50:17.630" style="s2">them in collaboration what like for me</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.060" end="00:50:19.190" style="s2">part of what I&#39;m working with is most of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.630" end="00:50:21.080" style="s2">my ideas most of this save-the-world</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.190" end="00:50:22.550" style="s2">cooperative stuff has been me alone in</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.080" end="00:50:24.620" style="s2">my bedroom coming up with stuff on paper</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.550" end="00:50:27.470" style="s2">because I enjoy it it&#39;s fun it&#39;s fun for</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.620" end="00:50:29.000" style="s2">me to do that nothing gets done there I</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.470" end="00:50:30.970" style="s2">have to be able to bring it out into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.000" end="00:50:35.090" style="s2">world for something to actually get done</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.970" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">and so now with the game be space I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.090" end="00:50:38.930" style="s2">like learning how to work in a group in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:40.190" style="s2">a different way where I&#39;m like I still</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.930" end="00:50:42.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to actually generate an</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.190" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">idea together I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.080" end="00:50:45.410" style="s2">conversation and I know how to generate</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:47.780" style="s2">90 go by myself but like any word that</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.410" end="00:50:51.470" style="s2">you kind of line up</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.780" end="00:50:52.700" style="s2">and and that&#39;s what kind of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.470" end="00:50:57.620" style="s2">leads to their and that&#39;s what the idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.700" end="00:50:59.480" style="s2">Cafe is one of the things that is an</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.620" end="00:51:03.770" style="s2">idea on how to do that and there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.480" end="00:51:05.180" style="s2">ways like the fishbowl that are it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.770" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">fishbowl dialogue circle which I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.180" end="00:51:08.780" style="s2">also liked it to talk about not right</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:10.460" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.780" end="00:51:15.110" style="s2">but there&#39;s different ways to have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.460" end="00:51:16.850" style="s2">conversation where the individual has is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.110" end="00:51:18.200" style="s2">able to be heard and less than two by a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.850" end="00:51:20.360" style="s2">small group of people because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.200" end="00:51:21.800" style="s2">do that in a large group but the larger</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.360" end="00:51:25.670" style="s2">group is having a conversation it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.800" end="00:51:27.650" style="s2">effective so we&#39;re talking you know in</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.670" end="00:51:30.200" style="s2">tiny groups about problem solving and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.650" end="00:51:33.620" style="s2">generating ideas and and what&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.200" end="00:51:36.320" style="s2">obstacle personally and collectively the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.620" end="00:51:37.940" style="s2">best ideas are able to be so be funneled</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.320" end="00:51:39.980" style="s2">up right and what up means I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.940" end="00:51:41.480" style="s2">if there&#39;s no hierarchy but that more of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.980" end="00:51:43.310" style="s2">us hear about it right so we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.480" end="00:51:46.100" style="s2">conversation with with just four of us</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.310" end="00:51:49.640" style="s2">and someone comes up with it with an</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.100" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">amazing idea how do how does it get out</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.640" end="00:51:53.690" style="s2">there and then later when we when</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:56.030" style="s2">someone did come up with amazing idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.690" end="00:51:58.370" style="s2">but it never got out there why didn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.030" end="00:52:01.760" style="s2">right so so there&#39;s a lot of times in</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.370" end="00:52:03.500" style="s2">history where like 9/11 happens and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.760" end="00:52:05.180" style="s2">there are people or let&#39;s not go back</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.500" end="00:52:06.320" style="s2">quite that far Trump got elected and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.180" end="00:52:08.030" style="s2">then there were people who are like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.320" end="00:52:09.380" style="s2">knew Trump was gonna get elected look</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.030" end="00:52:10.910" style="s2">like Michael Moore is like I told you</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.380" end="00:52:12.530" style="s2">guys we were like he&#39;s think he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.910" end="00:52:14.210" style="s2">Trump elected I&#39;m like that&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.530" end="00:52:17.750" style="s2">the same thing he just said he would get</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.210" end="00:52:20.210" style="s2">elected so there&#39;s the financial</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.750" end="00:52:21.470" style="s2">collapse and people who most economists</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.210" end="00:52:23.120" style="s2">aren&#39;t great at predicting what the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.470" end="00:52:25.640" style="s2">economy does cuz the economy is really</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.120" end="00:52:27.830" style="s2">complicated but there were some there</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.640" end="00:52:29.420" style="s2">were like look subprime mortgage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.830" end="00:52:31.550" style="s2">about to collapse they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.420" end="00:52:33.230" style="s2">necessarily going to be the next ones to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.550" end="00:52:35.060" style="s2">know the next thing is coming but</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.230" end="00:52:36.740" style="s2">they&#39;re better than the people who just</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.060" end="00:52:40.010" style="s2">thought it was gonna chug along fine and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.740" end="00:52:41.540" style="s2">so looking back at who did have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.010" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">that would have helped this and how I</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.540" end="00:52:45.740" style="s2">work there why wasn&#39;t their idea brought</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:47.360" style="s2">forward now if they just didn&#39;t say it</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.740" end="00:52:48.710" style="s2">then we need to ask well why didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.360" end="00:52:49.970" style="s2">say it at the time right like what would</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.710" end="00:52:51.800" style="s2">have made you feel more safe to say it</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.970" end="00:52:54.470" style="s2">as it was said and other people didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.800" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">hear it or didn&#39;t you know upload it why</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.470" end="00:52:59.270" style="s2">what was what was that part of it like</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.480" end="00:53:01.070" style="s2">we need to come up with a system to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.270" end="00:53:03.400" style="s2">able to work together on a massive</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.070" end="00:53:06.170" style="s2">ille to be able to understand the issues</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.400" end="00:53:08.360" style="s2">have access to the information we need</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.170" end="00:53:09.440" style="s2">to solve the problems even if the rest</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.360" end="00:53:10.910" style="s2">of the world doesn&#39;t care about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.440" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">information we want to access that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.910" end="00:53:13.970" style="s2">information so if we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:16.160" style="s2">climate change you want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.970" end="00:53:17.630" style="s2">understand the science and understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:19.310" style="s2">what is true and what is into where as</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.630" end="00:53:21.080" style="s2">carbon coming from and what other toxins</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.310" end="00:53:23.600" style="s2">are out there and what is what is their</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.080" end="00:53:25.340" style="s2">part in the ecosystem in a way we</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.600" end="00:53:27.260" style="s2">actually understand it not so</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.340" end="00:53:29.900" style="s2">climatologist can have this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.260" end="00:53:31.580" style="s2">but so climate deniers can have this</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.900" end="00:53:35.660" style="s2">conversation right like for that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.580" end="00:53:37.720" style="s2">specific category we would want climate</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.660" end="00:53:41.240" style="s2">deniers to be part of that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.720" end="00:53:42.860" style="s2">not let&#39;s debate the climate science but</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.240" end="00:53:44.180" style="s2">like what would we want to be answered</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.860" end="00:53:45.950" style="s2">what would it look like if humans were</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.180" end="00:53:47.330" style="s2">and conferred the cause of climate</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.950" end="00:53:49.550" style="s2">change would it look like if we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.330" end="00:53:51.230" style="s2">even if we aren&#39;t how do we best</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.550" end="00:53:53.330" style="s2">mitigate this right like having the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.230" end="00:53:54.620" style="s2">conversation without the debate like</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.330" end="00:53:56.380" style="s2">taking it away from the debate and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.620" end="00:53:58.970" style="s2">finding like right where&#39;s the science</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.380" end="00:54:01.520" style="s2">is there what is missing from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.970" end="00:54:02.990" style="s2">science what is every question we would</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:05.660" style="s2">want to answer an answer for climate</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.990" end="00:54:07.190" style="s2">change which ones have been answered who</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.660" end="00:54:11.090" style="s2">funded them why are they you know like</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.190" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">look at the actual actual bigger bigger</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.090" end="00:54:16.820" style="s2">picture of the question to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:18.620" style="s2">any of that we need to have our own</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.820" end="00:54:21.500" style="s2">collaboration platform we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.620" end="00:54:23.030" style="s2">able to look at who wants to be involved</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.500" end="00:54:23.900" style="s2">in this conversation do we have enough</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.030" end="00:54:25.490" style="s2">people to be involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.900" end="00:54:27.110" style="s2">conversation how do we run that</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.490" end="00:54:28.550" style="s2">conversation and that&#39;s where we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.110" end="00:54:29.900" style="s2">discussing climate change we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.550" end="00:54:31.070" style="s2">discussing food scarcity we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.900" end="00:54:33.200" style="s2">discussing those things or discussing</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.070" end="00:54:35.030" style="s2">how we break like how do you create the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.200" end="00:54:37.250" style="s2">thing that helps facilitate all of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.030" end="00:54:40.490" style="s2">so that when something happens like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.250" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">iran-us es that&#39;s going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.490" end="00:54:45.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like new war that&#39;s starting i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:47.300" style="s2">had like ten ideas between then and now</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.470" end="00:54:49.130" style="s2">and on things that could bring us closer</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.300" end="00:54:51.740" style="s2">together are any of them the answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.130" end="00:54:53.330" style="s2">maybe not but like if there was a space</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.740" end="00:54:55.490" style="s2">I could bring it to and all the people</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.330" end="00:54:57.260" style="s2">who care about that issue because based</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.490" end="00:54:59.360" style="s2">on social media nearly everyone cares</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.260" end="00:55:02.510" style="s2">about that issue even if it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.360" end="00:55:04.730" style="s2">way I agree with them they are care</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.510" end="00:55:06.650" style="s2">about it so to be able to say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.730" end="00:55:08.350" style="s2">how do we not have more it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.650" end="00:55:10.310" style="s2">conversation I want to have even if</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.350" end="00:55:13.460" style="s2">whatever the other side might want more</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.310" end="00:55:13.960" style="s2">um there is not like that is the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.460" end="00:55:16.630" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.960" end="00:55:19.480" style="s2">or you don&#39;t want more those to me are</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.630" end="00:55:21.550" style="s2">the sides not the argue every Iranian or</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.480" end="00:55:23.680" style="s2">America and it&#39;s like do you want words</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.550" end="00:55:24.849" style="s2">you know or and how can the people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.680" end="00:55:26.559" style="s2">don&#39;t want war how can we actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.849" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">facilitate when we have no power to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.559" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">actually stop war how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:32.020" style="s2">create the tools to be able to track the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:36.910" style="s2">money to be able to track the Killians</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.020" end="00:55:38.980" style="s2">to be able to see when it&#39;s true what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.910" end="00:55:42.250" style="s2">happening what is happening on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.980" end="00:55:44.140" style="s2">ground who&#39;s responsible it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.250" end="00:55:45.640" style="s2">Iranian people right it&#39;s not like they</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.140" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t get together and vote to bomb</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.640" end="00:55:50.200" style="s2">that airplane if they got bombed they</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:51.790" style="s2">didn&#39;t get together just like the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.200" end="00:55:54.490" style="s2">Americans didn&#39;t get together and vote</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.790" end="00:55:56.800" style="s2">to assassinate the guy writing like that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.490" end="00:55:59.230" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen but it&#39;s them who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.800" end="00:56:01.720" style="s2">pay the price it&#39;s like the American</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.230" end="00:56:03.490" style="s2">soldier and all of the Iranian people if</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.720" end="00:56:05.410" style="s2">they go to war and maybe the American</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.490" end="00:56:07.809" style="s2">public if things reach this far I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.410" end="00:56:10.839" style="s2">know there are four Canadians as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.809" end="00:56:12.849" style="s2">I don&#39;t want war I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.839" end="00:56:14.470" style="s2">solve it but there&#39;s this like</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.849" end="00:56:15.670" style="s2">underlining conversation that people</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.470" end="00:56:16.990" style="s2">don&#39;t eat it&#39;s like well we have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.670" end="00:56:19.059" style="s2">tackle climate change we have to go up</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.990" end="00:56:20.650" style="s2">straws we all have to it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.059" end="00:56:22.180" style="s2">not actually the solution the solution</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.650" end="00:56:24.460" style="s2">is meeting people where they are why are</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.180" end="00:56:26.470" style="s2">people using straws why are people using</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.460" end="00:56:28.660" style="s2">gee gocubs why are people doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.470" end="00:56:29.890" style="s2">then how do we recreate a lifestyle for</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.660" end="00:56:31.480" style="s2">them that they can feel good about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.890" end="00:56:32.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do that and meet them where they</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.480" end="00:56:35.170" style="s2">are like what would get you not to use a</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.920" end="00:56:38.109" style="s2">straw demanding everyone doesn&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.170" end="00:56:40.180" style="s2">straws as ablest as because people</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.109" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">need straws some people really need</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.180" end="00:56:44.380" style="s2">straws it&#39;s like well then you can use</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:46.089" style="s2">this kind ask them if they can use that</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.609" end="00:56:54.460" style="s2">one and help them create a solution it</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.000" end="00:56:57.339" style="s2">actually facilitates the like outcome of</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.460" end="00:56:58.869" style="s2">no more straws or no more useless</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.339" end="00:57:00.460" style="s2">because I don&#39;t want to stain my</p>

<p begin="01:02:17.740" end="01:02:21.640" style="s2">right like we&#39;re the ones steering eggs</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.630" end="01:02:23.140" style="s2">really ones on video showing up every</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.640" end="01:02:24.130" style="s2">week although there&#39;s people who are</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.140" end="01:02:28.390" style="s2">showing up in the comments every week</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.130" end="01:02:29.349" style="s2">and that as much appreciated and once</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.390" end="01:02:30.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a way for people to actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.349" end="01:02:32.410" style="s2">become members those people are full</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.880" end="01:02:34.210" style="s2">members you don&#39;t have to appear on</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.410" end="01:02:35.800" style="s2">camera in order to be to be a full</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.210" end="01:02:37.000" style="s2">member is that&#39;s not comfortable for</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.800" end="01:02:38.530" style="s2">everyone you do have to be a real person</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.000" end="01:02:39.849" style="s2">we have to figure that out right how do</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.530" end="01:02:41.800" style="s2">we know you&#39;re a real person and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.849" end="01:02:43.810" style="s2">have one account but which kids</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.800" end="01:02:47.950" style="s2">ironically figured out by a blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.810" end="01:02:50.050" style="s2">watching people do that oh um what is</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.950" end="01:02:53.410" style="s2">next is like we&#39;re meeting to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.050" end="01:02:55.690" style="s2">how we create a beta something that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.410" end="01:02:57.010" style="s2">useful that people want how do we fund</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.690" end="01:02:58.720" style="s2">it how do we do that right now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.010" end="01:03:01.480" style="s2">looking to create a platform that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.720" end="01:03:04.750" style="s2">the idea Cafe that&#39;s coordinating that</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.480" end="01:03:06.280" style="s2">it&#39;s coordinating he made a way to give</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.750" end="01:03:08.560" style="s2">it yeah and there will be we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.280" end="01:03:12.460" style="s2">looking we&#39;re talking about we just</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.560" end="01:03:13.960" style="s2">talked about it in the very brief board</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.460" end="01:03:16.900" style="s2">meeting that we had yesterday and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.960" end="01:03:18.339" style="s2">published to talk about this one if they</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.900" end="01:03:21.280" style="s2">have not showing up maybe like what do</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.339" end="01:03:23.290" style="s2">we do let&#39;s find other people and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.280" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">looking to get our project together tech</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.290" end="01:03:26.950" style="s2">on github then we need a hundred people</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:33.400" style="s2">to like it in order to be able to use</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.950" end="01:03:35.800" style="s2">their um program to or another person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.400" end="01:03:39.819" style="s2">program to probably knows the names of</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.800" end="01:03:42.069" style="s2">all these things to him and I can put</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.819" end="01:03:44.020" style="s2">money in and then collectively we decide</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.069" end="01:03:44.920" style="s2">where it goes right so if a third person</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.020" end="01:03:45.940" style="s2">comes on board they&#39;re also putting</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.920" end="01:03:47.920" style="s2">their money in then we&#39;re collectively</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.940" end="01:03:49.839" style="s2">just I know it goes so they have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.920" end="01:03:51.160" style="s2">software to be able to do that but never</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.839" end="01:03:54.220" style="s2">be able to use that software you have to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.160" end="01:03:57.060" style="s2">have an open-source technology ours is</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.220" end="01:03:59.470" style="s2">open source it&#39;s open everything um and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.060" end="01:04:00.550" style="s2">part of that is before they allow you to</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.470" end="01:04:01.869" style="s2">do that you need a hundred likes on</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.550" end="01:04:05.099" style="s2">github which means you be part of github</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.869" end="01:04:06.380" style="s2">and so we will need people to do that</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.099" end="01:04:08.870" style="s2">that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.380" end="01:04:10.700" style="s2">all end up talking about next week we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.870" end="01:04:12.980" style="s2">also looking to like I said change this</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.700" end="01:04:15.140" style="s2">to be a little less Bentley and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.980" end="01:04:16.520" style="s2">talking and a little more a third person</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.140" end="01:04:18.170" style="s2">coming and helping us problem-solve the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.520" end="01:04:21.470" style="s2">next the next one and that probably will</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.170" end="01:04:23.720" style="s2">mean we need to figure out what the like</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.470" end="01:04:25.250" style="s2">everything we need to solve to get that</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.720" end="01:04:27.260" style="s2">first project out there and then having</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.250" end="01:04:30.170" style="s2">people come and work on pieces of it for</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.260" end="01:04:33.100" style="s2">us right like the funding the legal the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.170" end="01:04:35.390" style="s2">whatever it is having guests that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.100" end="01:04:37.840" style="s2">willing to be part of it for that hour</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.390" end="01:04:41.210" style="s2">not taking on responsibility long term</p>
