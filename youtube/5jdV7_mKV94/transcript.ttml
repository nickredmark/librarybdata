<p begin="00:04:01.420" end="00:04:07.810" style="s2">book by writing horseshit for decades</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:10.150" style="s2">like everybody else that&#39;s what you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.810" end="00:04:12.010" style="s2">to do and I worked at it really hard I</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.150" end="00:04:17.950" style="s2">got up early every morning I wrote every</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.010" end="00:04:19.510" style="s2">day and then continued doing that for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.950" end="00:04:23.140" style="s2">years and years and years cranking out</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.510" end="00:04:25.300" style="s2">horse after horse and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.140" end="00:04:27.760" style="s2">book is the culmination of many years of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.300" end="00:04:30.220" style="s2">work it&#39;s an extremely short tight</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.760" end="00:04:33.790" style="s2">little book and it took me three years</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.220" end="00:04:36.850" style="s2">of intense writing to write know when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.790" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">wasn&#39;t writing it I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.850" end="00:04:43.510" style="s2">it I was failing to write it but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:45.970" style="s2">know the idea behind it in the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.510" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">behind it was big enough that I could</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.970" end="00:04:51.370" style="s2">never with all with all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:53.830" style="s2">self-hatred and self-doubt I could never</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.370" end="00:04:55.030" style="s2">doubt that the essential idea behind the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.830" end="00:04:57.480" style="s2">book was true and that the essential</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.030" end="00:05:01.150" style="s2">feeling behind the book was true and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.480" end="00:05:02.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a book about hating modern American</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.150" end="00:05:03.970" style="s2">life and being very frustrated with it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.890" end="00:05:06.100" style="s2">and wanting the world to be destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.970" end="00:05:11.260" style="s2">and I keep waking up and I keep feeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.100" end="00:05:13.930" style="s2">that way every day so so it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.260" end="00:05:15.940" style="s2">not some ephemeral idea that that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.930" end="00:05:17.530" style="s2">easily dismissed there was a real truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.940" end="00:05:20.170" style="s2">behind it that I sort of had to had to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.530" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">find right so look first of all the name</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.170" end="00:05:26.890" style="s2">of the book is finally some good news</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:30.970" style="s2">and on the cover of the book is a giant</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.750" end="00:15:28.550" style="s2">and I wanted to put it out on that date</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.440" end="00:15:39.500" style="s2">me probably a year and a half and by a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.029" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">year and a half that&#39;s like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.500" end="00:15:42.920" style="s2">month of a fitness start and then two</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:44.390" style="s2">months of like outlining and then going</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.920" end="00:15:45.829" style="s2">back and not winning again and then they</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.390" end="00:15:47.570" style="s2">are writing a draft in another draft and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.829" end="00:15:51.320" style="s2">I wrote like five five full light drafts</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.570" end="00:15:53.420" style="s2">and you know by the time you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.320" end="00:15:55.430" style="s2">end you&#39;re like I hate it I</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.420" end="00:15:57.649" style="s2">don&#39;t even want to read it ever again I</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.649" end="00:16:02.180" style="s2">done like there&#39;s parts of my book that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.899" end="00:16:03.380" style="s2">I wish that were better right like I</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.380" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">but you know you finally something you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.720" end="00:16:09.230" style="s2">just get to a point where you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:11.990" style="s2">good good is better than not finished</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.230" end="00:16:13.550" style="s2">and I just put it up there but you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.990" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">that creative hangover you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.550" end="00:16:17.180" style="s2">I mean I think about writing another</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.180" end="00:16:21.079" style="s2">think about writing another book if you</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.660" end="00:24:44.280" style="s2"> was before yeah and how did how did</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.540" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">and the reason I brought that up is</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.280" end="00:24:50.700" style="s2">because you know lot of people Bukowski</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:53.880" style="s2">especially it comes to mind immediately</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.700" end="00:24:56.790" style="s2">sort of glamorized their alcohol abuse</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.880" end="00:24:59.929" style="s2">and how it relates to their art did you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.790" end="00:25:03.300" style="s2">notice any difference in your production</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.929" end="00:25:06.990" style="s2">quality capabilities your output your</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.300" end="00:25:09.300" style="s2">outlook your prose anything like did you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.990" end="00:25:10.980" style="s2">write and get better yes so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.300" end="00:25:12.900" style="s2">I thought when I went to quit drinking I</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.980" end="00:25:14.250" style="s2">thought if my writing gets worse as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.900" end="00:25:17.220" style="s2">result of this I&#39;m going to just keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.250" end="00:25:19.230" style="s2">drinking aha and unfortunately the next</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.220" end="00:25:21.960" style="s2">day when I woke up after being sober I</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.230" end="00:25:23.429" style="s2">wrote and the prose was crisper than it</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.960" end="00:25:24.840" style="s2">had been that I was drunk and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.429" end="00:25:29.340" style="s2">when I knew that I was and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.840" end="00:25:31.290" style="s2">would have to stay sober well I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.340" end="00:25:33.179" style="s2">you know good for you I&#39;m making good</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.290" end="00:25:36.120" style="s2">choices I think that I remember Stephen</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.179" end="00:25:37.380" style="s2">King also said that he thought that he</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.120" end="00:25:38.850" style="s2">was writing better</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.380" end="00:25:41.640" style="s2">he was drunk but it turns out he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.850" end="00:25:44.550" style="s2">just drunk so I think you know for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.640" end="00:25:47.640" style="s2">personally I can&#39;t write if I feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.550" end="00:25:49.800" style="s2">if I feel hungover if I&#39;ve been didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.640" end="00:25:53.010" style="s2">get enough sleep it&#39;s like I have to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.800" end="00:25:55.560" style="s2">up early be fresh and my mind clear and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.010" end="00:25:58.440" style="s2">clean I&#39;ve never had any success with</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.560" end="00:26:01.260" style="s2">art under the influence and when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.440" end="00:26:03.990" style="s2">kid I used to DJ and you know we would</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.260" end="00:26:05.970" style="s2">do some things and and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.990" end="00:26:08.940" style="s2">maybe helped a little bit but probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.970" end="00:26:10.830" style="s2">not so that that&#39;s an interesting sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.940" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">of changed for you and then your</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.830" end="00:26:15.810" style="s2">productivity went up and you came out</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:17.640" style="s2">you know this book that really by all</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.020" end="00:26:30.990" style="s2">writing it&#39;s interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:32.940" style="s2">mentioned the fragility of your ability</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.990" end="00:26:34.560" style="s2">to write this is a problem that I have</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.940" end="00:26:38.010" style="s2">more with the time of day than anything</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.560" end="00:26:40.620" style="s2">else you know I had I had a rotten</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.010" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">infected cyst in my asshole</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.620" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">that&#39;s almost killed me and I was and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:47.670" style="s2">wrote the morning that I ended up having</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:51.060" style="s2">to go into the emergency room to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.670" end="00:26:52.830" style="s2">emergency ass surgery I was writing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.060" end="00:26:55.020" style="s2">I just had to stand up instead of sit</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.830" end="00:26:57.270" style="s2">down to write you can read there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.020" end="00:26:59.850" style="s2">think it&#39;s called ass part 4 on my blog</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.270" end="00:27:01.530" style="s2">and I&#39;m talking about how my asshole is</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.850" end="00:27:03.510" style="s2">feels like somebody stuck a bottle up</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.530" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">there and broke it and my balls felt</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.510" end="00:27:07.650" style="s2">like two doorknobs rattling together and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:10.290" style="s2">it was in I was in intense physical</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.650" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">agony but writing is the only way to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.290" end="00:27:14.190" style="s2">through it I think it&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:16.920" style="s2">that sort of makes the feelings real and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.190" end="00:27:17.400" style="s2">puts them outside yourself oh that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.920" end="00:27:21.720" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.400" end="00:27:23.250" style="s2">no God my writing certainly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.720" end="00:27:25.230" style="s2">think it was as good when I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.250" end="00:27:26.550" style="s2">up but I was more prolific when I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.230" end="00:27:31.050" style="s2"> up I think that&#39;s probably just</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.550" end="00:27:33.000" style="s2">because I had less standards about half</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.050" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">of everything that&#39;s on my blog was</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.000" end="00:27:36.900" style="s2">written when I was drunk</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:38.280" style="s2">even though really I was only drunk for</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.900" end="00:27:40.470" style="s2">a year and a half when I was writing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.280" end="00:27:43.290" style="s2">and then I&#39;ve done five years sober</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.470" end="00:27:44.400" style="s2">writing it I certainly wrote a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.290" end="00:27:46.210" style="s2">I was more willing to write about</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.400" end="00:27:47.860" style="s2">topical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.210" end="00:27:49.720" style="s2">more willing to try to go for a straight</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.860" end="00:27:51.519" style="s2">comedy stuff and then suddenly when I</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.720" end="00:27:54.330" style="s2">sobered up I got some hoity-toity</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.519" end="00:27:58.119" style="s2">standards that things need to have some</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.330" end="00:28:01.299" style="s2">some reason to exist yeah well you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.119" end="00:28:03.879" style="s2">I&#39;ve found that Twitter especially is is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.299" end="00:28:05.590" style="s2">a place where I get sort of my inspired</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.879" end="00:28:09.369" style="s2">writing you know the writing that just</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.590" end="00:28:11.169" style="s2">comes to me or cathartic writing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.369" end="00:28:13.269" style="s2">I&#39;ve really been taking advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.169" end="00:28:14.860" style="s2">sort of micro blogging feature on</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.269" end="00:28:17.259" style="s2">Twitter lately I&#39;m stringing together</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.860" end="00:28:19.409" style="s2">you know like 15 and 20 tweets at a time</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.259" end="00:28:21.249" style="s2">to do like a little short stories and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.409" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">those are the ones that are like</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.249" end="00:28:24.610" style="s2">emotional that are just like outpouring</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.200" end="00:28:28.629" style="s2">that probably would have gone in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.610" end="00:28:30.610" style="s2">journal you know ten years ago and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.629" end="00:28:31.929" style="s2">I found that the research in writing for</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.610" end="00:28:33.879" style="s2">the nonfiction that was much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.929" end="00:28:36.190" style="s2">mechanical man that was much more of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.879" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">process where it didn&#39;t matter if I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.190" end="00:28:40.389" style="s2">feeling inspired it didn&#39;t matter if I</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:42.850" style="s2">was needing to you know have a catharsis</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.389" end="00:28:45.700" style="s2">it just was like you got you got to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.850" end="00:28:47.830" style="s2">this thing done so you better just start</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.700" end="00:28:50.470" style="s2">cranking and cranking and I found a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.830" end="00:28:53.409" style="s2">little less joy in that process to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.470" end="00:28:55.330" style="s2">honest do you see is your personal</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.409" end="00:28:57.369" style="s2">reward any different between your sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.330" end="00:28:58.990" style="s2">of cathartic writing writing that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.369" end="00:29:00.429" style="s2">have to get out of you or writing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.990" end="00:29:02.350" style="s2">you&#39;re writing for a book that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.429" end="00:29:04.419" style="s2">hopefully gonna pay you or you know do</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.350" end="00:29:06.580" style="s2">you feel any differences there I never</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.419" end="00:29:08.470" style="s2">think about any of my writing paying me</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.580" end="00:29:09.519" style="s2">I assume that I&#39;ll never make a living</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.470" end="00:29:12.220" style="s2">from it and I&#39;ll never make any</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.519" end="00:29:14.369" style="s2">substantial money from it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.220" end="00:29:18.340" style="s2">that&#39;s not like a doom and gloom thing I</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.369" end="00:29:20.860" style="s2">I think that way because you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.340" end="00:29:23.080" style="s2">can&#39;t make it a workhorse you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.860" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">let it be a wild animal you can make</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.080" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">writing till the field you have to let</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:31.149" style="s2">it wander around in the woods eating and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:34.419" style="s2">killing and doing whatever it wants</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.149" end="00:29:35.830" style="s2">I can&#39;t also separate catharsis from</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.419" end="00:29:37.110" style="s2">mechanically writing the book because</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.830" end="00:29:39.669" style="s2">the book really was</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.110" end="00:29:41.499" style="s2">it had an emotion behind it and that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.669" end="00:29:44.169" style="s2">its reason for existing in every chapter</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.499" end="00:29:48.999" style="s2">related to that emotion in some way it</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.169" end="00:29:50.230" style="s2">was described well so the thesis of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.999" end="00:29:54.039" style="s2">book is that the world has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.230" end="00:29:56.169" style="s2">destroyed it&#39;s a reverse dystopian novel</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.039" end="00:29:58.029" style="s2">most most apocalyptic fiction and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.169" end="00:29:59.620" style="s2">is an apocalyptic book not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.029" end="00:30:02.820" style="s2">post-apocalyptic book you actually get</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.620" end="00:30:04.900" style="s2">to see the real apocalypse is about</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.820" end="00:30:07.480" style="s2">civilization collapses and then people</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.900" end="00:30:10.330" style="s2">are left in a dystopia so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.480" end="00:30:11.980" style="s2">implied our lives were great before when</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.330" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">we had running water and electricity and</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.370" end="00:37:31.130" style="s2">and I kept thinking if Ted Kaczynski</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:32.630" style="s2">could write a narrative ending he</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.130" end="00:37:36.140" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have had to blow people&#39;s hands</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.630" end="00:37:37.940" style="s2">off all right you know all right if his</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.140" end="00:37:39.470" style="s2">story if he&#39;d been a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.940" end="00:37:44.690" style="s2">better storyteller he wouldn&#39;t have had</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.470" end="00:37:47.240" style="s2">to hurt people when I read books fiction</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.690" end="00:37:50.090" style="s2">and then I hear people giving commentary</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.240" end="00:37:52.550" style="s2">and critique and they say oh well the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.090" end="00:37:53.990" style="s2">authors use of you know this bird in</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.550" end="00:37:56.570" style="s2">this situation is meant to represent</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.990" end="00:37:58.580" style="s2">blah blah blah and I always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.570" end="00:38:00.290" style="s2">thought that the artists just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.580" end="00:38:02.870" style="s2">wrote what they were thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.290" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">feeling without it being premeditated</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.870" end="00:38:09.860" style="s2">but you&#39;re telling me now that in your</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:11.870" style="s2">fiction book that that reads spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.860" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">which means it&#39;s you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.870" end="00:38:18.350" style="s2">masterfully was also premeditated and</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:21.980" style="s2">its symbolism was that right yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.350" end="00:38:23.390" style="s2">know I have bad memories of English</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.980" end="00:38:25.220" style="s2">class where they made us pick out all</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.390" end="00:38:27.050" style="s2">the symbols and books and it really</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.220" end="00:38:28.700" style="s2">ruins them so I&#39;m loathe to do that with</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.050" end="00:38:31.700" style="s2">my own book but yes everything is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.700" end="00:38:33.710" style="s2">absolutely premeditated and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.700" end="00:38:35.450" style="s2">work was burying it deep there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.710" end="00:38:37.670" style="s2">of setups and payoffs in it that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.450" end="00:38:38.900" style="s2">worked on Barry like you know the one I</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.670" end="00:38:40.370" style="s2">just mentioned in particular is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.900" end="00:38:43.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a dog that shows up in the first</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.370" end="00:38:47.270" style="s2">page never shows up again until the last</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.370" end="00:38:48.650" style="s2">page but I knew the entire you know when</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.270" end="00:38:52.700" style="s2">I wrote the beginning of the book I knew</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.650" end="00:38:53.990" style="s2">the ending and you know which isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.700" end="00:38:54.670" style="s2">say look there&#39;s a lot of birds in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.990" end="00:38:56.890" style="s2">book and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.670" end="00:39:01.120" style="s2">all of them are symbolic and Roman</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.890" end="00:39:03.460" style="s2">augury there is an L like really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.120" end="00:39:06.070" style="s2">don&#39;t look at it as a homework</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.460" end="00:39:07.330" style="s2">assignment let it wash over you but the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.070" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">birds in the end and particularly in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.330" end="00:39:12.340" style="s2">last chapter is called birds of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:14.380" style="s2">Amazon and and I&#39;m glad that you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.340" end="00:39:16.030" style="s2">thank you for the way you&#39;ve described</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.380" end="00:39:18.730" style="s2">it because then what you worry about is</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.030" end="00:39:20.010" style="s2">it being too heavy-handed and being too</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.730" end="00:39:23.620" style="s2">on-the-nose</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.010" end="00:39:25.870" style="s2">which it shouldn&#39;t be like things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.620" end="00:39:27.220" style="s2">you put in their images that you put in</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.870" end="00:39:29.650" style="s2">there that mean something should be</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.220" end="00:39:32.020" style="s2">absorbed by people&#39;s subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.650" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">instead of things that they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.020" end="00:39:36.970" style="s2">they have to academically track and pick</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:38.380" style="s2">out right then you know the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.970" end="00:39:40.660" style="s2">the book is told out of chronological</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.380" end="00:39:45.580" style="s2">time is to bury a lot of that stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.660" end="00:39:47.740" style="s2">to defuse it and you know you&#39;re meant</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.580" end="00:39:50.050" style="s2">to sort of let it wash over you</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.740" end="00:39:51.700" style="s2">right yeah so let&#39;s talk about one more</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.050" end="00:39:54.910" style="s2">piece of the technical aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.700" end="00:39:56.860" style="s2">book is the I didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t strike me</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.910" end="00:39:59.860" style="s2">as being sort of like out of I guess it</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.860" end="00:40:01.900" style="s2">is out of chronology but mainly I took</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.860" end="00:40:04.990" style="s2">away that there was like multiple</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.900" end="00:40:08.260" style="s2">timelines but they both were leading you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.990" end="00:40:10.410" style="s2">up to the conclusion so yes talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.260" end="00:40:12.940" style="s2">that because I mean I found that to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.410" end="00:40:14.980" style="s2">exceptional technique and craft</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.940" end="00:40:18.580" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve not been able to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.980" end="00:40:22.210" style="s2">even in my doodlings at home is is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.580" end="00:40:24.340" style="s2">create parallel nonlinear timelines but</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.210" end="00:40:25.750" style="s2">that are all on the same path leading</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.340" end="00:40:28.630" style="s2">you to the same sort of final</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.750" end="00:40:30.880" style="s2">destination yeah that was the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.630" end="00:40:32.200" style="s2">I worried about the most or one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.880" end="00:40:34.270" style="s2">things they&#39;re really worried about and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.200" end="00:40:37.570" style="s2">and again it brings me great relief</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.270" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">whenever people say that they understood</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.570" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">and appreciated it because if I it</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:44.500" style="s2">up this book would be but so</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:47.650" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s three timelines</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.500" end="00:40:49.300" style="s2">it&#39;s real complicated and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.650" end="00:40:52.090" style="s2">timelines were laid out this is another</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.300" end="00:40:53.740" style="s2">thing that I when I wasn&#39;t writing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.090" end="00:40:55.540" style="s2">book I was walking around on my lunch</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.740" end="00:40:57.160" style="s2">break like dictating into the notes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.540" end="00:40:59.110" style="s2">my phone like how these chapters might</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.160" end="00:41:01.450" style="s2">fit together there were certain beats I</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.110" end="00:41:02.920" style="s2">wanted ahead there are certain can you</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.450" end="00:41:04.600" style="s2">hear that siren in the background I</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.920" end="00:41:05.350" style="s2">can&#39;t but manages you know it&#39;s greedy</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.600" end="00:41:06.700" style="s2">dude really</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.350" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.700" end="00:41:11.740" style="s2">I&#39;m in the I&#39;m in the hood here</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:16.540" style="s2">so I bet that&#39;s the cut the cops on</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.740" end="00:41:20.260" style="s2">their way to pop the master criminals</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.540" end="00:41:22.630" style="s2">that live in this neighborhood you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.260" end="00:41:24.369" style="s2">the the real point of the chapters being</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.630" end="00:41:25.869" style="s2">told out of order is so that certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.369" end="00:41:29.859" style="s2">emotional beats can be next to each</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.869" end="00:41:31.570" style="s2">other so that you can contrast the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.859" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">intimacy that the two main characters</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.570" end="00:41:36.430" style="s2">experience with the distance that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:38.829" style="s2">experience and in you know so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.430" end="00:41:40.510" style="s2">they&#39;re really close after the bombs hit</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.829" end="00:41:42.010" style="s2">and they&#39;re really distant before the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.510" end="00:41:46.829" style="s2">bombs hit and those two those two</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.010" end="00:41:49.810" style="s2">moments are next to each other but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.829" end="00:41:54.070" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s three time lines in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.810" end="00:41:56.770" style="s2">book there&#39;s also there&#39;s also each time</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.070" end="00:41:59.349" style="s2">line has its own structure that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.770" end="00:42:01.420" style="s2">a different place so the first time line</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.349" end="00:42:03.460" style="s2">one kind of leads nowhere like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.420" end="00:42:05.099" style="s2">character doesn&#39;t experience any growth</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.460" end="00:42:08.589" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t experience any success</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.099" end="00:42:11.190" style="s2">timeline to almost gets there and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.589" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">he backs out and then time line three</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.190" end="00:42:14.829" style="s2">which chronologically happens at the end</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:18.700" style="s2">but which is peppered throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.829" end="00:42:21.369" style="s2">book is when he really experiences in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.700" end="00:42:25.569" style="s2">Hollywood character arc sense some kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.369" end="00:42:29.109" style="s2">of triumph and it&#39;s corny as hell to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.569" end="00:42:31.569" style="s2">all that but I really hope so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.109" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">so true though and it&#39;s so evident like</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.569" end="00:42:35.319" style="s2">I said the craft and the technique that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:37.510" style="s2">comes out in the book is so evident and</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.319" end="00:42:40.599" style="s2">the writing is so tight and there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.510" end="00:42:43.510" style="s2">there&#39;s not one superfluous word and all</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.599" end="00:42:44.650" style="s2">the copy anywhere and in fact there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.510" end="00:42:49.300" style="s2">some sentences that don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.650" end="00:42:51.790" style="s2">verbs that&#39;s really like my editing</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.300" end="00:42:55.540" style="s2">process is cut and cut and cut until I</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.790" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">can&#39;t cut any more yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.540" end="00:42:58.750" style="s2">reads better you know things just read</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">better that way people need to you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.750" end="00:43:02.859" style="s2">learning how to edit as the so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">the good news about writing right or for</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.859" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">me it&#39;s extremely hard for me to write a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:12.730" style="s2">good honest flowing first draft I will</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">do that once a month you can edit any</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.730" end="00:43:18.310" style="s2">time of day you can tell good prose any</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:20.320" style="s2">time of day so you don&#39;t have to be on</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.310" end="00:43:21.910" style="s2">to edit and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.320" end="00:43:23.320" style="s2">thank God for that if I had to be on to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.910" end="00:43:24.760" style="s2">edit you&#39;d be reading this book in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.320" end="00:43:27.640" style="s2">hundred years all right</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.760" end="00:43:29.320" style="s2">well and I think editing when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.640" end="00:43:31.090" style="s2">first learning how to write and people</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.320" end="00:43:32.500" style="s2">are telling you editing is so important</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.090" end="00:43:33.820" style="s2">to go to edit you got to edit you got it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.500" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">you&#39;re like what the I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.820" end="00:43:37.240" style="s2">write what are you talking about I want</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:39.700" style="s2">to edit and it seems like the mundane</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.240" end="00:43:41.980" style="s2">the mundane bit of the writing process</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.700" end="00:43:44.140" style="s2">but I think really that&#39;s where the gold</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.980" end="00:43:46.210" style="s2">is in the editing and the paring down</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.140" end="00:43:48.370" style="s2">and the owning of it all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.210" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">just it&#39;s essential and you can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.370" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">can tell when people don&#39;t special</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:56.110" style="s2">editing their work whereas yours is just</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.160" end="00:43:58.750" style="s2">like punches to the face like every</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.110" end="00:44:02.830" style="s2">sentence and you know I remember reading</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.750" end="00:44:05.020" style="s2">a short story that you did where the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.830" end="00:44:06.970" style="s2">character was a man and a woman and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.020" end="00:44:08.500" style="s2">the guy had like I think it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.970" end="00:44:10.360" style="s2">fantasy right and he had looked up his</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.500" end="00:44:11.890" style="s2">old flame on Facebook or something there</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.360" end="00:44:14.680" style="s2">and then they magically like get</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.890" end="00:44:16.690" style="s2">together and then at the very end like</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.680" end="00:44:17.950" style="s2">she like turns into I don&#39;t know some</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.690" end="00:44:21.340" style="s2">sort of monster or something and kills</p>

<p begin="00:44:21.340" end="00:44:24.940" style="s2">don&#39;t know about you but I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.380" end="00:44:26.620" style="s2">piece was sort of like a turning point</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.940" end="00:44:29.410" style="s2">and when I had been reading for me like</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.620" end="00:44:31.210" style="s2">that stuff was so punchy and so clear</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.410" end="00:44:33.670" style="s2">and the turns and the payoffs are so</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.210" end="00:44:36.190" style="s2">great it felt like you have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.670" end="00:44:38.920" style="s2">elevated with that one and then I think</p>

<p begin="01:02:43.710" end="01:02:49.140" style="s2">you buy my book I make five bucks and if</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:50.520" style="s2">I had a publisher I would make 4% of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.140" end="01:02:52.559" style="s2">cover price which I don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.520" end="01:02:55.500" style="s2">is but it&#39;s a lot less than five bucks</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.559" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">but also what publishers want is</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.500" end="01:02:59.160" style="s2">somebody that can promote themselves</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:01.170" style="s2">they want you to be your own marketing</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.160" end="01:03:03.510" style="s2">department so what what the do I</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.170" end="01:03:07.589" style="s2">need you for right what are you why do</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.510" end="01:03:09.329" style="s2">you exist then um right unless unless</p>

<p begin="01:03:09.329" end="01:03:14.010" style="s2">you want they want to promote which</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.670" end="01:03:16.430" style="s2">means they&#39;re already famous there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.010" end="01:03:19.619" style="s2">there&#39;s really very little payoff to it</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.430" end="01:03:20.970" style="s2">tell the other thing is especially so I</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.619" end="01:03:24.510" style="s2">really only have three things</p>

<p begin="01:03:30.750" end="01:03:35.340" style="s2">things need to exist for their own sake</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.520" end="01:03:37.320" style="s2">and not as a promotional tool Twitter is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.340" end="01:03:40.470" style="s2">a place to post stupid pictures and have</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.320" end="01:03:43.140" style="s2">fun if I didn&#39;t enjoy it I wouldn&#39;t do</p>

<p begin="01:06:31.490" end="01:06:36.980" style="s2">whereas I thought that part of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:40.460" style="s2">liberal revolution in the eighties you</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.980" end="01:06:43.579" style="s2">know 60 70s and 80s was about opening up</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.460" end="01:06:45.140" style="s2">our norms and allowing people to be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.579" end="01:06:47.089" style="s2">little bit more free with their</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.140" end="01:06:50.119" style="s2">sexuality and the things that they do</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.089" end="01:06:51.440" style="s2">but in fact there and this is a great</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.119" end="01:06:54.290" style="s2">segue to one of the last things what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.440" end="01:06:56.420" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s it but in fact what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.290" end="01:06:58.550" style="s2">happened is people can write about sex</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.420" end="01:07:02.420" style="s2">even less people can talk about sex even</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.550" end="01:07:03.619" style="s2">less and I&#39;m I think it&#39;s also sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.420" end="01:07:05.990" style="s2">dovetailing with private sexual</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.619" end="01:07:07.910" style="s2">practices that are even maybe crazier</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.990" end="01:07:09.710" style="s2">than they were in the past but yet you</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.910" end="01:07:11.089" style="s2">can&#39;t talk about it and if you do write</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.710" end="01:07:14.300" style="s2">about it somehow you&#39;re diminished</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.089" end="01:07:16.640" style="s2">professionally or you know I always joke</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.300" end="01:07:18.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like what why is writing about sex</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.640" end="01:07:21.589" style="s2">like somehow less professional then</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.980" end="01:07:24.500" style="s2">writing about like local news stories</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.589" end="01:07:26.900" style="s2">like I don&#39;t understand the comparison</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.500" end="01:07:29.810" style="s2">there and I&#39;ve read I&#39;ve read many</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.900" end="01:07:31.970" style="s2">articles recently that say men can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.810" end="01:07:35.180" style="s2">write about sex anymore how me too</p>

<p begin="01:07:37.040" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2">writing about sex and it just you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.450" end="01:07:41.960" style="s2">my first instinct is that&#39;s complete</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:44.300" style="s2">horseshit cuz I know guys that are doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.960" end="01:07:45.800" style="s2">it but what what&#39;s your take on that</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.300" end="01:07:46.910" style="s2">what&#39;s your take about our current</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.800" end="01:07:50.180" style="s2">culture and the way it</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.910" end="01:07:51.829" style="s2">lates to writing sex writing men writing</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.180" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">about sex men being honest about their</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.829" end="01:07:57.710" style="s2">experiences as men and putting that out</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:59.900" style="s2">there rather than wrapping it in some</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.710" end="01:08:02.720" style="s2">sort of politically correct packaging in</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.900" end="01:08:04.970" style="s2">order to assuage the you know the PC</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.720" end="01:08:08.450" style="s2">monsters and the me to maniacs out there</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.970" end="01:08:11.720" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting when you say men</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.450" end="01:08:13.490" style="s2">writing about sex you I think I take it</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.720" end="01:08:14.930" style="s2">to me and you talk men writing about</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.490" end="01:08:17.600" style="s2">being horny that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.930" end="01:08:20.359" style="s2">that I do a lot is writing about just</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.600" end="01:08:23.029" style="s2">the insane intensity of the state of</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.359" end="01:08:25.609" style="s2">horniness and the the things that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.029" end="01:08:29.509" style="s2">get horny for for instance young teen</p>

<p begin="01:08:34.759" end="01:08:40.850" style="s2">question that you asked my take on this</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.980" end="01:08:42.560" style="s2">topic is there&#39;s no difference in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.850" end="01:08:43.819" style="s2">law the government is not going to throw</p>
