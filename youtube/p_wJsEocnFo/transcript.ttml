<p begin="00:00:08.480" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">welcome back to the dark horse podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.880" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">live stream</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:17.440" style="s2">q a number 36.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:19.520" style="s2">before we get going i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.440" end="00:00:22.240" style="s2">since we did not cover it in the main</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.520" end="00:00:23.920" style="s2">podcast we need to show you a brief clip</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.240" end="00:00:27.519" style="s2">from beirut this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.920" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">uh a spectacular event that has taken</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.519" end="00:00:30.600" style="s2">place there this morning zach would you</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:33.729" style="s2">put it up</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.600" end="00:00:33.729" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.960" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">all right so there&#39;s a lot of footage of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.600" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">it as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:54.559" style="s2">fact that there was an initial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">which had a lot of cameras pointed in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.559" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">the direction of the billowing smoke and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.719" end="00:01:01.280" style="s2">the gigantic explosion i see indications</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.280" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">that the culprit may have been 2700</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">tons of ammonium nitrate that had come</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">in on a ship into the port</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">and had been moved into warehouses there</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">so this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">very similar stuff that was used to blow</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">up the murrow federal building</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">by timothy mcveigh many years ago that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">was apparently</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.680" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">two tons i don&#39;t understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">just said you you say</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:29.119" style="s2">what you&#39;re seeing suggests that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">was an accident or intentional</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.119" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">well let&#39;s put it this way i believe</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">what we you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">early reports are always wrong and these</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">are still early reports</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">but it looks like there was a large</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">shipment of ammonium</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.280" style="s2">nitrate that was brought into the port</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.280" end="00:01:48.079" style="s2">normal purposes and uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">could somebody have set it off could</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:51.520" style="s2">somebody have shipped it knowing that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">would make the port vulnerable who&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.520" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">but let&#39;s just say they&#39;re um the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">indications so far</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to suggest that they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">suggest a massive amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">uh explosive material and uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m just not tracking the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">reports so far don&#39;t seem to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">that it was intentional that it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2">intentional okay yeah so anyway can</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">always change</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">but um anyway a terrible tragedy that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">has happened there</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">um and it is clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">from the video that a huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">buildings were just simply</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">obliterated so how many people were in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:29.599" style="s2">its path is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">very hard to say at this point but um</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a certainly a very dramatic event</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">wonder why anybody would allow massive</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">shipments</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">of uh materials that are this explosive</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">um because the danger is is obvious yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">that&#39;s terrifying all right um on to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">q a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">all right we&#39;re gonna start with three</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">questions from episode 35</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">that we did not get to and that were</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">interesting uh first one is</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">first one is there&#39;s a dog in the room</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">uh hi i&#39;m a big fan what was the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">of the evolutionary process to have an</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:05.120" style="s2">appendix why is it not an essential</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">organ anymore</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.120" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">and i wanted to pose this question</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">because uh it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">it is something that we have addressed</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">directly in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">in the first of our health and medicine</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">chapters in the book that we are writing</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">that will be out next year</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know if we want to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.159" style="s2">anything more than that right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">well i do want to say at least one thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.159" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">okay um which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">it was obvious that the story that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">appendix</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">was a vestigial organ of no value was</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">wrong right what the appendix does is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">more interesting question than that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:41.599" style="s2">but anyway years ago i generated a test</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">to counteract the argument</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.599" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">that in order to establish that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">something was a product of adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:48.799" style="s2">you needed to demonstrate that there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">genetic variability and that the genes</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.799" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">that encode the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">out compete genes that don&#39;t this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">nonsense logically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">if a trait is complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">if it is expensive and if it persists</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">over evolutionary time</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">it is telling you that it is doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">something positive</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">for the creature and the appendix always</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:10.159" style="s2">passed this test so i always wondered</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.159" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">um in more recent times it has become</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">clear what exactly the appendix does but</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">the important part of the story there</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">there is a leading hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not wholly</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">demonstrated so i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that i would say that it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not so sure about that i believe it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">demonstrated maybe not sufficiently that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">it rules out the possibility of another</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">but it has withstood a substantial test</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">um and what what i think is most</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:44.639" style="s2">important to realize though</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">is that a story that never made any</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.639" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">and didn&#39;t match the uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">the ancestral data floated for</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">years on the basis that people could</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">remember it and it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">you know logical enough to people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">weren&#39;t very good at thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">and that that is a cautionary tale</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">because you know you can make the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">for example for religion that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">massively expensive</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">phenomenon that persists over</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">evolutionary time and has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">complexity to it</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">and people are still telling us that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a mind virus and other such</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">things so the belief that something is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">uh expensive and persistent and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:27.039" style="s2">noticed by evolution even though there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">an obvious way</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">to save should attract our attention and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">in the case of the appendix</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not even just the expense of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">organ which is presumably small</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">not negligible but small but the cost of</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">one right i know numerous people in my</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">direct sphere who have had an</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">appendicitis and presumably</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">most or all of them would have died from</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:54.160" style="s2">appendicitis</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">if not for medical intervention and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.160" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">that says is that the fitness cost of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">having such</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">uh a an organ is potentially very large</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">but here&#39;s here&#39;s the teaser so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">not gonna we&#39;re not gonna go into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">whole story right now the teaser is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">consider what about so the appendix is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">part of our gi tract our</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">gastrointestinal tract so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">consider in our gi tract is what takes</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:19.840" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">our our food and converts it into</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.840" end="00:06:23.120" style="s2">nutrients that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">and allows us to get rid of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.120" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">that we can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">so what looking at our diet would be an</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">a good place to start to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">have our diets changed obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">from those of our even just</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">pre-industrial ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">that question is relevant especially in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">light of the finding which probably many</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">which is that the rate of appendicitis</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">is incredibly high among post-industrial</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">people that much we do know brett just</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">mentioned that he&#39;s known several people</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">extreme bouts of appendicitis including</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">your dad um</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">yes yes um</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">but uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">yeah i suppose that&#39;s true um but what</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">what is true what is more interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">that pre-industrial people</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">have almost no rates of appendicitis so</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:16.680" style="s2">it is this is something that has changed</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.680" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">industrialization of our food almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">certainly and in fact what you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">leading hypothesis for</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">uh what it has has changed and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">what the function the appendix is</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">is consistent with this understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">that this is about hyper novelty of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">very modern human condition that has</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">turned an organ that actually was quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">important uh into one that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">apparently more of a hazard than a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">benefit so</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">it has increased the hazard and other</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">features of the modern environment have</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">reduced the value</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">to near zero for modern people um so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">sure we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">no we can do it okay i thought you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to so um</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">let&#39;s just say the leading hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:03.800" style="s2">is that the appendix preserves a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">an isolate of the community of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.800" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">microorganisms</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">in your gut that aid</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">in the extraction of nutrients from food</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">that this process means that when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">are infected by some competing uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.280" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">microorganism and your you have uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">chemical warfare going on biological</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">warfare going on in your gut</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">and you potentially lose your gut flora</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">to diarrhea then this isolate</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">that is basically in a little pouch that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">sticks off of your intestine</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">this isolate can then repopulate your</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">gut very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">with um gut flora for which you are well</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">adapted</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">so that you can immediately go back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">extracting the nutrients from food</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">in a very efficient way it&#39;s your body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">probiotic source</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s your body&#39;s probiotic source</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">maintained right where it needs to be in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">condition where it can be preserved</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:07.839" style="s2">a gastrointestinal infection</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">and i would just last thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.839" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">reason that you can eliminate it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">apparently suffer no harm</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">is that you have so much extra food you</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">don&#39;t need to be efficient at extracting</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">resources now it may be bad for you what</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">you are repopulated with</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">may not be very good for you in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">the community of microorganisms and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">may</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">suffer all sorts of gastrointestinal</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">problems that put you on things like</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">proton pump inhibitors that increase</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">your risk of covid for instance just to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">go back to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">for example for example but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">in the modern environment no guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">that you&#39;re current while you&#39;re healthy</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">gut flora are the right ones for you</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">either hence these fecal transplants</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">that people</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">have so so two just two two more things</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:46.399" style="s2">on this i mean there&#39;s this goes in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">lot of different interesting directions</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.399" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">one of the other predictions of of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">you just said is that whereas</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">uh pre-industrial people who are still</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">alive today don&#39;t tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">appendicitis at all another prediction</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">of the model that brett just laid out is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">that they will have much higher rates of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">diarrhea of incidence of diarrhea</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">um that you know are common enough that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t really think about it that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">much whereas</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">you know it&#39;s rare enough for sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">weird you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.560" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">western educated industrialized rich</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">democratic uh country inhabitants</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">uh to have that they can go like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">that was like six months ago it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">of ugly right</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">um whereas um pre-industrial people tend</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">to have it more often</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">and the idea there is that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">repopulation of the effectively</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">probiotic</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">gut bacteria would be a more of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">regular and necessary part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">a functional gi tract for such people</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">who are regularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">losing all of their good bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">through these</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:45.440" style="s2">to these diary incidents the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">is that the appendix is not just in</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.440" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">across mammals there&#39;s a very sort of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">looks almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">chaotic if you just map the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">of appendix and also the cecum which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">another out pouching of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">digestive tract onto the mammalian tree</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">it should it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s popping on and popping off</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:05.279" style="s2">like evolving and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">disappearing lots and lots of times um</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.279" end="00:11:08.800" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">it it tracks interestingly with diet</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.800" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">and so this is again sort of supporting</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.440" style="s2">evidence that this is about</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:16.959" style="s2">changes in diet that have rendered this</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.959" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">not not only not useful but actually a</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">hazard</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">yes and um the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">explanation that it was vestigial the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">wrong explanation which we should have</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">spotted from the very beginning and some</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">of us did i mean i always knew the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">appendix was going to turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">useful but um</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">the the wrong explanation was that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">was a cecum</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">that was being eliminated by selection</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">now cecum is a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:47.760" style="s2">digesting cellulose it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">pouch that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">allows so no mammal can digest cellulose</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">but you can have microorganisms that do</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">the digesting for you in fact i think no</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">complex animal can digest cellulose</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">even termites have microorganisms i</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">think that&#39;s right that allow them to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">it yeah and so the point is you need a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">plastic</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">being wood um so you need</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">a place for the microorganisms that can</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.959" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">digest cellulose so</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">this is so interesting cellulose is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:15.760" style="s2">actually the mirror image of a molecule</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">that we actually very easily digest but</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.760" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t have an enzyme that deals</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">with the flip side and it&#39;s apparently</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">very what&#39;s what&#39;s the mirror image</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s um relevant here no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">stark</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">um and so those are those are cis trans</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">versions of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">i believe so really so the um</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">in order to digest the cellulose you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">microorganisms that have an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:41.360" style="s2">history that allows them to digest</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">cellulose</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">you need a place for those creatures to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:45.279" style="s2">live so even termites have a place for</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.279" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">creatures to live in their gut and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:53.360" style="s2">thing in mammals is a cecum</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">but the explanation that our um appendix</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.360" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">a cecum that is vestigial and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">receding and disappearing over time</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">have the evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:05.760" style="s2">an ancestor that digested cellulose and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:07.519" style="s2">needed a cecum</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.760" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">and so the point is you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">superficially it makes sense but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">that mapped that hypothesis onto a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">phylogenetic tree of our closest</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">relatives and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">falsified like that&#39;s all you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:18.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s just not a match for our</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.839" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">yep all right</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">schoolyard&#39;s sing-song element to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">protest chants bothers me</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">have you seen this nanonan or tone</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">before in protests of the past</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.680" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">seems new to me um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:37.040" style="s2">awful and not just i mean nano nano is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.040" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">sing-song isn&#39;t even quite right because</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">it&#39;s so nasal and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">off-key it&#39;s unmusical it&#39;s anti-it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">really bad now i agree it suggested</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">something has gone so seriously</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">awry um that it&#39;s just not even able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">put together</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">you know even the briefest of repeating</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">melodies and it just sounds sick</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">it makes you long for the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">hey hey ho ho</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">i i find it hard to long for that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:11.120" style="s2">complexity having had</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">my name chanted hey hey how brett</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">weinstein&#39;s got to go</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">yeah um and you know i&#39;m in fact when i</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">now hear that chant repurposed for other</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.320" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.320" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">i i just wonder about the noun they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.320" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">put in they wonder about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">whatever it was yeah um but yeah i do</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">this this seems particularly off-key</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">nasal</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:36.079" style="s2">um yeah neener neater as a nano</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">yes as you say and it does it just</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:40.399" style="s2">sounds</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">it sounds unwell it sounds sick yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">the fact that you know they would</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">trying to win hearts and minds so</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">it would be a priority to put together</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">something musical and compelling and all</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">and the inability to do it suggests just</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">another place</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">in which the people who are telling us</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">they know how to rebuild civilization</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">into a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">beautiful utopia really don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">know they don&#39;t they don&#39;t even</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">one from episode 35 is more of a comment</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">than a question but it might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">worth us commenting on this comment the</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">in some contexts tends to be that or</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">i won&#39;t even say it tends to be there</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">but it tends to include that</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think the truth is</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">is that you know the truth is</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.079" style="s2">how does it relate to concepts like</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.079" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">or the comment on the last stream that</p>

<p begin="00:17:14.160" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">effectively creates two mothers one of</p>

<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">successful in the usual genetic standard</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">yeah well i think very frequently we um</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">we lose track of the essential element</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">that we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">um that we should be tracking for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">given purpose so for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:37.440" style="s2">when people say oh uh that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">you know his biological child or</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">something like that when somebody has</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">been adopted</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">my sense is no</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">a father for example who raises a child</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">has tremendous influence in a most</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">biological fashion</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">you have to understand that culture is</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">biology every bit as much as genes</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">so it is fair to say that somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:00.880" style="s2">not someone&#39;s genetic child</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">but it is wrong to say that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">somebody&#39;s biological child</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">and to say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">it happens we don&#39;t have any adopted</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">children but if</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">uh you know if if we did and that child</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:15.440" style="s2">said well that&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">uh that&#39;s not my real father right no</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.440" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">your real father is actually much</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">more the person who raised you than it</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">is the person who donated the genes for</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">one thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">the genes uh aren&#39;t all that variable in</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:27.080" style="s2">interesting ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">what you learn from your father is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.080" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">tremendously variable and so the point</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">we should be tracking the important part</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">donated eggs you know you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.720" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">from evolution&#39;s perspective it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">genetic lineage that matters</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">from the perspective of the human stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">important right it is certainly going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:55.200" style="s2">the person who raises the offspring and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.200" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">the question is for what purpose right</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">there&#39;s also i mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:03.360" style="s2">it it further splits up you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">adoption is something that&#39;s been around</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">at least thousands of years and probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">millions actually because we see</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">uh we see children being adopted</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">by um other mothers who are at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">appropriate developmental stage with</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">their own children in</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">in chimps and bonobos i believe yep um</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">but typically by relatives</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">typically by relatives yes um</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:28.960" style="s2">if uh you know if if their mother dies</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">right only only under duress</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">um but this idea of egg donation does</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">does partition this even more you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">you do have even more impact on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">child&#39;s development</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not your genes that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">know even if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">um contribute either of the gametes to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">the child but if you carried that child</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">in in your womb for nine months that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">a it&#39;s a lot of input um that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">environmental input</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">um that uh that you would not have</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">otherwise so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">um you know so it&#39;s it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.559" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">impacting that child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:08.720" style="s2">life um from an even earlier stage than</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">you do when you adopt a child</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.720" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">at birth yep um</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">it also is the case that in uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">in an implanted egg i mean for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">a woman can</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">preserve eggs and then have them</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">fertilized and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:27.039" style="s2">and reintroduced later in her life but</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">this also introduces a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.039" end="00:20:29.679" style="s2">uncertainty of maternity</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">that&#39;s previously this is in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.679" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">question it&#39;s never been an issue for</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">females so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">the basic answer is look this has every</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">impact on</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">the genetic thing which is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">evolution in the narrow sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">cares about it is not at all what we</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">should care about</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">and therefore there&#39;s a question of can</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">we track the parameters that matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">most like what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.159" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">human will be created how uh capable</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">fulfilled yeah decent will they be but i</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">mean we still</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">so much of society is still around</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">basically issues of certainty fraternity</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">whether or not people know that sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.760" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">right like people don&#39;t like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">about it and want to pretend it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">true but</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">the fact that certainly paternity has</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:12.159" style="s2">driven uh mating systems and social</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">systems and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">and all civilizations uh forever uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change just because we should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">focusing on the other stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">the idea of introducing this new</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">uh this certainty of maternity um is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">a very interesting question although i</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">really except i mean i just i&#39;m not too</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">familiar</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:33.280" style="s2">with all of the sort of reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">assisted technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">and the ways that they they they get</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:39.120" style="s2">used but</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">often i would think um that really you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.120" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">you just have certainty of non-maternity</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:46.159" style="s2">really like if you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">if you are a woman who can carry a child</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">and desperately wants a child and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">um you just your eggs can&#39;t do it um you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">simply know that the child that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">carrying doesn&#39;t have your genetics but</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">everything else you know you know you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">still know you&#39;ve given birth to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">child and that child is</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:03.280" style="s2">is yours from from day one it just</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen to have your genes</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.280" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">so so there&#39;s you&#39;re you&#39;re flipping a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">switch but you haven&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">increased</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">um uncertainty any you just have gone</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:13.919" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m certain i am the genetic mother</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.919" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">too i&#39;m certain i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">right unless you&#39;re donating eggs to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:22.320" style="s2">yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">um yeah so like so for this like</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">i i&#39;m i know my eggs are good now and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">i&#39;m hoping for a moment ten years in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:31.039" style="s2">future or something okay right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">um but you know what you have is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.039" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">mismatch between</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">the genetic reality about which i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:38.000" style="s2">arguing you should care very little</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">and the realities that matter about</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">which you should care in proportion to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">they matter and i think heather&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">here which</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">i agree with is that it doesn&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t matter any less important</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">to the motivational structure that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">have inherited</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">but that motivational structure will</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">interface with</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">um the realities that you actually care</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">about arbitrarily so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">in some sense it&#39;s the same puzzle as</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">for people who are young</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">and fertile sex is fun because of its</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:14.559" style="s2">reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">potential at the point you interfere</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">with its reproductive potential</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">with birth control it is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">the fun does not correlate with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">increase in reproductive success that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">likely to accompany</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">that behavior and yet it doesn&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">less fun so</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">yeah um in some sense do you care that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">you know that the fun was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">because you were gambling you were</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:38.400" style="s2">playing baby roulette or</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">no i think that&#39;s actually maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.400" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">most relevant thing here because</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">actually since there is exactly no</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">of uncertainty of maternity in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">mammalian lineage</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">uh the fact that we&#39;ve now introduced</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">uncertainty or certainty of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">non-maternity</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">is so new that it&#39;s equivalent to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">messing with the psychology with regard</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">to birth control which is to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">not insignificant but it has no</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">evolutionary history yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">yeah now i should point out that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:02.799" style="s2">uncertainty of maternity is very</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.799" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">than just being unsure of your mom</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">because mom says some crazy stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">sometimes you just find yourself unsure</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">of your mom and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">did zack pay you to say that i wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">this was a first for me clearly a sign</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">of my privilege has cancer degendered me</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">since my breasts ovaries and uterus were</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">removed</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">oh boy yeah so sorry that a community</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">cleanup event which should have been all</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">hands on deck let&#39;s do the work turned</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:20.960" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">an excuse for political one up</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2">upsmanship</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">and uh no cancer did not degender you it</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">took away some of your anatomy and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">but that didn&#39;t change anything about</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.000" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">long developmental history and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">endocrinological history</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">and uh you know just everything in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">that made you female yeah you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">female just as much as you were um</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">with or without those those parts</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">absolutely so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">um earlier you described the difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">between activation</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">i did organizational effects you might</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">briefly say something here oh yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a model in endocrinology that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">is is pretty good it&#39;s probably a little</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">bit too simplistic but uh which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">uh speaking to the ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">that hormones affect uh the body and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">and they&#39;re being broadly speaking two</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">categories activational and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">organizational effects</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">and so uh in early development</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">when um testosterone gets starts getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">produced</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">uh for males you get a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">organizational effects of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">testosterone that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">uh render the brain masculinized</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">and during puberty uh you get the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">secondary</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t you get not just the primary</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">sex characteristics but the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">sex characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">that are organizational effects of those</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">hormones which</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">require that early effect</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">of the testosterone but do not require</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">that there be ongoing testosterone once</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">the development of that particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">is over</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">compare that to activational effects</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">which basically turn on</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">when you&#39;ve got the trigger be it</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">testosterone estrogen serotonin whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">and turn off when you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">trigger and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">you know for instance all of this um</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">argument about like you know should</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">trans women be able to play against</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">women in</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">sports well all we have to do is make</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">sure their testosterone is low</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">no this is misunderstanding what</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">hormones do it&#39;s amazing imagining that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">all hormonal effects are activational</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">as opposed to organizational and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">fact is the vast majority of hormonal</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:30.799" style="s2">effects</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">in mammals are organizational that</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.799" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">unless you can go back in time you get a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">time travel</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">back to fertilization and turn off all</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.919" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">yeah um but yes to your point about math</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">absolutely it helps you learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">think it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just math or</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">mouth sake so you know when the kid</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:57.840" style="s2">who&#39;s being taught by a terrible math</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">teacher says what is this good for when</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.840" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">will i ever use this</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">uh it trains your brain to do logic and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">to do nuance</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">and to see pattern and to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">it is that you can recognize when the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">pattern you think you see isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">pattern but it&#39;s actually noise</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">that&#39;s some of what math is good for</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">okay so we have three questions uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">written by someone who i think&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">language is russian and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.799" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">i think this uh between that and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">character limit they&#39;re a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">hard to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">interpret so i&#39;m going to read all three</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">of them and see if we can get something</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:33.440" style="s2">juicy out of this okay um on brain and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">coevolution markov proposed that brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:39.919" style="s2">size decrease in homo sapiens is linked</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">to culture emerging and helping to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.919" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">well smartphones outsource of brain</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">and actually that one is separate from</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">the next two so i think we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">to this one say um homo</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">is not experiencing a brain size</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">decrease i thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">okay there&#39;s one place where we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">relative to neanderthals there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">loss of a lobe and we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">um much about what it is but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">but of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">we&#39;re not using the paleontological</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">species concept right like neanderthals</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t precede us we didn&#39;t all evolve</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">from neanderthals</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">people of european descent have a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">bit of neanderthal genealogy</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">in us um but um</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:25.520" style="s2">but for the most part neanderthals is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:28.559" style="s2">branch off of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.520" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">the the homo sapiens lineage</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.559" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">and um really we see over you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">within mammals</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">an increase in brain size um to body</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">size ratio</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">within primates we see that accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:42.399" style="s2">within apes we see that accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">and within the hominid lineage within</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">the oscillopithecine and homo lineage</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">um specifically we see brain size to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">body size</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">increasing and specifically these ripple</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">cortex increasing relative to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">the size of the rest of the brain but</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">that question was rephrased within</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">rather than in within which would be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">of a reduction that&#39;s the only one that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">i know</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">of right i mean neanderthals a is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">different species and it&#39;s a branch</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">um so i don&#39;t know that we i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">there&#39;s still something interesting here</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">but i just wanted to make sure that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:17.279" style="s2">like that we see</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">other than neanderthals appear not sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.279" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">about the additional lobe in</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:22.799" style="s2">neanderthals i don&#39;t know this</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">yeah um because that would be a totally</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.799" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">i guess it would be a different lobe</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">within the cerebral cortex so without</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">the telomere</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not a hemisphere just a particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">globe and we know</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">obviously because we don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">neanderthal brains to look at all we</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">know is</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">the volume um but</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">it is pretty likely that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">reasons that homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">out competed neanderthals was</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">plasticity and it may have had to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">with the degree i</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">have never believed that neanderthals</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">did not have language</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">they pretty clearly must have but they</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">had reduced capacity to transmit</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">abstract ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">using language and so um it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">it is true that basically a sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">exporting of certain functions to other</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">brains or other mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">would potentially decrease the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">space necessary and there&#39;s intense</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">pressure to make the brain no bigger</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.240" style="s2">than needed because big brains are</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.240" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">they&#39;re expensive to run and uh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">expensive to build</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">so so yes uh that is likely</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">uh and i thought that i would uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">take this opportunity to give a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">recommendation on a novel</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">uh which is william golding who is most</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">famous for lord of the flies</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">wrote a book called the inheritors in</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">life in a band of neanderthals and he</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">imagines them if i remember correctly</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">without language</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:58.399" style="s2">we actually read it in a program i</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:01.600" style="s2">taught with a linguist</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.399" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">it was her suggestion that we that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.600" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2">turn this way because we&#39;ve got noise on</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">our driveway now um</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">we it&#39;s really it&#39;s quite it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">and really gives some insight uh in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">narrative form to what it might have</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.840" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">been like to live</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">as an alternative form of hominid some</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">some tens of thousands of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">cool i don&#39;t remember he doesn&#39;t specify</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:25.519" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">anyway okay um so the next two questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">from the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">same person um i&#39;ll read them as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:32.000" style="s2">written let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">try to make sense of them here could you</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">please describe your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:37.840" style="s2">how the propaganda could be handled</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">social media filter bubble youtube etc</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.840" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">assigns opinions to people critical</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:45.039" style="s2">thinking is rare</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">also with regard to brain and talent um</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.039" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">is it nature versus nurture or</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">uh brain intelligence defines success</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">and the invisible inequality</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">that couldn&#39;t be changed and three uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a great idea about poor communities</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">with a broken culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">how do you see the way out</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">all kinds of social and canine canine</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">chaos here</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">yeah um so i would just say</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">a few things one i believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">we are struggling and to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">successful at figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.079" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">navigate a world of garbage including</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:23.599" style="s2">propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:24.960" style="s2">propaganda being intentional garbage</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.599" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">rather than noise</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.960" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">um but then in some sense that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">yeah in some sense you know idw and all</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">look and function like it you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">long-form podcasting</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:41.919" style="s2">and the like are experiments in this and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.919" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t want to reduce it too</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">much because</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">you know the magic is what it is for</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">whatever reason you&#39;re tuning in but</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">why are you tuning in right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">hearing people talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:55.200" style="s2">you know off the cuff about things those</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">people have</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.200" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">some level of expertise they have some</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">track record at being able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">you know guess what&#39;s interesting what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">important what can be discounted</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">able to look at a story and say actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">that claim is suspect and here&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s really odd that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">would want to tune into</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">a conversation between people that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">never met on the other hand it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">that really the game is about you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">terrible at self-promotion</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">i must say so bad but it&#39;s actually part</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">of why people trust me</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">i just suck at it why are you here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">well why are you here but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">thing if you&#39;re if the question</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">really was look all there was is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">conversations between people</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">and your ability to figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">true is a question</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">of how good is your discernment and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">which conversations</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">tend to be at least more informative</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:53.280" style="s2">than they are misleading maybe most</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:54.240" style="s2">conversations are more misleading than</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.280" end="00:35:55.599" style="s2">informative so</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.240" end="00:35:57.040" style="s2">there&#39;s some small subset of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:35:58.320" style="s2">conversations that are more informative</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">than misleading and then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.320" end="00:36:00.880" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">which one&#39;s a good return on your</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.880" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">investment of time</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:07.200" style="s2">and thought energy right and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">there&#39;s some pinnacle of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">and then there&#39;s things below it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">then there&#39;s the question about</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not an absolute value because</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a question of what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">right it may be you know there may be</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">discussions that are really high quality</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">on topics that wouldn&#39;t be that much</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">used to you to know about</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">so anyway you&#39;re you&#39;re choosing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">invest your time</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">tuning into a conversation and the who</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">you tune into</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">because of how it plays out you know i</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">mean for me what i would do is</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">i tune into a conversation and then i</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">how it tracks what later turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">judgeable as to whether or not it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">accurate and important</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">and see which conversations proved to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">predictive you know it&#39;s sort of loosely</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:53.839" style="s2">so what&#39;s the solution to propaganda is</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">a system in which those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.839" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">that tend to be insightful about</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:59.520" style="s2">important things</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:01.440" style="s2">over time the conversations that prove</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">out are the ones that peop more people</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">tune into and then what does that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">develop into</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">its collective sense making right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">this is part of why</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">the joe rogan sam harris universe</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">of podcasts is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">important and and controversial force</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">that it is is that in some sense it has</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">that even though it makes mistakes just</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">like everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">over time it turns out that people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">tune into those discussions</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:33.119" style="s2">have ended up enlightened relative to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">those who have tuned into the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.119" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">which is really low quality and um</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">so something like that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:44.079" style="s2">good trim that was the next part but i</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">think you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.079" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">yeah um yeah one more thing on the brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">talent nature versus nurture thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">the thing to know about humans is you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">been told nature versus nurture is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">dichotomy and it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s always both however what</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">you haven&#39;t been told</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">is that human beings are the most</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:04.079" style="s2">nurture based creature of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">any that has ever existed on planet</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.079" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">earth we are not a blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">but we are the blankest slate and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">that fact of us being the blanket slate</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">and the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">why would the creature that dominates</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:18.400" style="s2">every uh productive habitat on earth</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">also be the most nurture based that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">the key to understanding what human</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:27.040" style="s2">um are and uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">so in any case um it&#39;s not nature versus</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">nurture but</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">these talents are housed in a brain that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">largely un or i don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">largely unwired but more unwired at</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">and that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:25.520" style="s2">not a resolution to the problem that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">are having there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.520" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">many people who have found ways to deal</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.800" style="s2">with the modern condition which is so</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">unlike any condition that humans have</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">that requires some modernity such that</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.599" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">exactly the thing that you have clued</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:43.359" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">to deal with modernity can itself be</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">by modern decision making and that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">awful and i don&#39;t know what the answer</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">to address that particular conundrum</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">that many people find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">in is well this is a very jarring</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">question because of course um</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">the idea of self-harm here is both easy</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">to understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">and such a dire and one-way choice</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">um i would say there has got to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">and this is something we&#39;ve been on</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">about for months now</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:20.200" style="s2">our failure to understand that there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.200" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">idiosyncrasies about our situation that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">work against us</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">and there are others that work for us</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">and we are not leveraging the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">for us so that we can afford to borrow</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">more where</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:35.119" style="s2">we are more constrained and so i would</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">say look</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.119" end="00:40:39.760" style="s2">surely surely there is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">reformulate what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.760" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">in jiu-jitsu so it can be done outside</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">during the day uv light maybe it has to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">done with a mask i don&#39;t know frankly if</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.800" style="s2">that&#39;s possible impossible</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">imaginable not imaginable i know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">feel very good about riding a bike with</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">a mask but i see people doing it</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">yeah so i know it&#39;s not impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:02.319" style="s2">but is there a way</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">or you know could you have a jiu jitsu</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.319" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">of people who um are hyper vigilant</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">about protecting themselves get a test</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">be hyper vigilant about isolation</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">and participate in a community a jiu</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:17.760" style="s2">jitsu community that has very low risk</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">of carrying any kovid through the door</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.760" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">right and then could you then do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">outside something like that when</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">you know presuming you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.160" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">northern hemisphere which most people</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">at the point that it is no longer sunny</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">out you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:31.599" style="s2">i mentioned a long time ago i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">heard anybody respond to it but</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">you know couldn&#39;t we have light bulbs</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">that put out uv</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">light when nobody&#39;s in the room right</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">couldn&#39;t we have like self-purifying</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">rooms</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">in which you know these risks were</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">reduced yeah can what can you do with</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">air circulation</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">right the way we circulate air currently</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">may make things worse but</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">really there is a way to circulate air</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">that would make them</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">better and you know look you&#39;re spelling</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">out just how</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.359" style="s2">dire the problem actually is it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.359" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">question this is something built into</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">you your core</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">and you need it and we all have those</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">things and i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s so key</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not an aesthetic question and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">depending on which side you know which</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">camp you&#39;ve decided which tribe you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:17.760" style="s2">decided to belong to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">you will have become accustomed to being</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.760" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">mocked by the other side for something</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">on the basis that this is just your</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">preference and this is just an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">that may not be the word that they use</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s um it&#39;s dehumanizing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">disrespectful</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">and downright mean and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">that um most of us who are functional</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">have one or a few things that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">really need to do in order to continue</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">to feel like</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">at least one of those things is being</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">seriously curtailed by this series of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">events that we&#39;re living through right</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">and that is it makes it no easier at all</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">for the individual to know that the</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">to some degree is going through</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.560" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">something similar but it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">um yeah i think the last thing to say is</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">initially this was much less prevalent</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.680" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">which is ever more likely it has all</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.040" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">kinds of implications for what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">programmed to do and what it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">incompetent at doing and the more</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">frivolously we treat this</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">the more tricks that it cannot currently</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">do that it will learn and i worry that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">one of these things</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">is um that the tendency for it to infect</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">children at a greater rate which we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">now seeing these reports</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">that this is a trick that it has now</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:39.280" style="s2">learned on top of what it knew when it</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:40.560" style="s2">jumped oceans and we should treat this</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.280" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">stuff much more carefully</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">it probably doesn&#39;t transmit very much</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.960" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">outdoors during the day at this point</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:48.480" style="s2">we should preserve that because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">godsend right</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.480" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">we should preserve that at all costs the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">last thing you want is for it to figure</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">out how to transmit itself outdoors so</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">there&#39;s nowhere to go at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:59.599" style="s2">we have a vast landscape of places</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">outdoors that you can go in reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.599" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">safety</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:06.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s uh to be cherished</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">that&#39;s right uh what what time are we at</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.400" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">zach</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">okay uh that&#39;s sort of what i was</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">worried about you&#39;re gonna say let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">two more here and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">skip to the next livestream okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">are you familiar with the research</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">pointing toward memory engrams being</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.520" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">carried by rna</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">i imagine this must be a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">transfer of fitness needs</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">it must also impact society and its</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">evolution with each generation</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">potentially reinforcing that memorial</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">lineage</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:36.319" style="s2">might maybe tendency of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">insanity skips generations</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.319" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">like schizophrenia um i</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.400" end="00:45:45.359" style="s2">want to proceed with great caution about</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">the idea of engrams being transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.359" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">in or on the genome um</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve seen just a very little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">this in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:55.440" style="s2">um it did not strike me as particularly</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:57.440" style="s2">compelling but i have not run into it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.440" end="00:45:59.200" style="s2">lately so i have very little</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.440" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">that said lots of things do travel on</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:04.960" style="s2">the genome that transmit things between</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">generations and this says unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.960" end="00:46:08.319" style="s2">because it is the most interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:10.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">surprising result in molecular</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.800" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">epigenetics</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">it has sucked up a lot of the attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">which has robbed</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">epigenetics of at least in the popular</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">conception</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">uh its proper understanding as the key</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">to creating an organism from a genome</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">that is shared between all of its cells</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:30.640" style="s2">so anyway i&#39;ll just put a placeholder</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">there we can talk more about that some</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.640" end="00:46:34.079" style="s2">other time</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:34.800" style="s2">all right okay one more question here uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.079" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:37.839" style="s2">go to the next live stream i&#39;m one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">those conservatives you mentioned in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.839" end="00:46:40.319" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">question how much do you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.319" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">demographic change and diversity</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">plays a part in the issues we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure i understand the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">well uh i think what it part of what it</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">is uh is their uh legitimate grievance</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">that has been</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">uh at a level in the population has been</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">low enough that people weren&#39;t voicing</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">and as as america at least becomes even</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">less homogeneous than it</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">was which you know it never was all</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">white</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">but um but white people certainly had</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">the vast majority of the power</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">for for a long time um as</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">as it becomes less so does that change</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">uh what&#39;s possible in the sort of policy</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">and activism realms that&#39;s how i read</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:30.800" style="s2">the question it&#39;s certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">demographic</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.800" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">tipping point um part of the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">that not only is there a tipping point</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">that is to say people who have</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">been or have felt disempowered or</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">suddenly recognizing that their numbers</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">carry potential political power if they</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">will wield it but</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">their tendency to do so along something</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">like racial lines</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">then causes people who have largely</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:58.160" style="s2">forgotten about their interest to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:48:00.559" style="s2">well-being along racial lines it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.160" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">to drive them into doing so</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.559" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">so i&#39;ve called this the speak of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">devil problem where</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:10.319" style="s2">by accusing civilization of being white</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">supremacists where it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.319" end="00:48:13.359" style="s2">you will cause white supremacy to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:15.119" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.359" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">whites will be forced to look at their</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.119" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">interests as a racial group because</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">they&#39;re being challenged as a racial</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">group so that&#39;s a very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">property and we ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">incredibly cautious about it um</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">yeah all right let&#39;s get through as many</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">of these</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">so often it&#39;s too good to skip an</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">episode but you stream faster than i can</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">watch</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">we probably will uh roll back to once a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">week at some point</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">um but at the moment at the moment this</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">cut back to once every half week</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">good wow we do need that crickets</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">cricket</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">wow so the final part of that like</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">having more skin service to make vitamin</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">d and high latitudes</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">of course goes exactly opposite the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:49.599" style="s2">usual explanation for why</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">uh historically ancestrally uh high</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.599" end="00:49:53.040" style="s2">latitude people</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:54.559" style="s2">tend to be more sphere-like because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.040" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">closer you are to sphere</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.559" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">the lower you basically lower your</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">surface area to volume ratio and so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:03.440" style="s2">lose heat less</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">um less quickly so um while i</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.440" end="00:50:06.640" style="s2">i like that as a hypothesis it</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">definitely does</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.640" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">remind me of the kind of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">adaptive arm waving</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">that people in our field are often</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">accused of doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">right um i think it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">that because um</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">obviously becoming taller um and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:22.559" style="s2">typically lean they&#39;re increasing their</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">serious volume ratio making them more</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">likely to um</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">lose extremities to frostbite or just</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">die of hypothermia more generally so</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:30.880" style="s2">so you know is it is it just sexual</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:33.440" style="s2">selection is</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.880" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">it warrior-ness what what else might</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.440" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">explain the height and i&#39;m going to go</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">ahead and call them the</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">uh dortec and nudge people because</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">that&#39;s how i misread it the first time</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">i have uh i have not seen this question</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">before but i have what i would call a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">out of the money hypothesis here which</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">very unlikely to be true but big payoff</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">if it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">all right do it um one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">will notice one of the things i always</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.240" style="s2">relearn when it becomes biking season</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">again after</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">you know after winter yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:07.520" style="s2">is that i have forgotten how to dress</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">for it and actually the same thing maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.520" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">in reverse as uh bad weather sets in</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.280" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a tendency to try to dress for</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">the weather as you leave your door</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">but if you dress for the weather and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">leave your door then you quickly</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">overheat given</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:25.520" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re wearing to uh keep you</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">to dry and you and you mock me for this</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.520" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">okay at the top of the hill you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.480" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">have to take off your scarf</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">at the top of the next until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">gonna take off your jacket but here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">point anyway go on</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">in the summer you&#39;re closer to naked</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:35.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:37.760" style="s2">and the thing is you have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.680" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">fantastically complex system</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.760" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">for maintaining a very narrow range of</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">body temperatures</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">that involves capillary beds that can</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">open up to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">get rid of heat really quickly or close</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:49.839" style="s2">down to preserve heat right</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s all happening all over your</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.839" end="00:51:53.119" style="s2">body with different extremities that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">function as radiators and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.119" end="00:51:55.119" style="s2">complex system</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:57.200" style="s2">that you don&#39;t need to know anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.119" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">about and it works beautifully up to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:51:59.280" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:01.040" style="s2">right there&#39;s a point at which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.280" end="00:52:02.319" style="s2">creating more heat than you can shed</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.040" end="00:52:03.839" style="s2">and then you&#39;re at risk of heat stroke</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:04.319" style="s2">but that point is pretty freaking far</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.839" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.319" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">right you can do a lot of stuff on a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:11.119" style="s2">very hot day and not get heat stroke</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">so if you&#39;ve got some basic level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">fitness</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">yeah with with some basic level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">fitness</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">your body can keep you in that range and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">what you don&#39;t appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:24.079" style="s2">is how active a process that is of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">shedding heat and preserving heat in</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.079" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">order to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">ranges that are really tightly</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">constrained because they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">because every enzyme in your body is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:33.520" style="s2">actually dependent on that range in</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">order to even work very well so</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">total collapse comes if you get too far</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">outside of this range and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">this automatic system that does it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">you put on a sweater worse</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">a jacket worse a jacket that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">breathe and the point is that internal</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">system is still trying to do what it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:50.880" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">but it runs into something it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">control right so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">it&#39;ll you know if you start to heat up</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">in your jacket as you&#39;re biking</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">in you know uh in december</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:05.119" style="s2">your uh body will react as if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">naked and it will</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.119" end="00:53:12.400" style="s2">flush your radiators your back and your</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">limbs with um with blood in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.400" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">shed the heat that you&#39;re building up</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">but if anything it&#39;s shedding inside of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">the jacket isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">shed it builds up right the way warmth</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">does in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">in a wetsuit and so the point is you</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">very quickly get to a point where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">just building up heat and you can&#39;t shed</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">it because something you&#39;ve put between</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">you and the world is interfering with</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">the natural processes</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:37.280" style="s2">that allow this thing um to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">work and so deep out of the money</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.280" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:41.920" style="s2">why are they so tall in scandinavia</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.400" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">right so here&#39;s the question what if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.920" end="00:53:45.280" style="s2">had an ancestral</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">population that instead of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">position of facing winter and having to</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">relearn how to dress for it</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:52.400" style="s2">was actually kind of built for this</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">process where it did</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.400" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">wear these external things and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">the internal bodily processes</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">have to be able to shed heat through</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:03.920" style="s2">whatever it is that you tend to wear</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">over your surface and that that process</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.920" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">has been coordinated and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">we tend to think people who live closer</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">to the arctic circle</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">will be rounder in order to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.119" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">heat because losing heat is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">that threatens them</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:21.359" style="s2">but if you are a more technological</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:23.920" style="s2">population where you are operating</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.359" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">very regularly in these circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.920" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">where you are interfering with</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.079" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">uh freezing by putting layers over you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">you might actually want an</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">increased capacity to radiate basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:36.880" style="s2">you know the person isn&#39;t the system the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:39.440" style="s2">person plus</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.880" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">the clothing plus the food used to fuel</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.440" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2">the organism is the system</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">and that in fact you would get a body</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.000" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">form that looked more like a kenyan</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">um because the sum total of the system</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">would work better again very unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:52.799" style="s2">this is true so the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:54:54.319" style="s2">is scandinavians are tall because</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.799" end="00:54:55.359" style="s2">clothing and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.319" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.359" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">caricature but that&#39;s it that&#39;s it in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:04.319" style="s2">but the prediction then is uh for</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">uh nearby but more southerly populations</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.319" end="00:55:07.200" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">germans and french and such who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.200" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">as tall on average that</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:12.319" style="s2">at the same moment when the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:14.480" style="s2">scandinavians were becoming tall</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:16.799" style="s2">that the more southerly populations had</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">less clothing technology</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">um i think the way i would say it</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">actually the comparison</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:26.559" style="s2">population i would do is something like</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">arctic people like inuits versus</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.559" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">i&#39;d rather i&#39;d rather it be shared you</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">most recent common ancestor that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">really close yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">well any of these things work to test it</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:40.000" style="s2">but the real question i would say</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">is the combination of</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.000" end="00:55:45.599" style="s2">agriculture that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">releases the limit on food supply in</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.599" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">other words</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">for people who are hunting marine</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">mammals for example there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">limit on the amount of calories that can</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:56.319" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.680" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">acquired and so the preservation of heat</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.319" end="00:56:02.079" style="s2">is the higher priority</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.079" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">in so because obviously you know arctic</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:09.280" style="s2">peoples have</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">clothing that preserves heat um but</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.280" end="00:56:13.280" style="s2">the question is you&#39;ve got several</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:15.599" style="s2">parameters in the model how expensive</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">is the material that you burn to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:20.799" style="s2">heat that is to say how scarce is food</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a question about what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.799" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">technology you have for preserving heat</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">technologically that is to say clothing</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got what is your</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.400" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">internal structure going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:34.240" style="s2">tend to radiate versus preserve and how</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">much flexibility is and i guess what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.240" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">arguing is</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">you get the flexibility from the lanky</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:40.000" style="s2">body body form</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:41.760" style="s2">if you have the clothing and the food</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.000" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">supply to take to</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.760" end="00:56:45.280" style="s2">suffer the cost so i&#39;d like to see both</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">comparisons um and we&#39;d have to know</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.280" end="00:56:48.240" style="s2">when we&#39;re comparing two but both you</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.119" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">know same latitude</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.240" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">uh different different continents and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:53.200" style="s2">most recent common ancestor that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.200" end="00:56:57.359" style="s2">at least 15 probably close to 25 000</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.359" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">between scandinavians and uh inuit say</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">yep um well i know it might be closer</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:06.799" style="s2">actually because they were a later</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">movement into the new world um than the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.799" end="00:57:10.640" style="s2">original americans</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">um and then i but i&#39;d be even more</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">interested to see the comparison</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:17.680" style="s2">um within european populations</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">because it does seem that at least we</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.680" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">all have in our head that scandinavians</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:24.240" style="s2">um taller than the sort of central</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">western europeans</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">and uh i i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see this quite</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">working out but it&#39;s about it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">clothing and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">um lack of caloric deficit so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.760" end="00:57:35.920" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:37.680" style="s2">you&#39;re the addition to the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.920" end="00:57:38.400" style="s2">not just clothing it&#39;s lack of caloric</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:41.040" style="s2">deficit</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:42.319" style="s2">um and with that with regard to compared</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.040" end="00:57:44.160" style="s2">to the arctic i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.319" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">what was uh implied in what you said is</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.160" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">basically that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">jet stream renders the same latitude in</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.280" end="00:57:53.119" style="s2">much more fruitful with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">possibility of agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.119" end="00:57:56.000" style="s2">uh at least you know it&#39;s a very short</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:57.440" style="s2">growing season but there is a growing</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.000" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">season whereas there&#39;s nothing you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.440" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">the inuit are not</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">eating any plant-based food really</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">except what they pull from the sea</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:05.359" style="s2">right i&#39;m sure there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">of very very gathering</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.359" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">stuff but they&#39;re not i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">they&#39;re engaging in agriculture yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">um so i just say final thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">is the way to test hypotheses like this</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">are to look for transitions</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:21.119" style="s2">in space or in time that would tell you</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:23.280" style="s2">you know the height that you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.119" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">for that&#39;s surprising where does it stop</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.280" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">and is the transition at that place</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:30.480" style="s2">how food is produced what clothing is</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.640" end="00:58:32.160" style="s2">worn that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.480" end="00:58:34.000" style="s2">yeah and you can see the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.160" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2">time progresses</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.000" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">okay the next uh question seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">about woodchucks</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">specifically how much wood would a</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:42.160" style="s2">woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">ancestors had not recit</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">oh boy let me start again how much wood</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:48.160" style="s2">would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:49.520" style="s2">ancestors had not resided with it in an</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.160" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">environment where chucking wood would</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.520" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">have converted an increased propensity</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">to thrive and leave offspring</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:56.480" style="s2">zero that&#39;s the militant moderate again</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">i think that</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.480" end="00:58:59.680" style="s2">am i right that i understood that and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">that the answer is i was reading and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.680" end="00:59:04.880" style="s2">did not understand the question</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">wow right zero and i believe such a</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.880" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">woodchuck would chuck no wood</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">and woodchucks do chuck no wood</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2">because woodchucks are marmots yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:19.520" style="s2">yep so but beaver doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:21.040" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.520" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s what it means right</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:23.520" style="s2">so is it possible that beaver that</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">woodchucks</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:26.799" style="s2">and beavers were ever the same i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.680" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.799" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">genetically i mean these are not sirens</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">no no that&#39;s not what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">photogenically i mean like did did the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:36.480" style="s2">first person who wrote that did they</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">think that a beaver was a woodchuck oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.480" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">is this like</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:44.839" style="s2">uh the way in jamaica pear means avocado</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">yeah and uh and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.839" end="00:59:48.480" style="s2">is rat bat bat means moth and rat bat</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">means bat</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.480" end="00:59:52.160" style="s2">yeah yeah like that yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:53.680" style="s2">possible because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.160" end="00:59:55.680" style="s2">beavers do a certain amount of uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.680" end="00:59:57.200" style="s2">talking of wood yes whatever trucking</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.680" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">they absolutely do i mean i think we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.200" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">all agree that beavers check would but</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:02.400" style="s2">apparently woodchucks do not being</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:04.160" style="s2">cyards which is squirrels</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.400" end="01:00:05.680" style="s2">and squirrels chuck no wood they chuck</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">no wood yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.680" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">and they hold no truck with those that</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:10.240" style="s2">do they hold no truck with those that</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">chuck</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.240" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">exactly yeah yeah all right</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">so tired of listening to you people um</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.599" end="01:00:25.359" style="s2">okay we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">five more okay in 2009</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.359" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">h1n1 infected roughly one billion people</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">and then became part of the annual flu</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">season</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">why didn&#39;t it mutate the way you warned</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:37.599" style="s2">sars cove too well</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.559" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure what you think we&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">about what we</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.559" end="01:00:41.680" style="s2">think about how cyrus cove two will</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">mutate</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.680" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">we have said that it may well mutate in</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">a number of ways but i&#39;m not sure do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:50.079" style="s2">can you figure out from this</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:52.359" style="s2">which of the things we have said so i</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.079" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough here i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.359" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">h1n1</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:01:00.079" style="s2">shows up in this comparison because</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">of the uh now well</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.079" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">established fact of lab escape i believe</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">it&#39;s h1n1</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:08.839" style="s2">that escaped we don&#39;t know where from oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.839" end="01:01:12.640" style="s2">70 i&#39;m now just remembering off the top</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">my head but i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.640" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">78 either china or russia is thought to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:18.720" style="s2">be the source</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:21.680" style="s2">um is it 78 the year or is that just a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.720" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">number inserted i&#39;m hoping i&#39;m not stuck</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:25.359" style="s2">about any of these facts but uh yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">there is a famous</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">now established lab leak um</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:34.720" style="s2">and so the question so if that is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">comparison and that is the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.720" end="01:01:38.559" style="s2">you are delivering h1n1 here for us to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">compare sars cove 2</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.559" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">to then i would say the reason that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">don&#39;t expect the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:47.040" style="s2">is that what you had in the case of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">lab leak</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.040" end="01:01:52.720" style="s2">was a natural virus</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">i believe not one that had gone through</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.720" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">serial passaging</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:58.480" style="s2">serial passaging in this case the reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:02:02.880" style="s2">that it looms large for us</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.480" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">is they would have trained the virus on</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">particular idiosyncrasies of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">laboratory process</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:09.760" style="s2">and the tissue or the creatures that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:12.400" style="s2">serial passaging took place</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.760" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">in and therefore that would have drawn</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.400" end="01:02:16.480" style="s2">the virus out to somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">and then we would expect it to revert</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:21.359" style="s2">um to something else or not back but at</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">least it would adapt to the human</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.359" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">population as it finds it it would</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">discover new opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:31.520" style="s2">etc but no we expect</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.000" end="01:02:34.240" style="s2">all viruses to evolve over time</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.520" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">and in fact one of the reasons that flu</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.240" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">is seasonal is that the rate of</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">evolution is high enough</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:41.359" style="s2">that immunity doesn&#39;t persist and so we</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:42.880" style="s2">basically stuck with these things over</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.359" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">long periods of time because</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.880" end="01:02:46.319" style="s2">the rate of change is sufficient to</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">erase</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.319" end="01:02:51.520" style="s2">the protectiveness of memory cells over</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:51.520" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">all right uh hi in the light of</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:57.119" style="s2">orthotropic discussion does it seem like</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:02:58.799" style="s2">a good idea to chew</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.119" end="01:03:00.880" style="s2">chewing gum constantly for part of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.799" end="01:03:01.680" style="s2">day perhaps several hours sugarless</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.880" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.680" end="01:03:05.359" style="s2">the sap resin is probably harder load</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:06.720" style="s2">teeth without wearing them</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.359" end="01:03:09.039" style="s2">so this is one of the things that mike</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.720" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">mew specifically recommends</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.039" end="01:03:16.960" style="s2">and we went ahead and bought some</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:19.680" style="s2">some sugar-free natural um</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.960" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2">tree gum gum that&#39;s flavored</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">interestingly i guess</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.720" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">what it&#39;s called monica chiclay tree</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.440" end="01:03:28.720" style="s2">simply zac says it&#39;s called simply gum</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.119" end="01:03:30.640" style="s2">and it is indeed from the monaco</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.720" end="01:03:32.319" style="s2">chiclay tree from which the brand name</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.640" end="01:03:34.319" style="s2">chiclets comes</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:36.559" style="s2">not that chiclets is any more from that</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.319" end="01:03:39.359" style="s2">tree or they originally originally was</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.559" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">um i would say i certainly go natural</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.359" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:44.480" style="s2">any of the synthetic sweetener stuff i</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">would say the disappointing thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.480" end="01:03:51.599" style="s2">about the gum is that it is not um</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">robust enough to constitute the best</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.599" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">exercise in other words</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:56.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not generated with exercise in mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.160" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">well he wants so mike mew recommends i</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:01.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know how big the sticks of gum are</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:02.799" style="s2">in england but he recommends putting 10</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.520" end="01:04:04.000" style="s2">pieces in your mouth at a time and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.799" end="01:04:05.520" style="s2">making what he calls a really large</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.000" end="01:04:06.319" style="s2">bolus that you move around your mouth</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.520" end="01:04:07.839" style="s2">really actively</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.319" end="01:04:09.359" style="s2">well i&#39;ll just point out that britain</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.839" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">being an island there&#39;s a limit to how</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.359" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">big the sticks could be</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">this is a really terrible point</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">truly terrible point um but anyway i</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:19.200" style="s2">would say look i actually think somebody</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:21.119" style="s2">ought to formulate a gum</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.200" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">specifically for the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.119" end="01:04:24.640" style="s2">exercises that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">uh that mike is pointing to and the fact</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.640" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:29.200" style="s2">your sense that gum should be sweet</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">probably that&#39;s unnecessary</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.200" end="01:04:35.680" style="s2">my guess is gun gum could be uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:37.440" style="s2">pleasant if it was not sweet</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.680" end="01:04:39.440" style="s2">in other words mint might be enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.440" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">sweet it&#39;s not necessary to go with mint</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.440" end="01:04:45.440" style="s2">even if we sort of associate the two</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:46.160" style="s2">and that a gum that was formulated to</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.440" end="01:04:50.319" style="s2">resist</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.160" end="01:04:50.319" style="s2">better would be useful</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">so anyway there&#39;s a lot that could be</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:54.960" style="s2">done to make it better but i would also</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:56.400" style="s2">point out it is not a simple matter of</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.960" end="01:04:58.319" style="s2">chewing gum i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.400" end="01:04:59.760" style="s2">i think you know he&#39;s got specific mike</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.319" end="01:05:01.119" style="s2">mio&#39;s specific ways that he wants you</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.760" end="01:05:02.000" style="s2">sort of moving it around your mouth and</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.119" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">then uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.000" end="01:05:05.359" style="s2">flattening it against the brief your</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:06.400" style="s2">mouth pulverizing it against the roof of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.359" end="01:05:07.599" style="s2">your mouth</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.400" end="01:05:09.920" style="s2">to strengthen your tongue and all of</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.599" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">these things so i suspect that this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.920" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">super useful but we haven&#39;t found that i</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.200" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">admit i mean you you and the kids have</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:17.440" style="s2">actually been doing it more i think i</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">tried it twice i&#39;m sorry like</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.440" end="01:05:20.880" style="s2">i gave up yeah i just don&#39;t like chewing</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:22.079" style="s2">gum i never did</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.880" end="01:05:24.240" style="s2">yeah maybe you could get someone to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:25.599" style="s2">it for you oh that&#39;s good yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.240" end="01:05:27.760" style="s2">outsource the work that we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.599" end="01:05:28.079" style="s2">for ourselves this is exactly how we got</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.760" end="01:05:32.000" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.079" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">yes yes it is okay uh</p>

<p begin="01:06:39.440" end="01:06:41.680" style="s2">that one of them is not going to use</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.720" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">their names because we haven&#39;t asked</p>

<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:47.680" style="s2">but said was that you know clearly what</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:50.799" style="s2">we need</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.680" end="01:06:53.839" style="s2">is track and trace um you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.799" end="01:06:56.400" style="s2">abundant rapid turnaround testing uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.839" end="01:06:56.880" style="s2">with track and trace in place uh such</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.400" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.880" end="01:07:00.559" style="s2">uh you can immediately isolate people</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:01.599" style="s2">who are sick and one of the things you</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.559" end="01:07:03.920" style="s2">asked him</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.599" end="01:07:05.760" style="s2">was don&#39;t don&#39;t you also need that in</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.920" end="01:07:08.799" style="s2">combination with a lockdown</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.760" end="01:07:10.960" style="s2">and he said no he said actually i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.799" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">think it&#39;s necessary if you really had</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.960" end="01:07:16.000" style="s2">sufficient tests that were a</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:17.680" style="s2">reliable and you know really the thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.000" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">that no one is talking about that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.680" end="01:07:21.760" style="s2">obviously super important and this to</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:24.079" style="s2">your anecdote in the first hour today</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.760" end="01:07:25.760" style="s2">um that has a super fast turnaround best</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.079" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">if it&#39;s basically instantaneous best if</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.760" end="01:07:29.039" style="s2">they were so abundant</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">and so inexpensive that we could all be</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.039" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">doing it every day when we got up</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:34.799" style="s2">and with that then you have track and</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:36.559" style="s2">trace and that would free up the vast</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.799" end="01:07:39.599" style="s2">majority of us to go about</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.559" end="01:07:40.799" style="s2">our business and to to do normal things</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.599" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">and get the economy</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.799" end="01:07:44.000" style="s2">back to normal including the scientists</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:46.640" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.000" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">ought to be doing things like working on</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.640" end="01:07:52.079" style="s2">a vaccine against this virus</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">so i would say plausibly</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.079" end="01:07:58.480" style="s2">such a thing could work without a</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:59.359" style="s2">severe brief lockdown the likelihood of</p>

<p begin="01:08:01.200" end="01:08:06.720" style="s2">be in order that you don&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.760" end="01:08:08.319" style="s2">severe brief lockdown is low so probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.720" end="01:08:10.400" style="s2">you need to combine these things</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.319" end="01:08:12.319" style="s2">but the other thing we need which may</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.400" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">ironically be the hardest of these to</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.319" end="01:08:14.640" style="s2">accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.280" end="01:08:16.640" style="s2">is that we need to get on the same</p>

<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:20.719" style="s2">you can&#39;t have half the population</p>

<p begin="01:08:20.719" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">not very dangerous</p>

<p begin="01:08:27.359" end="01:08:30.480" style="s2">interrupt with that and let you riff</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.719" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">then because real lockdown isn&#39;t doable</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.480" end="01:08:35.120" style="s2">people aren&#39;t robots to obey 100 orders</p>

<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:42.080" style="s2">uh and boosting immunity could help</p>

<p begin="01:08:51.199" end="01:08:55.520" style="s2">for us we are actually putting the world</p>

<p begin="01:10:18.560" end="01:10:22.960" style="s2">is real i assure you</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.239" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">we know people who have it right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.960" end="01:10:26.000" style="s2">serious</p>

<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:44.320" style="s2">about this for months</p>

<p begin="01:11:05.120" end="01:11:08.560" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a good place to stop all</p>
