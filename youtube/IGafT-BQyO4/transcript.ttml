<p begin="00:00:02.610" end="00:00:07.259" style="s2">first met her I was gonna be first up</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.350" end="00:00:08.550" style="s2">today I was slightly Dario because quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.259" end="00:00:10.620" style="s2">frankly I didn&#39;t love the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:12.599" style="s2">of saying it out but all day but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.620" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">more I thought about it the more I</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.599" end="00:00:15.839" style="s2">thought that actually what I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">say might provide a really useful</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.839" end="00:00:19.800" style="s2">context for everything else that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">going to follow and I hope also it might</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.800" end="00:00:25.460" style="s2">provide a couple of potential solutions</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:28.170" style="s2">for the experience of powerlessness and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.460" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">you know what can the individual do that</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.170" end="00:00:33.660" style="s2">sort of feeling that I think is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:35.070" style="s2">prevalent among activists so I think as</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">actually is what we try and do and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.070" end="00:00:38.820" style="s2">trying to change a system that is both</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">pervasive and very very protective of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.820" end="00:00:43.170" style="s2">itself what we need to find is a point</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">of access point a point of attack</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.170" end="00:00:46.649" style="s2">something that I like to think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">a nexus point which is connected to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.649" end="00:00:51.270" style="s2">everything else rather than if you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2">weaken that just like a main structure</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">and abilities you can weaken that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.440" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">brings the whole thing down and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">peanut Josephina zeitgeist movies did an</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">excellent idea of identifying money as</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:02.370" style="s2">that nexus point and I came away from</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:04.199" style="s2">watching the addendum three or four</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.370" end="00:01:05.790" style="s2">years ago whenever it was thinking might</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.199" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">go to actually understand for the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">time just how profoundly and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:13.140" style="s2">systemically corrupt our institutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">are and how it&#39;s money that lies right</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">at the heart of it and so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">fight when tilting at windmills share to</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">give anyone would listen going down to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:25.650" style="s2">speaker&#39;s corner and I was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">convinced at the time that all you would</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.650" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">have to do is explain it clearly to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.390" end="00:01:29.930" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:32.100" style="s2">and once they realize just how</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.930" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">fraudulent it was and how much it</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:36.810" style="s2">actually enslaves us as a society that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">you know that that&#39;s all that would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.810" end="00:01:42.590" style="s2">required to bring change about but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">realized how that was pretty naive and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.590" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">you know the thing is though even if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:48.840" style="s2">do manage to get it across the salon you</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:50.790" style="s2">do manage to convince them that they do</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">see it for what it is what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.790" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">individual&#39;s supposed to do the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">individual stands powerless against</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">systems like the financial system the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:01:59.969" style="s2">against systems like the governmental</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">system the corporatocracy</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.969" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">you know the individual stance powers</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">and so I think many of us feel after a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:08.099" style="s2">very short time a sense of frustration</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">that we can see what&#39;s wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:10.860" style="s2">world but we can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">what to do about it and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.860" end="00:02:14.340" style="s2">what I want to address in this talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">because I&#39;ve come to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.340" end="00:02:20.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a level deeper than money and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:23.850" style="s2">is more powerful because it&#39;s deeper but</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.490" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">it is also more accessible to us as</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.850" end="00:02:27.630" style="s2">individuals to do something about and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:29.340" style="s2">that level I&#39;m talking about sort of got</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.630" end="00:02:30.690" style="s2">late when I diagrams the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.340" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">substrate and by the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.690" end="00:02:35.340" style="s2">substrate what I mean is the stories and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:38.100" style="s2">myths and narratives that we tell each</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.340" end="00:02:39.959" style="s2">other to bind society together and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.100" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">is a point of attack that we as</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.959" end="00:02:43.830" style="s2">individuals and small groups can make a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:45.810" style="s2">deal that can make a real difference to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.830" end="00:02:48.030" style="s2">it because our social systems grow out</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.810" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">of a metaphysical substrate so if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.030" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">can change the substrate the systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">will change as a consequence of that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:02:59.100" style="s2">I want to focus on in this talk three</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:02.580" style="s2">things firstly I want to get across to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">you just how powerful stories and myths</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.580" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">are in affecting how we act in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:09.870" style="s2">world Harry orient ourselves in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:11.610" style="s2">world I then want to go on and look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.870" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">some of the prevailing stories and makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.610" end="00:03:16.350" style="s2">and narratives that exist in our society</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">and show that they are bad stories and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.350" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">that they are bad stories because they</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.019" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">route us in what you&#39;ll call the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">and I want to introduce you for those of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:26.220" style="s2">you who don&#39;t already know about it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">the idea of Jung&#39;s shadow and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.220" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">last part of my talk is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:31.500" style="s2">about Joseph Campbell&#39;s hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:33.390" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s very relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.500" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">all of us if we can see ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.390" end="00:03:37.590" style="s2">being on that hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">it is a motivator and it gives us a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.590" end="00:03:41.910" style="s2">sense of making a real and meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:44.370" style="s2">contribution to the change that we want</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.910" end="00:03:46.049" style="s2">to see in the world so to begin with I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.370" end="00:03:47.850" style="s2">going to tell you a little story just to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.049" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">get across here there&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.850" end="00:03:51.390" style="s2">first thing of my talk is the power of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:53.519" style="s2">story and I can see no better way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.390" end="00:03:56.760" style="s2">doing that than by example so Tony Tony</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.519" end="00:03:58.170" style="s2">little story once upon a time there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.760" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">a colony of mussels and they lived on</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.170" end="00:04:02.579" style="s2">the river bed and they climbed to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:04.890" style="s2">river bed and the water rushed past them</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.579" end="00:04:06.209" style="s2">and all day every day they cling to each</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.890" end="00:04:07.769" style="s2">other and they cling to the rocks and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.209" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">they filter food out of the water</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.769" end="00:04:10.920" style="s2">and all knowing every night they think</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:12.620" style="s2">of each other and they clean to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.920" end="00:04:15.209" style="s2">rocks and they have a little sleep and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.620" end="00:04:16.680" style="s2">after a while one of the mussels starts</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.209" end="00:04:17.130" style="s2">to get agitated and he goes around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.680" end="00:04:20.459" style="s2">staff</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.130" end="00:04:22.620" style="s2">today I wasn&#39;t saying is this really all</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.459" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">there is clinging to the rocks we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.620" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">to each other picking bits of food out</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:29.190" style="s2">of Ottoman is this really all there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:31.500" style="s2">an world world what do you mean well</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.190" end="00:04:32.790" style="s2">what happens if we just let go what</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.500" end="00:04:36.120" style="s2">happens if we just let go and let the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.790" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">current take us you can&#39;t do that others</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.120" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">have tried you see those rocks down</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:40.710" style="s2">there the current takes you smashes you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:42.810" style="s2">against the rocks there&#39;s nothing you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.710" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">can do but after hearing this one he</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.810" end="00:04:45.480" style="s2">just can&#39;t bear it anymore and so he</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">says it&#39;s goodbyes to his friends and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.480" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">his family and he lets go and off he</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.090" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">goes and sure enough the client takes in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:53.760" style="s2">the wife bashes him against a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:56.420" style="s2">the rocks round the bend of the river</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.760" end="00:04:58.710" style="s2">and he disappears gone forever</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.420" end="00:05:03.240" style="s2">now the story ends here is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.710" end="00:05:05.400" style="s2">disappointing story is there and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.240" end="00:05:07.560" style="s2">really disappointing story because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.400" end="00:05:09.570" style="s2">hero&#39;s dead right what else is there the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.560" end="00:05:10.890" style="s2">hero&#39;s dead and I want to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.570" end="00:05:12.420" style="s2">this place run the importance of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.890" end="00:05:14.940" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey because it&#39;s deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.420" end="00:05:17.460" style="s2">deep in our psyche this this unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.940" end="00:05:18.990" style="s2">of a plot and so but anyway this is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.460" end="00:05:20.940" style="s2">the end of the story what actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.990" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">happens is that as the muscle rams the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.940" end="00:05:24.750" style="s2">baby took a couple of knocks on the rock</p>

<p begin="00:05:24.750" end="00:05:30.150" style="s2">not seriously damaged and as the river</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.220" end="00:05:53.090" style="s2">down this is a pretty short simple even</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:55.770" style="s2">somewhat silly story but even within</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.900" end="00:06:02.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff I want to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.890" end="00:06:05.460" style="s2">through today and I do want to stick to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.940" end="00:06:06.690" style="s2">my half ounce so I won&#39;t do that but you</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.460" end="00:06:08.760" style="s2">know a couple of things you might take</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.690" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">from it is for example to risk</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.760" end="00:06:14.100" style="s2">everything in search of adventure is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:15.540" style="s2">noble goal in life well you might see it</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.100" end="00:06:17.580" style="s2">from the other mothers perspective say</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.540" end="00:06:18.930" style="s2">well actually these are band and his</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.930" end="00:06:22.729" style="s2">him to claim to at night</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.969" end="00:06:25.009" style="s2">he&#39;s left them poorer by disappearing</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.729" end="00:06:27.169" style="s2">off like that or a level deeper than</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.169" end="00:06:29.749" style="s2">everything right because remember from</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.459" end="00:06:31.189" style="s2">the perspective of the muscles he left</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.749" end="00:06:34.459" style="s2">behind he was smashed against the rocks</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.189" end="00:06:36.199" style="s2">and was killed so you know our many many</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.459" end="00:06:38.029" style="s2">clients as a term sure there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.199" end="00:06:39.769" style="s2">people come up with many different many</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.029" end="00:06:41.839" style="s2">different interpretations but the point</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.769" end="00:06:43.719" style="s2">is you get into it straight away right</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.839" end="00:06:46.099" style="s2">you can&#39;t help yourself straight away</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.719" end="00:06:48.860" style="s2">something about the story captures you</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.099" end="00:06:51.049" style="s2">you live out the story as though you</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.860" end="00:06:53.029" style="s2">were one of the characters in it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.049" end="00:06:54.679" style="s2">then so it affects you not just on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.029" end="00:06:56.509" style="s2">mental on an intellectual level but on</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.679" end="00:07:01.610" style="s2">an emotional level and even on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.509" end="00:07:03.739" style="s2">spiritual level as well brain scans</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.610" end="00:07:05.719" style="s2">indicate that when you&#39;re exposed to</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.209" end="00:07:11.929" style="s2">you&#39;re exposed to storytelling multiple</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.429" end="00:07:14.899" style="s2">regions of your brain lights up at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.929" end="00:07:17.389" style="s2">same time to give you an even more</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.899" end="00:07:18.979" style="s2">concrete example that kondeh significant</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.389" end="00:07:20.269" style="s2">objects tone okay so other one be</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.979" end="00:07:21.979" style="s2">organizing the study dude was they</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.269" end="00:07:24.079" style="s2">employed the services of 200 writers and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.979" end="00:07:26.149" style="s2">they sense these 200 rights go out to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.079" end="00:07:28.159" style="s2">bric-a-brac shop junk shops whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.149" end="00:07:30.050" style="s2">buy something anything for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.159" end="00:07:31.999" style="s2">bucks and then put it up on eBay and try</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.050" end="00:07:33.469" style="s2">and sell it but before selling it right</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.999" end="00:07:35.899" style="s2">a little story about it to give the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.469" end="00:07:37.129" style="s2">object some significance in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.899" end="00:07:39.709" style="s2">minds of the people that are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.129" end="00:07:41.029" style="s2">the at the ads so these 200 writers</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.709" end="00:07:42.349" style="s2">spent between them at home with two</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.029" end="00:07:44.179" style="s2">hundred and fifty dollars on acquiring</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.349" end="00:07:47.419" style="s2">musical objects and sold them on eBay</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.179" end="00:07:49.610" style="s2">for just shy of eight thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.419" end="00:07:52.459" style="s2">so this is another little example of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.610" end="00:07:55.789" style="s2">just how powerful stories can be at</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.459" end="00:07:57.829" style="s2">grabbing our attention so what are ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.789" end="00:07:59.509" style="s2">so powerful and Ewing has a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.829" end="00:08:01.519" style="s2">to say about this I don&#39;t have time to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.509" end="00:08:03.349" style="s2">go deeply you know in theory obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.519" end="00:08:04.100" style="s2">but I would like to just touch on it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.349" end="00:08:06.500" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.100" end="00:08:08.150" style="s2">couple of context so these are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.500" end="00:08:11.150" style="s2">twelve archetypes that you came up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.150" end="00:08:13.910" style="s2">and what is what these are are kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.150" end="00:08:16.610" style="s2">characters that you use in order to act</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.910" end="00:08:18.230" style="s2">in the world because we&#39;ve got two parts</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.610" end="00:08:21.850" style="s2">of ourselves that need to be reconciled</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.230" end="00:08:25.370" style="s2">we have our sense of being people being</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.850" end="00:08:28.220" style="s2">organisms being consciousnesses but we</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.370" end="00:08:31.460" style="s2">also have to act in the external world</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.220" end="00:08:32.900" style="s2">and to reconcile these two things we</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.460" end="00:08:34.820" style="s2">create these characters and we tell</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.900" end="00:08:37.370" style="s2">ourselves a story and we become the lead</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.820" end="00:08:39.919" style="s2">characters in that story and this sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.370" end="00:08:42.890" style="s2">of characterization of narrative and an</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.919" end="00:08:46.070" style="s2">unfolding plot in our life is very very</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.890" end="00:08:47.480" style="s2">fundamental so how we how we apprehend</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.070" end="00:08:48.950" style="s2">the world and how we make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.480" end="00:08:50.930" style="s2">there&#39;s an infinite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.950" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">information out there which we have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.930" end="00:08:55.340" style="s2">sort that make sense of and try and turn</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:58.400" style="s2">that into an interpretation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.340" end="00:09:02.060" style="s2">which is manageable and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.400" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">ultimately meaningful I was hoping to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.060" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">this without notes at all I brought my</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:07.460" style="s2">bottle down and I brought them on with</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:09.230" style="s2">me anyway but yeah I just want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.460" end="00:09:11.350" style="s2">where I am on my four pages into my</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.230" end="00:09:14.060" style="s2">notes now so when it gets where I am</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.350" end="00:09:16.250" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ll come back I&#39;ll talk a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.060" end="00:09:18.260" style="s2">little bit more about Union stuff in a</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.700" end="00:09:23.150" style="s2">book or there&#39;s anyone in the room I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:24.980" style="s2">see a few people nodding it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.150" end="00:09:26.990" style="s2">excellent book if you haven&#39;t read in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.980" end="00:09:29.210" style="s2">this book he talks about the three great</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.210" end="00:09:33.950" style="s2">civil of the human civilization the</p>

<p begin="00:09:33.950" end="00:09:36.980" style="s2">thousand years ago then the agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.660" end="00:09:39.050" style="s2">about 12,000 years ago and then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.980" end="00:09:41.210" style="s2">scientific most recently starting about</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.050" end="00:09:43.780" style="s2">five hundred years ago and the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.210" end="00:09:46.550" style="s2">revolution is when language and art</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.780" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">appeared for the first time and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.550" end="00:09:51.890" style="s2">also allowed for the first time for</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:53.990" style="s2">stories and myths to take hold to become</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.890" end="00:09:56.810" style="s2">more complex to become much more widely</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.990" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">disseminated and because they became</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.810" end="00:10:00.470" style="s2">more complex and more adept larger</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:02.540" style="s2">numbers of people were able to buy into</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.470" end="00:10:05.120" style="s2">them and these stories are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.540" end="00:10:06.710" style="s2">essential because they allow for much</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.120" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">more widespread collaboration would</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.710" end="00:10:10.330" style="s2">otherwise be possible many of you may</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:14.740" style="s2">have heard of Robin Dunbar is</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.330" end="00:10:17.230" style="s2">he&#39;s a psychologist and anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.740" end="00:10:20.230" style="s2">that modeling college upstate he did a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.230" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">study where he compared frontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.230" end="00:10:24.280" style="s2">size to the number of relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.660" end="00:10:25.510" style="s2">an organism could hold if I actually</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.510" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">relation to ogle brain anyway doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.770" end="00:10:31.330" style="s2">matter and the number he came up for</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.800" end="00:10:34.090" style="s2">humans with one hundred and forty seven</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.330" end="00:10:36.340" style="s2">point eight 150 relationships is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.090" end="00:10:38.920" style="s2">maximum that a single human being can</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.340" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">maintain and so unless there are larger</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.920" end="00:10:45.460" style="s2">stories to buy into societies can never</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:47.320" style="s2">grow beyond about backside 150 indeed</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.460" end="00:10:49.180" style="s2">the maximum number of people you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.320" end="00:10:50.770" style="s2">know even at the most rudimentary level</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.180" end="00:10:52.960" style="s2">are you putting a name to a face is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.770" end="00:10:54.400" style="s2">about 1,500 and we&#39;re obviously living</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.960" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">in societies of millions hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.400" end="00:10:59.530" style="s2">millions even billions of people now and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:02.080" style="s2">so these cultural stories are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.530" end="00:11:05.110" style="s2">essential to the cohesion of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.080" end="00:11:07.210" style="s2">larger societies so the point about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.110" end="00:11:09.310" style="s2">next question is well all the stories</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.210" end="00:11:11.530" style="s2">that we&#39;re using to bind our society</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.310" end="00:11:13.150" style="s2">gather together excuse me are they</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.530" end="00:11:15.520" style="s2">useful are they helpful</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.300" end="00:14:05.140" style="s2">and so like I said we&#39;re living in bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.490" end="00:14:07.090" style="s2">stories and these stories are bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.140" end="00:14:10.180" style="s2">because they encourage us to live in</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.090" end="00:14:12.130" style="s2">shadow by that I mean these are the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.180" end="00:14:14.200" style="s2">twelve archetypes that I head up on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.130" end="00:14:15.970" style="s2">colored wheel earlier on when those</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.200" end="00:14:17.770" style="s2">archetypes well realize when those</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.750" end="00:14:22.930" style="s2">are the qualities that each of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.220" end="00:14:23.740" style="s2">archetypes brings to the table brings</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.930" end="00:14:26.410" style="s2">into the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.740" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">however when their archetype lives in</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.410" end="00:14:31.690" style="s2">fear when their archetype lives in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:33.280" style="s2">shadow this is what manifests in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.690" end="00:14:34.660" style="s2">world instead I take a look at the red</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.280" end="00:14:38.130" style="s2">list take a look at the black with what</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.660" end="00:14:38.130" style="s2">do you feel more of in this world today</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.450" end="00:14:49.240" style="s2">the shadow is rooted entirely in fear</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.820" end="00:14:50.890" style="s2">and denial and I think a really good way</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.240" end="00:14:52.630" style="s2">of summarizing what the shadow is this</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.890" end="00:14:55.420" style="s2">is a choir I think this is Ewing himself</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.630" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">saying all that you are not you also are</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.420" end="00:14:59.770" style="s2">now the shadow is those repressed bits</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.970" end="00:15:04.780" style="s2">for example if you think of yourself as</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.780" end="00:15:09.520" style="s2">and decent person who doesn&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.730" end="00:15:11.200" style="s2">upset others then you may very well find</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.200" end="00:15:16.870" style="s2">self-image when you&#39;re faced with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.780" end="00:15:19.210" style="s2">situation that demands of you forthright</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.870" end="00:15:21.250" style="s2">and assertive behavior that you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.210" end="00:15:24.070" style="s2">insufficiently forthright and assertive</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.250" end="00:15:26.650" style="s2">as a consequence of that you start to</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.650" end="00:15:30.340" style="s2">builds up over time but you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.540" end="00:15:31.720" style="s2">want to face it because it goes against</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.340" end="00:15:33.520" style="s2">your image of yourself and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.720" end="00:15:35.500" style="s2">really gated to the shadow doesn&#39;t mean</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.500" end="00:15:40.810" style="s2">our shadows but until you start to learn</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.350" end="00:15:42.550" style="s2">to integrate your shadow you cannot be</p>

<p begin="00:17:40.919" end="00:17:44.330" style="s2">minotaur kind of made this point</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.050" end="00:18:05.640" style="s2">influenced my thinking about Charles</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.640" end="00:18:11.230" style="s2">the stories that I saw through earlier</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.260" end="00:18:13.150" style="s2">money nation religion etc etc etc he</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.230" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">groups those and many many other of our</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.150" end="00:18:17.590" style="s2">cultural narratives under the umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:19.300" style="s2">of what he calls the story of separation</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.590" end="00:18:22.630" style="s2">that all of these stories are designed</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.300" end="00:18:25.180" style="s2">or have have become whether designed or</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.630" end="00:18:26.740" style="s2">not have had have come about to separate</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.180" end="00:18:28.900" style="s2">us from each other to separate us from</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.740" end="00:18:30.550" style="s2">the natural world to disconnect us from</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.900" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">our power to disconnect us from our</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.550" end="00:18:34.179" style="s2">knowledge of who we are and there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:36.040" style="s2">two ideas of his in particular I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.179" end="00:18:38.770" style="s2">just like to acquaint you with very</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.040" end="00:18:40.750" style="s2">quickly the first is the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.770" end="00:18:41.980" style="s2">opener so the of the gifting economy</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:43.990" style="s2">here you turned the whole idea in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.980" end="00:18:45.730" style="s2">economy on its head and so at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.990" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">things I mentioned earlier on greed is</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.730" end="00:18:51.070" style="s2">hoarding due to fear of scarcity in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:53.290" style="s2">future and that provides you with some</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.070" end="00:18:55.450" style="s2">security of security and a gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.290" end="00:18:56.800" style="s2">cultural in fact that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.450" end="00:18:58.090" style="s2">whatever you need is out there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.800" end="00:18:59.950" style="s2">people and people are happy to give it</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.090" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">to you just as you are happy to give</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.950" end="00:19:04.600" style="s2">whatever you are able to give to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.570" end="00:19:07.000" style="s2">world and your status and value in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.600" end="00:19:09.160" style="s2">society is now perceived not by how much</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.000" end="00:19:10.929" style="s2">you have but by how much you give it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.160" end="00:19:12.250" style="s2">turns the whole thing up on its head the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.929" end="00:19:14.700" style="s2">other idea he talked about which I</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.250" end="00:19:16.809" style="s2">really like is the idea of peaks of</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.700" end="00:19:18.250" style="s2">understanding and that the current</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.809" end="00:19:19.929" style="s2">narratives that we&#39;ve been using in</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.250" end="00:19:22.120" style="s2">society have taken us as high as they</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.929" end="00:19:23.260" style="s2">can possibly take us they are flawed and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.120" end="00:19:24.820" style="s2">they take us as far as they can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.260" end="00:19:26.710" style="s2">take us and that people are becoming</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.820" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">aware of the fact that there&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.710" end="00:19:31.240" style="s2">peak of understanding over there but in</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:34.300" style="s2">order to get from here to there you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.240" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">got to go and down into the valley in</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.300" end="00:19:38.050" style="s2">order to ascend the next peak right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:39.490" style="s2">that this is one of the main barriers</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.050" end="00:19:41.860" style="s2">holding us back is that people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.490" end="00:19:44.110" style="s2">fearful of descending into the valley</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.860" end="00:19:46.390" style="s2">because in the valley is the unknown in</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.110" end="00:19:48.730" style="s2">the valley you have to face the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.390" end="00:19:51.010" style="s2">and only when you face the dragon can</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.730" end="00:19:52.929" style="s2">you grab the treasure and enter the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.010" end="00:19:54.970" style="s2">world as a meaningful agent of change</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.929" end="00:19:56.710" style="s2">and this is this is the final theme of</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.970" end="00:20:00.900" style="s2">my talk is the hero&#39;s journey as</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.710" end="00:20:00.900" style="s2">described by this guy Joseph Campbell</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.210" end="00:20:06.470" style="s2">Joey Campbell spent his whole life</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.249" end="00:20:07.610" style="s2">studying mythologies from all over the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.470" end="00:20:10.399" style="s2">world and when he was particularly</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.610" end="00:20:12.019" style="s2">looking for with similarities and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.399" end="00:20:14.860" style="s2">differences between those mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.019" end="00:20:17.149" style="s2">and he would attribute similarities to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.860" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">elements of our psyche which are common</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.149" end="00:20:21.080" style="s2">to all human beings everywhere you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:22.850" style="s2">rooted in our biology and is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:24.919" style="s2">cultural and and the differences in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.850" end="00:20:28.940" style="s2">narratives he attributed to cultural</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.919" end="00:20:30.740" style="s2">influences and so themes like slaying</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.940" end="00:20:33.350" style="s2">the dragon themes like resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.740" end="00:20:35.960" style="s2">themes like the wise mentor these appear</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.350" end="00:20:37.820" style="s2">all over the world across vast time</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.960" end="00:20:39.590" style="s2">spans completely independently of each</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.820" end="00:20:41.480" style="s2">other with no possibility of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.590" end="00:20:43.340" style="s2">groups having communicated with each</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.480" end="00:20:45.710" style="s2">other and so I think it&#39;s reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.340" end="00:20:47.690" style="s2">assume that these these are themes which</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.710" end="00:20:49.070" style="s2">reside deep in our psyche according to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.690" end="00:20:52.009" style="s2">the archetypes of those that I went</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">through earlier with you this is a sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.009" end="00:20:54.830" style="s2">of circular representation of the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:56.749" style="s2">journey he&#39;s written a whole book about</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.830" end="00:20:59.769" style="s2">this which I highly recommend you read</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.749" end="00:21:02.629" style="s2">it&#39;s both inspirational and educational</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.769" end="00:21:03.769" style="s2">this is a much simplified version of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.629" end="00:21:05.509" style="s2">gonna use this one it&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.769" end="00:21:07.879" style="s2">quickly like I said I have a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.509" end="00:21:08.929" style="s2">of time lots of ideas and to talk you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.879" end="00:21:10.460" style="s2">through it so the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.929" end="00:21:12.350" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey is right here this is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.460" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">call to adventure and I&#39;m assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.350" end="00:21:16.249" style="s2">most of you are in this room right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:17.509" style="s2">because you have experienced that right</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.249" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve felt that call to adventure</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.509" end="00:21:22.519" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;re here right now and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:24.649" style="s2">wondering what you can actually do to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.519" end="00:21:27.230" style="s2">bring meaningful positive change to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.649" end="00:21:28.909" style="s2">world the call is sometimes refused for</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.230" end="00:21:30.259" style="s2">whatever reason it might be fear it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.909" end="00:21:32.600" style="s2">might be circumstances of your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.259" end="00:21:34.340" style="s2">whatever it may be but around about here</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.600" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">this is the important transition you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.340" end="00:21:38.869" style="s2">transiting from the ordinary world into</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.590" end="00:21:40.789" style="s2">the special world and your transition</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.869" end="00:21:43.220" style="s2">through the special world if this is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.789" end="00:21:44.389" style="s2">process of death and rebirth this is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.220" end="00:21:46.610" style="s2">resurrection the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.389" end="00:21:48.919" style="s2">resurrection comes this is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.610" end="00:21:51.259" style="s2">underlying the story of resurrection is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.919" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">when you cross the threshold you then</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.259" end="00:21:56.360" style="s2">encounter resources both within yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:58.580" style="s2">and outside yourself that you never knew</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.360" end="00:22:00.649" style="s2">you had you are tested you meet people</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.580" end="00:22:02.779" style="s2">who are going to help you and when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.649" end="00:22:04.190" style="s2">are on a hero&#39;s journey because this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.779" end="00:22:05.929" style="s2">something which resides deep in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.190" end="00:22:07.340" style="s2">psyche of every single one of us when</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.929" end="00:22:08.899" style="s2">you are on your hero&#39;s journey other</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.150" end="00:22:21.570" style="s2">final deal is your confrontation with</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.740" end="00:22:35.460" style="s2">can be gone through many times in one</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.540" end="00:22:37.530" style="s2">lifetime the hero&#39;s journey does not</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.460" end="00:22:39.300" style="s2">have to be as dramatic as the trials of</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.300" end="00:22:43.260" style="s2">journey can be much more mundane than</p>

<p begin="00:28:26.210" end="00:28:31.350" style="s2">likes to go fishing and so every day he</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.800" end="00:28:32.910" style="s2">goes down to the seawall and he sits on</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.850" end="00:28:40.530" style="s2">doing this for usually isn&#39;t very good</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.680" end="00:28:42.750" style="s2">he&#39;s a very simple life and he&#39;s sitting</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.530" end="00:28:44.460" style="s2">on a ball fishing one day when a tourist</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.750" end="00:28:47.130" style="s2">and a boat rose by them and they get</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.460" end="00:28:48.630" style="s2">talking and the story says to him say</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.130" end="00:28:52.220" style="s2">come down here if anyone you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.630" end="00:28:56.670" style="s2">must know the fishing pretty well there</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.220" end="00:28:59.180" style="s2">wanna brag of course so why do you catch</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.670" end="00:29:02.220" style="s2">for my notification you know sell them</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.180" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">in growth by yourself and then you catch</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.220" end="00:29:06.390" style="s2">even more fish you know anything you</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:08.610" style="s2">could make a nice living fear so okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.390" end="00:29:10.350" style="s2">and then what would I do well you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.610" end="00:29:11.850" style="s2">if you wanted to buy a boat you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.350" end="00:29:14.250" style="s2">start employing people you know you keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.850" end="00:29:15.300" style="s2">their answer makes your production and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.250" end="00:29:17.160" style="s2">then what would I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.300" end="00:29:18.360" style="s2">well once you&#39;ve got enough money you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.160" end="00:29:25.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do anything it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.360" end="00:29:27.400" style="s2">very efficient so again a simple little</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.480" end="00:29:28.780" style="s2">story but one final thought before I</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.400" end="00:29:30.190" style="s2">leave you the two little stories that</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.780" end="00:29:32.050" style="s2">are floating the muscle story and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.190" end="00:29:33.820" style="s2">old man&#39;s story and the two new</p>
