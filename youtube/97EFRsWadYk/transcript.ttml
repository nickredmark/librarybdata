<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>

<p begin="00:00:18.070" end="00:00:26.599" style="s2">so as you know there&#39;s this virus out</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.279" end="00:00:27.950" style="s2">there expanding pandemic and usually</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.599" end="00:00:29.810" style="s2">with the pandemic you would try to catch</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.950" end="00:00:32.180" style="s2">it early and you put a lot of work to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.810" end="00:00:37.280" style="s2">catch you early with tracing and testing</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.180" end="00:00:40.280" style="s2">and isolating and we screwed that up we</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.280" end="00:00:42.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t catch this one early and most</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.280" end="00:00:44.750" style="s2">health professionals would have said and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.710" end="00:00:46.820" style="s2">did say well I guess it&#39;s gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.750" end="00:00:48.800" style="s2">everywhere so I guess we should just try</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.820" end="00:00:52.219" style="s2">to flatten the curve and deal with it as</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.800" end="00:00:53.899" style="s2">best we can because we let it go and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.219" end="00:00:56.660" style="s2">the last few weeks people have said no</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.899" end="00:00:59.260" style="s2">no no you can&#39;t do that they need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.660" end="00:01:01.789" style="s2">people will die which they will and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.260" end="00:01:05.290" style="s2">people have been really excited to try</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.789" end="00:01:10.040" style="s2">to suppress to the lockdown and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.290" end="00:01:12.980" style="s2">people said stay home and don&#39;t go don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.040" end="00:01:15.320" style="s2">go to work and many people have hoped</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.980" end="00:01:18.560" style="s2">that that&#39;ll work and there is hope but</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.320" end="00:01:20.390" style="s2">we should have a plan B because we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.560" end="00:01:21.950" style="s2">really catching this late and all these</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.390" end="00:01:23.120" style="s2">people who think yeah we can do this</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.950" end="00:01:27.380" style="s2">they&#39;re the people who screwed up in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.120" end="00:01:29.720" style="s2">first place so I&#39;m not that hopeful but</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.380" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">of course we should try but the question</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.720" end="00:01:34.070" style="s2">is what if we can&#39;t suppress it what if</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:36.050" style="s2">it is basically eventually going to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.070" end="00:01:38.060" style="s2">to most everyone what do we do then so</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.050" end="00:01:40.970" style="s2">the usual story is to flatten the curve</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.060" end="00:01:42.860" style="s2">and ie to spread out who gets infected</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.970" end="00:01:48.140" style="s2">wins so that we aren&#39;t all expected at</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.860" end="00:01:50.390" style="s2">the same time so that the medical system</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.140" end="00:01:52.430" style="s2">will be there for us more so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.390" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">all infected in the same two weeks the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.430" end="00:01:59.030" style="s2">entire world then you know they just</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:02:02.660" style="s2">can&#39;t help us all that&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.030" end="00:02:05.660" style="s2">problem from the point of view of death</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.660" end="00:02:08.420" style="s2">rates because in fact there is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.660" end="00:02:10.610" style="s2">called a dose effect that is when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.420" end="00:02:12.620" style="s2">get sick with the virus you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.610" end="00:02:15.560" style="s2">get sick or not you get sick with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.620" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">certain amount of virus and then initial</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.560" end="00:02:20.150" style="s2">size of the dose that you get sick with</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:21.590" style="s2">matters a lot so as soon as you get sick</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.150" end="00:02:23.180" style="s2">with the virus your body turns on it</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.590" end="00:02:25.730" style="s2">goes oh and that tries to grow a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.180" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">response as fast as it can and the virus</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.730" end="00:02:28.920" style="s2">is trying to grow as fast as you can and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.110" style="s2">your your body is in a content</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.920" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">growing but the size that initial amount</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.110" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2">affects how well it can win so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:37.739" style="s2">very tiny initial amount your body can</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:40.200" style="s2">beat it out but if it&#39;s a much larger</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.739" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">amount and it that&#39;s worth so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">very consistent data in medicine that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:47.730" style="s2">the initial dose of a virus matters for</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">the severity the symptoms and whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.730" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">you die and we have data on that for</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:57.720" style="s2">SARS which came out you know in the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:59.550" style="s2">decade or two showing people in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.720" end="00:03:01.350" style="s2">field when they were far away from a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.550" end="00:03:02.760" style="s2">source sources close to a source it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.350" end="00:03:04.019" style="s2">three times the death rate when they</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">were closer to the source there&#39;s data</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.019" end="00:03:11.069" style="s2">on measles in African villages where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:13.590" style="s2">first kid and a family to get it would</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.069" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">have a 14 times lower death rate than</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.590" end="00:03:18.200" style="s2">the other kids in a family who would get</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:21.410" style="s2">it and we have this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.200" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">smallpox variations so back in the 1700s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.410" end="00:03:26.819" style="s2">before they have vaccines what they did</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:31.019" style="s2">to treat smallpox around the world and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.819" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">in the West starting then was to give</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.019" end="00:03:36.359" style="s2">people a small amount of smallpox in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:38.549" style="s2">fact connection and then instead of say</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.359" end="00:03:40.140" style="s2">a 20 to 30 percent death rate typically</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.549" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">for smallpox it would be a one to two</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.140" end="00:03:45.030" style="s2">percent that&#39;s rate for smallpox and for</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">example at Valley Forge George</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.030" end="00:03:50.850" style="s2">Washington inoculated his troops this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">way and that put the deaths rate down to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.850" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">2% instead of much higher which saves</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">Valley Ford and had the troops the US</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:03:59.670" style="s2">troops in Canada the same thing a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">months earlier they would have not died</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.670" end="00:04:04.440" style="s2">and we would eat part Canada would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:07.950" style="s2">part of the United States that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.440" end="00:04:13.079" style="s2">history of the u.s. Civil War is it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.950" end="00:04:15.810" style="s2">no the US Revolutionary War so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.079" end="00:04:17.459" style="s2">means unfortunately that if we lock</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.810" end="00:04:18.989" style="s2">everybody down and they catch the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.459" end="00:04:20.430" style="s2">disease at home they&#39;re gonna catch a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.989" end="00:04:23.130" style="s2">larger dose which means they have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.430" end="00:04:25.260" style="s2">larger chance to die and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:26.789" style="s2">problem with lockdown it doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.260" end="00:04:28.530" style="s2">isn&#39;t worth it if you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.789" end="00:04:30.300" style="s2">suppress the whole thing and prevent</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.530" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">lots more people from catching it but if</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.300" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">we&#39;re in the situation where most</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:35.310" style="s2">everything will get it then it&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">a trade off roading lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.310" end="00:04:39.570" style="s2">but it raises this possibility well what</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:41.220" style="s2">if we could just deliberately infect</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.570" end="00:04:42.340" style="s2">people small doses like they did with</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.220" end="00:04:45.000" style="s2">smallpox</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.340" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">back in the 1700s for this disease so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.000" end="00:04:49.540" style="s2">that&#39;s not strange in theoretical I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:51.220" style="s2">we know how to infect people diseases I</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.540" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">mean often like you if you do an</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.220" end="00:04:55.090" style="s2">experiment for say flu and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:56.380" style="s2">get people infect with it so you just</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.090" end="00:04:58.870" style="s2">make them play a card game where they</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.380" end="00:05:02.889" style="s2">exchange the cards and then they quickly</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.870" end="00:05:05.050" style="s2">all get infected by playing cards so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.889" end="00:05:07.030" style="s2">idea here then would be to say well if</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.050" end="00:05:09.820" style="s2">most everyone&#39;s gonna get it why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.030" end="00:05:12.669" style="s2">we try to intentionally get people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.820" end="00:05:14.500" style="s2">get it with a small dose and in addition</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.669" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s gonna get infected let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.500" end="00:05:19.479" style="s2">isolate them because usually you use</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:21.160" style="s2">isolation or quarantine resources to try</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.479" end="00:05:22.540" style="s2">to isolate people most likely to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.160" end="00:05:23.620" style="s2">infected soon but if you infect somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.540" end="00:05:26.380" style="s2">on purpose you know they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.620" end="00:05:28.690" style="s2">infected soon so let&#39;s create what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.380" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">call variolation villages or places</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.690" end="00:05:33.700" style="s2">where you go you get infected with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">small dose Zulu lady that has according</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.700" end="00:05:38.430" style="s2">to these previous reference points eight</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:42.729" style="s2">three to thirty times lower death rate</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.430" end="00:05:44.590" style="s2">from from this infection and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.729" end="00:05:46.180" style="s2">isolated until they&#39;re recovered and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.590" end="00:05:49.870" style="s2">they don&#39;t infect other people and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.180" end="00:05:52.090" style="s2">allows the spread out that&#39;s right the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.870" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">medical demand overtime so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.090" end="00:05:54.729" style="s2">everybody sick at the same time it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">allows people to have this three to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.729" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">thirty lower death rate it allows</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:06:00.849" style="s2">critical workers to sort of you know get</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:02.530" style="s2">certified early that that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.849" end="00:06:05.410" style="s2">recovered and then these safe to go to</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.410" end="00:06:10.320" style="s2">generic idea here and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.740" end="00:06:14.370" style="s2">been trying to get people to consider</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.320" end="00:06:17.050" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s enough for my initial</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.370" end="00:06:19.960" style="s2">presentation and we can go to Q&amp;A</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:27.669" style="s2">a question for Robin just right in the</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.520" end="00:06:39.610" style="s2">every question and I&#39;m not gonna ask him</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.380" end="00:06:41.950" style="s2">in order to and when used my discernment</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.610" end="00:06:44.349" style="s2">about what has the best sort of flow to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.950" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">it and I&#39;ll work Robin with a few</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.349" end="00:06:50.229" style="s2">questions and before like inquiring into</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:52.870" style="s2">the deliberate affection I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.229" end="00:06:54.700" style="s2">about bringing this to the personal I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.870" end="00:06:56.110" style="s2">been talking to a lot of people about</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.700" end="00:06:58.270" style="s2">the situation obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.110" end="00:06:59.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like emotional rollercoaster a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.270" end="00:07:02.650" style="s2">of people are going through wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:04.870" style="s2">with this radical uncertainty so my</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.650" end="00:07:07.060" style="s2">question for you is when did it dawn on</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.870" end="00:07:09.190" style="s2">you that the situation was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.060" end="00:07:14.200" style="s2">quite serious and how have you been</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.190" end="00:07:15.700" style="s2">personally processing it moving my court</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.200" end="00:07:17.230" style="s2">here we&#39;re just plugging in so losing</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.700" end="00:07:19.720" style="s2">them on battery power that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.230" end="00:07:25.030" style="s2">checking their batteries should last for</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.720" end="00:07:27.430" style="s2">a while I was tracking the news in</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.030" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">February and I think around February</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.430" end="00:07:32.590" style="s2">12th I looked at my records and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:35.410" style="s2">when I said to myself in a tweet and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.590" end="00:07:36.580" style="s2">public I said oh my goodness this is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.410" end="00:07:39.250" style="s2">being kept and move on</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.580" end="00:07:40.810" style="s2">this is escaping Luhan to other Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.250" end="00:07:43.000" style="s2">provinces in the rest of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.810" end="00:07:45.910" style="s2">then in my simple-minded way I said</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.000" end="00:07:47.980" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s it it&#39;s gone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.910" end="00:07:52.110" style="s2">escaped the initial place it&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.980" end="00:07:54.310" style="s2">through the whole world oh my god and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.110" end="00:07:56.950" style="s2">that&#39;s when I was starting to be very</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.310" end="00:08:00.870" style="s2">concerned and tried to convince my wife</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.950" end="00:08:00.870" style="s2">to sell stocks which I couldn&#39;t do and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:19.060" style="s2">that okay my Courtney&#39;s bugging me now</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.970" end="00:08:20.950" style="s2">and so two days later I made my first</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.060" end="00:08:23.290" style="s2">post on this topic because I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.950" end="00:08:25.480" style="s2">to think about what we do and that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.290" end="00:08:26.950" style="s2">so since then of course you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.480" end="00:08:28.330" style="s2">very concerned for a while I like tried</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.950" end="00:08:30.550" style="s2">to buy some stuff from trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:31.630" style="s2">convince my wife and other people it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.550" end="00:08:34.090" style="s2">a problem and of course initially</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.630" end="00:08:35.710" style="s2">everybody thought it was crazy because</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.090" end="00:08:37.780" style="s2">they hadn&#39;t heard this from anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.710" end="00:08:38.950" style="s2">so of course you know there&#39;s no point</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.780" end="00:08:42.100" style="s2">in selling stock before everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.950" end="00:08:46.750" style="s2">is gonna sell stocks right yes there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.100" end="00:08:48.460" style="s2">but anyway and so you know but now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.750" end="00:08:50.350" style="s2">I&#39;m a professor so I can still work from</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.460" end="00:08:53.220" style="s2">home and we don&#39;t have children at home</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.350" end="00:08:55.840" style="s2">anymore so it&#39;s relatively easy for us</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.220" end="00:08:59.290" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not employed don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.840" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">family around etc don&#39;t even have kids</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.290" end="00:09:05.610" style="s2">at home but I feel for people who have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:08.600" style="s2">lot more problems here right right</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.610" end="00:09:11.070" style="s2">and then the other question I had is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.600" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">kind of like how people&#39;s responses to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.070" end="00:09:13.769" style="s2">all these different kind of ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:15.720" style="s2">suggestions right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.769" end="00:09:17.070" style="s2">this is like provocative potentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.720" end="00:09:18.420" style="s2">productive for a lot of people if they</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.070" end="00:09:20.550" style="s2">hear this idea that you just presented</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.420" end="00:09:22.380" style="s2">and even that that tweet you sent out</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.550" end="00:09:24.029" style="s2">for the event like we got a few retweets</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.380" end="00:09:25.890" style="s2">someone said the internet was a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.029" end="00:09:27.390" style="s2">they should do this event in person so</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.890" end="00:09:28.410" style="s2">you can practice what they preach stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.390" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2">and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.410" end="00:09:32.730" style="s2">and I know you&#39;re no stranger to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:35.640" style="s2">controversy via misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.730" end="00:09:37.110" style="s2">so do you have any sense of how this</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.640" end="00:09:38.370" style="s2">type of stuff just the suggestion of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.110" end="00:09:43.410" style="s2">could be presented without creating that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.370" end="00:09:46.649" style="s2">backlash against it I mean I just we</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.410" end="00:09:48.120" style="s2">have to try so to explore different ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.649" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">of presenting it to different audiences</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.120" end="00:09:52.589" style="s2">etcetera I don&#39;t there&#39;s no easy there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">no way to figure out ahead of time</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.589" end="00:09:56.550" style="s2">before you go start and try so just</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:59.100" style="s2">jumping in and try right great</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.550" end="00:10:01.339" style="s2">it&#39;s just Robin Hanson technique just</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.100" end="00:10:04.290" style="s2">just jump in and go for it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.339" end="00:10:08.430" style="s2">so we tenured professors do have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.290" end="00:10:10.680" style="s2">little safer if others if you feel a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.430" end="00:10:13.110" style="s2">little fire about being had this fold I</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.680" end="00:10:15.240" style="s2">can appreciate that we have employers</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.110" end="00:10:19.279" style="s2">who don&#39;t appreciate less things for</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.240" end="00:10:21.480" style="s2">example right so let&#39;s turn to the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.279" end="00:10:25.010" style="s2">Jackson you have a question if you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.480" end="00:10:30.420" style="s2">unmute yourself an accent Pasco - Robyn</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.010" end="00:10:32.940" style="s2">yeah I actually I&#39;m curious hey Robin</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.420" end="00:10:33.990" style="s2">Jackson why has there been a difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.940" end="00:10:36.360" style="s2">in the impact between</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.990" end="00:10:41.310" style="s2">various viruses over the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.360" end="00:10:44.699" style="s2">obviously the death rate and and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.310" end="00:10:49.230" style="s2">virality but is it so say for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.699" end="00:10:52.949" style="s2">SARS in early 2000s didn&#39;t really escape</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.230" end="00:10:56.070" style="s2">much outside of Asia is it the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.949" end="00:10:57.810" style="s2">the virus is this the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.070" end="00:11:00.570" style="s2">viruses just do vary a lot in their</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.810" end="00:11:02.220" style="s2">nature you know there&#39;s some several I</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.570" end="00:11:05.100" style="s2">mean they&#39;re complicated little things</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:07.579" style="s2">they can be very different but the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.100" end="00:11:10.050" style="s2">important ones here are safe four stars</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.579" end="00:11:13.350" style="s2">others how what percentage of people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.050" end="00:11:17.810" style="s2">killed there&#39;s how fast it kills them</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.350" end="00:11:20.090" style="s2">and then especially whether they show</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.810" end="00:11:22.190" style="s2">symptoms when they&#39;re infected all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.090" end="00:11:25.460" style="s2">time so for SARS</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.190" end="00:11:28.040" style="s2">as soon as people were infected they</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.460" end="00:11:30.290" style="s2">showed symptoms and so that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.040" end="00:11:32.290" style="s2">much easier to catch the infection as</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.290" end="00:11:34.910" style="s2">soon as somebody has symptoms you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.290" end="00:11:38.839" style="s2">isolate them and check them and etc but</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.910" end="00:11:41.000" style="s2">for this disease you can so you can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.839" end="00:11:43.610" style="s2">sick for a week without showing symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.000" end="00:11:45.380" style="s2">which means so you know lots of places</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.610" end="00:11:47.930" style="s2">and affect on some other people before</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.380" end="00:11:51.230" style="s2">you show sutures so that the impact here</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.930" end="00:11:53.300" style="s2">is is almost entirely due to the nature</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.230" end="00:11:55.610" style="s2">of the disease rather than the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.300" end="00:11:57.110" style="s2">being different than right right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.610" end="00:11:59.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had these sorts of diseases</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.110" end="00:12:01.790" style="s2">for centuries of course and and our</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.480" end="00:12:03.890" style="s2">world has changed but you know every</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.790" end="00:12:06.620" style="s2">five years or so we have another thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.890" end="00:12:08.540" style="s2">somewhat like this but you know they</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.620" end="00:12:12.620" style="s2">vary in sort of how easy it is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.540" end="00:12:15.140" style="s2">character like AIDS right HIV well you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.620" end="00:12:17.810" style="s2">know thanks contrary to fears that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.140" end="00:12:20.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t be patched by handshaking or</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.810" end="00:12:22.310" style="s2">coughing or you know touching doorknobs</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.390" end="00:12:26.140" style="s2">etc you you have to be pretty close to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.310" end="00:12:30.380" style="s2">someone physically to catch aids right</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.140" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">HIV so this disease is relatively easy</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.380" end="00:12:37.520" style="s2">to pass on in the air which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:38.839" style="s2">severe so because that means were around</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.520" end="00:12:40.610" style="s2">each other a lot and we breathe around</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.839" end="00:12:44.030" style="s2">each other a lot and that&#39;s why I&#39;m ask</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.610" end="00:12:45.770" style="s2">might be good idea so yes they differ</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.030" end="00:12:50.080" style="s2">and how easy how they&#39;re caught how easy</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.770" end="00:12:55.610" style="s2">their catch whether you show symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.080" end="00:12:59.060" style="s2">when you&#39;re initially sick and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.610" end="00:13:00.470" style="s2">how fast you go severe and then what let</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.060" end="00:13:05.300" style="s2">the chance of dying is there just a huge</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.470" end="00:13:07.580" style="s2">range of these things cool there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.300" end="00:13:13.160" style="s2">of questions coming in Narayan</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.580" end="00:13:15.890" style="s2">you had a few questions yeah I&#39;m curious</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.610" end="00:14:53.550" style="s2">there a way in which I can actually take</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.170" end="00:14:55.200" style="s2">some of these ideas and help coordinate</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:10.890" style="s2">areas so one of the things is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.950" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">another medical literature research if</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.890" end="00:15:15.990" style="s2">you have medical expertise and a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:18.060" style="s2">of things there that you could do but</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.990" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">basically I&#39;m just trying to get other</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.060" end="00:15:21.480" style="s2">people to pay attention I presume that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:23.100" style="s2">if other people started to do more in</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.480" end="00:15:24.570" style="s2">this I would suddenly be a small part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.100" end="00:15:25.950" style="s2">this in the background because people</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.570" end="00:15:27.870" style="s2">will be I&#39;m just one person a lot where</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.950" end="00:15:29.220" style="s2">people will be doing other things but at</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.870" end="00:15:30.899" style="s2">the moment so I&#39;ve looked out there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.220" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">I found five other people in the last</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.899" end="00:15:36.750" style="s2">month - maybe voice similar ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:38.459" style="s2">helped you know pocha them somewhere you</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.750" end="00:15:43.699" style="s2">know pursuing it with some mild degree</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.459" end="00:15:50.339" style="s2">but that&#39;s obviously not enough okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.699" end="00:15:52.230" style="s2">Roku you just had a question yeah hi hi</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.339" end="00:15:53.670" style="s2">Robin I mean basic basically my question</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.230" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">is just going over what you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.670" end="00:15:59.310" style="s2">said you know anything that you could do</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.800" style="s2">with deliberate infection it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.310" end="00:16:03.779" style="s2">is is quite likely you could do better</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.800" end="00:16:06.810" style="s2">with a vaccine and do you think people</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.779" end="00:16:10.140" style="s2">have done a cost-benefit analysis on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.810" end="00:16:12.300" style="s2">cost of letting people die versus the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.140" end="00:16:13.949" style="s2">cost of a vaccine that has some risks</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.300" end="00:16:16.199" style="s2">associated with it versus the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.949" end="00:16:18.870" style="s2">lock down because I did that calculation</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.199" end="00:16:20.850" style="s2">just now and it seems to me that if say</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.870" end="00:16:23.640" style="s2">half a million people die then the cost</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.850" end="00:16:25.649" style="s2">of the lockdown for say six months would</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.640" end="00:16:27.540" style="s2">be substantially bigger than than the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.649" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">cost of those lives if you value them at</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.540" end="00:16:31.860" style="s2">say five million each and the cost</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:33.899" style="s2">presumably of a vaccine that&#39;s imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.860" end="00:16:38.790" style="s2">would be even lower than the cost in</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.899" end="00:16:41.250" style="s2">lives so regarding a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.790" end="00:16:43.620" style="s2">the usual conventional business which I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.250" end="00:16:45.240" style="s2">buy is that this is going to take at</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.620" end="00:16:47.250" style="s2">least 18 months and perhaps several</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.240" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">years and perhaps never but it takes</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.250" end="00:16:50.700" style="s2">that long because of the testing yes but</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:52.020" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.700" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to use one without</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.020" end="00:16:58.050" style="s2">testing it because most of them are</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:59.760" style="s2">don&#39;t work and some of them hurt so yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.050" end="00:17:02.250" style="s2">we don&#39;t all don&#39;t want to be using a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.760" end="00:17:05.370" style="s2">vaccine until it&#39;s tested now there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.250" end="00:17:07.560" style="s2">the claim which I find plausible that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.370" end="00:17:10.829" style="s2">should be less shy about how we test</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.560" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">so typically we either test on some</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.829" end="00:17:15.720" style="s2">other virus that&#39;s letting it but not as</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:17.699" style="s2">definitely in this case or we test on</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.720" end="00:17:19.260" style="s2">all population of people and then wait</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.699" end="00:17:21.390" style="s2">to see which of them get infected and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.260" end="00:17:22.770" style="s2">then see how that helps them rather than</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.390" end="00:17:25.500" style="s2">the more direct way of testing it which</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.770" end="00:17:27.209" style="s2">is in fact some people right after you</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.500" end="00:17:29.220" style="s2">gave them the vaccine and see if the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.209" end="00:17:30.510" style="s2">vaccine protected them now apparently</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.220" end="00:17:32.970" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing that yet and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.510" end="00:17:35.070" style="s2">would be faster but of course those</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.970" end="00:17:36.660" style="s2">people would take more of a risk but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.070" end="00:17:38.430" style="s2">certainly seems cost-effective to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.660" end="00:17:40.470" style="s2">nobody doubts the cost-effectiveness of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.430" end="00:17:42.690" style="s2">that or that people would volunteer they</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.470" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">just think there&#39;s an ethical issue with</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.690" end="00:17:46.130" style="s2">letting people volunteer to help save</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">millions of lives</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.130" end="00:17:53.180" style="s2">which seems crazy to me but maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.020" end="00:17:57.180" style="s2">are so but even with faster testing</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.180" end="00:18:00.540" style="s2">basically there are many dozens of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.180" end="00:18:03.030" style="s2">vaccine proposals out there most likely</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.540" end="00:18:04.980" style="s2">most of them don&#39;t work so a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.030" end="00:18:06.390" style="s2">searching isn&#39;t just like you do it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.980" end="00:18:08.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not you you have to search in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.390" end="00:18:10.620" style="s2">space of variations basically you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.520" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">taking the live virus and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.620" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">changing it in a bunch of ways so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:16.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not deadly but that maybe your body</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:18.540" style="s2">would latch on to the same thing but</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.530" end="00:18:21.870" style="s2">searching a lot of things to find out so</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.540" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">yeah I mean is it coming I I did</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.870" end="00:18:25.110" style="s2">actually see some sorry sorry to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:27.630" style="s2">interrupt I did see some people who were</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.110" end="00:18:29.700" style="s2">looking at synthetic RNA vaccines where</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.630" end="00:18:31.770" style="s2">you actually you actually don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.700" end="00:18:34.020" style="s2">use life vaccine but that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.770" end="00:18:36.210" style="s2">debate so I mean I guess my question was</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.020" end="00:18:41.040" style="s2">just in the space of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.210" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">trade-offs you know is violation or</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.040" end="00:18:45.510" style="s2">deliberate exposure really optimal</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:47.730" style="s2">should we maybe just try to persuade the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.510" end="00:18:49.920" style="s2">vaccine people to do their thing much</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.730" end="00:18:51.630" style="s2">more aggressively and just oh so they</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.920" end="00:18:53.340" style="s2">they still say that even if you do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.630" end="00:18:56.700" style="s2">more aggressively you&#39;re talking you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.340" end="00:18:59.130" style="s2">know at least six months here so in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.700" end="00:19:00.660" style="s2">next month six months it seems likely</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.130" end="00:19:02.040" style="s2">that maybe everybody would already be</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.660" end="00:19:02.970" style="s2">infected you see by the time the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.040" end="00:19:05.460" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.970" end="00:19:07.049" style="s2">well this is doubling it was doubling</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.460" end="00:19:08.640" style="s2">initially every week and now in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.049" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">places seem to be doubling every few</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:15.059" style="s2">communal three days at that rate you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.590" style="s2">don&#39;t have six months that you talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.059" end="00:19:19.080" style="s2">about trade offs the other trade-off is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.590" end="00:19:21.510" style="s2">between how hard to try to suppress how</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.080" end="00:19:24.530" style="s2">hard to clamp down in order to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.510" end="00:19:26.909" style="s2">growth and even suppress the virus and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.530" end="00:19:29.309" style="s2">as you know a lot of places have gone</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.909" end="00:19:34.679" style="s2">harder on suppression in the last two</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.309" end="00:19:37.409" style="s2">weeks but apparently not enough that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.679" end="00:19:39.780" style="s2">even now on average most places are</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.409" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">still allowing the virus to grow not</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.780" end="00:19:45.330" style="s2">shrink but just at a slower rate now as</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:46.860" style="s2">long as we&#39;re doing that that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.330" end="00:19:50.340" style="s2">more time to try to set up for your</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.860" end="00:19:52.110" style="s2">variation if say this has peaked in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.340" end="00:19:53.850" style="s2">within three weeks and the in three</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.110" end="00:19:56.010" style="s2">weeks the entire world got it then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.850" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t do anything to try to eat too</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.010" end="00:20:01.890" style="s2">fast but if we&#39;re gonna try really hard</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:06.929" style="s2">to suppress and we failed we might take</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.890" end="00:20:09.270" style="s2">a couple months to fail and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.929" end="00:20:10.590" style="s2">you know give us a chance to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.270" end="00:20:13.230" style="s2">something like this so you know in</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.590" end="00:20:16.350" style="s2">general spreading out over time again</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.230" end="00:20:18.210" style="s2">gives us each a chance to to have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.350" end="00:20:21.000" style="s2">bigger slice of the medical system</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.210" end="00:20:23.460" style="s2">devoted to us which is good on the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.000" end="00:20:24.870" style="s2">hand isolating people means they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.460" end="00:20:28.020" style="s2">more likely to get a high dose which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.870" end="00:20:34.530" style="s2">bad so it&#39;s not clear whether that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.020" end="00:20:38.460" style="s2">trade-off okay let&#39;s go to Kaitlyn</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.530" end="00:20:40.950" style="s2">Grimes you had a question yes I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.460" end="00:20:43.409" style="s2">wondering like how do we choose who gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.950" end="00:20:45.510" style="s2">infected so if the death rate is high</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.409" end="00:20:48.690" style="s2">for elderly people and people with</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.510" end="00:20:50.760" style="s2">underlying conditions then do we infect</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.690" end="00:20:53.549" style="s2">them like would it be ethical to do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.760" end="00:20:55.799" style="s2">or do we only infect people who are at a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.549" end="00:21:01.020" style="s2">low risk and then keep the two groups</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.799" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">separated so both in the last week I</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.020" end="00:21:08.010" style="s2">realized there was this dose effect that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">was really powerful and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.010" end="00:21:10.890" style="s2">focused on that but in the previous</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:13.409" style="s2">weeks I had just been focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.890" end="00:21:14.700" style="s2">benefits of deliberate infection even</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.409" end="00:21:17.519" style="s2">without this dose</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.700" end="00:21:19.830" style="s2">where I calculated it was at least a 20%</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.519" end="00:21:22.169" style="s2">reduction in deaths just using that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.830" end="00:21:24.119" style="s2">a 20% for another thing so in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.169" end="00:21:28.350" style="s2">analysis what I found that the optimal</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.119" end="00:21:30.029" style="s2">thing to do was you know there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.350" end="00:21:31.259" style="s2">things you can do you can have isolation</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.029" end="00:21:32.669" style="s2">or you just isolate people that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.259" end="00:21:33.929" style="s2">don&#39;t affect them of course now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.669" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">more protective and then you could also</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.929" end="00:21:39.299" style="s2">deliberately infect people expose them</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.590" end="00:21:40.649" style="s2">so in my analysis it was better to take</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.299" end="00:21:43.919" style="s2">the young and healthy and deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.649" end="00:21:48.749" style="s2">expose them and isolate the old and said</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.919" end="00:21:50.970" style="s2">and that cut deaths 40% below randomly</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.749" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">doing no deliberate infection and just</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.970" end="00:21:56.129" style="s2">screen in my solution so 40% I thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:58.499" style="s2">was a lot of course now we&#39;re talking in</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.129" end="00:22:01.559" style="s2">factor of 3 to 30 which is which is far</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.499" end="00:22:05.940" style="s2">more bigger but even then I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.559" end="00:22:07.559" style="s2">of volunteers not where Zika so I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.940" end="00:22:10.169" style="s2">thinking you play make a place where</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.559" end="00:22:12.090" style="s2">people could go get infected and but</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.169" end="00:22:13.590" style="s2">they would volunteer for it now if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.090" end="00:22:15.899" style="s2">thought it was a good policy maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.590" end="00:22:17.909" style="s2">all want to subsidize that and encourage</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.899" end="00:22:20.129" style="s2">it sort of conquer the expenses maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.909" end="00:22:21.690" style="s2">adds a bonus maybe we&#39;d want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.129" end="00:22:22.859" style="s2">more for critical care workers like</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.690" end="00:22:24.629" style="s2">medical workers people who work</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.859" end="00:22:27.869" style="s2">electrical electrical systems things</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.629" end="00:22:31.529" style="s2">like that but the idea was just to take</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.869" end="00:22:34.940" style="s2">volunteers rather than force people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.529" end="00:22:37.289" style="s2">ok sorry did you take into account</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.940" end="00:22:39.169" style="s2">people who would accidentally get</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.289" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">infected anyway and still be</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.169" end="00:22:45.529" style="s2">transmitting it within the community</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:48.149" style="s2">well that&#39;s what&#39;s already happening so</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.529" end="00:22:50.429" style="s2">that analysis was including that usual</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.149" end="00:22:54.299" style="s2">effect of course adding this other</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.429" end="00:22:55.830" style="s2">effect of assuming there&#39;s a rate at</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.299" end="00:22:57.570" style="s2">which people are infecting each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.830" end="00:22:59.159" style="s2">accidentally and now we add a place</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.570" end="00:23:01.259" style="s2">where people can go and quarantine where</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.159" end="00:23:02.970" style="s2">they have a small or a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.259" end="00:23:04.889" style="s2">infecting each other because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.970" end="00:23:07.169" style="s2">more protected and then we use part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.889" end="00:23:08.669" style="s2">that quarantine space to deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.169" end="00:23:10.399" style="s2">infect people and then keep them</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.669" end="00:23:13.470" style="s2">isolated there till they recovered and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.399" end="00:23:17.190" style="s2">that&#39;s the analysis that produced you</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.470" end="00:23:21.049" style="s2">know 40% reduction in death rates ok I</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.190" end="00:23:21.049" style="s2">see thank you ok</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.250" end="00:23:26.830" style="s2">okay Siddarth you had a few questions</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:36.500" style="s2">first I just wanted to start with so</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.020" end="00:23:38.420" style="s2">whether if so let&#39;s say we consider</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.500" end="00:23:40.820" style="s2">health care workers and for them this</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.420" end="00:23:44.150" style="s2">might be the most bang for the buck</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.820" end="00:23:48.040" style="s2">because they&#39;re the ones highest risk of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.150" end="00:23:51.710" style="s2">receiving high doses of the wider then</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.040" end="00:23:55.070" style="s2">it seems that strategies which provide</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.710" end="00:23:57.550" style="s2">sufficient personal protection to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.070" end="00:24:02.140" style="s2">health care workers are successful in</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.550" end="00:24:04.760" style="s2">Taiwan and Korea and Singapore so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.140" end="00:24:07.430" style="s2">suspect that one counter-argument to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.760" end="00:24:09.170" style="s2">this proposal would be the we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.430" end="00:24:11.420" style="s2">to do this risky thing we already have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.170" end="00:24:14.300" style="s2">solution to protect these people we just</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.420" end="00:24:17.960" style="s2">need to do it properly which we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.300" end="00:24:20.630" style="s2">currently doing it so I was hearing</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.960" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">about what you thought about that well</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.630" end="00:24:23.930" style="s2">so I&#39;m not clear about what you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:25.610" style="s2">talking protecting the health care</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.930" end="00:24:29.570" style="s2">workers themselves or the entire society</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.610" end="00:24:31.040" style="s2">so if an entire society becomes infected</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.570" end="00:24:33.860" style="s2">the health care workers are eventually</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.040" end="00:24:36.170" style="s2">ending the effective cure themselves for</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.860" end="00:24:39.020" style="s2">that so you might be talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.170" end="00:24:42.770" style="s2">you could say Taiwan and Singapore and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.020" end="00:24:44.780" style="s2">South Korea have already so far seem to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.770" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">successfully repress this why can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.780" end="00:24:48.830" style="s2">do that you know that&#39;s not what I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:50.360" style="s2">asking because I know that they started</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.830" end="00:24:52.580" style="s2">early and they started and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.360" end="00:24:54.980" style="s2">certainly so I know that they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.580" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">there that that strategy is too late for</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.980" end="00:25:00.830" style="s2">many countries all right what are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:02.420" style="s2">very least it&#39;s not also even assuming</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.830" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">we could temporarily protect our health</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.420" end="00:25:06.530" style="s2">care workers with some yeah not nothing</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.450" style="s2">still we have the question of what about</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.530" end="00:25:10.310" style="s2">the rest of us right if we&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.450" end="00:25:12.590" style="s2">get it up soon and we&#39;re all gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.310" end="00:25:15.380" style="s2">it accidentally we&#39;re gonna suffer you</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.590" end="00:25:16.700" style="s2">know the usual accidental death rate get</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.380" end="00:25:20.030" style="s2">on this could we do better</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.700" end="00:25:22.610" style="s2">sure yeah that&#39;s fair I just thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.030" end="00:25:25.100" style="s2">that the gates of strongest to that kid</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.610" end="00:25:30.280" style="s2">another question is it okay Peter if I</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.100" end="00:25:32.150" style="s2">jump on it okay so I office on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.280" end="00:25:33.779" style="s2">but I&#39;ll just toss it again</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.150" end="00:25:35.190" style="s2">in case your</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.779" end="00:25:39.590" style="s2">you have some new thinking on this which</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.190" end="00:25:44.129" style="s2">was that why hasn&#39;t this been done for</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.590" end="00:25:46.739" style="s2">why this is other than smallpox and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.129" end="00:25:47.729" style="s2">and one part that I had and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.739" end="00:25:49.830" style="s2">you think about it is that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.729" end="00:25:52.769" style="s2">really hard to isolate it was really</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.830" end="00:25:54.359" style="s2">hard to isolate widel samples for</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.769" end="00:25:57.359" style="s2">anything other than smallpox because</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.359" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">smallpox had the quote-unquote benefit</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.359" end="00:26:01.769" style="s2">that there were scabs on your skin that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:04.440" style="s2">you could pick up and kind and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.769" end="00:26:06.570" style="s2">store in a way that transports and keeps</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.440" end="00:26:08.669" style="s2">for a long periods of time so but</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.570" end="00:26:11.789" style="s2">portfolio it&#39;s not clear what you would</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.669" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">keep so I guess do you think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.789" end="00:26:15.599" style="s2">possible leading that now we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:18.089" style="s2">cultivate vital samples in the lab from</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.599" end="00:26:21.479" style="s2">you know from infected people so perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.089" end="00:26:23.489" style="s2">that objection doesn&#39;t really work so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.479" end="00:26:26.759" style="s2">mean again I&#39;m not an expert in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.489" end="00:26:28.769" style="s2">area but my understanding is that over</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.759" end="00:26:31.859" style="s2">the last century we&#39;ve gotten used to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.769" end="00:26:33.299" style="s2">the vaccine solution and we think of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.859" end="00:26:34.950" style="s2">that as the advanced solution and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.299" end="00:26:36.779" style="s2">variolation thing is the old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.950" end="00:26:40.259" style="s2">thing that you used to do long before we</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.779" end="00:26:41.460" style="s2">do how to do other thing and vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.259" end="00:26:43.320" style="s2">are fine for a disease that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.460" end="00:26:45.599" style="s2">around for a while because you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.320" end="00:26:47.299" style="s2">two years it takes to develop one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.599" end="00:26:49.109" style="s2">not a problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.299" end="00:26:51.239" style="s2">vaccines are only a problem for these</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.109" end="00:26:53.279" style="s2">very new things and so far we basically</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.239" end="00:26:57.929" style="s2">squashed all the new things relatively</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.279" end="00:26:59.309" style="s2">quickly through you know trace except</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.929" end="00:27:01.460" style="s2">for things like influenza where the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.309" end="00:27:05.339" style="s2">death rate was really relatively low and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.460" end="00:27:06.690" style="s2">so you know we weren&#39;t I guess they</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.339" end="00:27:11.070" style="s2">weren&#39;t thinking about I don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.690" end="00:27:12.929" style="s2">um I wish I knew why current you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.070" end="00:27:13.499" style="s2">standard professionals aren&#39;t all over</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.929" end="00:27:15.299" style="s2">this already</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.499" end="00:27:16.529" style="s2">why they are talking about it why why</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.299" end="00:27:18.659" style="s2">they&#39;re on reason but but I could</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.529" end="00:27:19.950" style="s2">imagine that just so far they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.659" end="00:27:21.539" style="s2">have to go there or they didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.950" end="00:27:24.149" style="s2">pressured to go there because their</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.539" end="00:27:26.639" style="s2">other their toolkit need to work and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.149" end="00:27:30.419" style="s2">that this does feel and look bad people</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.639" end="00:27:32.519" style="s2">that is infecting you with the actual</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.419" end="00:27:33.179" style="s2">virus whether you have an actual chance</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.519" end="00:27:35.909" style="s2">of dying</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.179" end="00:27:39.149" style="s2">seems pretty old-fashioned than and mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.909" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">and you know crude what they had to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.149" end="00:27:43.529" style="s2">in the old days but we modern people</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:45.010" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have to deal with that in one</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.529" end="00:27:47.460" style="s2">final question in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.010" end="00:27:50.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a croco brought up the question of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.460" end="00:27:54.220" style="s2">so let&#39;s say we remove barriers to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.380" end="00:27:56.890" style="s2">testing on white asses and allow the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.220" end="00:27:58.600" style="s2">participants of clinical trials to take</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.890" end="00:28:01.000" style="s2">much higher risks than they currently do</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.600" end="00:28:03.610" style="s2">then it seems possible that we might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.000" end="00:28:07.330" style="s2">able to get a reasonably effective</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.610" end="00:28:09.220" style="s2">reasonably safe vaccine within six</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.330" end="00:28:12.040" style="s2">months and I think six months might also</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.220" end="00:28:14.650" style="s2">be the time skill on which the video</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.040" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">Latian strategy would have to be tested</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.650" end="00:28:20.140" style="s2">and tried in small-scale trials before</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">society would be willing in any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.140" end="00:28:25.299" style="s2">way to accept it because I just think</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:26.770" style="s2">yeah well so it&#39;s a big world</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.299" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">we&#39;re regarding the entire world&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.770" end="00:28:33.340" style="s2">be affected by this so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">United States so given how big and very</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.340" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">the world is I could certainly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:41.320" style="s2">some part of the world trying this with</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:42.280" style="s2">less solid pre-testing so again yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.320" end="00:28:45.730" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about people who are going</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.280" end="00:28:48.370" style="s2">to get this anyway and so do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.730" end="00:28:50.620" style="s2">try some way to get a smaller dose even</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.370" end="00:28:52.380" style="s2">if it&#39;s not as solid a dataset as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.620" end="00:28:54.340" style="s2">might get after a six month big study</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.380" end="00:28:55.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not crazy there&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.340" end="00:28:57.400" style="s2">somewhere in the world will think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.900" end="00:29:00.669" style="s2">worth the try</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.400" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">so it&#39;s not obvious to me that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.669" end="00:29:05.620" style="s2">have to wait six months then again like</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.190" end="00:29:07.780" style="s2">this is not simpler right we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.620" end="00:29:10.630" style="s2">gonna look it&#39;s ways to do smaller doses</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.780" end="00:29:11.710" style="s2">basically but ways to have contact let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.630" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">say somebody you&#39;re sick in a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.710" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">dose there&#39;s just a lot of simple things</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:16.620" style="s2">to experiment it&#39;s not that complicated</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:19.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you have to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.620" end="00:29:23.590" style="s2">necessarily chemical things or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.020" end="00:29:25.750" style="s2">but again what I hear is that vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.590" end="00:29:28.210" style="s2">will take a while even if we accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.750" end="00:29:30.130" style="s2">the testing and and also just this is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.210" end="00:29:33.940" style="s2">plan D I mean let&#39;s try to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.130" end="00:29:36.460" style="s2">that guinea pls pursue the vaccine yes I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.940" end="00:29:39.309" style="s2">don&#39;t mean it&#39;s a try for that but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.460" end="00:29:41.620" style="s2">set up a plan B let&#39;s at least be ready</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.309" end="00:29:43.660" style="s2">to do something else that vaccines don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.620" end="00:29:44.860" style="s2">come and even if it doesn&#39;t turn out to</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.660" end="00:29:46.150" style="s2">be neither for this kind of thing you</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.860" end="00:29:49.000" style="s2">know what this is not gonna be the last</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.150" end="00:29:50.559" style="s2">pandemic this is in some sense a dress</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.000" end="00:29:52.090" style="s2">rehearsal for something even bigger that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:55.900" style="s2">will come down the line that will matter</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.090" end="00:29:57.410" style="s2">even more right so Amy you had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.900" end="00:30:00.750" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.410" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">yeah and my question is kind of related</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.750" end="00:30:05.880" style="s2">to the idea of the places where this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:08.790" style="s2">happening I live in New York City and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.880" end="00:30:10.680" style="s2">mean even my video is not working but if</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.790" end="00:30:12.360" style="s2">I showed you what I can see right now I</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.680" end="00:30:15.270" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t think that this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.360" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">work here I think that for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.270" end="00:30:20.160" style="s2">this is a in deliberate or non</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:22.020" style="s2">deliberate infection that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.160" end="00:30:24.840" style="s2">here so I&#39;m wondering if a place like</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.020" end="00:30:26.880" style="s2">New York City that is so dense and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.840" end="00:30:28.860" style="s2">heavily populated so many people getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.880" end="00:30:30.510" style="s2">infected so many more people are very</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.860" end="00:30:33.450" style="s2">much likely to get infected will that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.510" end="00:30:37.550" style="s2">eventually become like a haven to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.450" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">trial of this type of deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.550" end="00:30:43.940" style="s2">infections and I think at some point</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:47.190" style="s2">it&#39;ll taper off just as it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.940" end="00:30:52.530" style="s2">hotter in other parts of the country in</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.190" end="00:30:54.330" style="s2">the world not clear how the level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.530" end="00:30:56.370" style="s2">infection in area really affects</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.330" end="00:30:59.700" style="s2">people&#39;s willingness to do trials about</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.370" end="00:31:02.250" style="s2">this sort of thing there are several</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.700" end="00:31:04.620" style="s2">conflicting factors and I don&#39;t see a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.250" end="00:31:06.330" style="s2">clear answer now it&#39;s clear that if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.620" end="00:31:10.440" style="s2">if there&#39;s almost no threat of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.330" end="00:31:12.510" style="s2">that people are and as the threat gets</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.440" end="00:31:13.560" style="s2">larger they get more motivated to deal</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.510" end="00:31:15.240" style="s2">something with something but then they</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.560" end="00:31:18.570" style="s2">also just more scared and hunker down</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.240" end="00:31:21.630" style="s2">and not being reflective or willing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.570" end="00:31:23.880" style="s2">take chances and so and less able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.630" end="00:31:25.410" style="s2">coordinate so it&#39;s not clear to me that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.880" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">one year the peak of this that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.410" end="00:31:28.890" style="s2">time people would be willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:30.630" style="s2">something organized together they might</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.890" end="00:31:34.380" style="s2">be desperately willing to do something</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.630" end="00:31:36.300" style="s2">personally but I&#39;m less optimistic about</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.380" end="00:31:39.000" style="s2">individual random people trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.300" end="00:31:41.970" style="s2">deliberately infect themselves more</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.000" end="00:31:46.740" style="s2">optimistic about us organizing some way</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.970" end="00:31:48.800" style="s2">to do that together by like doing some</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.740" end="00:31:50.850" style="s2">trials and some collecting some data</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.800" end="00:31:53.670" style="s2">public you know telling each other what</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.850" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried and then some so in my post</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.670" end="00:31:57.630" style="s2">I&#39;d talk about how you might have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:59.580" style="s2">place like take an old hotel that at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.630" end="00:32:01.650" style="s2">moment isn&#39;t being used or university</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.580" end="00:32:03.930" style="s2">campus and bring people there all</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.650" end="00:32:05.670" style="s2">together deliberately they look in fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.930" end="00:32:08.460" style="s2">a whole cohort of people at the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.670" end="00:32:09.600" style="s2">time then they can be there together and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.460" end="00:32:12.179" style="s2">socialize and interact</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.600" end="00:32:13.679" style="s2">and and you with a large cohort you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.179" end="00:32:14.940" style="s2">just try different variations in</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.679" end="00:32:17.820" style="s2">different ways to infect them and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.940" end="00:32:22.260" style="s2">different apparently antivirals that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.820" end="00:32:24.870" style="s2">slow the virus growth rate and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.260" end="00:32:26.910" style="s2">with even just a few thousand people you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.870" end="00:32:30.419" style="s2">could do a lot of experimentation and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.910" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">find out what worked best but just</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.419" end="00:32:33.330" style="s2">individuals who are scared hunkering</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:35.429" style="s2">down and New York finally deciding they</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.330" end="00:32:38.039" style="s2">want to do this on tomorrow because</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.429" end="00:32:39.750" style="s2">they&#39;re scared I mean that might help</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.039" end="00:32:41.909" style="s2">but I mean they&#39;re taking big chances</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.750" end="00:32:44.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to be harder to collect</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.909" end="00:32:45.950" style="s2">data out of that so the rest of us could</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.280" end="00:32:50.220" style="s2">learn from it</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.950" end="00:32:53.030" style="s2">Jake you had a question yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.220" end="00:32:56.250" style="s2">Robin so my question is just about how</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.030" end="00:32:57.659" style="s2">how high a percentage of compliance you</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.250" end="00:32:59.909" style="s2">would need given that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.659" end="00:33:01.650" style="s2">about volunteers in order for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.909" end="00:33:03.570" style="s2">effective at the kind of scale that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.650" end="00:33:05.909" style="s2">wanted to and do you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.570" end="00:33:08.370" style="s2">suspicion that you would have low</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.909" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">compliance in addition to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.370" end="00:33:12.270" style="s2">the optics of kind of coercing people</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.710" style="s2">into doing this would be very bad given</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.270" end="00:33:15.809" style="s2">that some some small percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.710" end="00:33:18.000" style="s2">people are going to die do you think</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.809" end="00:33:20.419" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s not being considered</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:23.010" style="s2">more broadly that people just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.419" end="00:33:24.900" style="s2">assume that people be willing to infect</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.010" end="00:33:27.059" style="s2">themselves when they have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.900" end="00:33:28.590" style="s2">last-ditch eye idea in their mind that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.059" end="00:33:30.150" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t accidentally get infected</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.590" end="00:33:31.640" style="s2">that they could comply with social</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.150" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">distancing measures and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.640" end="00:33:37.470" style="s2">so you know I&#39;m an economist and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">economist very much distinguish things</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.470" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">that you do that you benefit you</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:42.630" style="s2">personally from things that we could do</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:45.750" style="s2">together that benefits us collectively</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.630" end="00:33:47.580" style="s2">even if some of us suffer personally and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.750" end="00:33:50.370" style="s2">obviously social distancing and other</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.580" end="00:33:53.490" style="s2">sort of policies are presented and are</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.370" end="00:33:55.409" style="s2">in many ways social policies that if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.490" end="00:33:58.409" style="s2">if enough of us do it together we could</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.409" end="00:34:00.270" style="s2">together get benefits and so if any one</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.409" end="00:34:01.980" style="s2">person deviates by saying on social</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.270" end="00:34:04.169" style="s2">distancing and the rest of us feel like</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.980" end="00:34:06.059" style="s2">we should socially shame them and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.169" end="00:34:08.250" style="s2">discourage them in order to get the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.059" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">collective to do what we all need this</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.250" end="00:34:13.590" style="s2">is not a social collective policy this</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.000" end="00:34:15.810" style="s2">is something that you can personally</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.590" end="00:34:18.570" style="s2">benefit from possibly that is if there</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.810" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">is in fact a factor of 3 to 30 reduction</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.570" end="00:34:22.379" style="s2">in your death rate because you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:23.600" style="s2">deliberately in fact involuntarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.379" end="00:34:25.010" style="s2">infected</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.600" end="00:34:27.169" style="s2">that&#39;s something you might want to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.010" end="00:34:29.150" style="s2">for your own personal benefit we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.169" end="00:34:31.220" style="s2">have to push you into that and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.150" end="00:34:32.690" style="s2">there&#39;s no minimum threshold for being</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.220" end="00:34:34.880" style="s2">effective the more people that do it the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.690" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">better so it can just be a thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.880" end="00:34:39.500" style="s2">put out there the main thing we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:41.840" style="s2">collectively do is to allow it to give</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.500" end="00:34:43.900" style="s2">permission so we are so focused on</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.840" end="00:34:46.310" style="s2">collectively preventing people from</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.900" end="00:34:47.929" style="s2">hurting us all that we&#39;ve set up a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.310" end="00:34:50.120" style="s2">system that actually makes it hard to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.929" end="00:34:53.030" style="s2">just do this now or at least it seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.120" end="00:34:54.470" style="s2">hard so the first one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.030" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">priorities here just need to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.470" end="00:35:00.110" style="s2">to get legal permission so that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:35:03.650" style="s2">could just try to experiment with this</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.110" end="00:35:05.240" style="s2">voluntary infection and you know then</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.650" end="00:35:08.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t again you don&#39;t need the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.240" end="00:35:10.460" style="s2">to agree with you you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.080" end="00:35:13.430" style="s2">percentage of people to do it you just</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.460" end="00:35:15.950" style="s2">do it then you get to that and and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.430" end="00:35:17.720" style="s2">persuasive frame there is you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.950" end="00:35:19.160" style="s2">control the amount of your dose which</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.720" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">you&#39;d never be able to control in an</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.160" end="00:35:24.020" style="s2">accidental context and therefore vastly</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">lower your risk of death right so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.020" end="00:35:29.600" style="s2">show up to this what I call variolation</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:31.550" style="s2">village and you know maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.600" end="00:35:33.050" style="s2">cohort of a thousand people who all show</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.550" end="00:35:34.970" style="s2">up this you know say it&#39;s a university</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.050" end="00:35:37.430" style="s2">dorms or something you all show up at</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.970" end="00:35:40.400" style="s2">the same time we&#39;re all immediately</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.430" end="00:35:41.810" style="s2">isolated and immediately infected and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.400" end="00:35:43.880" style="s2">you know that that&#39;s when it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.810" end="00:35:47.060" style="s2">and then as soon as you&#39;re all you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.880" end="00:35:48.860" style="s2">verified to be affected you know either</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.060" end="00:35:50.870" style="s2">individually or statistically based on</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.860" end="00:35:52.520" style="s2">previous experience now if you can go</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.870" end="00:35:54.080" style="s2">interact with each other and then some</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.520" end="00:35:55.490" style="s2">people get sick but you&#39;ll all be we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.080" end="00:35:57.620" style="s2">all be watching out for that and once</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.490" end="00:35:59.000" style="s2">you get sick we will take to a media</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.620" end="00:36:03.320" style="s2">medical care that&#39;s available right</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.000" end="00:36:05.090" style="s2">there and and then as soon as you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.320" end="00:36:06.770" style="s2">you are completely recovered from this</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.090" end="00:36:09.230" style="s2">they even that&#39;s when you can leave this</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.770" end="00:36:11.060" style="s2">place and might just daggered classes</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.230" end="00:36:13.640" style="s2">over a week or two and different people</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.060" end="00:36:15.020" style="s2">left but you know it would have all</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:16.460" style="s2">happened in this controlled context and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.020" end="00:36:18.500" style="s2">the rest of us can be assured you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.460" end="00:36:20.300" style="s2">infecting the rest of us if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.500" end="00:36:21.350" style="s2">infecting yourself but not isolating</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.300" end="00:36:22.730" style="s2">yourself then the rest of us shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.350" end="00:36:24.590" style="s2">be much more concerned about that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.730" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">much more reluctant to letting you do</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.590" end="00:36:26.990" style="s2">that because then you&#39;re just speeding</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:32.380" style="s2">up the whole pandemic when we were all</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.990" end="00:36:32.380" style="s2">trying to slow it down Thanks</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.900" end="00:36:42.170" style="s2">okay Brian you had a question Robin I</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.689" end="00:36:46.049" style="s2">would like to hear your predictions or</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.170" end="00:36:47.130" style="s2">the number of total cases and deaths by</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.049" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">the end of 2020</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.130" end="00:36:53.279" style="s2">also your prediction for when</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:56.390" style="s2">quarantines will be lifted and also how</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.279" end="00:37:00.539" style="s2">bad you think the economy</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.390" end="00:37:03.150" style="s2">so back in mid-february when I said oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.539" end="00:37:05.009" style="s2">my god this is gonna wear everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.150" end="00:37:07.650" style="s2">other people thought that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.009" end="00:37:11.339" style="s2">silly I made a bunch of that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.650" end="00:37:15.900" style="s2">then so I think I made like 11 bets</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.339" end="00:37:19.469" style="s2">about the following would the world have</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.900" end="00:37:23.819" style="s2">more than 10 million deaths by 2022 that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.469" end="00:37:26.069" style="s2">is the end of the pom year and I got 11</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.819" end="00:37:29.099" style="s2">people to give me 10 to 1 odds that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.069" end="00:37:31.469" style="s2">was not going to happen but I still</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.099" end="00:37:33.479" style="s2">think that&#39;s you know in the ballpark of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.469" end="00:37:35.999" style="s2">something impossible to happen I also</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.479" end="00:37:37.799" style="s2">made some bets about whether 250,000</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.999" end="00:37:41.939" style="s2">people in the US would die by that same</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.799" end="00:37:44.249" style="s2">time and you know the current newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.939" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">today or yesterday said you know it</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.249" end="00:37:48.900" style="s2">would be good outcome of only a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:50.309" style="s2">thousand people died I think that means</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.900" end="00:37:56.519" style="s2">they&#39;re admitting that it&#39;s not crazy</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.309" end="00:38:01.079" style="s2">from 250,000 people yes so the economic</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.519" end="00:38:02.729" style="s2">effect is a choice we have so you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.079" end="00:38:04.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a choice about our policy</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.729" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">response I&#39;m pretty clear that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.920" end="00:38:10.439" style="s2">economic costs are high lock down is</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:12.569" style="s2">expensive we are a rich world and we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.439" end="00:38:16.019" style="s2">in some sense afford to pay a lot for</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.569" end="00:38:18.359" style="s2">things but it will be expensive and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.019" end="00:38:21.179" style="s2">key question is are we paying the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.359" end="00:38:22.679" style="s2">amount for the right thing in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.179" end="00:38:25.650" style="s2">the worst case is we pay an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.679" end="00:38:29.369" style="s2">amount and we still don&#39;t keep it from</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.650" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">spreading and then we are hit with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.369" end="00:38:37.109" style="s2">same massive death wave that we would</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:38.999" style="s2">have a hit with anyway and you know then</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.109" end="00:38:40.829" style="s2">that we don&#39;t do much about it through</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.999" end="00:38:43.049" style="s2">variation or other means and you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.829" end="00:38:45.089" style="s2">still have a peak where within the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.049" end="00:38:46.060" style="s2">roughly month most of the people in an</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.089" end="00:38:48.010" style="s2">area get sick</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.060" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">and then mostly they don&#39;t have much of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.010" end="00:38:53.740" style="s2">nautical care don&#39;t and we will either</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:56.440" style="s2">just hit that in the next few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.740" end="00:38:58.150" style="s2">because our methods are just not helping</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.440" end="00:39:00.040" style="s2">or our methods will be helping in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.150" end="00:39:04.210" style="s2">case they will slow it down and we will</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.040" end="00:39:05.950" style="s2">hit a peak in the next few months or if</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.210" end="00:39:08.440" style="s2">we&#39;re lucky and we will suppress it in</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.950" end="00:39:09.670" style="s2">the next few weeks or months so that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.440" end="00:39:12.060" style="s2">can be get smaller but I&#39;ll never go</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.670" end="00:39:14.140" style="s2">down to zero and then we&#39;re faced with</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.060" end="00:39:15.970" style="s2">repeatedly having to suppress it when it</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.140" end="00:39:17.860" style="s2">pops back up again and doing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.970" end="00:39:21.010" style="s2">indefinitely until it backseat shows up</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.860" end="00:39:22.870" style="s2">and that could also fail in which case</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.010" end="00:39:24.190" style="s2">you know we could even suppress it for</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.870" end="00:39:26.200" style="s2">six months that great expense and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.190" end="00:39:32.410" style="s2">it still pops up and takes over and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.200" end="00:39:37.480" style="s2">still have all the same death okay no</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.410" end="00:39:39.250" style="s2">I&#39;m you had a question what some</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.480" end="00:39:41.470" style="s2">countries like some countries do more</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.250" end="00:39:43.570" style="s2">politically and legally amenable in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.470" end="00:39:45.670" style="s2">United States or Canada or most Western</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.570" end="00:39:47.590" style="s2">countries to a burial Asian village</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.670" end="00:39:50.410" style="s2">experiment and under what circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.590" end="00:39:53.470" style="s2">might the data gathered there be useful</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.410" end="00:39:56.440" style="s2">to us I&#39;m sure the data would be very</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.470" end="00:39:57.940" style="s2">useful that is this this disease isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.440" end="00:39:59.650" style="s2">very different for different people in</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.940" end="00:40:02.380" style="s2">the world at least that&#39;s the current</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.650" end="00:40:04.030" style="s2">thinking there has been substantial</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.380" end="00:40:05.950" style="s2">variation around the world and people</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.030" end="00:40:07.630" style="s2">are puzzling over that and I think dos</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.950" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">attacks are one plausible contribution</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.630" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">to those big variations but I think an</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:13.690" style="s2">experiment most anywhere would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:15.790" style="s2">informative and of course the main</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.690" end="00:40:18.370" style="s2">things would just be you find out well</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.790" end="00:40:19.810" style="s2">what how do you deliver a small dose and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.370" end="00:40:20.830" style="s2">then what&#39;s the death rate associated</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.810" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">with that and then there&#39;s some other</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.830" end="00:40:24.130" style="s2">questions like do you take it in your</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:25.990" style="s2">mouth you take it you breathe that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.130" end="00:40:27.970" style="s2">do it on the skin what will be the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.990" end="00:40:29.650" style="s2">to deliver it and then there&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.970" end="00:40:32.770" style="s2">said antivirals that might in</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.650" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">conjunction also help and so just</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.770" end="00:40:36.340" style="s2">whatever data they have on what people</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:39.340" style="s2">tried and what the death rates were we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.340" end="00:40:41.590" style="s2">be great wherever they did it obviously</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.340" end="00:40:44.410" style="s2">there are many places with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.590" end="00:40:45.820" style="s2">varying regulations and if it weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.410" end="00:40:47.830" style="s2">for the fact that it started in China I</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.820" end="00:40:49.240" style="s2">might have said China in the East would</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.830" end="00:40:50.710" style="s2">have been more open to this but of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.240" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">course hardly what&#39;s going on to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.710" end="00:40:54.610" style="s2">China and South Korea and Singapore</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:40:55.640" style="s2">their story now is well we&#39;ve kept it</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.610" end="00:40:58.730" style="s2">out we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.640" end="00:41:02.390" style="s2">else we&#39;re done rest the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.730" end="00:41:04.190" style="s2">yes and until they face the threat that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.390" end="00:41:05.780" style="s2">this will in fact Sweetback one to them</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.190" end="00:41:07.910" style="s2">that they can&#39;t and they can&#39;t keep it</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.780" end="00:41:10.550" style="s2">out they probably wouldn&#39;t be interested</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.910" end="00:41:12.650" style="s2">in variability until they actually felt</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.550" end="00:41:15.560" style="s2">threatened which unfortunately they</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.650" end="00:41:17.540" style="s2">probably eventually will be but then the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.560" end="00:41:22.070" style="s2">waiting for them to do that at that late</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.540" end="00:41:24.950" style="s2">date may be kinda late perhaps a country</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.070" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">like Turkey or some semi-authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.950" end="00:41:37.490" style="s2">place I have no idea it&#39;s a random thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:41.750" style="s2">I had a roaster Robin are you there</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.490" end="00:41:47.720" style="s2">looks like your camera froze turkey will</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.750" end="00:41:50.170" style="s2">say your camera froze there Robin we</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.720" end="00:41:54.410" style="s2">missed the last three seconds of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.170" end="00:41:57.170" style="s2">sorry Internet are you back you&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.410" end="00:42:00.100" style="s2">now you&#39;re good good time okay I</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.170" end="00:42:06.950" style="s2">realized if I need to change these yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.100" end="00:42:19.580" style="s2">okay so we got a question did it Dan</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:23.030" style="s2">Feldman you have a question yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.580" end="00:42:25.670" style="s2">what is your view on herd immunity and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.030" end="00:42:30.830" style="s2">how does it influence either plan a the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.670" end="00:42:35.480" style="s2">vaccine or Plan B the micro dosages with</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.830" end="00:42:38.420" style="s2">isolation so herd immunity is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.480" end="00:42:41.240" style="s2">happens when most of us get infected</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.420" end="00:42:46.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s the thing that naturally stops</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.240" end="00:42:49.400" style="s2">the whole process after that point if</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.280" end="00:42:51.530" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to suppress he prevent most</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.400" end="00:42:53.900" style="s2">people from getting infected then herd</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.530" end="00:42:57.110" style="s2">immunity isn&#39;t is a little drawing for</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.900" end="00:42:58.730" style="s2">we&#39;re going for suppression and many</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.110" end="00:43:00.740" style="s2">people are hopeful about that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.730" end="00:43:01.790" style="s2">the official focus a lot of policy is</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.740" end="00:43:03.530" style="s2">the claim that we&#39;re going to suppress</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.790" end="00:43:06.230" style="s2">I&#39;m skeptical that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.530" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">succeed but I&#39;m happy to let us try at</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.230" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">least a modest cost</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.230" end="00:43:13.569" style="s2">unless we suppress herd immunity is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.210" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">basically what we&#39;re going for</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.569" end="00:43:19.160" style="s2">it&#39;s basically most people enough people</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:23.720" style="s2">get it so that you know there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.160" end="00:43:25.609" style="s2">enough people who in fact marking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.720" end="00:43:29.530" style="s2">just a name for the scenario where most</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.609" end="00:43:29.530" style="s2">people get it so the disease can regrow</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:39.790" style="s2">Peter can I ask one follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.710" end="00:43:42.500" style="s2">yep your solution if I&#39;m getting this</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.790" end="00:43:46.180" style="s2">correct it appears to be sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.500" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">playing on perhaps libertarian or</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.180" end="00:43:55.309" style="s2">neoclassical sensibilities playing on</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:57.650" style="s2">self-interest that if I get if I go to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.309" end="00:44:00.680" style="s2">place and get microdose and get infected</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.650" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">and this protects me personally but it</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.680" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">also has this benefit and I&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:09.290" style="s2">exactly sure of the argument yet I that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:12.109" style="s2">this also benefits the collective and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.290" end="00:44:14.119" style="s2">I&#39;m just wondering am i understanding</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.109" end="00:44:15.950" style="s2">this correctly and if if I am</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.119" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">understanding this correctly do you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.950" end="00:44:20.980" style="s2">this as you know given that we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">operating in kind of a libertarian</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.339" end="00:44:39.140" style="s2">in formal political theory I of course</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.400" end="00:44:41.530" style="s2">you know know a lot of things about</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.140" end="00:44:45.079" style="s2">politics and coordination and governance</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.530" end="00:44:47.859" style="s2">but I don&#39;t really think this issue you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.079" end="00:44:51.170" style="s2">know is affected much by that stuff just</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.859" end="00:44:54.349" style="s2">in general the world sometimes you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.170" end="00:44:57.170" style="s2">we have problems where each person&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:44:57.170" end="00:45:00.740" style="s2">everybody and sometimes we have</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.199" end="00:46:02.619" style="s2">people might say no no we need to try</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.579" end="00:46:04.959" style="s2">harder and pay more cost stronger</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.619" end="00:46:07.299" style="s2">institutions coordinate that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.959" end="00:46:08.589" style="s2">standard debate and you know other</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.299" end="00:46:10.539" style="s2">points happy to engage that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.589" end="00:46:12.630" style="s2">participate there that&#39;s not issue here</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.539" end="00:46:15.489" style="s2">I here the issue is we&#39;ve set up</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.630" end="00:46:17.289" style="s2">regulatory systems to prevent people</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.489" end="00:46:19.809" style="s2">from hurting themselves with medicine</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.289" end="00:46:24.009" style="s2">but that&#39;s getting in the way of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.809" end="00:46:25.559" style="s2">way people that just help themselves if</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.009" end="00:46:29.229" style="s2">only we allow it</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.559" end="00:46:31.929" style="s2">okay so we&#39;ll have maybe two two more</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.229" end="00:46:44.890" style="s2">questions Raven you have a question for</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.929" end="00:46:47.769" style="s2">Robin yeah so let&#39;s say this proposal</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.890" end="00:46:50.109" style="s2">would work how do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.769" end="00:46:52.059" style="s2">people&#39;s like kind of intuitive or</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.109" end="00:46:54.339" style="s2">perceived risk when thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.059" end="00:46:56.380" style="s2">proposal their cognitive biases would</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.339" end="00:47:01.529" style="s2">play out in their reactions so both</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.380" end="00:47:01.529" style="s2">experts but then also the general public</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:07.900" style="s2">and also like purses a person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.279" end="00:47:13.779" style="s2">perceived level of autonomy over</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.900" end="00:47:15.909" style="s2">avoiding illness right now I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.779" end="00:47:18.039" style="s2">risk and autonomy are the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.909" end="00:47:19.449" style="s2">effects I mean I see that they are</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.039" end="00:47:21.759" style="s2">effects but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.449" end="00:47:24.369" style="s2">strongest one I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.759" end="00:47:26.559" style="s2">biggest one is just a sort of conformity</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.369" end="00:47:28.539" style="s2">and authoritarianism that people have</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.559" end="00:47:29.739" style="s2">with respect to medicine that is until</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.539" end="00:47:31.150" style="s2">the medical authorities recommend</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.739" end="00:47:34.449" style="s2">something they don&#39;t think anybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.150" end="00:47:36.049" style="s2">should do it and that&#39;s here and of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.449" end="00:47:38.420" style="s2">course until other people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.049" end="00:47:39.949" style="s2">korie&#39;s recommend many individual people</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.420" end="00:47:41.539" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do something especially</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.949" end="00:47:44.569" style="s2">regarding medical treatments or diseases</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.539" end="00:47:46.339" style="s2">or something so it&#39;s long been observed</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.569" end="00:47:48.559" style="s2">and it is true and you&#39;re seeing it now</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.339" end="00:47:50.239" style="s2">that people who are very independent and</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.559" end="00:47:51.890" style="s2">autonomous in times of peace and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.239" end="00:47:54.410" style="s2">prosperity when there is a big threat</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.890" end="00:47:55.849" style="s2">like a war or a pandemic they suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.410" end="00:47:57.199" style="s2">become much more conservative they</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.849" end="00:47:59.059" style="s2">suddenly want to give government more</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.199" end="00:48:00.380" style="s2">power they suddenly want to collective</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.059" end="00:48:03.410" style="s2">have more power they want to repress</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.380" end="00:48:05.539" style="s2">dissent repress deviation because</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.410" end="00:48:07.099" style="s2">they&#39;re scared and they think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.539" end="00:48:09.589" style="s2">all stick together with a common policy</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.099" end="00:48:12.289" style="s2">to make things work and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.589" end="00:48:14.660" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing now but unfortunately this</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.289" end="00:48:16.009" style="s2">if the authorities endorse this and if</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.660" end="00:48:17.329" style="s2">everybody else was doing it I think most</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.009" end="00:48:20.150" style="s2">people go along just fine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.329" end="00:48:21.259" style="s2">certainly what we saw in 1700 so 1700 s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.150" end="00:48:23.390" style="s2">initially a lot of people thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.259" end="00:48:25.009" style="s2">variolation was crazy and they highly</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.390" end="00:48:26.989" style="s2">opposed to it&#39;s like the ancient actuals</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.009" end="00:48:28.429" style="s2">today it will they keep but once the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.989" end="00:48:31.130" style="s2">authorities ignited most people were</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.429" end="00:48:33.890" style="s2">doing it then most people did it and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.130" end="00:48:36.349" style="s2">was it was a standard thing to do and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.890" end="00:48:37.969" style="s2">that&#39;s just more than dominant factor</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.349" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">here&#39;s about conformity and authority</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.969" end="00:48:46.819" style="s2">and less about your personal calculation</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:48.229" style="s2">of risk unfortunately yeah obviously</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.819" end="00:48:49.939" style="s2">it&#39;s how you frame it right you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.229" end="00:48:51.739" style="s2">think I&#39;m gonna go in this place and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.939" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">might die sure but of course I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.739" end="00:48:54.769" style="s2">stay out here and I might die you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:48:57.049" style="s2">thinking about the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.769" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">not going in and going in that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.049" end="00:49:01.339" style="s2">different framing then thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.989" style="s2">the absolute risk and then first we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.339" end="00:49:05.479" style="s2">this framing about longer we let other</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.989" end="00:49:07.489" style="s2">people take and so even today as other</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.479" end="00:49:09.559" style="s2">would mentioned people have proposed</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.489" end="00:49:11.719" style="s2">accelerated vaccine trials where people</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.559" end="00:49:13.309" style="s2">are paid in order to get the actual</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.719" end="00:49:15.739" style="s2">virus and then a vaccine and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.309" end="00:49:17.059" style="s2">people oppose that that&#39;s an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.739" end="00:49:18.949" style="s2">issue for a lot of people even at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.059" end="00:49:20.809" style="s2">moment and so this would bring up those</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.949" end="00:49:23.239" style="s2">similar sort of ethical issues do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.809" end="00:49:32.029" style="s2">allow people to voluntarily go in even</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.239" end="00:49:40.849" style="s2">if they might get a lower dose so last</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.029" end="00:49:44.029" style="s2">question let&#39;s go with Daniel Zev my</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.849" end="00:49:46.819" style="s2">question is are you yourself going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.029" end="00:49:48.890" style="s2">get deliberately infected and if not</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.819" end="00:49:50.920" style="s2">like what would it take for you to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.890" end="00:49:50.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.650" end="00:49:59.660" style="s2">somehow this is new to me okay this told</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.380" end="00:50:04.250" style="s2">me I was muted per moment okay never</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.660" end="00:50:06.590" style="s2">right there&#39;s there&#39;s two issues one do</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.250" end="00:50:08.360" style="s2">I want to do something illegal or do I</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.590" end="00:50:11.240" style="s2">want to stay within the legal framework</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.360" end="00:50:13.250" style="s2">and try to to make something legal and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.240" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">that we can do about work right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.250" end="00:50:18.860" style="s2">another issue is do I want to do some</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:20.990" style="s2">individual personal action with my own</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.860" end="00:50:23.090" style="s2">little personal resources or do I want</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.990" end="00:50:26.150" style="s2">to be part of some group or organization</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.090" end="00:50:27.980" style="s2">that does things together so here my</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.150" end="00:50:32.090" style="s2">main initial strategy has been to try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.980" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">do things legally together so if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.090" end="00:50:36.230" style="s2">could set up a thing where people many</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:39.470" style="s2">people together we&#39;re being deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.230" end="00:50:42.020" style="s2">infected I certainly am open to being</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.470" end="00:50:44.000" style="s2">part of that process I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.020" end="00:50:47.330" style="s2">just go try to do it myself personally</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.000" end="00:50:51.170" style="s2">by flying China or something but that</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.330" end="00:50:54.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make much sense the the point is</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.170" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">to first of all you know do it enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.080" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">together that we can collect data</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:50:58.730" style="s2">together about what works or not and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:02.570" style="s2">you know willing to consider being part</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.730" end="00:51:03.950" style="s2">of a trial but then of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.570" end="00:51:05.540" style="s2">we want to do a trial with the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.950" end="00:51:08.380" style="s2">who are the most apt appropriate for it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.540" end="00:51:10.460" style="s2">and like the data and you&#39;d like some</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.380" end="00:51:13.730" style="s2">medical professionals to be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.460" end="00:51:16.760" style="s2">process to the set up how it happens and</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.730" end="00:51:19.370" style="s2">set up how its traced and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.760" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">mostly now want to try to help us</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.370" end="00:51:24.980" style="s2">together do this so I&#39;m less focused on</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:26.690" style="s2">me saving myself and more how could we</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.980" end="00:51:28.730" style="s2">together create a process where we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.690" end="00:51:31.190" style="s2">do this together I would hold out the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.730" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">possibility that if we kept having legal</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.190" end="00:51:36.440" style="s2">in permission and opposition or at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">ambiguity maybe some sort of civil</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.440" end="00:51:41.900" style="s2">disobedience or group where it does it</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:43.250" style="s2">anyway in defiance of perhaps rules but</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.900" end="00:51:46.430" style="s2">even that I&#39;d want to do it with other</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.250" end="00:51:48.500" style="s2">people together where we had organized</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.430" end="00:51:50.120" style="s2">it and we&#39;re trying to do it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.500" end="00:51:54.140" style="s2">systematically sharing information now</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.120" end="00:51:59.420" style="s2">to do it that&#39;s right thing all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.140" end="00:52:01.250" style="s2">very cool so raven had a slogan do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.420" end="00:52:03.980" style="s2">want to want to end it off</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.250" end="00:52:05.480" style="s2">no she&#39;s legally together gray sloven</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.980" end="00:52:08.940" style="s2">okay</p>
