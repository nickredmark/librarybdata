<p begin="00:00:08.469" end="00:00:13.510" style="s2">about really difficult subjects and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.080" end="00:00:15.190" style="s2">seems that the subject of race in</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.510" end="00:00:15.639" style="s2">America is just about as difficult as it</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.190" end="00:00:18.039" style="s2">gets</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.639" end="00:00:20.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve written quite a few pieces for</p>

<p begin="00:00:24.580" end="00:00:28.810" style="s2">taken what you might call it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.020" end="00:00:31.630" style="s2">heterodox approach to the issue of race</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.810" end="00:00:34.630" style="s2">in America how would you summarize that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.630" end="00:00:37.570" style="s2">perspective well first thing I would say</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.630" end="00:00:40.930" style="s2">is I think the word heterodox is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.570" end="00:00:43.780" style="s2">overused because by definition a single</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.930" end="00:00:47.320" style="s2">take can&#39;t be heterodox I guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.780" end="00:00:51.910" style="s2">heterodox relative to what one generally</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.080" end="00:04:41.500" style="s2">might call a more humanist or colorblind</p>

<p begin="00:04:41.500" end="00:04:49.479" style="s2">meaning to your skin is a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:04:53.530" end="00:04:57.940" style="s2">all human beings and that the project</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.210" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">should generally be to use policy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.940" end="00:05:03.099" style="s2">conversation to make as many people</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.069" end="00:05:10.500" style="s2">census category they fit in do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.020" end="00:05:13.720" style="s2">accept the idea of systemic racism I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:16.300" style="s2">think systemic racism ever since the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.720" end="00:05:20.680" style="s2">concept was born in the book black power</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.300" end="00:05:23.770" style="s2">in 1967 has always been has always been</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.680" end="00:05:26.380" style="s2">confusing because it was originally</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.770" end="00:05:28.810" style="s2">called institutional racism and it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.380" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">created in contrast to what was called</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.810" end="00:05:33.580" style="s2">individual racism so the idea was you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:35.889" style="s2">have individual racists these are people</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.580" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">who have bias in their minds or hearts</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.889" end="00:05:43.060" style="s2">and you have racist policies like Jim</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:44.469" style="s2">Crow policies in the south but then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.060" end="00:05:44.860" style="s2">have this other thing that&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.469" end="00:05:47.139" style="s2">subtle</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.860" end="00:05:49.240" style="s2">it&#39;s called systemic racism and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.139" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">located in the individuals or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.240" end="00:05:55.659" style="s2">policies but in the quote/unquote system</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:57.639" style="s2">and even if you read the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.659" end="00:05:59.229" style="s2">articulation of the concept it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.639" end="00:06:01.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s some confusion behind it</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.229" end="00:06:03.219" style="s2">because if it&#39;s not in the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.240" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s not in the policies it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.219" end="00:06:08.440" style="s2">clear that there really is a third place</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">for the racism to be located so I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.440" end="00:06:12.599" style="s2">argue that there&#39;s a conceptual problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:15.300" style="s2">with systemic racism to begin with and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.599" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">aside from the conceptual problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.300" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">there&#39;s an empirical problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">there are several empirical problems one</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:26.650" style="s2">is that generally the studies used to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">justify the notion that the US has a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.650" end="00:06:33.029" style="s2">systemic racism problem are taking big</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:35.550" style="s2">categories like blacks and whites</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.029" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">comparing them on some mean statistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.550" end="00:06:39.849" style="s2">finding some difference and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:42.159" style="s2">ascribing</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.849" end="00:06:44.279" style="s2">that too systemic racism one problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.159" end="00:06:45.849" style="s2">with that is blacks and whites are</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.279" end="00:06:47.529" style="s2">different groups with different</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.849" end="00:06:49.479" style="s2">histories different demographics</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.529" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">different average ages and when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.479" end="00:06:52.029" style="s2">control for that some of that stuff will</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:54.610" style="s2">go away</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.029" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">the second problem is that even when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.610" end="00:06:58.689" style="s2">can control for everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:07:00.969" style="s2">measurable there are all kinds of huge</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.689" end="00:07:04.629" style="s2">and important immeasurable differences</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.969" end="00:07:06.399" style="s2">between people so if you&#39;re even if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.629" end="00:07:08.469" style="s2">think you&#39;re comparing like with like so</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.399" end="00:07:10.990" style="s2">you you&#39;re just gonna look at 25</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.469" end="00:07:13.959" style="s2">year-old black men and 25 year old white</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.990" end="00:07:17.649" style="s2">men both from two-parent households who</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.959" end="00:07:20.589" style="s2">live in Wisconsin and why is it the case</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.649" end="00:07:23.379" style="s2">that black men are incarcerated at what</p>

<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:47.589" style="s2">values desires and we should notice that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.759" end="00:07:48.069" style="s2">we&#39;re not tempted to do this in many</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.589" end="00:07:50.019" style="s2">areas</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.069" end="00:07:54.059" style="s2">we&#39;re not tempted to look at the fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.019" end="00:07:56.349" style="s2">that 20% of postal workers are black or</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.180" end="00:08:03.999" style="s2">systemic bias towards black people in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.459" end="00:08:07.509" style="s2">those cases so what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.999" end="00:08:10.959" style="s2">people to people are fart in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.509" end="00:08:13.300" style="s2">there being a conceptual problem there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.959" end="00:08:15.550" style="s2">there&#39;s just a huge literature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.300" end="00:08:17.589" style="s2">founded on the presumption that in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.550" end="00:08:20.439" style="s2">absence of bias groups would achieve</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.589" end="00:08:21.819" style="s2">identical outcomes and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.439" end="00:08:25.959" style="s2">no reason to support that assumption</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.819" end="00:08:27.909" style="s2">that said individual racism is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.959" end="00:08:32.529" style="s2">real and I don&#39;t ever expect it to go</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.909" end="00:08:34.449" style="s2">away and the other caveat I would give</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.529" end="00:08:36.430" style="s2">is that there are certain rare instances</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.449" end="00:08:39.699" style="s2">where I think the notion of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.430" end="00:08:41.860" style="s2">racism is useful for example there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.699" end="00:08:46.060" style="s2">study recently that showed court</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.860" end="00:08:48.660" style="s2">stenographers routinely messed up in</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.060" end="00:08:52.559" style="s2">transcribing the speech of black</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.660" end="00:08:52.559" style="s2">defendants and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.960" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">of black people testifying in court and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.790" end="00:09:00.730" style="s2">black stenographers and white</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:02.950" style="s2">stenographers were both equally likely</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.730" end="00:09:03.970" style="s2">to mess up so this is a notion where</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.950" end="00:09:06.460" style="s2">it&#39;s not that these people were</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.970" end="00:09:09.550" style="s2">individually biased against black people</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.460" end="00:09:11.770" style="s2">it was just hearing african-american</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.550" end="00:09:15.520" style="s2">vernacular they were worse at</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.770" end="00:09:17.320" style="s2">transcribing it in a way that redounded</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.520" end="00:09:19.540" style="s2">to the detriment of black people</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.320" end="00:09:22.540" style="s2">disproportionately so there it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.540" end="00:09:26.290" style="s2">policy it&#39;s not quite an individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.540" end="00:09:27.820" style="s2">anti-black bias so in those rare</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.290" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">instances I do think the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.820" end="00:09:32.470" style="s2">systemic racism is justified but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">interesting is not how many such</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.470" end="00:09:36.460" style="s2">examples there are about how few i mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:38.410" style="s2">race is certainly one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.460" end="00:09:40.600" style="s2">polarizing topics and one of the hottest</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.410" end="00:09:42.040" style="s2">topics in American culture do you feel</p>

<p begin="00:16:09.630" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">slavery so how can you possibly exempt</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.069" end="00:16:29.160" style="s2">the point is you benefit from it so to</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:40.050" style="s2">like yeah because they shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.250" end="00:16:44.009" style="s2">felt guilty for those things in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.050" end="00:16:47.910" style="s2">first place I don&#39;t think guilt is a</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.899" end="00:17:03.089" style="s2">clear to me why guilt is a useful</p>

<p begin="00:17:05.120" end="00:17:12.630" style="s2">guilt is too powerful guilt is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.370" end="00:17:15.720" style="s2">extremely powerful emotion it has not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.630" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">unique power but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.720" end="00:17:22.650" style="s2">capable of shutting down a reason to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:25.799" style="s2">degree that is really remarkable and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.650" end="00:17:28.230" style="s2">don&#39;t mind if my writing makes people</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.799" end="00:17:31.650" style="s2">makes white people feel less white guilt</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.230" end="00:17:37.309" style="s2">because the whole idea of race pride and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.650" end="00:17:40.049" style="s2">race guilt is corrupt to begin with so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.309" end="00:17:42.900" style="s2">would agree with the current like does</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.049" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">my writing make people feel less guilty</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.900" end="00:17:47.070" style="s2">sure that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:50.670" style="s2">that&#39;s not my intention my intention is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.070" end="00:17:54.270" style="s2">just to make sense about race in America</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.670" end="00:17:55.920" style="s2">and to critique the way we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.270" end="00:17:58.590" style="s2">race and put forward alternative</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.920" end="00:18:00.990" style="s2">frameworks that are more useful but if</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.590" end="00:18:04.410" style="s2">part of that entails people feeling less</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.990" end="00:18:06.180" style="s2">guilt shame or pride for the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.410" end="00:18:09.150" style="s2">melanin in their skin than so much the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.180" end="00:18:10.920" style="s2">better let&#39;s say one of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.150" end="00:18:14.070" style="s2">summarizing for maybe people who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.920" end="00:18:16.130" style="s2">read many of your pieces one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.070" end="00:18:19.530" style="s2">themes that you talk about a lot is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.130" end="00:18:21.480" style="s2">if you if you just look at kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.530" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">disparities between different racial</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.480" end="00:18:26.700" style="s2">groups and conclude that it&#39;s only due</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:28.380" style="s2">to discrimination you&#39;re you&#39;re ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.700" end="00:18:31.290" style="s2">a whole load of other factors that could</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.380" end="00:18:33.179" style="s2">be responsible for that would that be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.290" end="00:18:35.550" style="s2">good sort of summary and also and in</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.179" end="00:18:40.740" style="s2">particular in that the the role of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.550" end="00:18:44.490" style="s2">culture yeah yes so a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.740" end="00:18:47.370" style="s2">confusion around systemic racism stems</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.490" end="00:18:52.770" style="s2">from the assumption that in the absence</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.370" end="00:18:55.170" style="s2">of some systemic bias different groups</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.770" end="00:18:57.390" style="s2">would achieve statistically equal</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.170" end="00:18:59.790" style="s2">outcomes we have no reason to believe</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.390" end="00:19:04.410" style="s2">that this is true if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.790" end="00:19:06.750" style="s2">for just a few minutes for example the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.410" end="00:19:10.620" style="s2">average white American household of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.750" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">Russian descent earns $1 for every 79</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.620" end="00:19:14.840" style="s2">cents earned by the average white</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:17.100" style="s2">American household of French descent in</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.840" end="00:19:19.850" style="s2">America both of these groups would just</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.100" end="00:19:22.200" style="s2">be called white people but if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.850" end="00:19:25.050" style="s2">categorize them by the country in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.200" end="00:19:30.929" style="s2">they came from you get a 21 cent on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.050" end="00:19:33.420" style="s2">dollar pay gap does that imply that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.929" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">u.s. is systemically racist against</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.420" end="00:19:40.710" style="s2">white American French people well no</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:43.950" style="s2">it&#39;s just that these disparities are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.710" end="00:19:45.720" style="s2">norm it&#39;s normal to have disparities</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.950" end="00:19:48.360" style="s2">between groups with entirely different</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.720" end="00:19:50.670" style="s2">histories entirely different patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.360" end="00:19:53.310" style="s2">migration entirely different</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.670" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">demographics entirely different average</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.310" end="00:19:58.110" style="s2">ages and this is equally true if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:19:59.640" style="s2">break down</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.110" end="00:20:02.309" style="s2">quote-unquote black people into</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.640" end="00:20:05.400" style="s2">subgroups and sub ethnicities you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.309" end="00:20:07.290" style="s2">find that Nigerian households make not</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.400" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">only more than the American average</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.290" end="00:20:11.910" style="s2">American household but much more than</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:14.070" style="s2">the average say Haitian American</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.910" end="00:20:20.809" style="s2">household yet both of these people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.070" end="00:20:25.830" style="s2">black if we can&#39;t even attain parity</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.809" end="00:20:28.260" style="s2">within races what is the thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.830" end="00:20:31.530" style="s2">assumes we should be achieving parity</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.260" end="00:20:33.750" style="s2">between races when races have entirely</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.530" end="00:20:36.809" style="s2">different histories and patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.750" end="00:20:40.020" style="s2">migration and cultures and values at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.809" end="00:20:43.770" style="s2">median this is a completely unsupported</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.020" end="00:20:45.900" style="s2">assumption and yet it seems to it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.770" end="00:20:48.299" style="s2">rarely challenged because if you do</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.900" end="00:20:51.179" style="s2">challenge it then you have to be willing</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.299" end="00:20:52.950" style="s2">to say cite uncomfortable facts about</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.179" end="00:20:55.470" style="s2">different cultures having different</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.950" end="00:20:57.630" style="s2">values that lead them at the median to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.470" end="00:21:02.940" style="s2">achieve different outcomes whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.630" end="00:21:04.980" style="s2">in education athletics or business the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.940" end="00:21:07.500" style="s2">example that you just gave was Haitian</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.980" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">and Nigerian I think and obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.500" end="00:21:13.470" style="s2">the the the big issue under all of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:16.200" style="s2">is the legacy of slavery which I guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.470" end="00:21:22.530" style="s2">the Haitian would have in the Nigerian</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.200" end="00:21:25.049" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t not necessarily I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.530" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">been slavery in the in modern-day</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.049" end="00:21:30.230" style="s2">Nigeria there&#39;s been slavery virtually</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:32.940" style="s2">everywhere there&#39;s been civilization</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.230" end="00:21:36.350" style="s2">obviously we know about we know more</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.940" end="00:21:40.380" style="s2">about the transatlantic slave trade</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.350" end="00:21:43.350" style="s2">partially because the West participated</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.380" end="00:21:47.960" style="s2">in it most people don&#39;t know that 14</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.350" end="00:21:50.250" style="s2">million Africans were enslaved by Arabs</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.960" end="00:21:53.190" style="s2">most people know very little about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.250" end="00:21:54.630" style="s2">history of slavery in China most people</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.190" end="00:21:56.520" style="s2">know very little about the history of</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.630" end="00:22:00.690" style="s2">slit of white slaves on the Barbary</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.520" end="00:22:03.690" style="s2">Coast in North Africa so one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.690" end="00:22:06.900" style="s2">would say is yes we have a recent legacy</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.690" end="00:22:10.020" style="s2">of slavery in the West Indies in America</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.900" end="00:22:11.730" style="s2">and Brazil etc and we happen to know</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.020" end="00:22:13.620" style="s2">more about it because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.730" end="00:22:15.390" style="s2">kind of narcissistic about our own</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.620" end="00:22:20.190" style="s2">history and we talk about slavery as if</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.390" end="00:22:24.360" style="s2">it&#39;s something only America and Britain</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.190" end="00:22:28.110" style="s2">and Portugal participated in but slavery</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.360" end="00:22:30.540" style="s2">is as old as civilization it&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.110" end="00:22:32.700" style="s2">ten thousand years old it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.540" end="00:22:35.220" style="s2">practiced on every continent that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.700" end="00:22:39.570" style="s2">inhabited in virtually every</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.220" end="00:22:42.540" style="s2">civilization so in some sense the legacy</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.570" end="00:22:44.940" style="s2">of slavery is something everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.540" end="00:22:48.090" style="s2">world is trailing not just black</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.940" end="00:22:49.770" style="s2">Americans what do you think of the best</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.090" end="00:22:54.810" style="s2">criticisms of your pieces that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.770" end="00:22:56.460" style="s2">seen that&#39;s a tough question because if</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.810" end="00:22:59.640" style="s2">the criticisms are that good then they</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.460" end="00:23:03.390" style="s2">become my new opinions so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.640" end="00:23:06.990" style="s2">they don&#39;t stay criticisms for long if</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.390" end="00:23:08.310" style="s2">they&#39;re that good I think so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.990" end="00:23:13.680" style="s2">another way of asking that question is</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.310" end="00:23:15.630" style="s2">how if your views change then I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.680" end="00:23:19.290" style="s2">too many ways to count to many small</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.630" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">ways that probably don&#39;t get flagged in</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.290" end="00:23:27.030" style="s2">the moment the changes are happening I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:30.060" style="s2">think one thing I&#39;ve probably changed my</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.030" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">mind on recently is the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.060" end="00:23:38.580" style="s2">the welfare state is responsible for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:41.940" style="s2">rise of the single parent family in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.580" end="00:23:44.820" style="s2">black community I think that those</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.940" end="00:23:48.390" style="s2">claims are less supported than they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.820" end="00:23:52.740" style="s2">sometimes trumped up to be especially by</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.390" end="00:23:54.180" style="s2">conservative intellectuals there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.740" end="00:23:57.090" style="s2">doubt that there was a huge spike in</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.180" end="00:23:59.300" style="s2">single-parent homes but it started a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.090" end="00:24:02.310" style="s2">little bit before the welfare state so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.300" end="00:24:06.150" style="s2">before the huge Great Society era</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.310" end="00:24:07.770" style="s2">expansion so that&#39;s one reason to doubt</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.150" end="00:24:12.360" style="s2">that the welfare state was the primary</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.770" end="00:24:14.460" style="s2">cause and secondly I&#39;ve been looking at</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.360" end="00:24:17.580" style="s2">the work of the economist Rick Nevin on</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.720" end="00:26:01.630" style="s2">people with race conscious policy meant</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.909" end="00:26:03.900" style="s2">to uplift black America and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.630" end="00:26:05.500" style="s2">now considering whether to start is</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.900" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">absolutely ludicrous</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.500" end="00:26:12.190" style="s2">we have an entire entire networks and</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.250" end="00:26:21.970" style="s2">were created in in essence to pay people</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:24.669" style="s2">that to pay black people back for</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.970" end="00:26:27.309" style="s2">slavery and Jim Crow so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.669" end="00:26:28.870" style="s2">question of whether to start doing race</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.309" end="00:26:31.870" style="s2">conscious policy we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.870" end="00:26:36.520" style="s2">for decades what we a part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.870" end="00:26:39.170" style="s2">I think that it gets framed that way is</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.520" end="00:26:41.450" style="s2">because we haven&#39;t seen as much</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.170" end="00:26:44.840" style="s2">progress in reducing disparities as</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.450" end="00:26:46.820" style="s2">people expect it to so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.840" end="00:26:49.700" style="s2">you implement some great new</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.820" end="00:26:51.860" style="s2">race-conscious program that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.700" end="00:26:55.220" style="s2">really that&#39;s gonna uplift black people</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.860" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">20 years later you see that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.220" end="00:27:01.930" style="s2">black-white gap in whatever relevant</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:04.850" style="s2">area has remained the same and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.930" end="00:27:06.980" style="s2">after the fact you say well we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.850" end="00:27:08.930" style="s2">really done anything and it&#39;s like wait</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.980" end="00:27:10.760" style="s2">no you&#39;re just saying that now because</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.930" end="00:27:15.950" style="s2">the policy you proposed actually didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.760" end="00:27:19.210" style="s2">work so one thing I would say is again</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.950" end="00:27:22.490" style="s2">disparities are normal it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.210" end="00:27:25.340" style="s2">like no one is losing any sleep over the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.490" end="00:27:27.140" style="s2">21 cent household income gap between</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.340" end="00:27:30.890" style="s2">French Americans and Russian Americans</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.140" end="00:27:32.690" style="s2">we&#39;re only losing sleep over similar</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.890" end="00:27:35.690" style="s2">types of disparities between blacks and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.690" end="00:27:37.310" style="s2">whites and hey we should interrogate why</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.690" end="00:27:38.350" style="s2">it is that we&#39;re losing sleep over the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.310" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">one and not the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.350" end="00:27:43.850" style="s2">really why and don&#39;t just say slavery</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:45.710" style="s2">and Jim Crow go deeper than that because</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.850" end="00:27:47.270" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you could tell a historical</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.710" end="00:27:50.630" style="s2">story about why the French and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.270" end="00:27:54.020" style="s2">Russians aren&#39;t at perfect parity and B</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.630" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">we need a conceptual change in the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.020" end="00:28:01.040" style="s2">we understand what is just what progress</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:03.950" style="s2">entails does progress entail equal</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.040" end="00:28:06.920" style="s2">outcomes well not really and this may</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.950" end="00:28:10.790" style="s2">seem a glib but you could easily get</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.920" end="00:28:13.280" style="s2">equal outcomes just by making the people</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.790" end="00:28:15.260" style="s2">who are doing better do worse like take</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.280" end="00:28:16.670" style="s2">some income away from Asian Americans so</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.260" end="00:28:19.220" style="s2">that they&#39;re earning as much as white</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.670" end="00:28:21.230" style="s2">Americans and you&#39;ve made progress and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:23.090" style="s2">then take income away from both so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.230" end="00:28:25.730" style="s2">blacks whites and Asians are all making</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.090" end="00:28:27.230" style="s2">the same amount of income and now we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.730" end="00:28:28.790" style="s2">achieved parity isn&#39;t the world better</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.230" end="00:28:32.300" style="s2">well no you&#39;ve just made a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.790" end="00:28:34.490" style="s2">poorer that&#39;s it so the way we should</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.300" end="00:28:36.110" style="s2">conceptualize progress should allow for</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.490" end="00:28:38.570" style="s2">different groups that have some</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.110" end="00:28:40.880" style="s2">disparity say blacks and whites to both</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.570" end="00:28:43.690" style="s2">make progress without the disparity</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.880" end="00:28:47.330" style="s2">necessarily having to collapse because</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.690" end="00:28:49.460" style="s2">disparities don&#39;t always collapse right</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.330" end="00:28:50.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s not an indictment of society</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.460" end="00:28:52.909" style="s2">when they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.600" end="00:28:56.029" style="s2">and I mean you kind of hinted at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.909" end="00:28:58.009" style="s2">idea of unintended consequences there</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.029" end="00:29:00.259" style="s2">and you had a really interesting example</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.009" end="00:29:02.990" style="s2">of that in the Sam Harris podcast I</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.259" end="00:29:05.690" style="s2">think in affirmative action and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.990" end="00:29:08.120" style="s2">happened in California can you outline</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.690" end="00:29:10.309" style="s2">oh yeah this is the what&#39;s been called</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.120" end="00:29:13.700" style="s2">the mismatch theory or the mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.309" end="00:29:16.190" style="s2">effect which is when you take an</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.700" end="00:29:19.639" style="s2">eighteen-year-old black high school</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.190" end="00:29:21.950" style="s2">graduate and you apply affirmative</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.639" end="00:29:24.440" style="s2">action to their application which is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.950" end="00:29:26.659" style="s2">say you put them in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.440" end="00:29:28.909" style="s2">competitive school than they otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.659" end="00:29:32.990" style="s2">would have gotten into at their level of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.909" end="00:29:36.639" style="s2">preparedness what you&#39;re doing in effect</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.990" end="00:29:40.639" style="s2">is putting them in the bottom 10% of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.639" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">preparedness at a top school where they</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.639" end="00:29:44.600" style="s2">might have been at the 50th percentile</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:45.559" style="s2">if they were a white applicant at a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.600" end="00:29:49.610" style="s2">different school</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.639" end="00:30:24.950" style="s2">to switch to less rigorous majors so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.629" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">believe there is a study at Duke</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.059" end="00:31:23.960" style="s2">what I understood is that they abolished</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.960" end="00:31:29.769" style="s2">the grades rise or more success that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:35.169" style="s2">right yeah they abolished it in either</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.769" end="00:31:38.659" style="s2">1994 or 1996 and there were doomsayers</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.659" end="00:31:45.769" style="s2">back it actually didn&#39;t it it narrowed</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.820" end="00:32:33.019" style="s2">and what do you think of the most</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:35.570" style="s2">compelling comparisons or examples to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.019" end="00:32:37.429" style="s2">make to tell us straight the points that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.570" end="00:32:42.519" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make yeah so there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.429" end="00:32:45.879" style="s2">several examples throughout history of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.519" end="00:32:51.080" style="s2">groups of people that experienced</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.879" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">enormous levels of oppression and not</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.080" end="00:32:58.190" style="s2">only did they nevertheless achieve at</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.169" style="s2">what would be seen as a high level of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.190" end="00:33:04.070" style="s2">success but at a higher level of success</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.169" end="00:33:07.240" style="s2">than the groups that oppressed them so</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.070" end="00:33:11.299" style="s2">one example I often use our</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.240" end="00:33:13.700" style="s2">japanese-americans who came to this</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.299" end="00:33:16.279" style="s2">country in the first wave of Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.700" end="00:33:18.890" style="s2">immigration as illiterate peasants in</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.279" end="00:33:22.409" style="s2">the early 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.890" end="00:33:24.269" style="s2">there were laws on the books in 13 or 14</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.409" end="00:33:26.220" style="s2">states called the alien land laws that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.269" end="00:33:29.820" style="s2">prevented them from owning property</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.220" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">until 1952 when those laws were ruled</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.820" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">unconstitutional by the Supreme Court by</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:37.220" style="s2">1960 Japanese people had a higher rate</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:41.490" style="s2">of college attainment than white people</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.220" end="00:33:43.140" style="s2">than white Americans so I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.490" end="00:33:47.370" style="s2">that&#39;s one example I could also give the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.140" end="00:33:51.059" style="s2">example of West Indian and African</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.370" end="00:33:52.649" style="s2">immigrants in the United States who</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.059" end="00:33:55.190" style="s2">there had there have been men there</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.649" end="00:33:57.990" style="s2">haven&#39;t been many studies on this but</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.190" end="00:34:00.419" style="s2">from Douglas Douglas Massey study and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.990" end="00:34:02.639" style="s2">from Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.419" end="00:34:06.179" style="s2">a study in the early 2000s we know</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.639" end="00:34:07.889" style="s2">anywhere from 40% to two-thirds of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.179" end="00:34:10.800" style="s2">black students at Ivy League colleges</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.889" end="00:34:12.599" style="s2">are West Indian immigrants African</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:15.419" style="s2">immigrants or their children you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.599" end="00:34:17.099" style="s2">that cohort only makes up 10% of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.419" end="00:34:18.780" style="s2">u.s. black population so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.099" end="00:34:21.869" style="s2">massively over-represented at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.780" end="00:34:23.879" style="s2">highest levels of achievement and yet</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.869" end="00:34:25.649" style="s2">certainly in the case of West Indians</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.879" end="00:34:30.389" style="s2">this is a group that was formerly</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.649" end="00:34:33.210" style="s2">enslaved for formerly enslaved so what</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.389" end="00:34:34.970" style="s2">happens reason I I could say similar</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.210" end="00:34:39.260" style="s2">things about Jewish Americans as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.970" end="00:34:43.830" style="s2">the reason I bring these examples up is</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.260" end="00:34:48.240" style="s2">to combat the lazy assumption that sees</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.830" end="00:34:50.730" style="s2">a group lagging today behind the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.240" end="00:34:54.330" style="s2">majority ethnic group sees that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.730" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">group has also been oppressed throughout</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.330" end="00:35:02.310" style="s2">history and assumes that the oppression</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">is the main cause of the lagging you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.310" end="00:35:07.650" style="s2">make the point in the opposite direction</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.510" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">as well there are groups that do lag</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.650" end="00:35:12.390" style="s2">behind without having an essence</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:15.000" style="s2">necessarily a historical reason to lag</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.390" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">behind there&#39;s a point where Porto</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.000" end="00:35:19.349" style="s2">Ricans in New York City had lower</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:22.470" style="s2">incomes than blacks in New York City</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.349" end="00:35:25.800" style="s2">despite having been a recent wave of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.470" end="00:35:27.450" style="s2">voluntary emigration they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.800" end="00:35:29.369" style="s2">the history of slavery in the u.s. to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.450" end="00:35:31.619" style="s2">point to as a reason they came here</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.369" end="00:35:31.950" style="s2">voluntarily unlike black people and yet</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.619" end="00:35:34.650" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.950" end="00:35:38.070" style="s2">similar patterns of single-parent homes</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.650" end="00:35:40.020" style="s2">crime you could say much the same about</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.070" end="00:35:42.599" style="s2">the Irish when they first came the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.020" end="00:35:45.260" style="s2">Italians when they first came they</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.599" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">sometimes had murder rates that were</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.260" end="00:35:51.930" style="s2">five times the rate of say German</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:56.220" style="s2">Americans and they didn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.930" end="00:36:00.570" style="s2">have the history of oppression to blame</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.220" end="00:36:02.280" style="s2">it on so I&#39;m trying to the common thread</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.570" end="00:36:04.020" style="s2">here is that there&#39;s a lazy assumption</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.280" end="00:36:06.930" style="s2">of causation where it may not be the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.020" end="00:36:10.890" style="s2">case why do you think these this subject</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.930" end="00:36:16.490" style="s2">is so important well we have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.890" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">to think clearly about the sources of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.490" end="00:36:23.820" style="s2">socio-economic disparity to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:25.290" style="s2">conceptualize the problem we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.820" end="00:36:27.570" style="s2">have the right concepts to apply to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.290" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">problem because if we&#39;re if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.570" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">thinking about the whole thing upside</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:36.210" style="s2">down then inevitably our solutions are</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">going to be upside down as well so</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.210" end="00:36:43.319" style="s2">that&#39;s reparations is now seriously on</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:45.030" style="s2">the table in a condition with in a</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.619" end="00:37:23.099" style="s2">stems directly from a misunderstanding</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.050" end="00:37:36.329" style="s2">perspective how do you think we&#39;ve ended</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.450" end="00:37:38.099" style="s2">up in this place there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.329" end="00:37:39.270" style="s2">thinker called Jordan Green Hall who</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.099" end="00:37:42.420" style="s2">we&#39;ve had on the channel a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.270" end="00:37:45.390" style="s2">times and he talks about how the left</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.420" end="00:37:48.690" style="s2">has kind of started</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.390" end="00:37:50.700" style="s2">on the values of openness but it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.690" end="00:37:53.070" style="s2">degenerated into a kind of ideology of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.700" end="00:37:54.420" style="s2">openness so that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.070" end="00:37:56.940" style="s2">topics that you have to have a certain</p>

<p begin="00:39:30.420" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">seems like the war of ideas was</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.980" end="00:39:39.890" style="s2">basically won by the Black Power</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.890" end="00:39:45.630" style="s2">contingent of people who were far more</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.300" end="00:40:08.670" style="s2">has been more or less a consensus since</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.670" end="00:40:15.330" style="s2">of that idea has continued winning I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:17.430" style="s2">think and it&#39;s abdun flowed and it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.330" end="00:40:20.600" style="s2">certainly exacerbating start it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.430" end="00:40:23.340" style="s2">exacerbated starting right around 2014</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.600" end="00:40:26.970" style="s2">when Michael Brown was killed in</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.340" end="00:40:30.270" style="s2">Ferguson and when we all had I phones in</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.970" end="00:40:34.790" style="s2">Facebook to see that to see evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.270" end="00:40:38.270" style="s2">that and to have very unproductive and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.790" end="00:40:42.810" style="s2">scary debates about it on social media</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.270" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">so just since 2014 there&#39;s been a kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.810" end="00:40:52.860" style="s2">of there&#39;s been a spike in intensity</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:55.290" style="s2">around this issue and it&#39;s magnified the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.860" end="00:40:58.890" style="s2">conflict but the conflict has been there</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.290" end="00:41:00.630" style="s2">for decades so I would say the power of</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.890" end="00:41:03.060" style="s2">ideas is sufficient to explain why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.630" end="00:41:08.940" style="s2">here in addition to that I would add</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.060" end="00:41:11.640" style="s2">that social media and the current access</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.940" end="00:41:14.670" style="s2">to videos of unarmed black people</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.640" end="00:41:17.850" style="s2">getting killed by the cops in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.670" end="00:41:19.890" style="s2">of the fact that in any given year more</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.850" end="00:41:23.370" style="s2">white people are killed by the cops than</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.890" end="00:41:25.260" style="s2">blacks the visceral nosov seeing those</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.370" end="00:41:29.000" style="s2">videos rather than reading it in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.260" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">newspaper as you would have in 2007 has</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.000" end="00:41:35.940" style="s2">magnified what the the conflict of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:39.420" style="s2">that has existed for decades just moving</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.940" end="00:41:41.490" style="s2">on a little bit too so there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.420" end="00:41:44.040" style="s2">sense at the moment that there is a an</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.490" end="00:41:45.570" style="s2">emerging kind of alternative media at</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.040" end="00:41:46.830" style="s2">the same time as the kind of mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.570" end="00:41:51.840" style="s2">media feels a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.830" end="00:41:53.580" style="s2">ideologically captured what do you make</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.840" end="00:41:56.370" style="s2">of there was a Collette piece recently</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.580" end="00:42:00.690" style="s2">that that basically said that this</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.370" end="00:42:03.060" style="s2">attitude to the social justice left</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.690" end="00:42:08.070" style="s2">either for or auntie it&#39;s becoming the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.060" end="00:42:09.180" style="s2">the main wedge issue now between and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.070" end="00:42:10.710" style="s2">think you can really call it left and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.180" end="00:42:11.480" style="s2">right but you can certainly call it kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.710" end="00:42:14.750" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.480" end="00:42:17.450" style="s2">a new constellation what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.750" end="00:42:21.020" style="s2">that do you think the last reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.450" end="00:42:25.120" style="s2">argument on its face I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.020" end="00:42:27.950" style="s2">that&#39;s true then that says something</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.120" end="00:42:32.630" style="s2">flattering about the left&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.950" end="00:42:34.490" style="s2">eject people from it because so like</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.630" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">interrogate what that argument means</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.490" end="00:42:44.270" style="s2">what it means is that sjw&#39;s came up</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:47.270" style="s2">sprang up right around 2014 yes they</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.270" end="00:42:49.910" style="s2">existed before but that was the year</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.270" end="00:42:54.100" style="s2">where it kind of started becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.910" end="00:42:56.390" style="s2">national story that sjw&#39;s were</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.100" end="00:42:57.920" style="s2">infiltrating journalism and you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.390" end="00:42:59.780" style="s2">just seeing more of these outbreaks you</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.920" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">were seeing things happen on campus that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.780" end="00:43:05.240" style="s2">a few years earlier you would have just</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:07.160" style="s2">like laughed off and now it&#39;s a Yale</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.240" end="00:43:09.080" style="s2">professors is leaving campus over a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.160" end="00:43:12.460" style="s2">Halloween costume that&#39;s like when that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.080" end="00:43:17.390" style="s2">started happening and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.460" end="00:43:18.980" style="s2">five years later the main or one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.390" end="00:43:22.670" style="s2">main political fault lines is whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.980" end="00:43:27.970" style="s2">you&#39;re pro or anti sjw&#39;s it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.670" end="00:43:30.350" style="s2">the like Vox versus Colette stand off</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.970" end="00:43:33.590" style="s2">what that tells me is that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.350" end="00:43:37.640" style="s2">people on the Left didn&#39;t like sjw&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.590" end="00:43:40.070" style="s2">got booted out of the left the which</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.640" end="00:43:42.050" style="s2">says that which then made it the case</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.070" end="00:43:45.710" style="s2">that the new fault line was Pro and anti</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.050" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">SJW whereas before you could have a pro</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.710" end="00:43:52.130" style="s2">or anti h IW h JW and be on the left it</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:54.050" style="s2">also could be a story of anti s JW</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.130" end="00:43:57.170" style="s2">people on the left to choosing to move</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.050" end="00:43:58.100" style="s2">more towards the right there&#39;s agency</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.170" end="00:44:03.710" style="s2">involved as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.100" end="00:44:08.420" style="s2">so I don&#39;t maybe that&#39;s a CI I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.710" end="00:44:10.750" style="s2">really think in those terms but I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.420" end="00:44:13.970" style="s2">definitely a fault line whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.750" end="00:44:15.590" style="s2">kind of into social justice ideology or</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.970" end="00:44:17.480" style="s2">not that&#39;s definitely an important</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.590" end="00:44:19.940" style="s2">political fault line one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.480" end="00:44:22.400" style="s2">important I don&#39;t know exactly how it</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.940" end="00:44:23.750" style="s2">tracks with left and right because left</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.400" end="00:44:24.540" style="s2">and right are kind of by definition</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.750" end="00:44:27.060" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.540" end="00:44:28.890" style="s2">it&#39;s and now one person gets to decide</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.060" end="00:44:33.210" style="s2">what they mean and I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.890" end="00:44:35.130" style="s2">what they mean right now in 2019 so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.210" end="00:44:38.970" style="s2">not gonna I&#39;m not gonna comment on</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.130" end="00:44:41.070" style="s2">whether the Pro and anti sjw divided</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.970" end="00:44:43.470" style="s2">mirrors the left and the right at this</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.070" end="00:44:45.840" style="s2">point because you know people can argue</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.470" end="00:44:47.370" style="s2">it just get semantics when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.840" end="00:44:50.040" style="s2">what does it mean to be a leftist or a</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.370" end="00:44:52.230" style="s2">right winger how do you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.040" end="00:44:54.750" style="s2">possible to reach people who are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.230" end="00:44:56.970" style="s2">just ideologically captured or just have</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.750" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">bad ideas without making them into</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.970" end="00:45:03.300" style="s2">enemies I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a one</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:06.290" style="s2">size fits all strategy and I do know</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.300" end="00:45:08.580" style="s2">that there&#39;s no strategy that avoids</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.290" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">completely the phenomenon of making</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.580" end="00:45:13.830" style="s2">enemies so there there are many people</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:15.960" style="s2">no matter what I said no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.830" end="00:45:17.540" style="s2">evidence I provide provided that I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.960" end="00:45:20.970" style="s2">coming from a good place</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.540" end="00:45:22.790" style="s2">yeah I could save 10 puppies from a</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.970" end="00:45:25.260" style="s2">burning building from a burning building</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.790" end="00:45:27.240" style="s2">risking my own life and they would still</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.260" end="00:45:28.890" style="s2">think I&#39;m an Uncle Tom I&#39;m gonna sell</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.240" end="00:45:30.450" style="s2">out which is not to say that saving</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.890" end="00:45:35.070" style="s2">puppies is clear evidence that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.450" end="00:45:36.420" style="s2">not a sellout but you get my point and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.070" end="00:45:38.610" style="s2">I&#39;m fine with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.420" end="00:45:40.230" style="s2">you have to reconcile yourself to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.610" end="00:45:42.150" style="s2">fact that not everyone in life is going</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.230" end="00:45:45.930" style="s2">to like you that&#39;s kind of an insane</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.150" end="00:45:49.260" style="s2">thing to expect nor should you use that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.930" end="00:45:53.030" style="s2">as a reason to write off people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.260" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">passionate and disagree with you because</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.030" end="00:45:58.050" style="s2">people get persuaded out of entire</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:00.840" style="s2">worldviews all the time they just</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.050" end="00:46:03.990" style="s2">generally do it quietly so we get the</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.500" end="00:49:24.150" style="s2">more than sam harris in the in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.630" end="00:49:28.369" style="s2">that i&#39;m more likely to see him like</p>
