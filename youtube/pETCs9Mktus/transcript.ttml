<p begin="00:00:10.050" end="00:00:14.549" style="s2">what kind of a decade are we up for</p>

<p begin="00:00:18.750" end="00:00:22.590" style="s2">years I think that the first thing that</p>

<p begin="00:00:22.590" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">ready to take on something which I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">always found to terrify and that has to</p>

<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:54.960" style="s2">you back to the end of world war two</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.460" end="00:00:57.329" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of prehistory but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.960" end="00:00:59.609" style="s2">afford to do everything so shortly after</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.329" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">World War Two there were two very</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.609" end="00:01:05.309" style="s2">important events in the early 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">from our perspective one of which was</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.309" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">the unlocking of the three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">1953 and the other was the explosions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">hydrogen devices using work of Edward</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">Teller and Stanislaus Lum and what that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">changed in the human picture because we</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">went from a short period where we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">dealing with atomic bombs where Duck and</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.509" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2">the destructive power was really</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">incalculable it&#39;s the power of gods used</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.060" end="00:01:48.299" style="s2">to power the Sun here on earth now for</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">my wit to my way of thinking since the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.299" end="00:01:52.380" style="s2">early 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">there has been no comparable explosion</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.380" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">of wisdom to go along with this newfound</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">power that humans have this new godlike</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">power so I&#39;ve called this the twin</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">run of luck and I think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.530" end="00:02:13.540" style="s2">magical and marvelous thing but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:16.180" style="s2">believe that we can count on</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.540" end="00:02:20.469" style="s2">like forever and in fact given some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.180" end="00:02:23.670" style="s2">the events of early 2020 taking place in</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.469" end="00:02:26.709" style="s2">Iraq and Iran I would say that history</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.670" end="00:02:29.859" style="s2">at the scale that we were accustomed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.709" end="00:02:32.739" style="s2">it during the let&#39;s say first half of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.859" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2">the 20th century could start up at any</p>

<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:41.019" style="s2">and we&#39;re entirely unprepared for this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.780" end="00:02:41.709" style="s2">now in the story that has this major</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.019" end="00:02:44.739" style="s2">through-line</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.709" end="00:02:47.889" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been following the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.739" end="00:02:51.220" style="s2">that happens that&#39;s really important is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.889" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">a guy named Eric de sola price starts to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.220" end="00:02:55.359" style="s2">calculate that science is on an</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:56.889" style="s2">exponential trajectory and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.359" end="00:02:59.650" style="s2">thinking that that&#39;s a great thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.889" end="00:03:01.720" style="s2">he starts to understand that anything on</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.650" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">an exponential trajectory can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.720" end="00:03:07.590" style="s2">go on because it&#39;s going to burn itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:10.359" style="s2">out and if science is the original</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.590" end="00:03:13.209" style="s2">seedcorn if you will of technology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.359" end="00:03:15.189" style="s2">technology of economics then effectively</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.209" end="00:03:16.780" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen in science is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.189" end="00:03:19.000" style="s2">going to percolate through a chain</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.780" end="00:03:22.840" style="s2">through technology and into the economy</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.000" end="00:03:25.239" style="s2">with a potential stagnation coming now</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.840" end="00:03:29.500" style="s2">he started to arrive at these ideas I</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.239" end="00:03:32.139" style="s2">think at Yale in the late 1950s it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.500" end="00:03:34.989" style="s2">not well understood what he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.139" end="00:03:37.479" style="s2">about and still I am always shocked that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.989" end="00:03:40.090" style="s2">the book science since Babylon which he</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.479" end="00:03:42.549" style="s2">wrote and which discusses this issue is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.090" end="00:03:44.909" style="s2">so much less well known than say Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.549" end="00:03:47.530" style="s2">Kuhn structure of scientific revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.909" end="00:03:49.269" style="s2">for some reason this is so dispiriting</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.530" end="00:03:55.810" style="s2">to so many people that we&#39;d actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.269" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">don&#39;t discuss it much studying this work</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.810" end="00:04:03.010" style="s2">led to the idea of talking about egos</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:04.780" style="s2">that is embedded growth obligations now</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.010" end="00:04:07.470" style="s2">embedded growth obligations are the way</p>

<p begin="00:04:10.180" end="00:04:15.609" style="s2">since the period between the end of</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.330" end="00:04:40.310" style="s2">yet because it was embedded in our</p>

<p begin="00:05:03.560" end="00:05:09.770" style="s2">and indigenous people looked at the air</p>
