<p begin="00:00:02.220" end="00:00:05.250" style="s2">the microphone right up next to my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.629" end="00:00:09.269" style="s2">and see what kind of impact that has on</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.250" end="00:00:11.940" style="s2">the sound quality so the the topic today</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.269" end="00:00:14.790" style="s2">is related to the topic for previous</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.940" end="00:00:16.920" style="s2">episode thinking and simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.790" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">but here I&#39;m focused on a different</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.920" end="00:00:22.010" style="s2">distinction that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:25.070" style="s2">characterize as a paradigmatic mind and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.010" end="00:00:27.210" style="s2">liminal mind or the middle consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.070" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">so so to begin with I want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.210" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">characterize a paradigmatic mind the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">concept of a paradigm as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:41.270" style="s2">personally know comes from a coon who is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">discussing us in the context of social</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.270" end="00:00:45.989" style="s2">environments particularly specifically</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:48.210" style="s2">scientific communities and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.989" end="00:00:51.270" style="s2">frameworks the collectives since making</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.210" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">frameworks were used to describe the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:56.039" style="s2">world natural phenomena I&#39;m using it in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:57.660" style="s2">a in a different sense I&#39;m using it in</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.039" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">the sense of a the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.660" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">framework there to give an individual</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">users to make sense of their environment</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">so for example if you had a contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">physicalist paradigm and you saw an</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">Apple fall from a tree you might invoke</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:16.979" style="s2">the notion of gravity to describe what</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:21.570" style="s2">happened whereas say for example you</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.979" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">maybe had an animist paradigm you might</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">suspect that maybe the tree was trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:28.310" style="s2">to convey something to you and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">sense making frameworks these paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.310" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">stand in between raw perception of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:40.380" style="s2">blooming buzzing confusion of phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">reality and the way we actually well</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.380" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">make sense of what&#39;s going on ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">for the purposes of making meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and taking actions in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:56.369" style="s2">the world now paradigms operate in my my</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:59.159" style="s2">story with three interrelating</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.369" end="00:02:00.930" style="s2">principles the first is the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.159" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">responsiveness which is to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.930" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">paradigm exists as I said for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:05.990" style="s2">purpose of making sense of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:08.310" style="s2">environments so that you can then make</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.990" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">meaningful choices and effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.310" end="00:02:12.850" style="s2">in your environment so paradigms emerge</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:16.870" style="s2">so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.850" end="00:02:19.420" style="s2">bond reality however paradigms also seem</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.870" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">to have two other primary</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.420" end="00:02:24.850" style="s2">characteristics one I might call the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:27.960" style="s2">principle of conservation which is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.850" end="00:02:31.000" style="s2">say that paradigms in some sense seek to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.960" end="00:02:31.930" style="s2">change as little as they can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.000" end="00:02:36.690" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.930" end="00:02:38.980" style="s2">so hold state hold as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.690" end="00:02:41.710" style="s2">unchanging and only change it at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.980" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">edges minimally and then this the third</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.710" end="00:02:47.710" style="s2">is the principle of minimum dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:49.480" style="s2">which is to say that if some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.710" end="00:02:52.510" style="s2">perception shows up some experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.480" end="00:02:54.310" style="s2">comes in that doesn&#39;t make sense in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.510" end="00:02:55.420" style="s2">paradigm there&#39;s something about the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.310" end="00:02:57.940" style="s2">the years since making framework</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.420" end="00:02:59.590" style="s2">operates where what you are experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.940" end="00:03:03.250" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense this shows up as</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.590" end="00:03:04.540" style="s2">dissonance and paradigms need to solve</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:08.310" style="s2">dissonance but they need to resolve</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.540" end="00:03:12.940" style="s2">dissonance also under the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:15.130" style="s2">maximum conservation so say for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.940" end="00:03:17.560" style="s2">for whatever reason you&#39;re a particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.130" end="00:03:20.170" style="s2">paradigm didn&#39;t have any room whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.560" end="00:03:21.580" style="s2">for the notion of a hummingbird and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.170" end="00:03:24.880" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting in a park and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.580" end="00:03:26.260" style="s2">hummingbird flies by well the principle</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.880" end="00:03:28.020" style="s2">of dissonance is that something is just</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.260" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">an experience that doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.020" end="00:03:34.090" style="s2">and so this needs to be resolved the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:37.720" style="s2">principle of maximum conservation is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.090" end="00:03:40.150" style="s2">that the paradigm will endeavour to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.720" end="00:03:43.810" style="s2">a way to make sense of this in the least</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.150" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">amount of change and and here things</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.810" end="00:03:48.280" style="s2">like self deception and delusion</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">actually come in quite often now of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.280" end="00:03:51.970" style="s2">course it might be that your paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:53.590" style="s2">will change to include the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.970" end="00:03:55.780" style="s2">hummingbird you know and so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:03:57.790" style="s2">the idea of bird and it&#39;s not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.780" end="00:03:59.170" style="s2">to extend it to some other time move</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.790" end="00:04:01.600" style="s2">bird and then eventually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.170" end="00:04:02.770" style="s2">potentially evolve your paradigm develop</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.600" end="00:04:04.840" style="s2">it to be able to include this entirely</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.770" end="00:04:06.820" style="s2">new concept of hummingbird</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.840" end="00:04:08.830" style="s2">but perhaps the easiest thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.820" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">just to maybe supposed to just imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.830" end="00:04:14.230" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t in fact real and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:17.609" style="s2">course we know that the human mind is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.230" end="00:04:20.350" style="s2">extraordinarily capable of not</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.609" end="00:04:23.950" style="s2">perceiving or at least not being aware</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.350" end="00:04:25.990" style="s2">of the fact of perceiving things in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.950" end="00:04:26.260" style="s2">in the sensory environment and this can</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.990" end="00:04:28.810" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.260" end="00:04:31.150" style="s2">happening because it just edits things</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.810" end="00:04:34.600" style="s2">out that don&#39;t seem to be useful like</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.150" end="00:04:36.250" style="s2">see a gorilla walking across and behind</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.600" end="00:04:37.300" style="s2">a basketball game I don&#39;t if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.250" end="00:04:40.510" style="s2">familiar with that particular experiment</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.300" end="00:04:41.830" style="s2">or it can erase things that are just</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.510" end="00:04:43.930" style="s2">don&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.830" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">all here now within the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.930" end="00:04:49.150" style="s2">the principle of responsiveness so so</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:51.580" style="s2">let&#39;s say for example you had a paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.150" end="00:04:54.910" style="s2">that whatever reason had a framework</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.580" end="00:04:59.500" style="s2">that you were fireproof you could not be</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.910" end="00:05:02.140" style="s2">burned and you found yourself in fire</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.500" end="00:05:03.490" style="s2">and so all you&#39;re now experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.140" end="00:05:05.460" style="s2">dissonance which is to say to your body</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.490" end="00:05:08.500" style="s2">your skin is sending you signals that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.460" end="00:05:11.140" style="s2">are the minimum pain in fact being</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.500" end="00:05:12.850" style="s2">burned some kind of harm but your</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.140" end="00:05:16.150" style="s2">paradigm under the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.850" end="00:05:17.710" style="s2">conservation seeks not to change now</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.150" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen here is attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.710" end="00:05:21.340" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:23.350" style="s2">dissonance and the conservation but you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.340" end="00:05:26.740" style="s2">also the tense in tension now with with</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.350" end="00:05:28.840" style="s2">responsiveness that to fail to respond</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.740" end="00:05:31.150" style="s2">to what&#39;s actually happening is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.840" end="00:05:34.270" style="s2">violation of that principle now here</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.150" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">things can be very complex sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.270" end="00:05:41.800" style="s2">paradigm for whatever reason has enough</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.800" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">holds and the principle of dissonance is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.860" end="00:05:49.270" style="s2">resolved through a delusion which is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:52.180" style="s2">say no no no this isn&#39;t really pain I</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.270" end="00:05:54.160" style="s2">don&#39;t feel anything and you go to the</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:16.320" style="s2">between where the principle conservation</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.100" end="00:06:18.910" style="s2">gives up and where you actually die and</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.910" end="00:06:24.520" style="s2">quite familiar with circumstances where</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.010" end="00:06:26.860" style="s2">people choose to die rather than change</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.199" end="00:06:48.860" style="s2">and this is what I&#39;m calling liminal</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">mind or liminal consciousness and so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.860" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">first thing to keep in mind is that this</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:55.310" style="s2">space the liminal consciousness is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:58.159" style="s2">fact actually the base this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.310" end="00:06:59.960" style="s2">source from which paradigms emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.159" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s also the place to which</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.960" end="00:07:05.060" style="s2">paradigms dissolve when when they break</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:07.009" style="s2">up completely and you know under the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.060" end="00:07:10.849" style="s2">principle of conservation when you find</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.009" end="00:07:13.789" style="s2">yourself in a circumstance where reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.849" end="00:07:16.610" style="s2">is it&#39;s quite distinct from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.789" end="00:07:19.190" style="s2">framework that you&#39;re using the ability</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.610" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">to modify your paradigm enough to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.190" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">responsive to that level of distinctness</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:26.509" style="s2">might in fact just not be possible like</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">that kind of change may not be available</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.509" end="00:07:32.870" style="s2">and so it can often be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:35.569" style="s2">when confronted with circumstances that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.870" end="00:07:37.310" style="s2">are substantially outside of the scope</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.569" end="00:07:40.250" style="s2">or capacity of the paradigm under which</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.310" end="00:07:44.440" style="s2">were operating the only valid response</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.250" end="00:07:47.990" style="s2">is to in fact drop into liminality now</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.440" end="00:07:51.229" style="s2">liminality has itself certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.990" end="00:07:53.330" style="s2">characteristics when you&#39;re in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.229" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">truly deeply mental space you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.330" end="00:07:58.250" style="s2">necessarily even have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:02.020" style="s2">name the things that you&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.250" end="00:08:04.219" style="s2">so sense making can become very very</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.020" end="00:08:06.650" style="s2">limited and you might be in a part</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.219" end="00:08:08.360" style="s2">perceiving something that under a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.650" end="00:08:11.029" style="s2">paradigmatic frame you would call a tree</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.360" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">but in a liminal space you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.029" end="00:08:16.279" style="s2">name for it you&#39;re just experiencing it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:19.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s raw sensorial and of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.279" end="00:08:21.800" style="s2">this means you can be quite limited like</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.159" end="00:08:23.990" style="s2">your your ability to make sense of and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.800" end="00:08:25.669" style="s2">then make meaningful choices in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.990" end="00:08:27.349" style="s2">environment in a liminal space can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.669" end="00:08:28.909" style="s2">very limited</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.349" end="00:08:33.169" style="s2">you know beginner&#39;s mind and child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.909" end="00:08:35.630" style="s2">mind is it children are quite liminal</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.169" end="00:08:38.390" style="s2">and you know in in many circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.630" end="00:08:42.010" style="s2">this is the best place to be and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.390" end="00:08:44.930" style="s2">quite specifically if you happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.010" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">very successful your your paramedic</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.930" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">framework has put you in a circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:51.290" style="s2">where you&#39;re a peak predator of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:53.149" style="s2">local niche you know how to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.290" end="00:08:55.339" style="s2">you could change the world you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.149" end="00:08:57.500" style="s2">control your environment then dropping</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.339" end="00:08:59.870" style="s2">out of that paradigm is a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.500" end="00:09:02.149" style="s2">challenging choice and of course this</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.870" end="00:09:04.579" style="s2">conundrum is one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.149" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">problematics the the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.579" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">doing the best the the most successful</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:14.569" style="s2">elites are in many ways the least</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:17.930" style="s2">capable because it makes the least sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.569" end="00:09:19.850" style="s2">for them as individuals of dropping out</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.930" end="00:09:24.620" style="s2">of their paradigm and dropping into</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.850" end="00:09:27.160" style="s2">liminality and yet as we said when it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.620" end="00:09:30.470" style="s2">in fact the case that your paradigm is</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.160" end="00:09:32.540" style="s2">substantially maladaptive to the reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.470" end="00:09:36.649" style="s2">that you find yourself in that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.540" end="00:09:38.779" style="s2">exactly what one needs to do I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.649" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhat obvious why I bring up</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.779" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">this particular concept today because it</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:49.819" style="s2">is in fact my proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:52.459" style="s2">effectively all or at least a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.819" end="00:09:54.829" style="s2">substantial fraction of the enormous ly</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.459" end="00:09:57.170" style="s2">successful and effective paradigms that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.829" end="00:10:00.199" style="s2">got us here</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.170" end="00:10:01.550" style="s2">you know the 20th century framework</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.199" end="00:10:05.899" style="s2">particularly 20th century Western</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.550" end="00:10:08.329" style="s2">frameworks aren&#39;t adequate to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.899" end="00:10:09.829" style="s2">reality that we find ourselves in so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.329" end="00:10:14.060" style="s2">reality that the larger their own</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.829" end="00:10:18.050" style="s2">success has given rise to and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.060" end="00:10:21.139" style="s2">particularly the case for for experts</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.050" end="00:10:23.959" style="s2">all right so if you&#39;re a very successful</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.139" end="00:10:28.699" style="s2">expert in government or academia or</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.959" end="00:10:33.649" style="s2">business and you find yourself really</p>

<p begin="00:10:33.649" end="00:10:41.569" style="s2">to what&#39;s happening and you notice that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.209" end="00:10:45.649" style="s2">your toolkit isn&#39;t adequate to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.569" end="00:10:48.079" style="s2">going on you might find yourself if</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.649" end="00:10:52.970" style="s2">you&#39;re healthy dropping into a liminal</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.079" end="00:10:56.810" style="s2">space and my recommendation in fact my</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.970" end="00:10:58.519" style="s2">my counsel is to allow that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.810" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">space in fact to to recognize how</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.519" end="00:11:03.170" style="s2">important it is to be good at dropping</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:04.860" style="s2">into and holding that liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.170" end="00:11:08.460" style="s2">because that is the place</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.860" end="00:11:11.220" style="s2">which truly innovative new concept and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.460" end="00:11:12.630" style="s2">frameworks can emerge it is the place</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.220" end="00:11:17.310" style="s2">where you have the highest degree of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.630" end="00:11:19.620" style="s2">generative creativity and it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.310" end="00:11:22.500" style="s2">precisely when one finds themself in a</p>
