<p begin="00:00:51.940" end="00:00:58.309" style="s2">self-reflexive TV shows and films uh I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.339" end="00:01:01.390" style="s2">was really inspired in particular by an</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.309" end="00:01:05.210" style="s2">interview that cavae did recently in</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.390" end="00:01:08.869" style="s2">last December with brick TVs glitter and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.210" end="00:01:11.000" style="s2">doom about Radek radical honesty I feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.869" end="00:01:12.409" style="s2">like it touched on a lot of the topics</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.000" end="00:01:15.640" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been talking about here at</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.409" end="00:01:18.259" style="s2">the stoah and so I&#39;m really excited to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.640" end="00:01:22.400" style="s2">talk to him about some of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.259" end="00:01:24.800" style="s2">that he talked about there I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.400" end="00:01:26.300" style="s2">it&#39;s probably okay to start getting into</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.800" end="00:01:29.570" style="s2">the questions there might still be a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.300" end="00:01:31.730" style="s2">people trickling in as we get started</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.570" end="00:01:33.440" style="s2">but carve a there there is something</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.730" end="00:01:36.440" style="s2">that you said in the glitter and doom</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.440" end="00:01:39.710" style="s2">interview that I really liked you said</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.440" end="00:01:43.010" style="s2">that every interaction is a microcosm</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.710" end="00:01:46.870" style="s2">for the whole of humanity&#39;s interactions</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.010" end="00:01:50.060" style="s2">and that resonated with me a lot and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.870" end="00:01:53.120" style="s2">gets to the heart of why I wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.060" end="00:01:56.150" style="s2">a series on raw sexuality at this</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.120" end="00:01:59.540" style="s2">particular moment at the stoah I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.150" end="00:02:02.930" style="s2">that we share this idea that there is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.540" end="00:02:05.180" style="s2">something to do with being radically</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.930" end="00:02:08.269" style="s2">honest about our sex lives that relates</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.180" end="00:02:10.190" style="s2">to the big issues in the world today and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.269" end="00:02:13.069" style="s2">I was wondering if you could talk a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.190" end="00:02:14.989" style="s2">little bit about why honesty on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.069" end="00:02:19.780" style="s2">personal level is important on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.989" end="00:02:23.269" style="s2">political level I mean I think I just I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.780" end="00:02:26.840" style="s2">guess I feel like we don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.269" end="00:02:28.189" style="s2">I mean I study philosophy and like after</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.840" end="00:02:29.330" style="s2">st. vaast I was like okay no one knows</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.189" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">anything it was kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.330" end="00:02:34.700" style="s2">my take-home and it&#39;s like if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:36.020" style="s2">know anything you really don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.700" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">would be the right thing to do at any</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.020" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">moment it&#39;s like you really don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">but if it&#39;s just honest about whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.370" end="00:02:45.050" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling we&#39;re thinking then it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:46.340" style="s2">was just kind of like oh just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.050" end="00:02:49.730" style="s2">take care of itself like you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.340" end="00:02:51.620" style="s2">to you have to manipulate reality to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.730" end="00:02:54.170" style="s2">to the place where you think you should</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.620" end="00:02:58.880" style="s2">go you can just like not do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.170" end="00:03:00.950" style="s2">and so to me like it&#39;s about giving up</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.880" end="00:03:02.810" style="s2">an agenda or a destination and just sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.950" end="00:03:04.820" style="s2">of like letting the truth of them of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.810" end="00:03:07.820" style="s2">situation just sort of unfold</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.820" end="00:03:10.430" style="s2">organically and that seems to me like it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.820" end="00:03:12.440" style="s2">avoids a lot of wrong minded thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.430" end="00:03:14.180" style="s2">about what should be or and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.440" end="00:03:15.500" style="s2">misinformation about what it is because</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.180" end="00:03:17.450" style="s2">we don&#39;t know I mean we just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.500" end="00:03:19.580" style="s2">but we do know how we feel and we do</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.450" end="00:03:26.840" style="s2">know what&#39;s true for us and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.580" end="00:03:31.610" style="s2">we really do know yeah and in your films</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.840" end="00:03:34.700" style="s2">it seems that this honesty is the sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.610" end="00:03:37.880" style="s2">of compass for you that that directs all</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.700" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">of your films usually your shows and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.880" end="00:03:42.650" style="s2">your films don&#39;t have a script the show</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:46.340" style="s2">about the show each episode is about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.650" end="00:03:48.769" style="s2">making of the episode before and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.340" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s it reminds me a lot of improv</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.769" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">we we talk sometimes about impro by</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.840" end="00:03:55.670" style="s2">keith johnston here at the ZOA</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:58.220" style="s2">and a lot of us are into the like</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.670" end="00:04:01.880" style="s2">uncertainty and being and unknowingness</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.220" end="00:04:05.239" style="s2">and I wonder if you could talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.880" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">bit about how all of the uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.239" end="00:04:10.760" style="s2">around the Kovach crisis has affected</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:12.950" style="s2">your love life and your sex life and if</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.760" end="00:04:15.050" style="s2">that&#39;s had any repercussions through</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.950" end="00:04:19.880" style="s2">your art since it&#39;s always so self</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.050" end="00:04:22.270" style="s2">reflexive I mean it&#39;s been good for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.880" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">might be good for my sex life actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.270" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">and I&#39;m having a relationship right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:32.270" style="s2">with somebody online who lives in Berlin</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:34.640" style="s2">and we met online just she was she she</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.270" end="00:04:36.440" style="s2">was a fan of of my work and we started</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.640" end="00:04:39.830" style="s2">talking and it&#39;s been like incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.440" end="00:04:41.870" style="s2">intense and kind of amazing I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.830" end="00:04:42.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this would have happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.870" end="00:04:47.220" style="s2">if we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.840" end="00:04:49.500" style="s2">having this quarantine and my heart has</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.220" end="00:04:52.970" style="s2">just been really wide open because of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.500" end="00:04:52.970" style="s2">so for me it&#39;s been really good</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.010" end="00:04:59.200" style="s2">I&#39;m really curious can you say any more</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.110" end="00:05:02.350" style="s2">about why you think it might have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.200" end="00:05:05.290" style="s2">like partially because of the unique</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.350" end="00:05:08.460" style="s2">quarantine situation that you&#39;ve been so</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.290" end="00:05:11.560" style="s2">open hearted in this new relationship I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.460" end="00:05:13.690" style="s2">mean I think it&#39;s forced everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.560" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">slow down its first everyone kind of to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.690" end="00:05:19.180" style="s2">take stock of what&#39;s important and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">just seems like a wake-up call to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.180" end="00:05:26.020" style="s2">everybody at all levels and it also has</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:28.420" style="s2">provided like the kind of alone time</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.020" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">that we don&#39;t get enough of usually and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.420" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">I think you know like we can talk for</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:38.980" style="s2">hours on the phone or whatever because</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.740" end="00:05:40.780" style="s2">we&#39;re in this kind of period when people</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.980" end="00:05:44.170" style="s2">aren&#39;t really working you know like work</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.780" end="00:05:45.730" style="s2">has been sowed if you shut down so so</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.730" end="00:05:51.340" style="s2">meditation retreat really and I think in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.190" end="00:05:53.200" style="s2">that space things things arise that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.340" end="00:05:58.290" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t arise if you were you know on</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.200" end="00:05:58.290" style="s2">the treadmill of getting ahead</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:05.340" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s really interesting I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.759" end="00:06:07.740" style="s2">be talking to cadre until about the half</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.120" end="00:06:21.780" style="s2">to get back to what you said about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.620" end="00:06:23.699" style="s2">the pandemic has been sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.780" end="00:06:26.250" style="s2">meditation retreat I know that one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.699" end="00:06:29.699" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve seen sort of in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.250" end="00:06:32.370" style="s2">in the media around the pandemic is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.699" end="00:06:34.500" style="s2">we&#39;re all going through this mass trauma</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.370" end="00:06:37.770" style="s2">together and there&#39;s been sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.500" end="00:06:40.289" style="s2">heavy way that it&#39;s been phrased to us</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.770" end="00:06:42.740" style="s2">and and to think of it as that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.289" end="00:06:45.000" style="s2">I mean and emitted li involuntarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.740" end="00:06:47.849" style="s2">together on this sort of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.000" end="00:06:49.860" style="s2">retreat feels like a more uplifting way</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.849" end="00:06:52.949" style="s2">to look at it do you feel the same way</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.860" end="00:06:59.580" style="s2">yeah I think might as well look at it in</p>

<p begin="00:07:12.870" end="00:07:19.349" style="s2">way everyone is sort of more and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:21.750" style="s2">connected you know and I think like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.349" end="00:07:23.220" style="s2">use I used to edit with people you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.750" end="00:07:25.320" style="s2">every day and they&#39;d come to my</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.220" end="00:07:27.300" style="s2">apartment and it was nice I enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.320" end="00:07:28.710" style="s2">they would come over edit but now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.300" end="00:07:31.530" style="s2">editing with people like all over the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.710" end="00:07:34.380" style="s2">you know all over the place and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.530" end="00:07:36.770" style="s2">no more boundaries so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.380" end="00:07:40.289" style="s2">geographic boundaries in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.770" end="00:07:43.259" style="s2">and you know I think there&#39;s this sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.289" end="00:07:46.250" style="s2">in which we&#39;re all one and in which you</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.259" end="00:07:49.380" style="s2">know consciousness is collective and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.250" end="00:07:52.020" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the technology</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.380" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">of it and the forced zoom this of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.020" end="00:07:55.169" style="s2">that kind of brings it together I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:58.199" style="s2">it&#39;s really weird I mean there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.169" end="00:08:00.990" style="s2">these people here in this space and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.199" end="00:08:03.720" style="s2">almost like we&#39;re we&#39;re one mind or</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.990" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">something like a hive mind or something</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.720" end="00:08:10.470" style="s2">and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:17.020" style="s2">that&#39;s been increased since the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.470" end="00:08:20.650" style="s2">coronavirus hearing that I noticed the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.020" end="00:08:22.930" style="s2">word boundaries felt like emphatic for</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.650" end="00:08:25.690" style="s2">you I know from watching your work that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.930" end="00:08:28.750" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;ve had almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.690" end="00:08:31.720" style="s2">position of being against boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.750" end="00:08:33.339" style="s2">wanting everybody to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.720" end="00:08:36.750" style="s2">connected and honest with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.339" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">working together is is there a way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.750" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve like gone out of your way to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:48.070" style="s2">advantage of the boundaries that have</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:50.279" style="s2">dissolved in this situation out of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.070" end="00:08:50.279" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:56.649" style="s2">no I just think I mean boundaries are</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.730" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">weird I mean I&#39;m not very good with</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.649" end="00:09:00.490" style="s2">boundaries like I&#39;m like I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:01.899" style="s2">them and I don&#39;t think I have good</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.490" end="00:09:03.970" style="s2">boundaries and I and I know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.899" end="00:09:06.279" style="s2">something good about boundaries but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.970" end="00:09:08.350" style="s2">mostly experience the Meza as a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.279" end="00:09:13.000" style="s2">or as a limitation that I that I chafe</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.350" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">against I took African drumming classes</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.000" end="00:09:17.740" style="s2">for a while and I remember the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:19.089" style="s2">would say like if you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.740" end="00:09:21.310" style="s2">drumming you know everyone has a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.089" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">different beat that they&#39;re doing and if</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.310" end="00:09:25.630" style="s2">you are too intent on the other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:27.850" style="s2">beat like you&#39;re listening too carefully</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.630" end="00:09:30.190" style="s2">to them you lose your own beat and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.850" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">you screw up the rhythm and but if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.190" end="00:09:34.270" style="s2">also like our to focus on doing your own</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:35.589" style="s2">be right you don&#39;t hear what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.270" end="00:09:37.589" style="s2">doing and you also script the rhythm and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.589" end="00:09:40.360" style="s2">there was a delicate balance between</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.589" end="00:09:42.100" style="s2">keeping your beat and being and hearing</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.360" end="00:09:44.200" style="s2">the other person&#39;s beat that was really</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.100" end="00:09:46.209" style="s2">tricky and it&#39;s kind of almost like you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.200" end="00:09:48.100" style="s2">just hard not to lose it you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.209" end="00:09:50.230" style="s2">constantly and then you kind of find it</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.100" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">again you know there&#39;s a quote by Kafka</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.230" end="00:09:55.870" style="s2">I like a lot he says uh the true way is</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:57.990" style="s2">like a rope that is stretched not at any</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.870" end="00:10:00.610" style="s2">great height but just above the ground</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.990" end="00:10:03.640" style="s2">it seems almost as it was put there to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.610" end="00:10:06.790" style="s2">make you stumble over it rather than to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.640" end="00:10:08.709" style="s2">be walked on and and the true way it</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.790" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">feels like this very tricky thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.709" end="00:10:13.899" style="s2">so much like the actual way and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:15.430" style="s2">just this very minor difference that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.899" end="00:10:18.360" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly getting tripped up on</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.430" end="00:10:18.360" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.610" end="00:10:21.699" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m just I&#39;m just riffing on</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.809" end="00:10:23.889" style="s2">boundaries but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.699" end="00:10:25.929" style="s2">like and even here you know like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.889" end="00:10:29.439" style="s2">a like there&#39;s all these people in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.929" end="00:10:30.610" style="s2">in the room and I&#39;m like oh there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.439" end="00:10:33.629" style="s2">these people are they okay I hope</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.610" end="00:10:36.040" style="s2">they&#39;re okay is this going on too long</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.629" end="00:10:38.230" style="s2">should we should we open it up sooner</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.040" end="00:10:40.569" style="s2">you know like there&#39;s a and then also if</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.230" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">I do it too much I&#39;m not even like in my</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.569" end="00:10:46.119" style="s2">own thing you know and being expressive</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:48.699" style="s2">I&#39;m just being worried or something but</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.119" end="00:10:50.499" style="s2">you you want both energies and finding</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.699" end="00:10:54.819" style="s2">that balance I think is is the tricky</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.499" end="00:10:56.499" style="s2">thing in life in general and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.819" end="00:10:59.980" style="s2">Xoom think is more to moved it into this</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.499" end="00:11:03.189" style="s2">place where it&#39;s more focused you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.980" end="00:11:05.829" style="s2">and it&#39;s almost like a pinpoint of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.189" end="00:11:07.619" style="s2">attention and you know there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.829" end="00:11:11.949" style="s2">senses that are gone like touch and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.619" end="00:11:13.209" style="s2">smell and taste are not in that but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.949" end="00:11:14.619" style="s2">rest of it it&#39;s like when you&#39;re blind</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.209" end="00:11:16.089" style="s2">you you hear better like you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.619" end="00:11:22.600" style="s2">there&#39;s something that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.089" end="00:11:26.199" style="s2">intensified right when I was in clown</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.600" end="00:11:29.499" style="s2">school there was an exercise we did</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.199" end="00:11:31.629" style="s2">where one of the partners would put out</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.499" end="00:11:34.029" style="s2">a finger and then you would connect the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.629" end="00:11:36.339" style="s2">fingers and one of the partners would</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.029" end="00:11:38.730" style="s2">agree to close their eyes and be led</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.339" end="00:11:41.949" style="s2">around in a room full of other clowns</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.730" end="00:11:45.249" style="s2">just by the fingertip of the clown that</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.949" end="00:11:49.959" style="s2">had their eyes open and there was such a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.249" end="00:11:53.110" style="s2">magical intimacy in um trusting each</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.959" end="00:11:55.869" style="s2">other that way whether you were leading</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.110" end="00:11:59.649" style="s2">somebody or you were the follower there</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.869" end="00:12:04.419" style="s2">was such a surrender and such a giving</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.649" end="00:12:07.449" style="s2">up of other sensory input you you had to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.419" end="00:12:10.169" style="s2">focus so much on that one little point</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.449" end="00:12:12.939" style="s2">of connection and I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.169" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">relates to the way that the zune called</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.939" end="00:12:18.610" style="s2">creates constraints that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:20.829" style="s2">hack into the maseeh rather than hinder</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.610" end="00:12:24.939" style="s2">it I think that that&#39;s a really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.829" end="00:12:27.759" style="s2">way to look at it I know that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.939" end="00:12:29.079" style="s2">your work looks at trying to break other</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.759" end="00:12:31.970" style="s2">kinds of boundaries and limitations</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.079" end="00:12:33.979" style="s2">especially ones around sexual shame I</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.970" end="00:12:39.109" style="s2">I know I am a sex addict was especially</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.979" end="00:12:40.999" style="s2">aimed at trying to like have a voice in</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.109" end="00:12:42.679" style="s2">a narrative around sex addiction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.999" end="00:12:44.479" style="s2">often like very shame on you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.679" end="00:12:47.689" style="s2">I&#39;d love to hear you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.479" end="00:12:49.189" style="s2">about that I mean shame is like my</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.689" end="00:12:52.459" style="s2">middle name I mean I just feel it all</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.189" end="00:12:54.529" style="s2">the time and and I think you know like</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.459" end="00:12:56.599" style="s2">this person that I&#39;ve started seeing I</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.529" end="00:12:59.509" style="s2">guess you know through zoom you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.599" end="00:13:02.539" style="s2">like we kind of are like you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.509" end="00:13:05.720" style="s2">sexual in this the energy is sexual and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.539" end="00:13:08.179" style="s2">we&#39;re both like wanting to have sex and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.720" end="00:13:11.389" style="s2">yeah we can&#39;t and so what do you do and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.179" end="00:13:12.949" style="s2">and it&#39;s I don&#39;t know like last night I</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.389" end="00:13:15.109" style="s2">was sort of trying to explore this and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.949" end="00:13:18.379" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not I&#39;m not very good at</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.109" end="00:13:20.749" style="s2">whatever online sex I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.379" end="00:13:23.359" style="s2">really understand it or or you know it</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.749" end="00:13:26.089" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s never drawn me you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.359" end="00:13:28.129" style="s2">ever it was drawn to it but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.089" end="00:13:30.139" style="s2">what would it mean to have sex with</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.129" end="00:13:31.959" style="s2">somebody when you can&#39;t be with them you</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.139" end="00:13:34.339" style="s2">know what does that look like I you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.959" end="00:13:37.699" style="s2">and I think a lot of it had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.339" end="00:13:40.369" style="s2">with verbalizing I make for me it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.699" end="00:13:43.549" style="s2">like verbalizing ones desire felt like</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.369" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">sex or verbalizing one sexual desire or</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.549" end="00:13:47.509" style="s2">verbalizing this the particularity that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:50.149" style="s2">one&#39;s sexual desire because so much to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.509" end="00:13:53.509" style="s2">say about sex for me is about shame</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.149" end="00:13:55.159" style="s2">being healed and about like doing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.509" end="00:13:57.589" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re a little bit of shade</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.159" end="00:13:59.389" style="s2">of but doing it anyway and the person</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.780" end="00:15:23.180" style="s2">available within the constraints of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:27.230" style="s2">whatever now we are you know inherently</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.180" end="00:15:30.860" style="s2">traps in I hear a lot from you in your</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.230" end="00:15:33.590" style="s2">work too about like a drive for novelty</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.860" end="00:15:36.910" style="s2">and I hear in your life a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.590" end="00:15:40.280" style="s2">ambivalence over the years around this</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.910" end="00:15:45.760" style="s2">what I what I see is a natural desire</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.280" end="00:15:49.130" style="s2">for newness how how would you relate</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.760" end="00:15:51.890" style="s2">your like desire for novelty to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.130" end="00:15:54.020" style="s2">highest spiritual conception you have of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.890" end="00:15:57.830" style="s2">yourself what&#39;s your defense of novelty</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.020" end="00:16:01.130" style="s2">as like a spiritual passion well I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.830" end="00:16:05.930" style="s2">God is always new I mean I think God is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.130" end="00:16:08.090" style="s2">the eternal newness of the moment being</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:10.490" style="s2">recreated in each moment I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.090" end="00:16:13.850" style="s2">like new new new new new new you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.490" end="00:16:15.830" style="s2">and I think what we do as humans is we</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.850" end="00:16:18.650" style="s2">kind of like well one we&#39;re scared of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.830" end="00:16:20.270" style="s2">the new so we kind of like try to think</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.650" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">of experience than you based on some</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.270" end="00:16:25.400" style="s2">previous concept that had to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:29.690" style="s2">previous new but is not the current new</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.400" end="00:16:32.180" style="s2">and so you know I think I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.690" end="00:16:35.000" style="s2">all kind of control freaks and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.180" end="00:16:36.770" style="s2">think that if we could just I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.000" end="00:16:40.010" style="s2">whatever it is even if it&#39;s like I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.770" end="00:16:41.480" style="s2">to take the trash out you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.010" end="00:16:44.180" style="s2">like that&#39;s my goal I&#39;m gonna take the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.480" end="00:16:45.950" style="s2">trash out now like even that is too much</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.180" end="00:16:47.540" style="s2">like you know like because then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.950" end="00:16:50.450" style="s2">like not even like you&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.540" end="00:16:52.940" style="s2">attention to the the the trek down the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.450" end="00:16:55.970" style="s2">stairs to the trashcan you&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.940" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">in the trash getting done and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.970" end="00:17:01.460" style="s2">like a an incredible bliss to be had of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:03.200" style="s2">just like I&#39;m gonna walk towards the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.460" end="00:17:06.850" style="s2">trash can and I don&#39;t know where what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.200" end="00:17:07.720" style="s2">going to happen and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.850" end="00:17:09.220" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m not even gonna get to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.720" end="00:17:10.660" style="s2">trashcan maybe like something will</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.220" end="00:17:12.939" style="s2">happen along the way and I won&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.660" end="00:17:15.130" style="s2">out the trash oh I&#39;ll get sidetracked</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.939" end="00:17:17.919" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that&#39;s good or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.130" end="00:17:22.929" style="s2">fine so I just know that my own fears</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.919" end="00:17:25.630" style="s2">have a lot to do with fearing I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.929" end="00:17:28.840" style="s2">no faith I mean I think I&#39;m not the only</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.630" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">person but I think it&#39;s hot most people</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.840" end="00:17:32.410" style="s2">don&#39;t have faith that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">Providence or there&#39;s a reason whether</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.410" end="00:17:35.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a meaning for what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:38.470" style="s2">and so we&#39;re always fighting it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.590" end="00:17:40.210" style="s2">being like oh shit that wasn&#39;t well you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.470" end="00:17:46.260" style="s2">know should have happened but I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.210" end="00:17:49.450" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to like surrender to a higher</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.260" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">knowledge than my own you know limited</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.450" end="00:17:55.870" style="s2">ego knowledge of what I think would</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">would help me feel better and and I you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.870" end="00:17:58.299" style="s2">know and you know the saying a a you</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:18:01.059" style="s2">know because I&#39;d spent a lot of years in</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.299" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">a a meetings you know your best thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.059" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">has gotten you here you know best thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:08.169" style="s2">has gotten you in a room where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:10.870" style="s2">like I have a problem so you know my</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.169" end="00:18:13.840" style="s2">thinking is not you know my thinking has</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.870" end="00:18:15.580" style="s2">not helped doesn&#39;t help and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.840" end="00:18:17.169" style="s2">kind of knowing I think that is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.580" end="00:18:19.090" style="s2">thinking that is a spiritual knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.169" end="00:18:21.700" style="s2">which i think is what we need to tap</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.090" end="00:18:24.669" style="s2">into but also just like a surrender at</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.700" end="00:18:26.710" style="s2">every moment of like this isn&#39;t a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.669" end="00:18:29.409" style="s2">example my idea of what it should</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.710" end="00:18:32.679" style="s2">resemble and what is there what is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.409" end="00:18:34.390" style="s2">newness of that that is actually here</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.679" end="00:18:36.820" style="s2">presenting yourself to me for for</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.390" end="00:18:38.590" style="s2">reception like to receive it and most</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.820" end="00:18:41.080" style="s2">the time I&#39;m not receiving the world I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.590" end="00:18:44.110" style="s2">just not like I&#39;m like no thank you i I</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.080" end="00:18:46.510" style="s2">have I have other plans you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.110" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">that is actually the opposite of bliss</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.510" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s the opposite of art and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:52.390" style="s2">the opposite of spirituality to I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:56.450" style="s2">it&#39;s just like Oh or is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.390" end="00:18:57.529" style="s2">spirituality or something so just</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.450" end="00:19:00.499" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if just being really</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.529" end="00:19:03.080" style="s2">receptive to how the moment is different</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.499" end="00:19:09.619" style="s2">than the moment a moment ago and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.080" end="00:19:11.239" style="s2">then how that keeps happening there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.619" end="00:19:15.739" style="s2">weird delay here I answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.239" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">then there&#39;s like a long pause just like</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.739" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">really enjoying it to even break the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:26.989" style="s2">silence because I&#39;m just savoring the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:29.149" style="s2">way that you&#39;ve described impermanence I</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.989" end="00:19:32.059" style="s2">really love the Buddhist and like hindu</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.149" end="00:19:34.789" style="s2">concepts of things being continuous and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.059" end="00:19:37.009" style="s2">momentary in their own ways and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.789" end="00:19:39.409" style="s2">it&#39;s just really I don&#39;t know delicious</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.009" end="00:19:43.700" style="s2">to hear your take on it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.409" end="00:19:46.429" style="s2">I I was planning to ask you kind of for</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.700" end="00:19:48.980" style="s2">your other side of your ambivalence or a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.429" end="00:19:51.529" style="s2">novelty to what what part of it like</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.980" end="00:19:53.350" style="s2">drives you crazy and like makes you mad</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.529" end="00:19:57.980" style="s2">at yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.350" end="00:20:00.200" style="s2">what part of novelty am i against what</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.980" end="00:20:03.409" style="s2">part of your own like drive towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.200" end="00:20:04.730" style="s2">novelty feels like something that draws</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.409" end="00:20:10.879" style="s2">you away from your own highest</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.730" end="00:20:12.590" style="s2">spirituality um I don&#39;t I&#39;m not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.879" end="00:20:15.980" style="s2">any ambivalence about about novelty I</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.590" end="00:20:18.440" style="s2">think about for novelty are you are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.980" end="00:20:21.470" style="s2">afraid to something specific yeah mostly</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.440" end="00:20:24.619" style="s2">just the I am a sex addict and having</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.470" end="00:20:26.779" style="s2">like a desire to pursue sex with other</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.619" end="00:20:28.789" style="s2">women outside of the relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.779" end="00:20:31.190" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to manage or something</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.789" end="00:20:35.119" style="s2">like that oh right right like monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.190" end="00:20:37.519" style="s2">you mean something like that yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.119" end="00:20:41.779" style="s2">mean I think there is novelty to be had</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.519" end="00:20:42.830" style="s2">in any situation for sure I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.779" end="00:20:44.299" style="s2">is I mean I think the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.830" end="00:20:46.419" style="s2">relationships is they they feel stale</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.299" end="00:20:49.129" style="s2">after a while and I think that staleness</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.419" end="00:20:51.889" style="s2">has a lot to do with our own mental</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.129" end="00:20:53.059" style="s2">staleness that we project onto the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.889" end="00:20:55.609" style="s2">I&#39;m the other thing I noticed when I get</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.059" end="00:20:56.869" style="s2">stoned which I love to do is the person</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.609" end="00:20:59.119" style="s2">that I&#39;m talking to you like you for</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.869" end="00:21:01.249" style="s2">example maybe you know like I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.119" end="00:21:03.590" style="s2">a concept of you and when I talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.249" end="00:21:05.599" style="s2">I&#39;m imposing my concept of you on you</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.590" end="00:21:07.429" style="s2">and it&#39;s even just the way you look like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.599" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">I like you have a face like I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.429" end="00:21:10.309" style="s2">like saw your face once and it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.919" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.309" end="00:21:14.599" style="s2">in my mind and then when you talk your</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.489" style="s2">face is changing every second and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.599" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">have like a thousand different faces but</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.489" end="00:21:20.119" style="s2">I&#39;m just seeing that one face that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:22.309" style="s2">that I remembered and that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.119" end="00:21:24.440" style="s2">projecting onto your face but when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.309" end="00:21:26.899" style="s2">stoned I&#39;m like oh whoa she looks</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.440" end="00:21:28.099" style="s2">totally different then she was looking</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.899" end="00:21:30.739" style="s2">when I wasn&#39;t stoned and you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.099" end="00:21:32.599" style="s2">different every every second or several</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.739" end="00:21:35.149" style="s2">times a second and it&#39;s just like oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.599" end="00:21:37.429" style="s2">there&#39;s sadness oh there&#39;s there&#39;s humor</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.149" end="00:21:39.859" style="s2">and odours anger and oh there&#39;s joy I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.429" end="00:21:42.440" style="s2">know there&#39;s sexiness and oh there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.859" end="00:21:44.839" style="s2">know jealousy and oh there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.440" end="00:21:46.849" style="s2">and it&#39;s just like I can&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.839" end="00:21:50.389" style="s2">encompass you you&#39;re just like always</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.849" end="00:21:52.639" style="s2">morphing on me and and and I love that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.389" end="00:21:54.589" style="s2">I&#39;m just like and I&#39;m just receptive and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.639" end="00:21:56.389" style="s2">I&#39;m just like whoa who the hell are you</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.589" end="00:21:57.950" style="s2">and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.389" end="00:22:00.409" style="s2">need to know but you&#39;re not what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.950" end="00:22:05.659" style="s2">thought you were and there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.409" end="00:22:08.330" style="s2">the other power and sacredness that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.659" end="00:22:09.769" style="s2">arises from that and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.330" end="00:22:11.330" style="s2">problems with monogamy is you lose that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.769" end="00:22:12.950" style="s2">sense of their the others power and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.330" end="00:22:15.049" style="s2">sacredness you know they become you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.950" end="00:22:17.089" style="s2">their kin flat and it&#39;s like oh I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.049" end="00:22:19.219" style="s2">what for example I know what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.089" end="00:22:22.609" style="s2">to have sex with with you for example</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.219" end="00:22:25.099" style="s2">but I don&#39;t I mean I might have had that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.609" end="00:22:26.690" style="s2">before but I haven&#39;t had like the one</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.099" end="00:22:29.359" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have like right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.690" end="00:22:31.429" style="s2">and so it&#39;s tricky it&#39;s hard I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.359" end="00:22:33.109" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to have novelty in monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.429" end="00:22:35.869" style="s2">and it certainly easier just to find a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.109" end="00:22:37.729" style="s2">new person who&#39;s just like new and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.869" end="00:22:39.710" style="s2">you can like be okay that obviously new</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.729" end="00:22:42.229" style="s2">and that&#39;s nice and I love novelty learn</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.710" end="00:22:44.299" style="s2">that way like I love other sex with new</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.229" end="00:22:45.349" style="s2">people like I think it&#39;s exciting to</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.299" end="00:22:49.450" style="s2">have sex with the person you never had</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.349" end="00:22:51.499" style="s2">sex with before and it&#39;s a but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.450" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">exciting to have sex with a person</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.499" end="00:22:57.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve had sex before in a new way or in</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:58.309" style="s2">a braver way and that just requires just</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.320" end="00:22:59.869" style="s2">going deeper and deeper and deeper all</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.309" end="00:23:03.289" style="s2">the time which is kind of vertiginous</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.869" end="00:23:04.999" style="s2">you know like like I&#39;m dizzy how can I</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.289" end="00:23:06.139" style="s2">go deeper I&#39;ve gone as deep as I can go</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.999" end="00:23:09.769" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s any deeper to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.139" end="00:23:13.389" style="s2">go but there always is and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.769" end="00:23:14.950" style="s2">know I&#39;ve know like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.389" end="00:23:17.799" style="s2">I&#39;m agnostic about monogamy polygamy</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.950" end="00:23:21.749" style="s2">like I I see both I see the value of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.799" end="00:23:21.749" style="s2">both spiritual paths</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.410" end="00:23:29.660" style="s2">but I think novelty is needed in either</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.390" end="00:23:29.660" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.670" end="00:23:35.330" style="s2">yeah it makes me think of what you said</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.900" end="00:23:38.810" style="s2">about um normally when we watch the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.330" end="00:23:41.390" style="s2">garbage can we have no awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.810" end="00:23:43.880" style="s2">other possibilities apart from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.390" end="00:23:47.420" style="s2">regular completion of the garbage can</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.880" end="00:23:49.250" style="s2">tasks and as as sad as it might sound I</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.420" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">think often in in long-term</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.250" end="00:23:54.290" style="s2">relationships whether they&#39;re monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:56.870" style="s2">or non-monogamous we sort of approach</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.290" end="00:23:59.240" style="s2">sex in the same way a lot of times we</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.870" end="00:24:01.730" style="s2">have kind of a routine and that routine</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.240" end="00:24:05.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily vary a lot anymore</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.730" end="00:24:07.130" style="s2">because we find a way that is like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.000" end="00:24:09.230" style="s2">least vulnerable and that becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.130" end="00:24:13.840" style="s2">path of least resistance but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.230" end="00:24:17.000" style="s2">the least sexy um one thing that your</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.840" end="00:24:20.420" style="s2">filmmaking is really good at is like</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.000" end="00:24:23.270" style="s2">presenting vulnerability even when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.420" end="00:24:26.000" style="s2">not what would be in anybody&#39;s comfort</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.270" end="00:24:33.800" style="s2">zone how do you feel like that has</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.000" end="00:24:37.250" style="s2">improved your sex life amassing</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.800" end="00:24:38.840" style="s2">vulnerability and and and sex sexual</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.250" end="00:24:44.020" style="s2">lists are related you know like I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.840" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">I think not vulnerable sex is not as</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.020" end="00:24:53.060" style="s2">exciting or sexual or sexy or sensual as</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:55.040" style="s2">vulnerable sex and and I think and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.060" end="00:24:56.570" style="s2">that&#39;s not just true of sex is true of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.040" end="00:24:58.490" style="s2">any interaction I&#39;m it&#39;s true of just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.570" end="00:24:59.660" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s true of a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.490" end="00:25:01.820" style="s2">with a stranger on the street you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.660" end="00:25:04.760" style="s2">like there&#39;s something a vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.820" end="00:25:08.780" style="s2">that is so sexy I don&#39;t know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.760" end="00:25:10.370" style="s2">and they&#39;re like and and it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.780" end="00:25:12.170" style="s2">fall in love with the person I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.370" end="00:25:14.330" style="s2">think I think we fall in love with</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.170" end="00:25:15.740" style="s2">vulnerable nests you know like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.330" end="00:25:18.800" style="s2">people&#39;s vulnerability that we love in</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.740" end="00:25:20.450" style="s2">them it&#39;s not their you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.800" end="00:25:23.510" style="s2">their accomplishments or their strengths</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.450" end="00:25:25.550" style="s2">really it&#39;s their and even in a movie</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.510" end="00:25:27.890" style="s2">you know like the scenes that you love</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.550" end="00:25:30.890" style="s2">and are the scenes where something was</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.890" end="00:25:34.370" style="s2">broken or something was opened that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.890" end="00:25:38.230" style="s2">know your own heart could pour into so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.370" end="00:25:38.230" style="s2">think vulnerability is</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.600" end="00:25:44.750" style="s2">yeah I mean there&#39;s of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.220" end="00:25:48.770" style="s2">you know people who are into like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.750" end="00:25:51.020" style="s2">know masochism and bondage and stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.770" end="00:25:53.570" style="s2">and I&#39;m not really a sniper really been</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.020" end="00:25:55.940" style="s2">a world that I&#39;ve explored much but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.570" end="00:25:58.130" style="s2">imagine that even in that world there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.940" end="00:26:01.400" style="s2">like all this vulnerability around the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.130" end="00:26:03.590" style="s2">trappings of invulnerability you know so</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.400" end="00:26:07.040" style="s2">I don&#39;t know it just seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.590" end="00:26:14.090" style="s2">kind of the key ingredient in connection</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.040" end="00:26:15.770" style="s2">and in an in ear us really um it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.090" end="00:26:17.990" style="s2">getting kind of close that half hour</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.770" end="00:26:18.800" style="s2">mark so I&#39;m gonna open it up to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.990" end="00:26:22.190" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.800" end="00:26:28.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll let Peter start if he&#39;d like to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.190" end="00:26:29.330" style="s2">mute himself thanks maybe so my original</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.040" end="00:26:30.890" style="s2">question was what is your current theory</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.330" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">on monogamy but you kind of touched on</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.890" end="00:26:37.640" style="s2">that so I&#39;m gonna modify the question so</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">you you came in my previous podcast</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.640" end="00:26:40.610" style="s2">twice and the second time was with</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:41.870" style="s2">talking with Chester Brown and you guys</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.610" end="00:26:44.300" style="s2">had sort of jesse brown four people</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.870" end="00:26:46.790" style="s2">don&#39;t know he&#39;s a graphic novelist did a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.300" end="00:26:48.470" style="s2">bunch of amazing graphic novels one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.790" end="00:26:50.840" style="s2">them called paying for it and then kinda</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.470" end="00:26:52.430" style="s2">and Chester had sort like a debate non</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.840" end="00:26:54.200" style="s2">debate about you know you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.430" end="00:26:58.130" style="s2">approach this similar topic from</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.200" end="00:27:01.370" style="s2">different positions so I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.130" end="00:27:04.570" style="s2">question is since we last spoke</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.370" end="00:27:06.950" style="s2">what has your theory on monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.570" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">relationship sexuality has it has it</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.950" end="00:27:13.730" style="s2">changed at all it&#39;s always changing</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:18.470" style="s2">based on whatever is happening you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.730" end="00:27:20.390" style="s2">in my life you know I think maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.470" end="00:27:23.300" style="s2">be okay with this but like Mia maybe had</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.390" end="00:27:26.420" style="s2">a talk like a few like a few days ago</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.300" end="00:27:28.850" style="s2">and we talked about sexual attraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.420" end="00:27:31.850" style="s2">stuff with each other</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.410" end="00:27:52.160" style="s2">really invested in it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.790" end="00:27:55.190" style="s2">spiritually you know I think</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.890" end="00:28:11.530" style="s2">and so I was kind of in this place of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.740" end="00:28:14.660" style="s2">like um I should probably tell Valerie</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.530" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">about my conversation with maybe but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.660" end="00:28:19.610" style="s2">was scared too because I didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:21.590" style="s2">alienate her or scare her away because I</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.610" end="00:28:24.140" style="s2">was like just really wanted this</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.590" end="00:28:26.210" style="s2">relationship to work out and because</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.430" end="00:29:47.030" style="s2">worried and probably be kind of excited</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.530" end="00:29:49.670" style="s2">and feel like well this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.030" end="00:29:53.900" style="s2">exciting this person would seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.670" end="00:29:56.630" style="s2">like more I don&#39;t call it like like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.900" end="00:30:00.620" style="s2">think the other other and sacred and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.630" end="00:30:02.660" style="s2">powerful then they do when I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.620" end="00:30:04.220" style="s2">protect them or have the notion of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.660" end="00:30:05.730" style="s2">they need are trying to manage them or</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.220" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.730" end="00:30:08.850" style="s2">and she suddenly went from being</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:11.670" style="s2">somebody who I somehow is projecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.850" end="00:30:14.370" style="s2">like a certain amount of neediness onto</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.670" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">or needing me to be a certain way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.370" end="00:30:20.760" style="s2">somebody who was just like way cooler</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:24.630" style="s2">and way sexier and it was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.760" end="00:30:26.010" style="s2">great shift and just showed me like how</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.630" end="00:30:28.520" style="s2">I was starting to already fall into a</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.010" end="00:30:30.870" style="s2">rut with this person that I&#39;ve only been</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.520" end="00:30:35.850" style="s2">talking to for a couple of weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.870" end="00:30:39.060" style="s2">have never even met so I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.850" end="00:30:41.380" style="s2">the answer is I just know that being</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.060" end="00:30:43.900" style="s2">honest</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.380" end="00:30:48.010" style="s2">we&#39;ll take you to where you need to go I</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.900" end="00:30:50.350" style="s2">think and and keeps it fresh keeps it</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.010" end="00:30:56.020" style="s2">alive keeps it keeps it from falling</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.350" end="00:30:57.610" style="s2">into you know stale projections yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.020" end="00:31:03.179" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was thinking it it creates</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.289" end="00:31:10.059" style="s2">have a follow-up question around that um</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.210" end="00:31:13.330" style="s2">something that I really admire is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.059" end="00:31:16.780" style="s2">she was able to express to you that she</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.330" end="00:31:19.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t know how she would feel I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.780" end="00:31:22.150" style="s2">that that is like such an exciting form</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.480" end="00:31:24.760" style="s2">of honesty and I&#39;d love to hear like how</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.150" end="00:31:26.980" style="s2">it landed with you to have someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.760" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">expressed that that they didn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.980" end="00:31:31.870" style="s2">they would feel about something yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:33.370" style="s2">mean it was it was exciting and alive it</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.870" end="00:31:35.110" style="s2">was like life like you don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.370" end="00:31:37.390" style="s2">gonna happen tomorrow you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.110" end="00:31:40.960" style="s2">we could all die and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.390" end="00:31:44.230" style="s2">great you know yeah I just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.960" end="00:31:45.340" style="s2">like it brought me closer to her for</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.230" end="00:31:47.740" style="s2">real like a brought me closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.340" end="00:31:49.809" style="s2">real her as opposed to the fantasy her I</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.740" end="00:31:53.020" style="s2">could just cut the fantasy out of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.809" end="00:31:55.450" style="s2">equation and you know sexuality is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.020" end="00:31:56.890" style="s2">weird mix of fantasy and and reality you</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.450" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of a dialectic between</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.890" end="00:32:01.750" style="s2">those two things I think and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:03.520" style="s2">of what&#39;s great about it like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.750" end="00:32:06.549" style="s2">all fantasy like it&#39;s it gets it gets</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.520" end="00:32:08.919" style="s2">old and dead and and you know my</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.549" end="00:32:12.280" style="s2">argument with Chester I think was kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.919" end="00:32:14.289" style="s2">of about you know I think it came down</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.280" end="00:32:15.850" style="s2">to fantasy you know like is there</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.289" end="00:32:17.500" style="s2">something wrong with fantasy and of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.850" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">course there isn&#39;t anything wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.500" end="00:32:22.750" style="s2">fantasy but there it becomes a problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:25.179" style="s2">if the fantasy overwhelms reality and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.750" end="00:32:27.640" style="s2">becomes and reality becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.179" end="00:32:29.260" style="s2">second-class citizen to fantasy and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.640" end="00:32:32.230" style="s2">think for me and I think even Chester</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.260" end="00:32:35.289" style="s2">said this in our in our talk like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.230" end="00:32:38.530" style="s2">problem with whenever pornography or the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.289" end="00:32:39.970" style="s2">problem with prostitute stuff is more of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.530" end="00:32:42.760" style="s2">that you&#39;re kind of in a fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.970" end="00:32:44.380" style="s2">relationship and to the extent that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.760" end="00:32:46.390" style="s2">could be a real relationship except that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.380" end="00:32:48.340" style="s2">you could be real with a prostitute or</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.390" end="00:32:51.370" style="s2">you know or real with this person that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.340" end="00:32:53.260" style="s2">you know then then it&#39;s not then that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.370" end="00:32:54.419" style="s2">problem isn&#39;t there then it&#39;s alive and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.260" end="00:32:56.730" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.419" end="00:33:00.179" style="s2">connection but to the extent that is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.730" end="00:33:02.460" style="s2">that that is just a a mask and a and a</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.179" end="00:33:04.039" style="s2">transaction and then you just do the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.460" end="00:33:07.259" style="s2">rope thing that you know you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.039" end="00:33:09.029" style="s2">programmed to think to get off on you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.259" end="00:33:11.100" style="s2">know to the extent that&#39;s then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.029" end="00:33:13.710" style="s2">empty and and afterwards I feel empty</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.100" end="00:33:14.970" style="s2">and I think I was saying to Chester I</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.710" end="00:33:17.789" style="s2">always feel bad afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.970" end="00:33:21.119" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s because that elements</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.789" end="00:33:22.289" style="s2">of fantasy and it would accept that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.119" end="00:33:24.629" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel bad after this is when that</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.289" end="00:33:25.739" style="s2">element is not there as much when the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.629" end="00:33:28.409" style="s2">feeling there was actually a connection</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.739" end="00:33:30.090" style="s2">and you know with a prostitute you never</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.409" end="00:33:31.409" style="s2">know if that was a real connection or</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.090" end="00:33:34.830" style="s2">not you know like she could just be</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.409" end="00:33:35.759" style="s2">really good at her job but but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.830" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">you feel that you feel like I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.759" end="00:33:38.639" style="s2">there was a real connection and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">touched your heart is open and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.639" end="00:33:42.539" style="s2">like wow even though there was money</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:45.149" style="s2">exchanged there there was still</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.539" end="00:33:47.730" style="s2">something enlivening about that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.149" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">there was love or there was respect or</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.730" end="00:33:53.789" style="s2">there was sacred sacred exchange it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:57.179" style="s2">like you know sacred sex or you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.789" end="00:34:00.269" style="s2">you know ancient Greek you know sacred</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.179" end="00:34:01.950" style="s2">prostitute energy but often you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.269" end="00:34:04.350" style="s2">woman isn&#39;t into it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.950" end="00:34:06.419" style="s2">she&#39;s not trying to be connecting she&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.429" end="00:34:24.869" style="s2">I agree it&#39;s I think a lot to do is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.490" end="00:34:26.849" style="s2">you said before about how there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.869" end="00:34:29.250" style="s2">very delicate balance between being</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.849" end="00:34:32.129" style="s2">connected to the other person but also</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.250" end="00:34:34.169" style="s2">connected to yourself and sort of having</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.129" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">your focus be in both of those places so</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.169" end="00:34:39.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re sort of experiencing a unity</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:41.849" style="s2">between the two of you that doesn&#39;t like</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.799" end="00:34:54.649" style="s2">question that can like tag on to this</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.649" end="00:34:59.069" style="s2">feel actually okay leading up to taking</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.750" end="00:35:01.130" style="s2">this question just because we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.069" end="00:35:06.329" style="s2">about honesty that kind of nervous</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.130" end="00:35:08.230" style="s2">asking this question but it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.329" end="00:35:10.490" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.230" end="00:35:13.030" style="s2">with the practice of like radical</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.490" end="00:35:18.650" style="s2">honesty it seems like you have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.030" end="00:35:21.230" style="s2">moment where you are honest and then the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.650" end="00:35:23.270" style="s2">next time it seems like you almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.230" end="00:35:26.380" style="s2">express the same thing thinking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.270" end="00:35:30.560" style="s2">honesty again but it&#39;s already become</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.380" end="00:35:32.030" style="s2">not true and I was wondering like that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.870" end="00:35:47.060" style="s2">of radical honesty as well is that for</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:50.300" style="s2">me yeah yeah thanks for that question</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.060" end="00:35:52.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a good one I think you&#39;re right I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.300" end="00:35:53.810" style="s2">think you know you&#39;re honest and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.280" end="00:35:57.170" style="s2">somehow the honesty gets ratified right</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.810" end="00:35:58.910" style="s2">away you know and so it&#39;s like and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.170" end="00:36:00.500" style="s2">have to kind of it&#39;s easy to think oh I</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.910" end="00:36:02.390" style="s2">was honest and that&#39;s and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.500" end="00:36:04.460" style="s2">truth and then it&#39;s like already not</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.390" end="00:36:08.060" style="s2">true again or you know like in the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.460" end="00:36:10.370" style="s2">second and I think I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:14.690" style="s2">hard you just have to like keep calling</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.370" end="00:36:16.490" style="s2">yourself out and tuning into like what</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.690" end="00:36:18.530" style="s2">am i enough what am I feeling now you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.490" end="00:36:20.660" style="s2">know now what am I feeling and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.530" end="00:36:22.370" style="s2">and because I I said something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.660" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">actually feeling differently like</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.370" end="00:36:27.230" style="s2">everything you say changes you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">know the emotional temperature that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.230" end="00:36:33.650" style="s2">have you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re always in</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:35.540" style="s2">movement and so I could say I feel this</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.650" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">and then like as soon as I said it like</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.540" end="00:36:38.990" style="s2">it feels something different and so how</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:43.580" style="s2">do you keep that going it could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.990" end="00:36:45.710" style="s2">exhausting I guess but yeah I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.580" end="00:36:47.120" style="s2">I think you need to do that I&#39;m somebody</p>

<p begin="00:36:53.090" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">is it important to tithe and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.700" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">channeled entity said it&#39;s not important</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:04.030" style="s2">to tithe what&#39;s important is to give in</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:06.680" style="s2">the direction of your gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.030" end="00:37:09.260" style="s2">and when you feel gratitude for someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.680" end="00:37:12.980" style="s2">towards someone you should give right</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.260" end="00:37:14.630" style="s2">then as you&#39;re feeling it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.980" end="00:37:16.370" style="s2">what you should be doing not like having</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.630" end="00:37:18.230" style="s2">ideas about you know I should give 10%</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.370" end="00:37:20.700" style="s2">of my income to this charity you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.230" end="00:37:25.290" style="s2">like just give as you feel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.700" end="00:37:27.810" style="s2">and I I try to do that and I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.290" end="00:37:29.849" style="s2">sometimes like I&#39;ve I want to give and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.810" end="00:37:31.890" style="s2">just don&#39;t get around to it and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.849" end="00:37:33.900" style="s2">later I don&#39;t want it to anymore like</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.890" end="00:37:36.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve just passed the moment past my</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.900" end="00:37:37.890" style="s2">moment of gratitude past and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.510" end="00:37:39.420" style="s2">sometimes I still give anyway because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.890" end="00:37:41.849" style="s2">wanted to give earlier and I know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.420" end="00:37:43.710" style="s2">should give or wanted to give but now it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.849" end="00:37:46.589" style="s2">feels wrong and I feel resentful that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.710" end="00:37:49.109" style="s2">I&#39;m giving because I don&#39;t feel it so um</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.320" end="00:38:55.010" style="s2">story principle to get maybe what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.000" end="00:38:56.060" style="s2">afraid of to realize it has the power of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.010" end="00:38:59.180" style="s2">you and I wonder if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.060" end="00:39:00.650" style="s2">reflection on that Wow that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.180" end="00:39:03.530" style="s2">question I even think of that but yeah</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.190" end="00:39:11.900" style="s2">for 20 years I was like not acting out</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.470" end="00:39:14.840" style="s2">sexually with prostitutes and then like</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.900" end="00:39:16.370" style="s2">after talking to Chester I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.840" end="00:39:19.640" style="s2">like oh he&#39;s kind of got a really good</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.370" end="00:39:21.080" style="s2">point maybe this is okay to do and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.640" end="00:39:22.790" style="s2">I remembered as soon as I did it like oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.080" end="00:39:24.920" style="s2">I remember why I was trying not to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.790" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">this I just had forgotten you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.920" end="00:39:27.800" style="s2">easy to forget because the ego is just</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:31.670" style="s2">like this is gonna make you feel so much</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.800" end="00:39:33.650" style="s2">better and then it doesn&#39;t but yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.670" end="00:39:35.690" style="s2">and I you know also when you&#39;re older</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.650" end="00:39:38.840" style="s2">there&#39;s just something more honest I</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.690" end="00:39:41.300" style="s2">mean all of us are gonna get there some</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.840" end="00:39:42.410" style="s2">of us getting there before others but</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.300" end="00:39:45.140" style="s2">there&#39;s something really hard about</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.410" end="00:39:48.920" style="s2">sexuality and aging you know just like</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.140" end="00:39:51.560" style="s2">you just feel like you&#39;re your trap you</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.920" end="00:39:54.820" style="s2">know you decide oh you&#39;re attractiveness</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.560" end="00:39:57.350" style="s2">to others diminishes with time and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.820" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">the things that you could do before to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.350" end="00:40:05.480" style="s2">be like I&#39;m gonna affirm bisexual this</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:07.100" style="s2">they just get harder and so yeah 20</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.480" end="00:40:10.280" style="s2">years later it&#39;s like you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.100" end="00:40:14.540" style="s2">be that guy and I don&#39;t know I think I</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.280" end="00:40:17.540" style="s2">think I&#39;m not that guy only because I</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.540" end="00:40:19.070" style="s2">have like a spiritual practice I have</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.540" end="00:40:21.590" style="s2">some kind of inner healing that has</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.070" end="00:40:25.610" style="s2">happened in those 20 years that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.590" end="00:40:28.700" style="s2">feel different like the self-hatred the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.610" end="00:40:31.130" style="s2">shame the pathos has lifted to a large</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.700" end="00:40:34.220" style="s2">extent so I have a certain equanimity</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.130" end="00:40:35.120" style="s2">that I concern of whether the 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.220" end="00:40:37.750" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.120" end="00:40:41.690" style="s2">before and after picture better you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.750" end="00:40:43.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s nice and that&#39;s the result of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.690" end="00:40:48.950" style="s2">a lot of I think hard work you know like</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.690" end="00:40:57.860" style="s2">psychedelics have played a role in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:41:00.800" style="s2">spiritual opening and discovery I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.860" end="00:41:02.690" style="s2">for me they&#39;ve been key or essential I</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.800" end="00:41:05.000" style="s2">mean I think I wouldn&#39;t be Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.690" end="00:41:07.430" style="s2">without psychedelics I mean I think I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.000" end="00:41:12.620" style="s2">know who I would be but wouldn&#39;t be this</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.430" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">guy I would be a much angrier person I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.620" end="00:41:21.140" style="s2">be a much more rigid person yeah for me</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.730" end="00:43:46.990" style="s2">great and that really gave me so much</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:50.520" style="s2">confidence and joy and and connection to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.990" end="00:43:53.560" style="s2">who I am and and to and to God into my</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.520" end="00:43:54.940" style="s2">connection to God into my uniqueness and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.560" end="00:43:57.960" style="s2">in my sameness and just the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.940" end="00:44:00.630" style="s2">universal specificity that is each of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.960" end="00:44:03.579" style="s2">so that was great and then also just</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.630" end="00:44:06.099" style="s2">encountering God and being like whoa God</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.579" end="00:44:07.569" style="s2">exists like God this God just you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.099" end="00:44:10.839" style="s2">I&#39;ve had experiences where it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.569" end="00:44:14.740" style="s2">like oh my fucking god it&#39;s true and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.839" end="00:44:19.390" style="s2">magnificence of God and the power of God</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.740" end="00:44:20.920" style="s2">and the tornado like you know explosion</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.390" end="00:44:23.319" style="s2">that is God all of that you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.920" end="00:44:26.380" style="s2">psychedelics and the next last thing is</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.319" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">just love like it&#39;s so clear that God is</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.380" end="00:44:31.859" style="s2">just overwhelming love and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.680" end="00:44:34.060" style="s2">think my life has sort of gone from</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.859" end="00:44:36.460" style="s2">pursuing this ego dream of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.060" end="00:44:37.599" style="s2">specialness and like you know I think as</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.460" end="00:44:39.579" style="s2">soon as I wanted to make films which was</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:41.020" style="s2">I was like 18 now it&#39;s just like I want</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.579" end="00:44:43.450" style="s2">to be the greatest filmmaker ever and</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.020" end="00:44:46.990" style="s2">it&#39;s only thought that because I was 18</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.450" end="00:44:48.359" style="s2">and stupid but also because for me if I</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.990" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the greatest filmmaker ever I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.359" end="00:44:53.079" style="s2">wasn&#39;t anything I was worthless like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:54.490" style="s2">had very low self-esteem and I&#39;d to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.079" end="00:44:58.300" style="s2">compensate for my low self-esteem by</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.490" end="00:45:00.069" style="s2">some kind of grandiosity and so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.300" end="00:45:02.140" style="s2">spent most of my life trying to attain</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.069" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">this grandiosity to not feel bad about</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.140" end="00:45:06.310" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:07.990" style="s2">but along the way through psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.310" end="00:45:10.510" style="s2">really I discovered that you know love</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.990" end="00:45:12.520" style="s2">is the thing not specialness like</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.510" end="00:45:13.870" style="s2">specialness is nothing I mean no one is</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.520" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">special where else we&#39;re all equally</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.870" end="00:45:19.060" style="s2">special and there is no greatest</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:23.170" style="s2">filmmaker you know it&#39;s absurd concept</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.060" end="00:45:25.000" style="s2">obviously but um love is the important</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.170" end="00:45:28.600" style="s2">thing I mean like it&#39;s the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.000" end="00:45:31.960" style="s2">and and all the the vainglory dreams you</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.600" end="00:45:33.700" style="s2">know of glory of vainglory I&#39;ve have</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.960" end="00:45:35.350" style="s2">receded you know I still have them you</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.700" end="00:45:36.520" style="s2">know like I still would love to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.350" end="00:45:38.770" style="s2">people think I&#39;m a great filmmaker</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.520" end="00:45:40.810" style="s2">somebody wrote the other day and Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.770" end="00:45:42.520" style="s2">thing says something like Kavya Haiti is</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.810" end="00:45:45.850" style="s2">the greatest filmmaker for the next</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.850" end="00:45:50.320" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s not important anymore</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.070" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just like oh that&#39;s fun someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.320" end="00:45:56.500" style="s2">thinks that but it&#39;s not like I need</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">that to feel okay and so now I can just</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.500" end="00:46:00.100" style="s2">pursue what&#39;s important and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:03.580" style="s2">just just love in every moment and just</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.100" end="00:46:05.410" style="s2">the enjoyment of the moment and I think</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:15.060" style="s2">there is de presentment yeah I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.050" end="00:47:20.580" style="s2">that at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.060" end="00:47:22.850" style="s2">yeah yeah story of my life too I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.580" end="00:47:25.160" style="s2">think resentment is the opposite of love</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.850" end="00:47:27.150" style="s2">and I think resentment kills</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.160" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.150" end="00:47:32.130" style="s2">relationship killer right and so I used</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:33.360" style="s2">to think the only way to make a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.130" end="00:47:36.150" style="s2">relationship work is if you could</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.360" end="00:47:37.770" style="s2">constantly clear the resentment you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.150" end="00:47:39.270" style="s2">everything that comes up he was clear it</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.770" end="00:47:41.100" style="s2">and you clear right away you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.270" end="00:47:43.260" style="s2">like don&#39;t go to bed until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.100" end="00:47:45.300" style="s2">cleared the resentment and when I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.260" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">married for 20 years you know my wife</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.300" end="00:47:49.290" style="s2">did not share that view</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:50.730" style="s2">she had this other view that was like</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.290" end="00:47:52.350" style="s2">you know you can just live with it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.730" end="00:47:54.690" style="s2">gonna be okay we&#39;ll deal with it later</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.350" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">and I was like no no we&#39;re gonna break</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.690" end="00:47:59.070" style="s2">up we&#39;re gonna break up if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">clear it now you know and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.070" end="00:48:02.130" style="s2">took a while but we broke up and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:03.360" style="s2">broke up because of resentments because</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.130" end="00:48:06.510" style="s2">the resentments just piled up to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.360" end="00:48:08.430" style="s2">point where nobody could could you you</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.510" end="00:48:10.320" style="s2">the hatred was so thick you know and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.430" end="00:48:12.780" style="s2">there was nothing left there was no love</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.320" end="00:48:15.660" style="s2">left and all that resentment so I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.780" end="00:48:18.450" style="s2">resentment is like you know public enemy</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.660" end="00:48:20.130" style="s2">number one and I think whatever you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.450" end="00:48:21.960" style="s2">do to get rid of it I don&#39;t know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.130" end="00:48:24.630" style="s2">I think you have to be honest about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.960" end="00:48:27.420" style="s2">resentments first of all and if the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.630" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">person can&#39;t handle that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.420" end="00:48:30.840" style="s2">the end of the friendship early Ivy a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:31.860" style="s2">friendship I think I think the division</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.840" end="00:48:34.680" style="s2">of a friendship is somebody with whom</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.860" end="00:48:37.410" style="s2">you can say what you need to say and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.680" end="00:48:38.910" style="s2">they can hear it and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.410" end="00:48:40.650" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case and I think those</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.910" end="00:48:43.940" style="s2">are not friends you know those are</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.650" end="00:48:46.680" style="s2">acquaintances I guess or you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.940" end="00:48:49.020" style="s2">strategic allies in your quest for</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.680" end="00:48:50.610" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re going for but a friend</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.020" end="00:48:51.990" style="s2">is somebody you can say hey I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.610" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">mad at you you really hurt my feelings</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.990" end="00:48:55.620" style="s2">and I&#39;m really having a hard time with</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:57.600" style="s2">this thing that just happened and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.620" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">feeling alienated or something and if</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.600" end="00:49:02.760" style="s2">the person can say oh you are I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.000" end="00:49:04.110" style="s2">why what can I do gonna you know or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.760" end="00:49:05.220" style="s2">kind of mad at you too about something</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.110" end="00:49:06.690" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s why I did that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.220" end="00:49:08.460" style="s2">here&#39;s what I&#39;m mad about and you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.690" end="00:49:09.990" style="s2">you can work it out and get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.460" end="00:49:11.820" style="s2">where you understand that person and why</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.990" end="00:49:13.260" style="s2">they did it and you can drop the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.820" end="00:49:16.920" style="s2">resentment if you can&#39;t do that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.260" end="00:49:19.290" style="s2">can&#39;t be friends I think so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.920" end="00:49:23.910" style="s2">people can&#39;t be friends with it&#39;s sad</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.290" end="00:49:25.140" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s the truth and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.910" end="00:49:26.670" style="s2">the hard thing is how do you express a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.140" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">resentment in a way that isn&#39;t resentful</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.670" end="00:49:30.410" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:31.940" style="s2">and people have written books on this</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.410" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">and they do it better than I do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.940" end="00:49:36.500" style="s2">but you know what they all say you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:38.510" style="s2">you have to talk about how how you feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.500" end="00:49:40.130" style="s2">and not put it on them at all like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.510" end="00:49:42.650" style="s2">like I&#39;m having a problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.130" end="00:49:44.390" style="s2">you know I need help can you help me I</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.650" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">need your help I&#39;m having this</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.390" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">resentment or anger that I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:50.270" style="s2">have and I&#39;m not you didn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:52.670" style="s2">your fault it&#39;s not you know I just I</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.270" end="00:49:55.730" style="s2">need help and so they say that you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.670" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">do that and really own it then they can</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.730" end="00:49:58.789" style="s2">to that extent they can hear it better</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:00.289" style="s2">not that they can some people can&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.789" end="00:50:02.390" style="s2">anything any kind of criticism or any</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.289" end="00:50:04.700" style="s2">kind of anything they just can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:06.230" style="s2">their self-esteem is so low that if</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.700" end="00:50:07.549" style="s2">that&#39;s there they just they just</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.230" end="00:50:09.529" style="s2">collapse oh they hate themselves too</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.549" end="00:50:10.670" style="s2">much you know and again I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.529" end="00:50:14.150" style="s2">you can be friends with those people</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.670" end="00:50:16.730" style="s2">um but yeah that&#39;s such a hard one</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.150" end="00:50:21.260" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry here I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.730" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">it that&#39;s okay thanks everyone I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.260" end="00:50:25.099" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean I&#39;m I have a whole list</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:27.140" style="s2">of people that resentment stores and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.099" end="00:50:28.609" style="s2">just trying to like reduce the list and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.140" end="00:50:31.609" style="s2">I feel like when I can get the list to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.609" end="00:50:35.859" style="s2">zero I&#39;m good like I can I can die now</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.609" end="00:50:45.109" style="s2">I&#39;ve accomplished my task in life yeah</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.140" end="00:50:56.630" style="s2">much of a question cafe it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.779" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">I guess a random thought have you in</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.630" end="00:51:02.270" style="s2">your own life ever felt value or learned</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:04.819" style="s2">from conservative cultures or practices</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.270" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">for example like arranged marriages I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.819" end="00:51:09.740" style="s2">not showing gestures of love in public</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:13.250" style="s2">etc etc and do you think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.740" end="00:51:14.829" style="s2">anything to be learned I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.250" end="00:51:18.380" style="s2">probably set to be learned from anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.829" end="00:51:21.380" style="s2">you know my knee-jerk reaction is always</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.380" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">you know arranged marriage is bad you</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.380" end="00:51:26.210" style="s2">know not sure he love gestures public</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.359" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">bad you know like I have a knee jerk you</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.210" end="00:51:31.549" style="s2">know thing towards you know whatever a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:33.980" style="s2">kind of on an uninhibited expression of</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.549" end="00:51:35.089" style="s2">whatever but I do</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.980" end="00:51:36.049" style="s2">I mean what&#39;s interesting about arranged</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.089" end="00:51:38.029" style="s2">marriages is you know the statistics</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.049" end="00:51:40.069" style="s2">that they&#39;re just as successful as under</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.029" end="00:51:41.720" style="s2">managed marriages and you know what does</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.069" end="00:51:42.380" style="s2">that mean I mean it seems like it means</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.720" end="00:51:44.630" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.380" end="00:51:46.100" style="s2">basically you really could be with just</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.630" end="00:51:49.010" style="s2">about anybody I mean everyone is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.100" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">lovable and everyone is equally</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.010" end="00:51:55.970" style="s2">fucked-up and equally great at sub level</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:57.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s really just a choice of who you</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.970" end="00:52:00.140" style="s2">decide you&#39;re gonna like work with you</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.980" end="00:52:00.950" style="s2">know in your in your practice and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.140" end="00:52:02.330" style="s2">really believe that everything happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.950" end="00:52:03.830" style="s2">for a reason I think the people in our</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.330" end="00:52:05.960" style="s2">lives come to us because they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.830" end="00:52:07.640" style="s2">appropriate people so an arranged</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.960" end="00:52:08.660" style="s2">marriage isn&#39;t arranged I mean you say</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.640" end="00:52:10.910" style="s2">it&#39;s arranged by the parents but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.660" end="00:52:15.080" style="s2">really arranged by God you know like God</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.910" end="00:52:17.120" style="s2">got that going not the parents so in</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.080" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">that sense it&#39;s like sure if God says</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.120" end="00:52:21.440" style="s2">you marry this person it&#39;s just like you</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:23.030" style="s2">know you meeting someone on tinder you</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.440" end="00:52:25.400" style="s2">know and then responding to your like</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.030" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s also God you</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.400" end="00:52:29.780" style="s2">know so I think the universe is like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:32.120" style="s2">big matchmaker and whenever we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.780" end="00:52:34.340" style="s2">hit a new level that we were ready for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.120" end="00:52:35.810" style="s2">new something to learn then they send</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.340" end="00:52:37.790" style="s2">that person to us and loves it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.810" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">negative love it&#39;s like you need to look</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.790" end="00:52:41.260" style="s2">at this hard lesson and we&#39;re gonna send</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:45.950" style="s2">somebody&#39;s gonna like fuck with you now</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.260" end="00:52:47.840" style="s2">but yeah there&#39;s something I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.950" end="00:52:51.080" style="s2">there&#39;s something good about that model</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.840" end="00:52:53.330" style="s2">just because it shows the limits of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.080" end="00:52:56.540" style="s2">you know freedom model that you know</p>

<p begin="00:54:03.569" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">because on some level boundaries are not</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.660" end="00:54:14.569" style="s2">acknowledging that we are radically</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:21.859" style="s2">responsible for our own emotions and</p>

<p begin="00:54:50.819" end="00:54:55.319" style="s2">reason then I&#39;m able to just kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.380" end="00:54:57.630" style="s2">like oh okay what how how did I create</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.319" end="00:55:00.809" style="s2">that or how is that something that is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.630" end="00:55:02.700" style="s2">you know and this is such a such a</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.809" end="00:55:04.710" style="s2">radical idea I mean it&#39;s such a radical</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.700" end="00:55:07.829" style="s2">idea that it&#39;s almost inconceivable and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.710" end="00:55:10.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really hard to to accept it</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.829" end="00:55:13.140" style="s2">really I think it&#39;s been really hard for</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.530" end="00:55:14.970" style="s2">me certainly but I you know I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.140" end="00:55:17.940" style="s2">believe it and I sort of try to live by</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.970" end="00:55:22.170" style="s2">it but you know I fail and I flail you</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.940" end="00:55:25.559" style="s2">know constantly but um but yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.170" end="00:55:27.480" style="s2">like I think I&#39;ve really been lonely for</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.559" end="00:55:30.859" style="s2">the past you know three years since my</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.480" end="00:55:37.710" style="s2">breakup and I&#39;ve had a hard time finding</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.859" end="00:55:38.849" style="s2">a lover a companion uh whatever and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.710" end="00:55:40.170" style="s2">you know you ask yourself like is</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.849" end="00:55:42.930" style="s2">something wrong with me</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.170" end="00:55:45.390" style="s2">is it me am I is something in me that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.930" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">not creating whatever abundance or</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.390" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">whatever love reciprocity energy that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:52.140" style="s2">would manifest as a lover that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:53.579" style="s2">that loves you and that once what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.140" end="00:55:58.290" style="s2">want and then wants to have sex with you</p>

<p begin="00:55:59.940" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">like manifest you know I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.530" end="00:56:07.470" style="s2">desire is sacred and I think it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:09.030" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.470" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not only locators I think you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.030" end="00:56:13.290" style="s2">to desire what you want and and in</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:15.090" style="s2">desiring it without without guilt and</p>

<p begin="00:56:15.090" end="00:56:20.580" style="s2">of undercurrent you do manifest it in</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.640" end="00:56:22.260" style="s2">your life and I think for me like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.580" end="00:56:26.190" style="s2">been having these kind of like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.260" end="00:56:28.470" style="s2">sexual encounters over the past year</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.190" end="00:56:32.760" style="s2">let&#39;s say that has become increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.470" end="00:56:34.530" style="s2">close to hitting the mark</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.760" end="00:56:35.609" style="s2">and none of they&#39;ve hit the mark but</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.530" end="00:56:38.280" style="s2">each one gets a little closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.609" end="00:56:40.109" style="s2">mark and I feel like those uh those n</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.280" end="00:56:42.030" style="s2">archers who like blindfold themselves</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.109" end="00:56:43.500" style="s2">and they spin around and then they try</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.030" end="00:56:45.990" style="s2">to hit the bull&#39;s eye without seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.500" end="00:56:48.300" style="s2">like I feel like I&#39;m getting better at</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.990" end="00:56:50.310" style="s2">it and like every time I have a new</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.300" end="00:56:52.800" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s a little closer to</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.310" end="00:56:55.080" style="s2">like a satisfying one than the one</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.800" end="00:56:57.780" style="s2">before and I&#39;m still not there yet</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.080" end="00:56:59.369" style="s2">because I&#39;ve manifested somebody and in</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.780" end="00:57:01.590" style="s2">Berlin that I can&#39;t actually be with</p>
