<p begin="00:00:08.720" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">so please welcome daniel</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.920" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">schmachtenberger</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.080" end="00:00:20.480" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">so daniel if we just</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.480" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">fast forward to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:38.399" style="s2">2020 2030 2040 2050</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:38.399" style="s2">just really go into the future</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">what would an ideal hospital look like</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.760" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">well i think in this open space a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">ideas were being brought up about that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">yesterday as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">i think everybody has a clear sense that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:04.400" style="s2">environmental design and environmental</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:04.879" style="s2">psychology of the space is a huge part</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.400" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.879" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">the airflow the lighting both natural</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.479" end="00:01:13.119" style="s2">lighting and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">the right spectrum and the right amount</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.119" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">of lumens and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">really paying attention to the way the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">environment is affecting the health and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">the experience of the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">in the space so the actual design of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">infrastructure of the building itself i</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:33.040" style="s2">the nature of the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">time and also the amount of time that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.040" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">the providers get to spend with people</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">and also their training for the quality</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">of time and how they spend it</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a lot of things we know</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">about the tech that we want to see in</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">both much higher quality and less</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">invasive diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of diagnostic tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">by some of those dates will be online</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">that is now that will make a huge</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">the kind of dream of theranos that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:00.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t write didn&#39;t really have the tech</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">for there</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">there is tech that will achieve things</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">like that there&#39;s a company called gene</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:06.399" style="s2">radar</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">uh coming out of a company called</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.399" end="00:02:09.920" style="s2">nanobiosim that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">i think will probably make huge progress</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">in that time and other tech like it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">instead of needing reagents to be able</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:20.239" style="s2">to do blood labs we can simply do</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">chip based amplification and so a single</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">drop of blood can be able to measure</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">every biometric and if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">not having the cost associated then just</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">run every biometric every time on</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:33.760" style="s2">run big data analysis on an individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">person longitudinally over their life</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.760" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">plus on lots of people and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">just in the hospital that can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">decentralized so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">we start finding early disease</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">indicators and being able to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">most things so i think there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">of examples of better diagnostics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">that can augment the human doctor and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">healthcare provider capacity so that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">healthcare provider can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">much more focused on actually connecting</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:01.840" style="s2">to people and taking in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">diagnostic info that humans are uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.840" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">good at that machines don&#39;t do as good a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">job at</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">which is less biometric specified and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">more being able to get the gestalt of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">the person that lets you even know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">to look for and how to interpret it</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of things like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">that we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">one of them was mentioned yesterday that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">just feel like bringing up is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:31.760" style="s2">the idea that the hospital would feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">more like a sacred place like a temple</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">of some sort seems to be at the heart if</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">if we put that at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">consideration a lot of other things make</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">more sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">yeah and when you talk about heart-based</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">obviously we want a medicine that is uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">really excellent in terms of operations</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">we want a medicine that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.680" end="00:03:56.799" style="s2">excellent in terms of the actual science</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">and the technology of it but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.799" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">motivating all of it is the sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">of human life and human experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">and wanting to be able to support people</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">who have the highest quality experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">in the highest quality capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">offer what others to offer while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:12.840" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">and so that everyone in the healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.840" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">space remembers</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">and continuously that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">why they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">and the entire design is around</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">supporting that experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">you know you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">experiences where people died in your</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">and where they died in ways that were</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">versus painful based on the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">the care</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">so if you think about a hospital as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">place where people will be born</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">and people will die and people will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">brought back from death</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">and people will have the chance to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:48.080" style="s2">a totally different life trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">based on the care they get</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">like the sacredness of life is more on</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">the altar there than maybe anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">and um i i would like to see something</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">the doctors and nurses go through a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">ritual before they actually enter</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">every time not it becomes a dogma</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">because the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">the moment that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">intrinsically recognized dharma that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">becomes a protocol and becomes a dogma</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:13.759" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">obviously just becomes performative life</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.759" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">listen and you either do the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">performative thing or just reject it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">but if someone actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">reconnected to the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">experiences they had in medicine the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">most heart-wrenching</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">experiences why they were there what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">hippocratic oath was</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">and why they&#39;re there the way that would</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">affect</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">the quality of the interactions and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">from the point of view that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">patient&#39;s experience would be better but</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">also the actual quality of the care</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">would make a tremendous difference so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">we could talk about a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">based on specifically what we have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">state might be available in those</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">different timelines</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">what things we could do retrofitting</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">existing hospitals versus where we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">to build them from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">what things where we&#39;re still thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">of a hospital versus where we start to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">think about decentralizing health care</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">into all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">life so that&#39;s a start</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">wonderful thank you so many open</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:10.319" style="s2">questions let&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">you were putting the temple in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.319" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">so maybe let&#39;s start at the center</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">and i believe it&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">describing is um</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">that the subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">of a true dedication of a true interest</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">of the healthcare provider so rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">than busy being busy with themselves but</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">actually truly caring about the person</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">under in their care</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">that subjective experience will improve</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">the quality of care</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">not only in terms of making less</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">mistakes like this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">i realize it&#39;s the first time when i you</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:52.560" style="s2">i learned to make all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">prescriptions and so here you go and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">here&#39;s another one and here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">one here&#39;s another one and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">describing</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">and then i realized suddenly my kids</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">were in hospital</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">and i sat there and said like okay all</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">right now my kid&#39;s at hospital next one</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">and then i went um do i really want that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">such an important moment to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">when i</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">see children and i make prescription</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">based on what their disease</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">is or i make a prescription for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:24.160" style="s2">that i have a personal direct relation</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">with it&#39;s somehow there&#39;s a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.160" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">there so the quality i completely agree</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">that the quality of care</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">when we talk about patient safety a big</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">topic today</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">we talk about patient safety we improve</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">that healthcare providers show up this</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">improve the quality of care will improve</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">the safety of the patient</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">but it will also improve patient</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">so what could you see as</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:08:00.319" style="s2">steps taken well now let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">the end in mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.319" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">what would you see in you know 20 30 40</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.280" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">50 what might be the way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">what might describe or constitute the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">relation between a healthcare provider</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">and a patient</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">so you mentioned less mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">i think getting rid of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.160" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">all of the avoidable ietrogenic illness</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">it would take a few things increased</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">presence on the part of the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">and pharmacists and nurses is going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">make a huge difference to them</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not only that though it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">medical training up front it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">removing the financialization</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">of medicine that ends up influencing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">training and the incentive structures of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">the doctors as long as the hospital has</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">to have the doctors seeing more people</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">per day or in private practice you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">to see more people per day the mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">are just going to go up so</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">some of it can be addressed at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">bottom up level of things individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">doctors can do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">some of it really has to be addressed at</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">the top down level of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">of the major top-down institutions that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">are affecting medicine and optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">for something other than quality of care</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">and if we have trillions of dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">year optimizing for things other than</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">quality of care</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">compared to the relatively small level</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">of a few doctors</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually an asymmetric warfare</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">health right as long as at a federal</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">level we want to optimize gdp</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">and we met we think about gdp as a sign</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">of the success of the country</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">sick people are better for gdp than</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">healthy people are in a narrow</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">point of view in terms of medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">obviously this is the same for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">pharmaceutical company&#39;s incentive or</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">things like that if if we could just</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">prevent medicine</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">by making healthy people we would</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">have the best system of health care and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">it would totally tank gdp from both a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">pharmaceutical and hospital revenue</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">point of view as well as from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">revenue of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">food drug et cetera companies that make</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">more money off addiction</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s systemic factors as well as</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">kind of individual practitioner factors</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">that have to be addressed to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">remove hydrogenic disease</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">and then as you&#39;re mentioning the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">the increased presence of a practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.600" style="s2">a person who is in one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">disturbing positions people can be in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.600" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:25.920" style="s2">the quality of their life or their loved</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">one&#39;s life is like</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">up in the air and they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">technical expertise to know how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">going to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">and so they&#39;re trusting a stranger with</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">the most precious thing to them</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">actually feeling the care and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">presence and the attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">of that stranger is going to make a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">difference where</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">even if the thing is incurable</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">the actual experience of someone is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">terminal value in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">independent of how that translates to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">objective outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">and it will translate to objective</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:10:59.040" style="s2">outcomes both in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">increased diagnostic insight on the part</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">of the practitioner and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">a psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">better state and less stress on the part</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">patient is going to help their healing</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">so i mean this is just kind of recapping</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">heart-based medicine matters right</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">and then um</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t think any of that answered your</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">question your question was</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">how do we what would constitute the</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">and the patient</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.680" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">and so you mentioned quality of care and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">we started at</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">kind of avoiding mistakes but we may</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">just as we</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">look at disease on a systemic level we</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">look at mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">in terms of heart-based medicine we want</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">to look at kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">shift the attention a little bit away</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">from disease</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:51.839" style="s2">towards health so on on that systemic</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">level we may want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.839" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">ask what is quality of care yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">when we when we shift it towards the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">positive outcome towards the potential</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">and how might that be a constituent of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">so let me do a long-range version of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">this i&#39;m not going to try and specify</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:11.519" style="s2">the timeline we&#39;ll just do</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">a it will generally be hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.519" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">trending in this direction if it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">the right path</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">so let&#39;s say we look at the trend of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">technological automation to automate</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">things that we can proceduralize</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">that&#39;ll affect some things in medicine</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">and hopefully it will because that would</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">be great there are some things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">machines can do as well or better</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">and it won&#39;t affect other things and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">it does it&#39;d be a bummer because they do</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">it less well</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">but outside of medicine most of the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">that people like the least are</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">some of the ones that are most available</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">to technological automation</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">because it the more procedural something</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">is the easier it is to automate</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">the more procedural it is also the less</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">creativity and learning is involved</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">which means we have the less</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">less intrinsic motive for a human to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">feel like they can self-actualize there</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:02.399" style="s2">and so as we progress</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">to more technological automation and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.399" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">more categories we also start to change</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">a lot of the underlying assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">within market theory that we need people</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">to do the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">so we need to make it to where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">people need the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">well we don&#39;t need people to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">the jobs then we can also</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">start to create more of commonwealth</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">resources that</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">take care of people&#39;s needs to have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">system that is more focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">intrinsic incentive of people than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">extrinsic incentive</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">when you want to get people to when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">have to get people to do shitty labor</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">stuff you have to extrinsically incent</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">them when more of that&#39;s automated</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">then we get to facilitate what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:38.800" style="s2">actually intrinsically interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">meaningful for people and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.800" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">playing video games all the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">if they get to be facilitated to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">recognize that their short time here can</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">actually mean something</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">and i think the things that people will</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">most want to do have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">connection creativity and healing and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:53.920" style="s2">i think there will be a lot more people</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">in the healing</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.920" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">professions and i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:01.920" style="s2">as we think less and less in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:03.920" style="s2">how do i think of this as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.920" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">financially support myself and more in</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.920" end="00:14:07.440" style="s2">terms of if finances were already</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">supported what would i want to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.440" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">a lot of people want to do things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">involve connecting with other people in</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">ways that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:16.240" style="s2">contribute to the quality of their life</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">and that&#39;s everything from like</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.240" end="00:14:20.079" style="s2">music therapy and art therapy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">psychospiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">to uh training people&#39;s physical bodies</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">like that so i think the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">doctor will become largely decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">to a lot of other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">promoting well-being more than just</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">dealing with the after effects of not</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">promoting well-being</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">and similarly to where when we say</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">removing iatrogenic disease requires not</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">change on the doctor part but also the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">structural</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">incentives that lead to genetic disease</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">if we want to obsolete as much of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">medicine as possible we have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">what the upstream causes of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">are so</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">obviously if we if we don&#39;t just look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">health care but we look at the embedding</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">environment of things that affect</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:03.199" style="s2">people&#39;s health and we&#39;re pumping</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">billions of tons of glyphosate and other</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.199" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">pesticides and herbicides and petrol</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">chemical toxins into the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">and into people&#39;s food supply and water</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">supply continuously and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">embedding them in the manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">process in the carpet in the paint and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">where all of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">environments are actually toxic to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">way we genetically evolved we</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">genetically evolved to an environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">that didn&#39;t have organophosphates</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">and you know neonicotinoids</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">being able to change those things also</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">obsoletes so much</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">of the things that are upstream</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">contributing</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">to so much of the chronic complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">illness</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">then you start to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">changes in agriculture to actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:44.160" style="s2">re-mineralize topsoils and affect the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">microbiome of the topsoils and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.160" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">quality of the you know food that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">coming out and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">again we have to ask can we have healthy</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">in a society where almost everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">stressed out</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">due to macroeconomic pressures and due</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">to sociopolitical instability</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:04.560" style="s2">continuously</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.560" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s still going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">situations where no matter how well we</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">it somebody falls and hits their head</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">and we have to deal with that or</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">something that we haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">tend to comes up but</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">most of the causes of illness are</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">actually structurally induced at scale</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">in ways that are affecting everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">you actually can&#39;t even avoid currently</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m answering the question about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">relationship between the practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">partly saying most of the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">practitioners are currently looking at i</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">would like to not exist at all because</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with them upstream</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">both by doing health promotion and by</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">stopping the things that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">health degradation</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.839" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first part then we can get</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">into what</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">the uh when disease is manifesting and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">we need to deal with it what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">like but we would like to mostly just</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">shrink that category</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">um thank you so before we go we will</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">definitely need to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">the wider picture of health care or</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">healthy life um and the question of how</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">might we in if we were to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">redesign the health care system</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">and just completely kind of clean the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">table start out of the box what would it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">what could it look like</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">and those will be questions that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">would need to answer and and let&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">back to those so</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">if you allow let&#39;s stay a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">longer with with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">environment that is kind of closer to us</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">right now before we redesign everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">yeah so um when i look at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:43.200" style="s2">the relation between the healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:43.200" style="s2">provider and and the patient</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">one of the obvious changes right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2">and you alluded to this is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">automation of of healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">so more and more processes that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">just take</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">knowledge there&#39;s all the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">in medical school in terms of data to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">you know memorized</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">um all the effort it took in in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">initial years of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">my existence to go through paper cards</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">and finding that paper in paris and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">filling out a form and ordering it from</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">this library in paris and four weeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">later the paper would arrive and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">everything is available</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">online and we have search engines and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:22.480" style="s2">text mining and we can integrate all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">this and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">some fantastic new technologies already</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">collecting</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">information and processing this</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">information for me</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s that&#39;s one element so so how</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">am i going to deal with data now i</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">sometimes feel like i&#39;m in a data crisis</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">actually i</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">yeah in the beginning it was a problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">to find information now i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">i have enough i can&#39;t process more so</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a huge development and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">another huge development is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">the technological impact so all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">devices that we have all the techniques</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">and technologies that we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">that actually seem like seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">more authority</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">than my own clinical assessment</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.559" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">so i used to you know actually do a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">crazy thing and examine</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">patients you know now when i examine a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">patient um and if there&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">would have to validate my finding by</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">some kind of technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">so if i feel that there&#39;s some you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">something or you know i feel the liver</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:20.799" style="s2">is a little bit larger than i would</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">expect and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.799" end="00:19:23.919" style="s2">the next step would be to to get an</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">ultrasound to validate that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">and it used to be that that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">so somehow this the technology has</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">become is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">is becoming the reference point it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">kind of the objective measure and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">whatever we do as human beings is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">measured against</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">this is worrying to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">do you see that you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">profession of the physician will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">replaced</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">by technology at some point are we going</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">to have a robot where i just you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">like the little photo cameras that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">had at stations where you sit in you get</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">four pictures and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:01.919" style="s2">so i just walk into some station or some</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">office and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.919" end="00:20:05.760" style="s2">i put my finger in there take a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">blood and maybe take a little swab of my</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">my epithelium in the mouth and and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">go and two minutes later i get some</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">report</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">is this the future of medicine</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">hopefully yes and no there are things</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">machine learning can do really better</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">than human cognition there are things</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">that human cognition do that machine</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">learning can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">at all whether we get to artificial</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">or not obviously changes that story a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">bit because then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">talking about things that are less like</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">machines and more like</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">other kinds of beings</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.200" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we&#39;re close to that so</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">we&#39;re just talking about machine</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">learning and machine learning mostly</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">that is narrow in type</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">and so what i think that means</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">the machine learning and the diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">augment our capacity radically in good</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">ways in the way already your stethoscope</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">and your microscope and your you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">whatever tools your glasses you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">wearing right now are augmenting</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">your capacity and it&#39;s just continued</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">tools that can do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">so we learn new metrics new biometrics</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.520" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">all the time parts of the body we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">even know existed or parts of physiology</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">or new types of proteins and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">they&#39;re like the center of everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">and they&#39;re super important</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">we can anticipate that that continues</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">that 10 years from now nobel prizes will</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">be won about like breakthrough stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even know about right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">that will be the main stuff to look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">and so there&#39;s no way we&#39;re testing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">right now and there&#39;s no way that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">machine learning is paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">and yet some of it still comes through a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">kind of heuristic or intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">where you&#39;re feeling the liver and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">have some sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">even if the liver enzymes don&#39;t indicate</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">it or whatever some other test that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">we don&#39;t currently have does so</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">i think that the human capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">which includes intuition and things</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">beyond what we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">metrics on becomes increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:20.159" style="s2">as we&#39;re able to offload more of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">specialized narrow intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.159" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">so then the role of the doctor the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">practitioner is largely</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:29.039" style="s2">one that intermediates between really</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">being able to connect with the patient</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">in a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">generalized intuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">obviously enough cognitive knowledge to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:41.440" style="s2">even know how to use this database way</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">but then doesn&#39;t depend exclusively on</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:45.200" style="s2">memory we already don&#39;t we already</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">offload it to books it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.200" end="00:22:49.760" style="s2">much better versions of books and papers</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.760" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">you know when we think about the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">the information singularity</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">there can be so much information that no</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">one can be a specialist in any topic</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a hundred thousand journal</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">articles a year in the topic of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">specialty so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">already humans are irrelevant in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">we don&#39;t really need to like the data</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:11.919" style="s2">isn&#39;t what informs our choices</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">there the meaning of being able to put</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.919" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">the data of lots of things together does</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">and the meaningfulness is a second or</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">third derivative of the data if we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">have the machines not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">data mine and find the articles but also</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">be able to make sense of what a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">those articles together inform as far as</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">treatment goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">so one of the things i want to see the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">technology get a lot better at doing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">being able to do the kind of processing</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">it can so that what you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">is a higher order synthesis of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">information out there that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">can keep up with</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">so i see an information singularity much</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">faster than i see</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">a meaningfulness which is a derivative</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">of the information singularity which</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">then the doctors are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">paying attention to and the researchers</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">are working on helping to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:59.039" style="s2">factoring general intelligence so</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">the fact that we will be able to use</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:02.559" style="s2">increasingly good cameras on an iphone</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">to look at a skin condition use image</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.559" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">recognition to automatically diagnose</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">the thing at a distance like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">and there there are both things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">that won&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">in terms of physiologic diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">and in terms of the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:22.640" style="s2">and so and both of those are very</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:23.919" style="s2">important so um</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:26.000" style="s2">i think we were talking the other day a</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">little bit about how</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.000" end="00:24:31.200" style="s2">important it is that we don&#39;t automate</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">in ways that lead to more isolation</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.200" end="00:24:34.480" style="s2">especially in the name of healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">when isolation is one of the number one</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.480" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">causes of health care issues in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">thank you so when you when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">about the availability of technology and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">how this technology may</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">kind of support our decision making and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">will make it easier for us to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">provide meaningful health care</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">and we talked about the temple as in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">center of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">hospital if you like</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">is there a sacred space for the human</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">being as a healer a space that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">structurally not be</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">taken on by automation</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">um yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.120" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">i think it&#39;s i think it&#39;s obvious um</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">again we have to question like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">separate the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">artificial general intelligence or</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">silica-based life because now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">talking about life</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">and whether that is possible ever or not</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.200" end="00:25:38.799" style="s2">theoretical possibility of it and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.799" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">negative implications of silica-based</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">life trying to share a biosphere with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">hydrocarbon-based life might be like</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s so not near if ever we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">take that off and so really then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">human connection of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">connect with someone who can actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">care about you</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">and machines that are simply doing input</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">output processing</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">we obviously want to extend our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:10.559" style="s2">with machines and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">healthcare the center of it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.559" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">so this care so we have the temple</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">where the sacred space we have care as</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">the primary</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">ingredient of the relation between the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:28.720" style="s2">healthcare provider</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">and the patient something that remains a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.720" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">environment something that remains a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">capacity in quality</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.520" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">so if this is this is something that can</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.240" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">be established already</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">in can be promoted already in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">existing healthcare system</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">now you were alluding already to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">well yeah but care is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">limited or confined to either the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">consultation room or</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:02.320" style="s2">the hospital as really</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">whenever a doctor is needed we&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.320" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">late when we talk about health</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">so we&#39;ve already reached a threshold</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">several non-linear processes have have</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">scaled up and the threshold has been</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">reached and now</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">the dis-ease has become symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">so we&#39;re way too far downstream</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">so what we really wish to see is if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">want to promote health is to address</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">these health issues more upstream</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:32.399" style="s2">you already alluded to agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">finances</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.399" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">social interactions so what are these</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">areas</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">so if we&#39;re if we&#39;re kind of moving from</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">what is an ideal hospital</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">to what is an ideal healthcare system</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:52.080" style="s2">how would that change our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">what are these elements as we think</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.080" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">about moving forward we need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">think about our actual evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">environment in terms of what our</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">genes were selected to actually do well</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">um because our future environment will</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">be different than that but it has to not</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">be misaligned with that right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:11.279" style="s2">created a world in which we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:14.640" style="s2">genetically misfit</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.279" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">in really important ways so so we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.640" end="00:28:17.520" style="s2">to consider this</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">when we think about the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.520" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">environment of humans the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">we&#39;re social primates</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">and we for all of our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">history we&#39;re in bands and tribes with</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">extremely close</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">high trust interaction with lots of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">other humans</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">and i mean we can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:40.399" style="s2">how that affects via physical touch and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">microbiome sharing and pheromone sharing</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.399" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">to the actual uh attachment theory of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna go beyond any of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">specific mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">that&#39;s foundational to physical and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">psychological health</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">and so we&#39;re not just talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">the infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">will work we&#39;re also talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">the social structures work</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">i think it&#39;s really insightful to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">how many people you trust as much as</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">anyone in a tribe would have trusted</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">everyone they knew</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">because most people don&#39;t have anyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">that they feel like they know</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">as well or knows them as well or they</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">can trust as much as humans evolved</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">being able to trust all the people they</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">knew</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want to over romanticize</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not that there weren&#39;t difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">that were associated but</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">the kind of fierce egalitarianism tribes</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">had to have to be able to function</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">together well like in a tribe you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:34.799" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">right left antipathy and stay together</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.799" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">right you can&#39;t have internal defection</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:41.039" style="s2">you actually can&#39;t even get away with</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">lying because everyone&#39;s going to tell</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.039" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a forced transparency</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">at that small scale and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">we actually need extraordinarily high</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">trust environments for psychological</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">health and we need psychological health</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">for physiological health</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">so that&#39;s one example so when we just</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">stay with the social interaction for now</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:05.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of your</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">favorite topics is how to what is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.679" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">impact of a societal development</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">on them on various factors so if if in</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">this conversation we focus on health</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">what would be key societal developments</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">that we would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">again kind of time warping forwards</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">through 2050 what would we like to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">in place</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">in in our societies that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">would reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.760" style="s2">healthcare the attention in healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">facilities as we have them today</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.760" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">so could we kind of address some of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">problems that we see in hospitals now</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">already upstream</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s funny to kind of think about what</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.760" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">examples to use because it&#39;s pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">it&#39;s like every building material we use</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">almost every building material out gases</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">volatile organic compounds from petrol</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">derivatives that are either neurotoxins</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">endocrine disruptors or carcinogens</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">so it&#39;s the restructuring of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:15.360" style="s2">materials economy and material supply</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">chain to not be polluting the indoor and</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.360" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">outdoor environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:22.320" style="s2">it&#39;s that the the actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">photic spectrum of the light that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.320" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">in is unhealthy for us because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.640" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">photosynthesize vitamin d nitric oxide</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">uh cortisol and so many other things are</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">regulated by not just the total amount</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">of light but specific frequencies of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">light and timing of light it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:42.399" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">the nuclear family home structure the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.399" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">nature of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">economies of scale moving agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">far away where even if it was organic</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">which it generally isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">it&#39;s old it&#39;s been actually undergoing</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">entropy since being picked for a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">which means nutrient decay</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:59.039" style="s2">let alone lack of interaction with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:00.679" style="s2">soil that not only has a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.039" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">psychological regeneration but</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.679" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">microbiotic effects like</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.399" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">we can see that market forces</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.480" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">move the world to a place that optimizes</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">for market forces</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">and they optimize for addiction and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">comfort rather than health or well-being</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">and i think this is a really important</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">comfort and happiness or are not the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:32.000" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">but as soon as we one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.000" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">one of the effects of kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:40.640" style="s2">was moving into the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">objectivism and things we could measure</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.640" end="00:32:44.960" style="s2">but we can actually measure metrics of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">comfort like how bouncy the shocks in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.960" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">car</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">are or whatever more than we can measure</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">subjectivity which we can&#39;t measure at</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">and it gets into existentialism of what</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">is a meaningful human experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">and so we start optimizing for comfort</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">and you actually make shitty people when</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">you optimize for comfort because</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">psychologically good people are people</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">that can actually hold a certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">resilience in the presence of discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">so you look at the wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">that had sweat lodges and ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">ceremonies and combo ceremonies and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">sundances and vision quests which were</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">actually induced really intense</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">discomfort to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">find a self-transcendence in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">presence of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">in the same way that you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">strong people by not lifting weights</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">right you actually have to hormetically</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">stress the system to upregulate its</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">regulatory capacity</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">you have to psychologically stress the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">emotional system to learn emotional</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">so there&#39;s so much of the in the name of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">comfort that is just actually making</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">maximally entropic humans</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">and the same with like supposedly market</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">theory says people will demand real</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">that are actually going to enrich the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">quality of their life like food and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">and then that will create a basis for</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:56.799" style="s2">people to create supply</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">and the best supply will end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.799" end="00:34:01.919" style="s2">up regulated but of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">as soon as we start recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">economies of scale on the supply side</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:07.039" style="s2">and the supply side becomes a much</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">bigger</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.039" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">organism than the demand side and it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">going to benefit from more profit</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">now it wants to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">manufacture artificial demand that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">so then the business has the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">maximize lifetime revenue of a customer</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">and i maximize lifetime revenue of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">customer by driving addiction starting</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">in childhood</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">so if i can have social media and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">entertainment that&#39;s maximally addictive</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">it figures out psychologically exactly</p>

<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">then we can have the plausible</p>

<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">after you drove addiction in them using</p>

<p begin="00:35:14.839" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">so if i</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:22.079" style="s2">if i just you know put this into a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">pediatrician&#39;s kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.079" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">making it simple then</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">what i understand from you is that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">entire concept</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.040" end="00:35:36.160" style="s2">of healthcare as a service</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">that is being paid for including all the</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:42.839" style="s2">that are part of this service come along</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">with this service</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">is not in line with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">with with the concept of health as</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">you&#39;re describing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">so all of this works as long as we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:55.599" style="s2">disease</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">so if we have a problem to be solved if</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">we have a disease and we give it a name</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">and we give it a label</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">that allows us then to say if you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">that disease then you need this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">diagnostics and therefore you need these</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:07.520" style="s2">sort of machines and therefore you need</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">these sort of treatments</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">congratulations here sincerely thank you</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">so that is that is one um</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">this is one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">and the other is when we actually want</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.480" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">rather than the absence of disease then</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:27.599" style="s2">all of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">is is a misfit so whatever we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.599" end="00:36:32.160" style="s2">constructed in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">healthcare system trying to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.160" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">disease</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">as a system is not useful if</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">if we&#39;re actually turning our focus</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">towards health is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s funny even if we just think</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">about disease diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">i think most of the actual diseases that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">we have diagnostics for</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">are made up they&#39;re fit their fictions</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">so obviously adhd is a fiction that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">just making childhood a disease</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">and it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">take take kids</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:07.920" style="s2">have parents pay no attention to them</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">pay like if you think about what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.920" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2"> school is the way that we have it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">structured</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:13.599" style="s2">it&#39;s these p these little people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">make money yet</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.599" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">and so they are</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">possibly future assets in the financial</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">system but right now they&#39;re liabilities</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">or debts on the future system so we want</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">the least number of productive class</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">people to monitor the most of impossible</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:30.079" style="s2">so one teacher to 30 of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">typically a low paid person because</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.079" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">someone that could do something more</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">profitable we&#39;d rather than generating</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">more profit</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">to get them to the point where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">part of the productive class and as soon</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">as they&#39;re too old to be the productive</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:41.040" style="s2">class then again we want to ship them</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">off somewhere where</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.040" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">one low-paid person takes care of lots</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">like so we start with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">and the school system that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">facilitate their interest in anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">forces them to be interested in totally</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">uninteresting breaks their interest</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">in life as a result so then they want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">play video games and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:02.400" style="s2">watch porn or whatever and then we say</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:03.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that&#39;s what human nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.400" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">is there&#39;s only human nature after we</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.680" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">broke it</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">right so then we medicate that as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">disease because that&#39;s also a super</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">profitable thing to do and then that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">creates the beginning of a nitrogenic</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:15.839" style="s2">cascade where the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">ritalin the side effects of the ritalin</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.839" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">are going to need an ssri later and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:20.320" style="s2">are going to need a benzo</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">and then that person&#39;s for life</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.320" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">but the profitability is quite high in</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">terms of lifetime revenue</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">because if i drive rather than helping</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">people be healthy</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">if i override their system in a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">that&#39;s going to cause ongoing addiction</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:34.960" style="s2">because they can&#39;t get off that benzo</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">because they&#39;re going to have rolling</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.960" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">panic attacks if they do way worse than</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">their anxiety initially ever was</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">but the side effects of that are another</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">drug that we also sell that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">called an upsell or a cross cell which</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">is just good business</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">so like obviously adhd is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">disease</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">most psychiatric diagnoses it would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">way more useful to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">but also like every complex chronic</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">disease</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">they&#39;re diseases in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">rheumatoid arthritis we call it a</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">disease or ms or alzheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the same cause if i see</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">10 different people with ms there and i</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">actually found</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">out what&#39;s going on because right now we</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on at all so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">disease just allows us to know</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.400" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">what symptomatic drugs or military drugs</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do but we can&#39;t cure any</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.800" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">but if i want to say what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">going on the patho etiology is different</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">in every case</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">because they&#39;re multifactorial and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same set of factors</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:36.320" style="s2">and so the fact that there&#39;s a cluster</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">of biomarkers and a cluster of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.320" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">that i can make a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:42.880" style="s2">a disease title for to then know what</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">drug to prescribe and insurance can do</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.880" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">that thing doesn&#39;t mean that that tells</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">me anything about the pathophysiology of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">so even in so far as i&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">the disease i see ms i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">know when i hear ms all i know is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">so there&#39;s some kind of autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:40:00.560" style="s2">neurodegenerative stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">this system was exposed to some things</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.560" end="00:40:04.160" style="s2">that created dysregulation</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">deviations from homeodynamics it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.160" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">probably led to more susceptibility to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">more dysregulation</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">that eventually reached a threshold that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">had symptomology where there was</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">probably pathophysiology going on for</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">years or decades ahead of time</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">and for this person with ms it was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">mold exposure</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">30 years ago that left mycotoxins that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:26.560" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">cytokine profiles and whatever that then</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.560" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">10 years later they had a micro tbi from</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:32.720" style="s2">a car accident and then a divorce dress</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">that threw them over and now it&#39;s ms</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.720" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">and in somebody else it was a tick-borne</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">lime exposure and then some food</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">poisoning</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">in guatemala and some glyphosate and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:44.560" style="s2">then some other emotional stressor</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">so to actually be able to cure it i need</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.560" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">to know that stuff which the title ms</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:49.359" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give me</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">so not only do we want to move to health</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">promotion like we want to even think</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">about disease in a reasonable way</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">that is so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:01.680" style="s2">this is so interesting because the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">we do studies at least when when i look</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.680" end="00:41:04.560" style="s2">at the studies that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">this is the classic type of clinical</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:09.839" style="s2">studies what we what we see is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:11.760" style="s2">that there is uh there are basically two</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.839" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">observations so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.760" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a starting point and an end</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">point and then we assume that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2">linear association between the two</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:20.800" style="s2">and it seems that as we are as we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.119" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">learning more um</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.800" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">as there is in uh there&#39;s more insight</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:30.880" style="s2">into how we might be able to calculate</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:32.160" style="s2">non-linear associations and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.880" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.160" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">that probably a lot of what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">during this time of observation in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">classic clinical trial</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">what we observe there is is very much</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.079" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">dependent on what happened before this</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">trial and all the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">actually describing</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">and the heterogeneity that that is is</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">um is not usually captured in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">of typical table one</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">in a paper saying you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">distribution of sex and gender and</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">ethnicity so this is way way more</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:04.079" style="s2">complex than that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t even started to come to</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.079" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">grips with the complexity of what</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:10.079" style="s2">what the regulatory mechanisms are</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">before we start to observe something</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.079" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">right so so a lot of what i hear from</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">you is that a lot of the signs that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">that we look at so a lot of clinical</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">science is based on</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">a syndromic diagnosis so we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">that this this</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">this patient group shares a certain set</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">of signs and symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">and if it&#39;s that then we give it a name</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:32.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s a useful thing to give it a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">name so we have a working hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.560" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">can talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:39.839" style="s2">but along the line of this process of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.359" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">discovering what is actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.839" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">we are kind of taking this diagnosis as</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:45.599" style="s2">something set</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">as something that exists as an as an</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.599" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">entity rather than a working hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">so then we start to developing drugs to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:55.119" style="s2">fix a problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">so to fix the signs and symptoms which</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.119" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">is a good idea for those who do have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">signs and symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:02.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s at least very promising if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">do suffer of ms as the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">the example you gave if there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">solutions to the problem that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">experienced to the signs and symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">that&#39;s a useful thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">but we could recognize that this is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.359" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">a painkiller</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">rather than something that really</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">addresses the cause of disease so what</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">might be the steps for us what would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">the structural approach to take in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">future so that we&#39;re actually turning</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:26.160" style="s2">our direction and really drill down to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">the cause of disease rather than trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.160" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">to fix signs and symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">yeah and you know don&#39;t get me wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">symptomatic medicine and palliative care</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:37.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">you know ameliorating some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">the um advancement of pathology like</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">this awesome</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">novocaine is one of the best inventions</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">ever dentistry totally sucked before</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">novocaine</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">so uh that&#39;s not addressing something at</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">a causal level but it&#39;s awesome right</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">so but we can do so much</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">better and</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:06.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a place where okay so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:07.760" style="s2">i&#39;m looking at the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.480" end="00:44:10.560" style="s2">the regulatory bodies</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.760" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">so in the us the fda in particular other</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.560" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">bodies ama and whatever but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">look at the fda for is this a treatment</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">can actually a doctor can give to treat</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">a disease right so the disease has been</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:25.359" style="s2">recognized the treatment&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">recognized and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">otherwise the doctor&#39;s not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">use it insurance won&#39;t cover it whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">so we look at what it takes to get the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">status which also means then that it</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">will get trained to new people in</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">medical school</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">well so phase three clinical trials are</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">going to cost</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">a billion dollars most of a billion</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">dollars but now factoring all the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:46.240" style="s2">that don&#39;t make it through</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">matriculating that right a billion</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.240" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">so the only way to ever be able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">recoup that money</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:55.520" style="s2">is if i can patent the thing because</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.520" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">someone else who&#39;s just competing on</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:44:59.839" style="s2">cost of goods and they didn&#39;t put the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">billion dollars up</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.839" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">it was just going to beat me and so if</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:05.280" style="s2">i&#39;m looking at patentable stuff then i</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">look at the regulatory dynamics around</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.280" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">patenting i can only patent synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">molecules</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">and that means that the things i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">looking at are not part of how your body</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">worked when it was healthy and are not</p>

<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">right stuff so let&#39;s say i looked at</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">when the same person with the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">genome didn&#39;t have cancer and they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">super healthy and now that they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:42.560" style="s2">cancer what was different in their body</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">or before the autoimmune disease and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">see that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">cell types and certain peptides that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">much more</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">prevalent and other ones that are less</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">prevalent and i&#39;d start to think about</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">types of biological endogenous medicine</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">i could do</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">i i can&#39;t even research most of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:56.480" style="s2">because i&#39;ll never be able to patent it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">which means there&#39;s no money for the</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">to ever be able to get it through</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">clinical approval so</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">basically the epistemology that looks</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">sick one drug i mean one disease</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">a set of symptoms one drug it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">dumb epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">but the there is no incentive to be able</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">to try and do better complex</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">epistemology from a finance regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">point of view so</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">the epistemics are actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">straightforward which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:33.520" style="s2">acute causation acute singular causation</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">is straightforward you got a physical</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.520" end="00:46:37.359" style="s2">injury that was an acute injury</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:40.319" style="s2">we&#39;re going to sew it up don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.359" end="00:46:40.319" style="s2">thing again right</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">or you had an acute infectious exposure</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">we&#39;re going to give you the antibiotic</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">even that starts getting questionable</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">because did everyone who is exposed get</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">the same thing and do you actually have</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">underlying immune weakness</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">and is the antibiotic actually necessary</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">and are you breeding antibiotic</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">resistance in the whole population by</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">using it unnecessarily</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">there&#39;s questions there but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">say there are times where that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">an acute thing but</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">most disease does not have a single</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">cause</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:15.119" style="s2">and the causes so they&#39;re multifactorial</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">they&#39;re different for different people</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">and many of them are radically time</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">delayed</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">and so to actually be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">curative work we&#39;ve actually got to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">able to assess how the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">systems of the body are doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">and what the deviations to homeodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">the person has been exposed to are find</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">the unique set be able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">specially reverse that unique set and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">generally support the homeodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">systems of the body</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a totally different way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">about medicine so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">so we&#39;re talking about in a way you talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">about personalized medicine precision</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">terms that have been used in different</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">ways but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.359" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">n equals one medicine</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">now part of how research is done right</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">is is to understand what is going on in</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">a single case</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">by looking at similar cases and</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">comparing them and trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">so what we do the approach to research</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">is to kind of look at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">disease from the outside and recognize</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:15.440" style="s2">patterns of disease that are similar</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.440" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">in a group of people that we observe</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">that is essentially different to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:24.880" style="s2">disease experience of the person who had</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">this threshold</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.880" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">this multifactorial threshold experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:32.800" style="s2">how do we so it&#39;s basically the way we</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">conduct research</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.800" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">today is completely missing the point</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not useless</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:39.520" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:43.520" style="s2">clinical trials aren&#39;t totally useless</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">being able to do variable isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.520" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">seeing what that variable does across</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">the distribution of all the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">variables gives us an insight right so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">when we do a clinical trial on a drug</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">compared to a placebo and we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">to see is there some effect beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:48:59.040" style="s2">placebo and we see there is versus there</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">isn&#39;t there is indicates that there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">mechanism that&#39;s occurring that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:03.760" style="s2">of all it tells us that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.760" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">but the fact that there&#39;s a gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">distribution of the response curve where</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">some people have great responses and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">some maybe have terrible responses</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">is a result of lots of other things that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">are going on that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">don&#39;t recognize so they just get put</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">under a bell curve and it would be much</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.599" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">if we could start to figure that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">out well you can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.000" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">with looking with variable isolation on</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:29.520" style="s2">a large population</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:30.800" style="s2">so now when i move all the way to n</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.520" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">equals one where i&#39;m looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.800" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">population of one and trying to look at</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">all the variables and look at how they</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">make sense together i&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">now i&#39;ve got to use complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve got to use much more advanced kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">of statistical modeling</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">but there are ways of simplifying it</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">because we know that if i just try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">do the brute force computation</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">there are things we can&#39;t measure right</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">so i can</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">i can put a qeg on you but i can&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">way to see that in real time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">lots of proteins we can&#39;t measure</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">and and there&#39;s that we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">even know that we don&#39;t know about yet</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">a huge part of it and if i tried to run</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">medicine basics but that we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">modernize</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">so is it not getting enough of something</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:31.839" style="s2">is it not getting enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">exercise rest love affection sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.839" end="00:50:36.480" style="s2">micronutrients macronutrients so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">say we look at micronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.480" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">we need to think about subclinical</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.240" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">deficiency as opposed to clinical</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:45.119" style="s2">deficiency so</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:46.240" style="s2">most people don&#39;t have scurvy right</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.119" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome that they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.240" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">scurvy</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">but if we look at optimal vitamin c and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">then we look at scurvy</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:53.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a pretty big range in here that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">is don&#39;t yet have scurvy but that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.920" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">sub-optimal so we&#39;d call that</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">sub-clinical deficiency where</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">being able to augment those levels would</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">make a difference now</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">because i&#39;ve got so many micronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:05.920" style="s2">to look at if i just try to control that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.079" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">one variable and look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.920" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">decreased all-cause mortality or</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s going to be really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">tell</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:13.839" style="s2">because that one thing also needs</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">bioflavonoid synergistically to work and</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">it&#39;s going to interact</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">like there&#39;s so many other things going</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">on so if i start to look</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">overarchingly at are we providing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">good nutrition and is this person</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">absorbing and assimilating it</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">and dealing with subclinical deficiency</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">also toxicity so</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">until we have re-engineered our supply</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">chains</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">do i want to look at the exposure people</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:37.440" style="s2">have to heavy metals to vocs to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">mycotoxins</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.440" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">also to infections that are subclinical</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">meaning they&#39;re not creating acute</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">medical symptomology but this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">normal part of a human microbiome</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:51.680" style="s2">and when we look at nh pylori or an hpv</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">or an ebv that we know have statistical</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:55.200" style="s2">correlations with diseases that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">chronic infections there&#39;s a gazillion</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.200" end="00:51:58.240" style="s2">other things that do</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">functional medicine and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.240" end="00:52:01.760" style="s2">functional infectious explorative</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">medicine are starting to pioneer this</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.760" end="00:52:05.280" style="s2">more than general medicine</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">but this is too much of something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.280" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">the body shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:11.599" style="s2">we can do stuff about that so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">way of taking this entire search base</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.599" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">and optimization space and having some</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.160" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">kind of heuristic diagnostics that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">able to get</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:22.800" style="s2">do a lot of the work more simply we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">also think about the primary regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.800" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">mechanisms of the body and how to look</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">at the robustness of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">which indicates everything that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">on so like</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">i want to be able to look not just at</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:38.079" style="s2">homeostatic state is your vitamin d your</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">heart rate your cholesterol within a</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">i want to look at the homeodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">capacity that when i stress it how far</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">out does it go and how quickly does it</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:47.040" style="s2">come back</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">because if we don&#39;t just want to define</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">disease we want to define health in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">way we can measure</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">if we want to start to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">objectivity of it then i would define</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:56.559" style="s2">health as</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:57.760" style="s2">related to the robustness of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.559" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">homeodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">regulatory mechanisms how much stress</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">the being can be exposed to without</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:06.480" style="s2">going into pathophysiology without</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:08.079" style="s2">deviating from the homeodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">so we that&#39;s a different set of tests we</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.079" end="00:53:11.839" style="s2">need to stress test stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">right and so i would like to see more of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.839" end="00:53:16.960" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">then we can define disease as</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.960" end="00:53:20.880" style="s2">some of those homeodynamic markers are</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">actually out of range</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">and pathophysiology is occurring aging</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">is not yet disease they&#39;re in range but</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">there&#39;s less robustness which means</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">more susceptibility to disease meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">smaller stresses can cause larger strain</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:36.480" style="s2">and so then the kind of anti-aging um</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">preventative</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.480" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">preventative health promotion work is</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">just increasing the robustness of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">regulatory mechanism so we both want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">measure and think about the body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">regulatory dynamics and how to promote</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">those generally</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.240" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">as well as look at the specific causes</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">pathology and how to reverse them</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">beautiful thank you so when we you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">homeodynamic systems so basically the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.440" end="00:54:05.280" style="s2">regulations</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">all the different regulatory processes</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.280" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">going on within the body</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">that maintain some sort of range of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">within the realm of ease rather than</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:16.960" style="s2">this ease which is probably then at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">outliers of the bells curve</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.960" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">so when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">when we look at these regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.280" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">within a system we still assume that</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:34.800" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:34.800" style="s2">is a closed system</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">and i wonder from what you said before</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:39.920" style="s2">whether that&#39;s actually an assumption we</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">should take</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.920" end="00:54:43.520" style="s2">or whether we should also look at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">assumes that this body has</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">probably some mechanisms that run within</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">but probably also it is at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:55.040" style="s2">susceptible to or interfering with</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.040" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">that are around that body so in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s look at layers of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">holisticness and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:06.400" style="s2">or comprehensivity and consideration so</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:08.079" style="s2">we can&#39;t just do the vertical slices</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.400" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">called neurology gastroenterology</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.079" end="00:55:10.319" style="s2">rheumatology oncology because most of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">complex things occur across those right</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">if we look at brain access dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:18.480" style="s2">that&#39;s gastroenterology neurology</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">immunology rheumatology all mixed</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.480" end="00:55:20.720" style="s2">together where no specialist is going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">see the thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">right so we have to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:26.640" style="s2">interaction of all the body systems</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:28.480" style="s2">we also have to look at the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.640" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">slices the omics of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.480" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not just what&#39;s happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:34.000" style="s2">genomic level in the epigenetic and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:35.200" style="s2">proteomic but also how the top-down</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.000" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">connectomic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.200" end="00:55:38.000" style="s2">and neuroendocrine stuff is affecting</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">the bottom up stuff so we want to think</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.000" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">about all the body systems together</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">but then it&#39;s not just the body systems</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">of the individual it&#39;s the body and</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">mind psyche emotion spirit of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:48.720" style="s2">individual right so we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">thinking about how all of those interact</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.720" end="00:55:51.359" style="s2">but then it&#39;s not just the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:53.040" style="s2">the individual interacting</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.359" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">with the greater world and universe</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.040" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">they&#39;re part of both</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:55:58.559" style="s2">physically and psychologically right</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:01.119" style="s2">metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.559" end="00:56:02.720" style="s2">so physically i find the person has</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:04.720" style="s2">mycotoxins and i send them home to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.720" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">house that still has mold in it</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.720" end="00:56:08.799" style="s2">like obviously we have to address the</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:12.559" style="s2">physical environment they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.799" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">or we know very clearly that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.559" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">the lifestyle of people is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:17.920" style="s2">affected by the lifestyle of the people</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:19.680" style="s2">they&#39;re spending a lot of time around</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.920" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">more than almost anything else</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.680" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">so the person has illnesses associated</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:26.559" style="s2">with obesity and i send them home</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">to an environment and a community in</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.559" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">which the health habits of everyone suck</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.559" end="00:56:31.920" style="s2">and are self-reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.040" style="s2">and would be ostracizing if they did</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.920" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">something different</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.040" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">or were the persons really lonely and</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">loneliness we know drives addiction</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">so i i&#39;ve got to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:44.799" style="s2">s the physiological and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">interactions of the being with their</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">environment and what&#39;s necessary so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.720" end="00:56:50.079" style="s2">when we think about a integrative or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">holistic</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.079" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">medicine or healthcare it has to factor</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">all that so to what degree</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:57:00.799" style="s2">is a sense of isolation or separation</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">a cause of disease whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">of feeling separated is that is that a</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">statement you could go along with that</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:11.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:12.960" style="s2">the sense of separation is is a sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:14.799" style="s2">that i might create but it is an</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.960" end="00:57:17.839" style="s2">illusionary sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">whilst there is nothing but a connect</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.839" end="00:57:21.760" style="s2">an interconnectedness so as soon as i</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:23.880" style="s2">perceive myself</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.760" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">as separate from that one</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.880" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">this is a cause of disease</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">when you say that the disconnection is</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.640" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">illusory well that</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:40.319" style="s2">is true on some levels</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">it&#39;s also switching the burden to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.319" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">perception where maybe they actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:49.920" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">social dynamics that really are</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:53.280" style="s2">ostracizing or really are don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">real connection and</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.280" end="00:57:56.559" style="s2">of course insofar as i&#39;m talking to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">individual i want to help them figure</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.559" end="00:57:58.799" style="s2">out how</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">they can take more agency to change</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.799" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">their life but in so far as i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:03.520" style="s2">about how to change systems i want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">say how do we make systems that support</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.520" end="00:58:07.599" style="s2">individuals more</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:09.200" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the classically right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.599" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">left perspective individual or</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:12.400" style="s2">collective focus you have to do both and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:14.799" style="s2">pay attention to the virtuous cycle</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.400" end="00:58:16.319" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.799" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">when you look at work of people like</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.319" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">gabor mate and others on attachment</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">theory and how much</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">the sense of isolation drives</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">addiction which then drives so many</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">from a health perspective i think this</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">is huge</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:38.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">when we look at mass shooters</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.720" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">none of them that i&#39;m aware of had</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:45.680" style="s2">healthy meaningful relationships before</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">being mass shooters</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.680" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">so news goes and interviews and says</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">they were</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:53.599" style="s2">all the neighbors the neighbors say the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">person was alone or they totally kept</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.599" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">themselves nobody ever saw them</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:58:58.480" style="s2">which means that person was getting per</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">to progress</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.480" end="00:59:03.280" style="s2">in their how disenfranchised they felt</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">how depressed how misanthropic they were</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">with nobody knowing and checking which</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">is also why i don&#39;t want a world that</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:10.000" style="s2">allows</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:10.799" style="s2">people that makes it very easy for</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.000" end="00:59:12.880" style="s2">people to</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.799" end="00:59:14.079" style="s2">be isolated that much so if amazon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.880" end="00:59:16.240" style="s2">going to come deliver the stuff at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">door and my doctor on the phone can do</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.240" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">people can be progressing in their</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:21.119" style="s2">psychopathology radically and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">having access to</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.119" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">more destructive tools than earlier</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:26.799" style="s2">humans had</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:28.000" style="s2">right now ar-15s and beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.799" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">weaponized drones</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.000" end="00:59:32.480" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not just that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">isolation is bad for the person it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.480" end="00:59:35.200" style="s2">that the isolation makes those people</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.079" end="00:59:38.400" style="s2">very dangerous to</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.200" end="00:59:41.760" style="s2">the health of the society as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.400" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">and so it&#39;s actually important that as</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.760" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about redesigning</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">civilization we&#39;re making the processes</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:49.040" style="s2">by which people</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">get their basic resources provisioned</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.040" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">and needs met involve interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:58.160" style="s2">humans in healthy enriching ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="00:59:58.160" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">the intersection of people that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:05.760" style="s2">progressing in psychopathology with</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:10.000" style="s2">decentralized catastrophic technology</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.760" end="01:00:13.359" style="s2">is a major problem for the world yeah</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.599" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">an individual we have to think</p>

<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">we have to think about the environment</p>
