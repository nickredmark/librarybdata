<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">up 24 years ago settling in Sweden had</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.109" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">the pleasure and surprise of ending up</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">living on a small isolated island in</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">Sweden for about a decade where I had</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">some time to start to reflect about my</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">family&#39;s past and also gruesome roots to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:24.900" style="s2">start to to be able to become grounded</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">in order to be able to do the work I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t know I was going to do the work</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">but then in April 2010 went to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:36.810" style="s2">Buddhist archive in Germany and asked</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">whether they had any material on my</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.810" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">grandparents who were German I was born</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">in Brazil in 1967 my mother was born in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">occupied Poland in 1941 and most people</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">around me always laughed a bit that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:55.500" style="s2">hadn&#39;t put two and two together but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">guess I had tried to look away from</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.500" end="00:02:02.250" style="s2">those facts and so the documents I</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">received there set me off on a very long</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.250" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">journey I didn&#39;t know that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">that long six year journey through</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:12.569" style="s2">Germany Poland Brazil and Paraguay to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:14.790" style="s2">learn about</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.569" end="00:02:18.569" style="s2">the role my grandparents played in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.790" end="00:02:24.019" style="s2">Third Reich wow that&#39;s a hell of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.569" end="00:02:24.019" style="s2">answer to a question oh here you are</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.079" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">I guess secrets deeply hidden from you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:39.060" style="s2">about why a German girl would be growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:40.769" style="s2">up in Brazil can you tell us a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.060" end="00:02:42.390" style="s2">bit about your evolution as to how you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.769" end="00:02:44.489" style="s2">came to understand that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.390" end="00:02:47.489" style="s2">something fairly interesting in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.489" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">family story well first of all there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.489" end="00:02:51.260" style="s2">part of me that&#39;s Germans my mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:54.709" style="s2">German but my father was an American</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.260" end="00:02:59.310" style="s2">which also made matters more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.709" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">because I also had an I guess an</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:05.310" style="s2">outsider&#39;s perspective as well as an</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:10.079" style="s2">insider&#39;s perspective into my German</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:14.930" style="s2">heritage the way it started is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.079" end="00:03:17.699" style="s2">say but the way I usually think of it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.930" end="00:03:21.269" style="s2">back in a time when I was a two-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.699" end="00:03:25.319" style="s2">and put into a German dirndl so a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.269" end="00:03:28.260" style="s2">traditional German dress whenever my</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.319" end="00:03:30.900" style="s2">German grandparents came to visit from</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.260" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">the interior because they were settled</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.900" end="00:03:38.459" style="s2">on an estate near the Brazilian</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:40.349" style="s2">Paraguayan border and I noticed from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.459" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">albums that I always had one of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.349" end="00:03:44.750" style="s2">traditional dresses on when they came to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">visit which to me seemed very strange</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.750" end="00:03:51.389" style="s2">given that I was the daughter of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:54.419" style="s2">American and a German and I was living</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.389" end="00:03:56.519" style="s2">in Brazil there are large German</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.419" end="00:03:58.829" style="s2">communities there so maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.519" end="00:04:03.269" style="s2">argue it that way but it was a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.829" end="00:04:05.510" style="s2">strange and in that girl&#39;s eyes I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.269" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">see and I also remember growing up</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.510" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">burying a very considerable shame and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:14.970" style="s2">the nature of shame is different than</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">guilt when you are guilt when you feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.970" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">guilty you know what you&#39;ve done it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:22.770" style="s2">reaction to something you think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:24.719" style="s2">done wrong but shame is something else</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.770" end="00:04:26.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a feeling of self self</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.719" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">worthlessness</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.550" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">and you don&#39;t necessarily know why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:37.920" style="s2">there so I bore this with me from a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:40.410" style="s2">early age probably because my mother was</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.920" end="00:04:43.560" style="s2">very frustrated about her past and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.410" end="00:04:46.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t really know how to deal with it I</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.560" end="00:04:48.750" style="s2">think she wanted to love her parents</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.950" end="00:04:52.860" style="s2">like all children want to love their</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.750" end="00:05:00.840" style="s2">parents yet at the same time understood</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:05:04.220" style="s2">that they had this troublesome past that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.840" end="00:05:07.410" style="s2">was simply not acceptable in the new era</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.220" end="00:05:12.510" style="s2">that she was living in and so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.410" end="00:05:14.910" style="s2">I I had this with me then I got educated</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.510" end="00:05:19.260" style="s2">but I had a very close relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.910" end="00:05:20.820" style="s2">my grandmother whose affection I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.260" end="00:05:22.980" style="s2">sought because I didn&#39;t have a close</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.820" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">relationship with my mother and my</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.980" end="00:05:28.410" style="s2">grandmother remained a devoted Nazi to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:31.260" style="s2">the end of her life I just didn&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.410" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">hadn&#39;t I hadn&#39;t realized that she wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.260" end="00:05:37.890" style="s2">well so your grandma was a was a Nazi to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:41.940" style="s2">the end of a really 100 and 300 years</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.890" end="00:05:45.090" style="s2">old so she died in what year she died in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.940" end="00:05:48.450" style="s2">2014 she was born the year the Titanic</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.090" end="00:05:51.870" style="s2">sunk oh wow so it&#39;s pretty amazing to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.450" end="00:05:54.480" style="s2">think about it - Part C 2014 well</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.870" end="00:05:59.010" style="s2">obviously she wasn&#39;t a Nazi until until</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.480" end="00:06:00.930" style="s2">the 1930s right no no of course but one</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.010" end="00:06:03.690" style="s2">sense is from a little bit that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.930" end="00:06:05.460" style="s2">said that the commitment was made and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.690" end="00:06:07.410" style="s2">there was somehow no digging out of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.460" end="00:06:10.590" style="s2">and so it was just kept going full speed</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.410" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">ahead no I think you can can compare it</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.590" end="00:06:15.990" style="s2">to the commitment of some people today</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:17.670" style="s2">to alternative facts at some point</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.990" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve just gone too far and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.670" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">back out but it does leave it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:24.810" style="s2">devastation</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:26.970" style="s2">you know she was not free of nightmares</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.810" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">and depression and and so forth after</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.970" end="00:06:32.970" style="s2">the war but anyway she and I became</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">quite close or so I thought she was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.970" end="00:06:38.669" style="s2">well-read person she loved classical</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:39.900" style="s2">music she loved nature we spent lots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.669" end="00:06:42.030" style="s2">time together</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.900" end="00:06:43.550" style="s2">even more time when I got a Fulbright in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.030" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">Germany</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.550" end="00:06:47.760" style="s2">let&#39;s humanize her a little bit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:54.290" style="s2">what kind of classical music did you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.760" end="00:06:57.150" style="s2">love well she loved she loved the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.290" end="00:07:00.690" style="s2">classical German composers particularly</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.150" end="00:07:04.730" style="s2">from from the north of Germany she also</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.690" end="00:07:04.730" style="s2">loved Handel she listened to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.970" end="00:07:12.150" style="s2">piano music German piano music I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.230" end="00:07:14.190" style="s2">trying to think if it&#39;s not coming to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.150" end="00:07:16.440" style="s2">right away now all of them that she</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.190" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">liked but you know she listened to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.440" end="00:07:24.210" style="s2">Beethoven and Bach and Mozart and all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">those so very clearly culturally high</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.210" end="00:07:30.930" style="s2">German culture absolutely and high</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:32.520" style="s2">German literature she passed on a number</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.930" end="00:07:39.770" style="s2">of the books that were her favorites to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.520" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">me and a lot of it you know well-known</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.770" end="00:07:45.720" style="s2">high german literature so when she then</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:51.060" style="s2">started tossing out shards of this old</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.720" end="00:07:53.550" style="s2">ideology during our meetings in her</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.060" end="00:07:55.020" style="s2">apartment in southern Germany where we</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.550" end="00:07:56.520" style="s2">were having a cup of tea or a cup of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.020" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">coffee and a piece of cake</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.520" end="00:08:02.210" style="s2">I was always stunned and shocked</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:04.880" style="s2">and didn&#39;t know what to do with it</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.210" end="00:08:10.230" style="s2">except to get up and go do the dishes</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.880" end="00:08:12.030" style="s2">and over time though doing that gets to</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.230" end="00:08:16.980" style="s2">you because you end up in the position</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.030" end="00:08:20.340" style="s2">of the bystander you end up feeling</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.980" end="00:08:22.320" style="s2">rotten inside when you don&#39;t stand up</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.340" end="00:08:24.480" style="s2">and say but that&#39;s wrong that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.320" end="00:08:27.330" style="s2">and this was particularly so when she</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.480" end="00:08:31.350" style="s2">tried to convince me that the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.330" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">was a plot by the international media to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.350" end="00:08:38.280" style="s2">keep Germans down so after the war and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:42.170" style="s2">was at that time studying international</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.280" end="00:08:44.730" style="s2">affairs later on I went on to study</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.170" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">german polish relations in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.730" end="00:08:49.050" style="s2">century at oxford university so i knew</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:50.490" style="s2">what she was telling me was of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.050" end="00:08:53.880" style="s2">completely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.490" end="00:08:55.620" style="s2">and yet I didn&#39;t say anything to her</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.880" end="00:08:59.370" style="s2">because I was so frightened of losing</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.620" end="00:09:02.070" style="s2">her affection that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.370" end="00:09:04.920" style="s2">conundrum that we can all worry about</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.070" end="00:09:06.690" style="s2">but you&#39;ve really been been through this</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.920" end="00:09:10.470" style="s2">where you&#39;re you realize that your</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.690" end="00:09:13.080" style="s2">deepest emotional and loyalty your</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.470" end="00:09:17.070" style="s2">loyalty connections are running to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.080" end="00:09:21.270" style="s2">people who are a mixture of pure evil</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.070" end="00:09:24.450" style="s2">and pure normal and goodness I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.270" end="00:09:26.850" style="s2">know an educated family from from</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.450" end="00:09:29.400" style="s2">everything I can discern a family where</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.850" end="00:09:32.960" style="s2">there was love and caring and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.400" end="00:09:35.370" style="s2">there&#39;s just this horrible festering I</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.960" end="00:09:36.810" style="s2">don&#39;t know what even to call it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.370" end="00:09:41.190" style="s2">it&#39;s just some stain that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.810" end="00:09:43.290" style="s2">removed yeah absolutely and which is why</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.190" end="00:09:47.330" style="s2">when I go out to schools and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.290" end="00:09:49.890" style="s2">this I take out an image which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.330" end="00:09:54.390" style="s2">painted by an artist in Michigan called</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.890" end="00:09:58.050" style="s2">Kimo and it&#39;s a face that has many</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:10:00.510" style="s2">different surfaces and dimensions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.050" end="00:10:02.970" style="s2">you can&#39;t really figure out where</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.510" end="00:10:04.770" style="s2">exactly the face is at some level but</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.970" end="00:10:08.250" style="s2">the point is that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.770" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">different facades and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.250" end="00:10:11.610" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:15.290" style="s2">speaking with my grandmother and when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.610" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">when I think about her today but our</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.290" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">conversations as time went by ended up</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:24.300" style="s2">troubling me a lot and particularly my</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:28.070" style="s2">own reactions troubled me I was also</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.300" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">troubled by the fact that I was was</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.070" end="00:10:38.100" style="s2">influenced by her perspective of Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.760" end="00:10:40.230" style="s2">people because you know she kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.100" end="00:10:43.320" style="s2">imparted in various ways that Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.230" end="00:10:45.810" style="s2">people were dangerous to us which was</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.320" end="00:10:47.580" style="s2">kind of a reaction of her generation</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.810" end="00:10:51.750" style="s2">because they were being punished for</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.580" end="00:10:53.400" style="s2">what they did in the Holocaust but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.750" end="00:10:57.510" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that at that time of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.400" end="00:11:00.740" style="s2">and I did a number of kind of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.510" end="00:11:04.019" style="s2">things to try to counteract that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.740" end="00:11:06.209" style="s2">inheritance of mine to really dig</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.019" end="00:11:08.790" style="s2">deep into myself and blow the whistle</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.209" end="00:11:11.339" style="s2">and say hey that is a totally insane</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.790" end="00:11:14.069" style="s2">idea Jewish people are not dangerous to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.339" end="00:11:15.660" style="s2">you we you have been taking your life in</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.069" end="00:11:20.549" style="s2">your own hands staying with us night</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.660" end="00:11:23.429" style="s2">after night Julie I don&#39;t feel that way</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.549" end="00:11:28.649" style="s2">at all I feel very well taken care of so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.429" end="00:11:30.799" style="s2">do you think your mom knew a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.649" end="00:11:34.199" style="s2">of this history that you somehow were</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.799" end="00:11:36.779" style="s2">screened out of or do you think she was</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.199" end="00:11:40.170" style="s2">also in the dark about it or is even the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.779" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">idea of how much we know about our</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.170" end="00:11:45.329" style="s2">histories is that word too sharp and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">that there&#39;s some need for a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.329" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">layered concept of knowing where you</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">sort of know something but maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:56.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know you don&#39;t keep a copy of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:57.540" style="s2">that&#39;s too crisp in your mind because</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.040" end="00:11:59.309" style="s2">it&#39;s too dangerous to have it in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.540" end="00:12:04.889" style="s2">state what&#39;s the right question I should</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.309" end="00:12:05.879" style="s2">be asking I think there may be we start</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.889" end="00:12:08.699" style="s2">with the facts do you think she had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.879" end="00:12:11.929" style="s2">lot of facts that you didn&#39;t have no she</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.699" end="00:12:15.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t I know that she didn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.929" end="00:12:19.379" style="s2">neither did her siblings and neither did</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.240" end="00:12:24.059" style="s2">their mother because my grandfather went</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.379" end="00:12:25.589" style="s2">to war in the autumn of 1939 and first</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.059" end="00:12:28.589" style="s2">of all not all of that is documented</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.589" end="00:12:30.589" style="s2">what those men did in Poland secondly a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.589" end="00:12:33.569" style="s2">lot of the documents were destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.589" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">thirdly they haven&#39;t seen any documents</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.569" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m the one who has bothered to go</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:41.459" style="s2">and find the documents and read them and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:43.799" style="s2">there were a lot of them and so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.459" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">probably know more than any family</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.799" end="00:12:48.660" style="s2">member because I&#39;ve read primary</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:51.480" style="s2">documents specifically about what my</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.660" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">grandfather was doing and also just what</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.480" end="00:12:54.689" style="s2">people around him were doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:56.699" style="s2">areas where he was can you name your</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.689" end="00:12:59.850" style="s2">grandfather so that we have a an</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.699" end="00:13:02.069" style="s2">individual I just call him oppa I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.850" end="00:13:04.230" style="s2">name his name because the people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.069" end="00:13:07.589" style="s2">there are people who are alive who bear</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.230" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">his last name and I I don&#39;t don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.589" end="00:13:12.700" style="s2">to make their lives difficult yeah oppa</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:18.940" style="s2">for the purposes of this podcast yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.700" end="00:13:22.269" style="s2">yes and as to these layers I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.940" end="00:13:27.100" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re right very right there in</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.269" end="00:13:30.010" style="s2">my experience for the sake of the family</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.100" end="00:13:35.560" style="s2">unit you look away from certain very</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.010" end="00:13:38.110" style="s2">glaring facts I did that I think my</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.560" end="00:13:40.600" style="s2">mother and her siblings did that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.110" end="00:13:46.120" style="s2">family has been our most important unit</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.600" end="00:13:49.180" style="s2">of survival since forever and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.120" end="00:13:58.029" style="s2">probably a natural knee-jerk type of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.180" end="00:14:01.390" style="s2">thing to do I think my or I know that my</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.029" end="00:14:05.470" style="s2">family knew that my grandfather was in</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.390" end="00:14:08.410" style="s2">the SS because later on I met an uncle</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.470" end="00:14:12.010" style="s2">so he was the oldest of the siblings I</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.410" end="00:14:15.490" style="s2">met him in Paraguay so he oppa</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.010" end="00:14:19.899" style="s2">not only volunteered in 1939 but went</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.490" end="00:14:23.589" style="s2">straight for the SS he was he joined the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.899" end="00:14:25.899" style="s2">SS back in 1934 already oh wow so he</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.589" end="00:14:28.060" style="s2">joined the mounted SS I think what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.899" end="00:14:31.209" style="s2">should remember is that the SS and 34</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.060" end="00:14:33.790" style="s2">was a political primarily political</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.209" end="00:14:37.390" style="s2">organization and the waffen-ss of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.790" end="00:14:40.990" style="s2">military wing of the SS emerged out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.390" end="00:14:43.180" style="s2">this as the 30s went on but he joined as</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.990" end="00:14:46.649" style="s2">one of Hitler&#39;s political soldiers and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.180" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">specifically the mounted SS in 1934</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.649" end="00:14:53.620" style="s2">mainly because well the mounted SS was</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:58.199" style="s2">very prestigious the organization was</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.620" end="00:15:01.079" style="s2">also the mounted SS was created out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.199" end="00:15:05.110" style="s2">writing associations that were drafted</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.079" end="00:15:07.000" style="s2">into the organization so you some people</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.110" end="00:15:11.589" style="s2">argue that they didn&#39;t have a choice but</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.000" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">it&#39;s more complicated than that but so</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.589" end="00:15:16.690" style="s2">he he was pumped full of propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:20.350" style="s2">throughout the 1930s because he was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.690" end="00:15:22.620" style="s2">member of the SS throughout so that by</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.350" end="00:15:25.460" style="s2">the time he got into Poland he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.620" end="00:15:30.290" style="s2">really quite full of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.460" end="00:15:32.810" style="s2">and you know Hitler and Himmler and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.290" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">other Nazi leaders didn&#39;t really give</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.810" end="00:15:38.870" style="s2">very precise instructions to the SS when</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:41.000" style="s2">they went into Poland because they</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.870" end="00:15:43.070" style="s2">trusted that they&#39;d pump these people so</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.000" end="00:15:46.250" style="s2">full of propaganda that if they just</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.070" end="00:15:48.170" style="s2">Unleashed them they would fight a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.250" end="00:15:50.330" style="s2">brutal racial war which is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.170" end="00:15:51.890" style="s2">they did and with no documents</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.330" end="00:15:54.980" style="s2">indicating that they had been instructed</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.890" end="00:15:57.200" style="s2">to do so yeah so that in part and I</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.070" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">he just has to say this idly to himself</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.070" end="00:16:36.770" style="s2">and then he knows what happens and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:41.029" style="s2">there is no record so in effect there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.770" end="00:16:45.140" style="s2">no trigger pulling finger from the</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.400" end="00:19:07.230" style="s2">much although I was very affected by it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.670" end="00:19:09.980" style="s2">because these types of secrets when</p>

<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:28.560" style="s2">I didn&#39;t eat most of the time and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.150" end="00:19:33.240" style="s2">that was the way it expressed itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.560" end="00:19:34.650" style="s2">there in fact Pia and I worked out that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.240" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">we didn&#39;t see each other that much</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.650" end="00:19:39.990" style="s2">probably because I was hiding out a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:42.600" style="s2">from people because I I I had pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.990" end="00:19:46.950" style="s2">serious eating disorders but these were</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.600" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">all connected to a feeling of low</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.950" end="00:19:51.300" style="s2">self-worth that were connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:55.080" style="s2">shame that I went around with so I knew</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.300" end="00:19:56.550" style="s2">that there was something wrong my</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.080" end="00:20:00.630" style="s2">relationship with my mother was</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.550" end="00:20:05.430" style="s2">extremely troubled and as the years went</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.630" end="00:20:09.030" style="s2">by our family relationships in fact all</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.430" end="00:20:11.880" style="s2">of them became quite troubled because</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.030" end="00:20:15.450" style="s2">when you have something like this in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.880" end="00:20:16.950" style="s2">family that the adults knew something</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.450" end="00:20:21.060" style="s2">about they didn&#39;t know the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.950" end="00:20:23.190" style="s2">but they knew enough and that they try</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.060" end="00:20:24.510" style="s2">to keep from themselves it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.190" end="00:20:26.040" style="s2">they&#39;re keeping it from the next</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.510" end="00:20:27.690" style="s2">generation they&#39;re trying to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.040" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">away from themselves because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.690" end="00:20:33.570" style="s2">want to think about it then it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:35.690" style="s2">strangle their relationships and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.570" end="00:20:41.240" style="s2">was already going on at that time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.690" end="00:20:45.720" style="s2">that affected me at a cellular level and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.240" end="00:20:47.370" style="s2">so when I returned to Europe remember I</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.720" end="00:20:49.290" style="s2">only spent three years going to college</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.370" end="00:20:53.130" style="s2">in the u.s. that was my American</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.290" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">experience okay then I returned to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.130" end="00:20:58.200" style="s2">Europe to do a Fulbright and then went</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:21:00.870" style="s2">to Oxford and of course then I went back</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.200" end="00:21:03.240" style="s2">into the European realm yeah and of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.870" end="00:21:07.500" style="s2">course got closer and closer and closer</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.240" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">to this and I wasn&#39;t that surprised or</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.500" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">today I&#39;m not surprised in retrospect</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:15.510" style="s2">that my mother was a bit so-so about my</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">learning German because learning the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.510" end="00:21:23.670" style="s2">German language was a path into this</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:25.290" style="s2">history without it I would not have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.670" end="00:21:27.110" style="s2">able to do this could have gone through</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.290" end="00:21:31.230" style="s2">the archives No</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.110" end="00:21:33.090" style="s2">so I kept getting closer and closer and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.230" end="00:21:35.070" style="s2">closer to this history all the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.090" end="00:21:37.890" style="s2">without really knowing that I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.070" end="00:21:40.230" style="s2">it but I think there was something in me</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.890" end="00:21:43.230" style="s2">that was so desperate about what was</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.230" end="00:21:45.690" style="s2">happening in my family because I love my</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.230" end="00:21:47.550" style="s2">family it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t love my</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.690" end="00:21:49.560" style="s2">family that I&#39;ve done this work which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.550" end="00:21:53.110" style="s2">what some family members may think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.560" end="00:21:55.510" style="s2">because I do love my family</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.110" end="00:21:58.570" style="s2">and I realized that there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.510" end="00:22:00.700" style="s2">little little bit of pain in order to in</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.570" end="00:22:03.280" style="s2">order to try to allow some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.700" end="00:22:06.520" style="s2">healing to occur well Julie you were at</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.280" end="00:22:08.230" style="s2">Oxford after college in the States and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.520" end="00:22:09.940" style="s2">think you&#39;ve picked up some British</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.230" end="00:22:12.820" style="s2">understatement when you say that they do</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.940" end="00:22:16.980" style="s2">a little bit of pain it sounds like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.820" end="00:22:20.380" style="s2">hacked a whole lot more than that well I</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.980" end="00:22:22.270" style="s2">mean I&#39;m happy to sort of glance at it</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.380" end="00:22:27.910" style="s2">using our peripheral vision but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.270" end="00:22:36.760" style="s2">talking about an unbelievable burden yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.910" end="00:22:38.410" style="s2">it&#39;s an unbelievable burden but you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.760" end="00:22:40.900" style="s2">that well let&#39;s put it this way there</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.410" end="00:22:43.630" style="s2">were it was interesting to me that when</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.900" end="00:22:49.150" style="s2">I decided to actively start to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.630" end="00:22:51.190" style="s2">this work in April 2010 as I was moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.150" end="00:22:54.790" style="s2">towards the decision to go towards the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.190" end="00:22:58.060" style="s2">archives and really exercise my academic</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.790" end="00:23:00.310" style="s2">training there were quite a number of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.060" end="00:23:04.360" style="s2">people around me who knew what I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.310" end="00:23:06.460" style="s2">about to do who said to me that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.360" end="00:23:09.990" style="s2">necessary why do you have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.460" end="00:23:14.980" style="s2">that&#39;s passed let it be passed it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.990" end="00:23:20.620" style="s2">you know they were frightened and some</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.980" end="00:23:22.690" style="s2">of them really were extremely animated</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.620" end="00:23:24.610" style="s2">when they tried to convince me not to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.690" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">this these are well-meaning people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.610" end="00:23:34.540" style="s2">want the best for me and but what I knew</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:37.480" style="s2">all the time was that no that is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.540" end="00:23:40.840" style="s2">going to prolong the suffering not only</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.480" end="00:23:44.050" style="s2">for me but for other people for my</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.840" end="00:23:46.930" style="s2">children my children were a very big</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.050" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">motivator so do you think that the</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:54.280" style="s2">were just waiting you because they knew</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.280" end="00:24:00.730" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t know what you were</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.540" end="00:24:02.500" style="s2">gonna find some people I think most</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.730" end="00:24:05.560" style="s2">people thought I would find something</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.500" end="00:24:08.170" style="s2">because they knew me too well</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.560" end="00:24:10.090" style="s2">knew how troubled I had been they knew</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.170" end="00:24:11.890" style="s2">these different pieces of my background</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.090" end="00:24:13.900" style="s2">it was as though they already knew and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.890" end="00:24:16.150" style="s2">just wanted to put on the brakes because</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.900" end="00:24:19.860" style="s2">they didn&#39;t want me to go into that pain</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.150" end="00:24:22.930" style="s2">that you surename which is a caring</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.860" end="00:24:25.380" style="s2">response at the same time I also think</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.930" end="00:24:29.050" style="s2">that there is a selfish dimension to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.380" end="00:24:31.240" style="s2">because there is this idea in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.050" end="00:24:33.490" style="s2">society that looking back and looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.240" end="00:24:36.190" style="s2">particularly looking back at what our</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.490" end="00:24:38.920" style="s2">ancestors did and those before us did is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.190" end="00:24:44.050" style="s2">a dangerous thing it&#39;s in the myths and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.920" end="00:24:47.350" style="s2">legends of Western culture right and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.050" end="00:24:50.560" style="s2">I think there was a little element in</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.350" end="00:24:54.250" style="s2">that of trying to spare themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.560" end="00:24:56.770" style="s2">well which I sensed and it annoyed me</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.250" end="00:24:58.780" style="s2">greatly at the same time I tried to keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.770" end="00:25:01.150" style="s2">in my mind that these are people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.780" end="00:25:05.580" style="s2">care about me there was one person in</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.150" end="00:25:08.650" style="s2">particular who was a an elderly</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.580" end="00:25:11.320" style="s2">professor of German literature a scholar</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.650" end="00:25:16.990" style="s2">of Moses Mendelssohn a very great Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.320" end="00:25:20.440" style="s2">scholar who I knew from Wellesley and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.990" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">went to see her just before I went to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.440" end="00:25:28.840" style="s2">the archives she lived in a wolfenbüttel</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:31.410" style="s2">a town not too far from Berlin and she</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.840" end="00:25:33.880" style="s2">was 92 at the time and could barely walk</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.410" end="00:25:36.520" style="s2">yet she came with me to the train</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.880" end="00:25:39.580" style="s2">station and stood there and stared at me</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.520" end="00:25:43.180" style="s2">and she had she had survived the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.580" end="00:25:46.690" style="s2">Holocaust because her father had sent</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.180" end="00:25:48.760" style="s2">her away to Britain in the late 30s and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.690" end="00:25:53.020" style="s2">she stood there and looked at me and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.760" end="00:25:55.960" style="s2">said please don&#39;t do this because she</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.020" end="00:25:59.940" style="s2">knew my family very well and realized</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.960" end="00:26:02.980" style="s2">that I would find something all right I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.940" end="00:26:05.310" style="s2">got asked what did you find and and when</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.980" end="00:26:09.940" style="s2">did you start finding specifics that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.310" end="00:26:12.540" style="s2">really caused cause the story to advance</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.940" end="00:26:17.290" style="s2">and friend caused you to change yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.540" end="00:26:18.490" style="s2">well the first find was at the German</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.290" end="00:26:24.690" style="s2">federal archives</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.490" end="00:26:28.809" style="s2">was about a hundred pages which included</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.690" end="00:26:33.010" style="s2">mostly information about my grandparents</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.809" end="00:26:36.160" style="s2">it was my grandparents application to</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.010" end="00:26:38.260" style="s2">marry as an SS couple which required</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.160" end="00:26:41.610" style="s2">them to demonstrate their racial</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:44.350" style="s2">suitability so they went through medical</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.610" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">examinations and there were photographs</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.350" end="00:26:52.150" style="s2">of them from all angles and there you</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:55.780" style="s2">know life accounts written by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.150" end="00:26:57.550" style="s2">but there was also you know information</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.780" end="00:26:59.080" style="s2">about all the places where my</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.550" end="00:27:04.630" style="s2">grandfather had been stationed in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.080" end="00:27:06.550" style="s2">occupied Poland so so from there I went</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.630" end="00:27:09.700" style="s2">to a number of archives found as</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.550" end="00:27:12.190" style="s2">denazification papers which</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.700" end="00:27:13.870" style="s2">denazification was a process that all</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.190" end="00:27:18.309" style="s2">people who joined the party had to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.870" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">through after the war and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.309" end="00:27:22.020" style="s2">declare what they had been up to and of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:25.720" style="s2">course most of them regarded as a joke</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.020" end="00:27:28.000" style="s2">anyway eventually I ended up in Poland</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.720" end="00:27:33.660" style="s2">at the Institute of national remembrance</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.000" end="00:27:36.540" style="s2">in Poznan where they handed me a wad of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.660" end="00:27:40.929" style="s2">documents that were eyewitnesses of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.540" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">people who had experienced what my</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.929" end="00:27:45.580" style="s2">grandfather and his comrades had done in</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:50.140" style="s2">in local areas and these were</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.580" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">eyewitnesses recorded in 1946 so they</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.140" end="00:27:57.640" style="s2">were fairly fresh accounts fresh in</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:28:01.630" style="s2">people&#39;s minds and there I saw the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.640" end="00:28:04.780" style="s2">accounts of the brutality and of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.630" end="00:28:09.100" style="s2">beatings and the way the way that he</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.780" end="00:28:11.380" style="s2">behaved and how bad I mean I should say</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.100" end="00:28:14.860" style="s2">just so you know something about how I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.380" end="00:28:17.890" style="s2">react I can&#39;t in general go to holocaust</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.860" end="00:28:21.390" style="s2">films yeah it&#39;s not a topic that I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.890" end="00:28:24.910" style="s2">even almost talk about it&#39;s too hard but</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.390" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">I&#39;m asking you because this is a journey</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.910" end="00:28:29.830" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been on where I think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:31.810" style="s2">the level of pain and the level of</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.830" end="00:28:34.330" style="s2">bravery and the uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.810" end="00:28:36.940" style="s2">and the complex is what animates the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.330" end="00:28:46.330" style="s2">story and so I&#39;m willing to risk it what</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.940" end="00:28:49.150" style="s2">do you find well probably what made me</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.330" end="00:28:51.220" style="s2">just sit there and stop and look</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.150" end="00:28:53.110" style="s2">completely paralyzed when I sat in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.220" end="00:28:56.890" style="s2">Institute of national remembrance was</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.110" end="00:29:06.550" style="s2">was um you know the the information</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.890" end="00:29:10.420" style="s2">about beating of Labor&#39;s to to to now</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.550" end="00:29:15.610" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of a Swedish word to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.420" end="00:29:18.010" style="s2">unconsciousness on a regular basis then</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.610" end="00:29:21.220" style="s2">in those documents I did not find</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.010" end="00:29:24.160" style="s2">evidence of murder but there were other</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.220" end="00:29:26.590" style="s2">documents I found later on that pointed</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.160" end="00:29:29.500" style="s2">to that because he would not have tried</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.590" end="00:29:33.070" style="s2">to leave for Brazil later on</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.500" end="00:29:35.380" style="s2">had he not murdered anyone because in</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.070" end="00:29:38.620" style="s2">order to be put on trial you had to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.380" end="00:29:41.020" style="s2">murdered somebody and these would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.620" end="00:29:44.590" style="s2">been the local landowner so I did find</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.020" end="00:29:46.720" style="s2">some evidence of that but still indirect</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.590" end="00:29:49.090" style="s2">you&#39;re spared any kind of direct account</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:50.380" style="s2">of it oh no I would wasn&#39;t spirit in its</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.090" end="00:29:52.360" style="s2">period a direct account there were</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.380" end="00:29:58.750" style="s2">direct accounts of beating people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.360" end="00:30:04.110" style="s2">total unconsciousness no but I did find</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.750" end="00:30:08.620" style="s2">evidence later on of of engagement in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.110" end="00:30:10.420" style="s2">really awful episode where a small</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.620" end="00:30:14.590" style="s2">number of these estate owners would</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.420" end="00:30:18.070" style="s2">drive to drive the existing landowners</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.590" end="00:30:19.480" style="s2">to a nearby forest tell them to run</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.070" end="00:30:24.280" style="s2">towards a trench that they dug</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.480" end="00:30:27.460" style="s2">themselves and shoot them well so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.280" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">what I I learned about later on as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.460" end="00:30:37.210" style="s2">and so there was evidence of that which</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:41.560" style="s2">wasn&#39;t confirmed but it was it was there</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.210" end="00:30:43.540" style="s2">on paper and and really that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.560" end="00:30:44.800" style="s2">would have got him to to leave so</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.540" end="00:30:47.140" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.800" end="00:30:53.860" style="s2">to me it would seem very unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.140" end="00:30:56.740" style="s2">he that wasn&#39;t true at all so so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.860" end="00:30:59.470" style="s2">there were some names of people in those</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.740" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">documents of the the people who had</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.470" end="00:31:03.940" style="s2">given testimony were named in those</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:08.440" style="s2">documents from the Polish National</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.940" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">Archive so I set out to try to find see</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.440" end="00:31:12.340" style="s2">if I could find some of those families</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">not expecting to find anyone because we</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.340" end="00:31:17.020" style="s2">all know that after that the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:21.880" style="s2">Union came in and redistributed</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.020" end="00:31:23.770" style="s2">everybody and so I really didn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.880" end="00:31:27.250" style="s2">to find any of these families in these</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.770" end="00:31:30.580" style="s2">places but to my great surprise with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.250" end="00:31:33.250" style="s2">help of a wonderful young Polish</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.580" end="00:31:34.929" style="s2">archivist and historian who could see</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.250" end="00:31:39.429" style="s2">how distraught I was and just simply</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.929" end="00:31:42.630" style="s2">decided to join me found five families</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.429" end="00:31:45.429" style="s2">over different visits to Poland and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.630" end="00:31:47.470" style="s2">those meetings were very important they</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.429" end="00:31:50.370" style="s2">were very important to me I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:54.370" style="s2">how important they were to those people</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.370" end="00:31:55.929" style="s2">but to me they were important and my my</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.370" end="00:31:58.750" style="s2">friend who drove with me who&#39;s a young</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.929" end="00:32:00.010" style="s2">pole whose family had also suffered in</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.750" end="00:32:02.760" style="s2">the Second World War</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.010" end="00:32:08.860" style="s2">said trust me this is important to them</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.760" end="00:32:13.590" style="s2">so I would say that for me those</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.860" end="00:32:17.650" style="s2">meetings showed me why I was doing this</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.590" end="00:32:21.220" style="s2">work because what I realized in</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.650" end="00:32:25.510" style="s2">retrospect I was doing was looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.220" end="00:32:31.059" style="s2">transformational dynamic which is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.510" end="00:32:35.500" style="s2">portal which is how do we take</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.059" end="00:32:37.510" style="s2">everything that we know about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.500" end="00:32:39.640" style="s2">horrible things human beings have done</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.510" end="00:32:43.990" style="s2">to one another and their own experiences</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.640" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">of that perhaps and transform it into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.990" end="00:32:51.190" style="s2">force that&#39;s powerful enough for us to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:53.770" style="s2">take another path and those meetings</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.190" end="00:32:57.179" style="s2">provided one answer there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.770" end="00:33:00.929" style="s2">answers do you think it gave any relief</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.179" end="00:33:02.909" style="s2">to those people that you were meeting</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.929" end="00:33:06.679" style="s2">with do you think there was a double</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.909" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">portal just to riff off you riffing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.679" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">I can&#39;t answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:14.820" style="s2">all I can explain to you is a few of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:15.979" style="s2">reactions and then you can decide</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.820" end="00:33:21.629" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.979" end="00:33:25.169" style="s2">so the first meeting was with a person</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.629" end="00:33:27.960" style="s2">who didn&#39;t want to shake my hand because</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.169" end="00:33:30.869" style="s2">his memories of what my my grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.960" end="00:33:32.789" style="s2">was name was recognized instantly by all</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.869" end="00:33:35.339" style="s2">these people by the way no one had to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.789" end="00:33:38.460" style="s2">remind them of who he was which is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.339" end="00:33:40.859" style="s2">chilling phrase yeah which is incredible</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.460" end="00:33:42.029" style="s2">whatever it is over seven decades later</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.859" end="00:33:46.229" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.029" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">so so he didn&#39;t want to shake my hand</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.229" end="00:33:53.099" style="s2">and he was very sick he was dying this</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:57.419" style="s2">man and but he was conscious and able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.099" end="00:33:58.919" style="s2">register who I was and my friend the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.419" end="00:34:00.149" style="s2">archivist said I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.919" end="00:34:02.580" style="s2">much point in carrying on with this</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.149" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">conversation because he doesn&#39;t want you</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.580" end="00:34:07.649" style="s2">know he experienced you imagine but what</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:11.190" style="s2">was in my mind was I I must shake this</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.649" end="00:34:13.619" style="s2">man&#39;s hand I need to show some form of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.190" end="00:34:15.899" style="s2">compassion I can&#39;t ask for forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.619" end="00:34:19.169" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t commit the crime but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.899" end="00:34:21.659" style="s2">want to show humanity and compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.169" end="00:34:23.240" style="s2">I did eventually take his hand and shake</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.659" end="00:34:26.909" style="s2">it and he looked completely bewildered</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.240" end="00:34:30.869" style="s2">he didn&#39;t think that someone like me was</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.909" end="00:34:34.349" style="s2">capable I think of shaking his hand and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.869" end="00:34:36.510" style="s2">showing compassion the next person I</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.349" end="00:34:39.480" style="s2">went to see was a person who had</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.510" end="00:34:41.579" style="s2">dementia and was in his 90s so he</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.480" end="00:34:43.619" style="s2">couldn&#39;t remember what happened</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.579" end="00:34:48.329" style="s2">yesterday but he remembered things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.619" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">happened over 70 years ago and his</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.329" end="00:34:51.389" style="s2">great-granddaughter was there and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">started shouting my grandfather&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.389" end="00:34:57.270" style="s2">into his ear at which his reaction was</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:59.130" style="s2">to go back to an episode in time in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.270" end="00:35:00.930" style="s2">which he was hiding in a barn because</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.130" end="00:35:04.170" style="s2">some people were being shocked and there</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.930" end="00:35:06.119" style="s2">was violence going on outside I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.170" end="00:35:09.000" style="s2">know exactly what the details of it were</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.119" end="00:35:12.690" style="s2">but you could see he was recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.000" end="00:35:15.270" style="s2">moment in time and so I begged everyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.690" end="00:35:18.150" style="s2">present to turn switch this off I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.270" end="00:35:20.490" style="s2">want this to go on and I decided that my</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.150" end="00:35:23.190" style="s2">journey was just too selfish journey it</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.490" end="00:35:25.380" style="s2">was just for me you know to somehow take</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.190" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">care of my shame and all that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.380" end="00:35:31.560" style="s2">said to my friend the the archivist we</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:32.760" style="s2">must stop now this is enough because</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.560" end="00:35:36.030" style="s2">this is just bringing back bad memories</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.760" end="00:35:38.010" style="s2">for people and he said no believe me we</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.030" end="00:35:42.930" style="s2">have to go on so there was a third guy</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.010" end="00:35:47.430" style="s2">we we met who was what healthy a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.930" end="00:35:51.240" style="s2">85 year old yeah who had a very nice</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.430" end="00:35:55.260" style="s2">garden as it happened his father was</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.240" end="00:35:57.630" style="s2">most likely my grandfather&#39;s gardener on</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.260" end="00:36:00.750" style="s2">this estate where he his parents had</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.630" end="00:36:04.200" style="s2">worked and he&#39;d been beaten over the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.750" end="00:36:05.850" style="s2">head when he was a 10 year old and my</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.200" end="00:36:07.470" style="s2">grandfather had passed him and he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.850" end="00:36:09.750" style="s2">forgotten to doff his hat so he had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.470" end="00:36:12.660" style="s2">scar over his right eye well waste like</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.750" end="00:36:14.490" style="s2">it he was beaten directly by your</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.660" end="00:36:16.770" style="s2">grandfather so that this your</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.490" end="00:36:20.420" style="s2">grandfather&#39;s mark it was still visible</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.770" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">on his on his head yes they defy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.420" end="00:36:25.560" style="s2">and when I when I realized this I sat</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:30.990" style="s2">there and I listened to him for several</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.560" end="00:36:33.510" style="s2">hours and I felt awful and but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.990" end="00:36:36.710" style="s2">really very much to say of course what</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.510" end="00:36:39.480" style="s2">should I say I was there to listen and</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.710" end="00:36:42.300" style="s2">there was a feeling welling up in me of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.480" end="00:36:44.210" style="s2">wanting to beg for forgiveness because</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.300" end="00:36:47.130" style="s2">that was really all I felt I could offer</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.210" end="00:36:48.450" style="s2">but he realized that without my saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.130" end="00:36:50.370" style="s2">very much he was a smart very</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.450" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">intelligent person emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.370" end="00:36:55.260" style="s2">intelligent person and he stood up and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">took my lower arms and shook me up and</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.260" end="00:37:06.510" style="s2">said this wasn&#39;t your fault you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:09.300" style="s2">do anything so I want you to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.510" end="00:37:12.060" style="s2">into my garden and I want you to enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.300" end="00:37:14.570" style="s2">my garden and furthermore I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.060" end="00:37:14.570" style="s2">enjoy your life</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.250" end="00:37:19.360" style="s2">and then I went out there it stood there</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.020" end="00:37:21.760" style="s2">and he and his wife and his daughter was</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.360" end="00:37:24.670" style="s2">also around his grown daughter and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:26.380" style="s2">they had been very kind to me served me</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.670" end="00:37:28.810" style="s2">cherries picked from their cherry trees</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.380" end="00:37:30.910" style="s2">in his garden and anyway I went outside</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.810" end="00:37:34.420" style="s2">and stood there and did exactly as he</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.910" end="00:37:35.860" style="s2">told me to do and he and his wife came</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.420" end="00:37:37.420" style="s2">and stood next to me and it was almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.860" end="00:37:39.220" style="s2">like we were holding hands we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.420" end="00:37:41.940" style="s2">touching our hands together and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.220" end="00:37:47.620" style="s2">were we were just silent together and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.940" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">later on I thought well of course it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.620" end="00:37:52.570" style="s2">happened right there this</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">transformational dynamic happened right</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.570" end="00:38:01.870" style="s2">there it transformed everything that he</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:04.420" style="s2">knew and that I knew about our violent</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.870" end="00:38:08.620" style="s2">past and what we had experienced into</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.420" end="00:38:12.820" style="s2">something else and what he what it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.620" end="00:38:16.110" style="s2">it for me was that shame became energy</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.820" end="00:38:21.220" style="s2">it became responsibility it became a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.110" end="00:38:27.270" style="s2">feeling that you need and have to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.220" end="00:38:32.680" style="s2">something with this get moving and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.270" end="00:38:35.320" style="s2">without him and without that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.680" end="00:38:37.870" style="s2">have been able to carry on really no I</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.320" end="00:38:39.730" style="s2">would have given up because it would</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.870" end="00:38:42.940" style="s2">just have been miserable and horrible</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.730" end="00:38:44.950" style="s2">and terrible well the thing is it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.940" end="00:38:47.140" style="s2">disruptive because I think there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.950" end="00:38:51.460" style="s2">many different layers going on in the in</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.140" end="00:38:53.380" style="s2">a story like this that most people have</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.460" end="00:38:56.080" style="s2">never been called upon to have to pull</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.380" end="00:38:58.080" style="s2">to pull apart so many different layers</p>

<p begin="00:39:05.980" end="00:39:14.380" style="s2">have all the words that we need and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.200" end="00:39:16.390" style="s2">idea that for example two people could</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.380" end="00:39:19.240" style="s2">have been harmed let&#39;s say by the same</p>

<p begin="00:39:19.240" end="00:39:26.350" style="s2">more might be much more capable of</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.369" end="00:40:51.430" style="s2">hmm that&#39;s a very very good question um</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.250" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">on one hand I think that people who come</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.430" end="00:40:56.830" style="s2">to events to listen to me by their own</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:58.390" style="s2">free choice there are events were at</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.830" end="00:41:02.920" style="s2">schools and things where they have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.390" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">attend they don&#39;t have a choice but the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.920" end="00:41:09.940" style="s2">ones where they have a choice and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:11.740" style="s2">register to attend so most people have</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.940" end="00:41:13.900" style="s2">of course something there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.740" end="00:41:17.859" style="s2">them that attracts them to this and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.900" end="00:41:19.510" style="s2">that there&#39;s some level of reflection</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.859" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">that has taken place that is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.510" end="00:41:26.830" style="s2">them there something in their personal</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:29.380" style="s2">histories usually at the same time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.830" end="00:41:33.250" style="s2">always surprised that after I give these</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.380" end="00:41:34.900" style="s2">talks often people come up to me to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.250" end="00:41:38.020" style="s2">express their thanks for the work that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.900" end="00:41:41.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve done but then they&#39;ll add something</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.020" end="00:41:45.300" style="s2">to that that demonstrates to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.550" end="00:41:49.210" style="s2">there&#39;s no way they could really</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.300" end="00:41:51.850" style="s2">understand the the very complex dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.210" end="00:41:56.710" style="s2">of what I what I have encountered</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.850" end="00:41:59.830" style="s2">because people then fall back on terms</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.710" end="00:42:03.700" style="s2">like you know forgiveness and guilts and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.830" end="00:42:06.840" style="s2">things like that which to me are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.700" end="00:42:11.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.840" end="00:42:16.420" style="s2">vocabulary that&#39;s been developed around</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.130" end="00:42:19.330" style="s2">this history and the descendants of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.420" end="00:42:20.920" style="s2">history whether whether they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.330" end="00:42:22.540" style="s2">descendants of the victims or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.920" end="00:42:24.670" style="s2">descendants of the perpetrators or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.540" end="00:42:28.990" style="s2">descendants of the bystanders there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.670" end="00:42:33.460" style="s2">whole vocabulary and to me it&#39;s just old</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.990" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">stuff that we fall back on because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.460" end="00:42:41.230" style="s2">not prepared to go deeper we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:44.740" style="s2">prepared to to let ourselves in to other</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.230" end="00:42:45.790" style="s2">levels other experiences and so when</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.740" end="00:42:49.320" style="s2">people start to talk to me about</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.790" end="00:42:52.090" style="s2">forgiveness I try to say to them yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.320" end="00:42:54.190" style="s2">well I&#39;ve already explained to you that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.090" end="00:42:57.670" style="s2">I was seeking forgiveness but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.190" end="00:42:59.500" style="s2">rat wheel it didn&#39;t lead anywhere didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.670" end="00:43:03.160" style="s2">lead forward and it didn&#39;t lead forward</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.500" end="00:43:05.770" style="s2">because for for me to ask my</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.160" end="00:43:08.710" style="s2">grandparents victims for forgiveness is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.770" end="00:43:10.660" style="s2">is it&#39;s not doesn&#39;t lead us anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.710" end="00:43:13.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lead me anywhere which is what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.660" end="00:43:15.790" style="s2">had to learn from one of his victims and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.030" end="00:43:19.060" style="s2">and so but people fall back on this and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.790" end="00:43:24.040" style="s2">other other aspects of vocabulary that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.060" end="00:43:25.720" style="s2">are that we formed around this the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.040" end="00:43:27.790" style="s2">legacy of this history to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.720" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">protect ourselves from the pain of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.790" end="00:43:34.390" style="s2">somehow I think that&#39;s my read on it</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:37.270" style="s2">because when you get into the into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.390" end="00:43:40.660" style="s2">into the pain of it and really get your</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.270" end="00:43:44.440" style="s2">hands dirty you start to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.660" end="00:43:45.910" style="s2">other things well you know I have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.440" end="00:43:47.880" style="s2">tell you that one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.910" end="00:43:50.640" style="s2">been very weird about this you</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.880" end="00:43:54.599" style="s2">is I&#39;ve used the opportunity of your</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:56.970" style="s2">visit with us to explore how many</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.599" end="00:43:59.460" style="s2">different dimensions of reaction I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.970" end="00:44:00.660" style="s2">myself am having and you know you and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.460" end="00:44:03.420" style="s2">have been talking about this a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.660" end="00:44:05.730" style="s2">bit so I don&#39;t mind trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.420" end="00:44:08.730" style="s2">it but just it&#39;s fascinating to become</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.730" end="00:44:11.130" style="s2">metacognitive and look at your own kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.730" end="00:44:15.480" style="s2">of automated reactions to a story like</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.130" end="00:44:16.769" style="s2">this on the one hand I&#39;m just really</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.480" end="00:44:19.019" style="s2">impressed by the work that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.769" end="00:44:21.059" style="s2">with this book and telling this tale and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.019" end="00:44:23.430" style="s2">I think it&#39;s it&#39;s really important and</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.059" end="00:44:25.890" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to this to tell these</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.430" end="00:44:29.069" style="s2">stories right at the end of living</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.890" end="00:44:32.190" style="s2">memory of the actual Holocaust so it</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.069" end="00:44:34.440" style="s2">looks hugely impressed second of all</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.190" end="00:44:36.089" style="s2">just to modern people hanging out having</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.440" end="00:44:38.849" style="s2">a great conversation it&#39;s been great</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.089" end="00:44:41.250" style="s2">talking to you third maybe I have this</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.849" end="00:44:44.849" style="s2">attitude of I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m stuck</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.250" end="00:44:47.009" style="s2">with the granddaughter of an SS myapp do</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.849" end="00:44:49.589" style="s2">you understand which is like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.009" end="00:44:51.450" style="s2">lineage to lineage level which is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.589" end="00:44:53.849" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not just me and you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.450" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">like the Jewish people and and their</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.849" end="00:44:56.460" style="s2">murderers you know are in under the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:44:59.630" style="s2">roof</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.460" end="00:45:03.089" style="s2">and then you know there&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.630" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">selfish thing which is this is really</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.089" end="00:45:14.130" style="s2">important for for I think for us Jews to</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:16.460" style="s2">do some hard work which is Germany was</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.130" end="00:45:18.900" style="s2">one of the most impressive cultures</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.460" end="00:45:22.619" style="s2">anywhere in terms of its intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.900" end="00:45:25.670" style="s2">artistic contributions and I am all</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.619" end="00:45:29.279" style="s2">wrapped up in the incredible</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.670" end="00:45:32.970" style="s2">contribution to world history that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.279" end="00:45:36.259" style="s2">German and my belief is that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.970" end="00:45:38.789" style="s2">safe to have a very guilty Germany</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.259" end="00:45:41.099" style="s2">perhaps as we saw with the refugee</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.789" end="00:45:43.619" style="s2">crisis where you&#39;re making sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.099" end="00:45:46.799" style="s2">almost performative decisions to assuage</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.619" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">guilt that it&#39;s the wrong tool to it to</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.799" end="00:45:54.119" style="s2">attack the problem on the other hand you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:55.980" style="s2">don&#39;t want a super triumphalist Germany</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.119" end="00:45:57.750" style="s2">to emerge and say none of this was real</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.980" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">and the Germans have been kicked to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.750" end="00:46:04.440" style="s2">curb so you&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:06.630" style="s2">in my opinion should the Jewish people</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.440" end="00:46:10.910" style="s2">use the end of living memory of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.630" end="00:46:14.250" style="s2">Holocaust to finally extend extend a</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.910" end="00:46:17.089" style="s2">warmer hand up to Germany not that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.250" end="00:46:19.849" style="s2">Germany is suffering economically I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.089" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">but Germany was also just the seat of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.849" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">unbelievable genius at a level that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:27.030" style="s2">we&#39;ve scarcely seen in the world I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:28.589" style="s2">you have the Italian Renaissance but</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.030" end="00:46:33.589" style="s2">there was a period of German</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.589" end="00:46:37.410" style="s2">contribution which was unparalleled and</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.589" end="00:46:40.559" style="s2">I think that we have to do this really</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.410" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">hard work that I&#39;m sort of not prepared</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.559" end="00:46:50.130" style="s2">to do and we talked about a very weird</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:52.230" style="s2">metaphor now I wonder if we can draw you</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.130" end="00:46:56.339" style="s2">in we were talking about how people get</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.230" end="00:46:58.380" style="s2">angry that the the untrue story gets</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.339" end="00:47:02.579" style="s2">disturbed when you do this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.380" end="00:47:05.339" style="s2">research and I went into our one of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.579" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">smartphones and I found this triptych of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.339" end="00:47:09.960" style="s2">three images originally of something I</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:12.869" style="s2">think was a fresco or a painting that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.960" end="00:47:16.380" style="s2">had been beautiful that it in the second</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.869" end="00:47:18.540" style="s2">panel that had gotten damaged but in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.380" end="00:47:21.140" style="s2">third panel there was a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.540" end="00:47:27.230" style="s2">restoration of the damaged painting and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.140" end="00:47:31.109" style="s2">it was almost cartoon like and I worry</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.230" end="00:47:35.460" style="s2">that what we&#39;re left with right at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.109" end="00:47:37.559" style="s2">moment is a bit of a cartoon and what</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.460" end="00:47:40.680" style="s2">you&#39;re really trying to say is I want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.559" end="00:47:42.299" style="s2">go back before this bad restoration and</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.680" end="00:47:45.390" style="s2">you&#39;re in the case of your family&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.299" end="00:47:49.020" style="s2">history let&#39;s say and look at both the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.390" end="00:47:51.510" style="s2">beauty and the damage that was your</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.020" end="00:47:56.309" style="s2">family more honestly in the hopes of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.510" end="00:47:59.549" style="s2">maybe a better restoration can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.309" end="00:48:01.770" style="s2">about sort of I know that you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.549" end="00:48:04.589" style="s2">strange place with your mom can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.770" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">about kind of the love that you feel for</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.589" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">your family and your mom having done</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:11.160" style="s2">this work and having me tell you that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:13.589" style="s2">you know I&#39;m just being open that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.160" end="00:48:14.370" style="s2">struggling with the fact that you&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:48:14.370" end="00:48:19.830" style="s2">and I think that you know this is just</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.100" end="00:48:21.510" style="s2">this is really courageous work to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.830" end="00:48:24.600" style="s2">doing can you talk about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.510" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">trying to do for your family first of</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.840" end="00:48:35.640" style="s2">doing the work so you don&#39;t have to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.030" end="00:48:42.600" style="s2">that you are not doing the work you are</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.640" end="00:48:48.570" style="s2">doing the work right now and as far as</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.570" end="00:48:54.660" style="s2">with me of this poor restoration I</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.350" end="00:48:56.820" style="s2">reacted to that immediately as a the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.660" end="00:48:59.040" style="s2">best representation of what has happened</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.820" end="00:49:03.720" style="s2">in my family that I have seen so far</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:11.220" style="s2">really visually I think you grasped it</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.720" end="00:49:12.920" style="s2">so fast and which means that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.220" end="00:49:16.890" style="s2">getting somewhere with our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.920" end="00:49:22.770" style="s2">but but if I think of you ask me about</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.890" end="00:49:27.660" style="s2">the love of my family and if I had not</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.770" end="00:49:29.730" style="s2">done this work I can safely say that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.660" end="00:49:33.120" style="s2">would have hated several members of my</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.730" end="00:49:36.690" style="s2">family I don&#39;t want to say which ones</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.120" end="00:49:39.840" style="s2">it&#39;s you don&#39;t have to know I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.690" end="00:49:42.570" style="s2">would have hated them not just the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.840" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">generation that committed the crimes but</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.570" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">the generation afterwards too I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:52.560" style="s2">have hated them for lying to me about</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:54.780" style="s2">very serious things and leaving me with</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.560" end="00:49:57.390" style="s2">a shame that I felt at a cellular level</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.780" end="00:49:59.460" style="s2">not only me but my sister too and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.390" end="00:50:02.460" style="s2">younger than I am so my job was to</p>

<p begin="00:50:02.460" end="00:50:08.120" style="s2">protect her from this messed up her life</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.370" end="00:50:08.120" style="s2">for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.800" end="00:50:19.320" style="s2">but going back and for example getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.290" end="00:50:22.470" style="s2">in a Jeep with a Brazilian genealogist</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.320" end="00:50:25.920" style="s2">in Brazil and driving out into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.470" end="00:50:28.350" style="s2">interior of Brazil where my mother and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.920" end="00:50:30.150" style="s2">her some of her siblings ended up</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.350" end="00:50:32.790" style="s2">because my grandma thought parents went</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.150" end="00:50:38.610" style="s2">there because of what they&#39;d done in</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.790" end="00:50:45.330" style="s2">Europe and seeing what a young teenager</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.610" end="00:50:47.790" style="s2">faced a life in a wilderness a dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.330" end="00:50:48.470" style="s2">wilderness a place dominated by the drug</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.790" end="00:50:52.130" style="s2">trade</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.470" end="00:50:54.870" style="s2">having your youth taken away from you</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.130" end="00:50:57.360" style="s2">not being able to grow up in Germany</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.870" end="00:51:03.720" style="s2">which after all as you said had a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.360" end="00:51:08.010" style="s2">rich and old culture having your just</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.720" end="00:51:11.460" style="s2">having your opportunities taken like</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.010" end="00:51:16.710" style="s2">that and as I stood actually on this</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.460" end="00:51:18.420" style="s2">estate was the this place where they had</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.710" end="00:51:20.970" style="s2">established themselves and their</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.420" end="00:51:24.120" style="s2">interiors on looked at the structures</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.970" end="00:51:25.560" style="s2">that were still standing there the man</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.120" end="00:51:27.390" style="s2">who&#39;s with me said so I take a picture</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.560" end="00:51:29.670" style="s2">of you in front of this and I said I</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.390" end="00:51:33.000" style="s2">never want to have a picture of me in</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.670" end="00:51:36.360" style="s2">front of this ever this is the source of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.000" end="00:51:44.810" style="s2">our suffering this is the source of my</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.360" end="00:51:50.210" style="s2">mother suffering and I realized then how</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.810" end="00:51:54.600" style="s2">much sympathy I had for her situation</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.210" end="00:51:56.340" style="s2">well and for her siblings as well I</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.600" end="00:51:58.590" style="s2">don&#39;t think they really realized that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.340" end="00:52:02.840" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the consequence of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.590" end="00:52:07.020" style="s2">work today I have a sympathy for them</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.840" end="00:52:11.370" style="s2">and it&#39;s not like feeling sorry for just</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.020" end="00:52:17.870" style="s2">a you know like a hurt person it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.370" end="00:52:20.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a deep love of of them as</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.870" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2">you would love a person who you can see</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.280" end="00:52:27.480" style="s2">is enduring the unbearable you know we</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:29.310" style="s2">all have children you have a you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.480" end="00:52:30.930" style="s2">children who are teenagers I have</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.310" end="00:52:35.370" style="s2">children who are just over the teenage</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.930" end="00:52:38.730" style="s2">years and if you just think of them in</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.370" end="00:52:40.680" style="s2">that situation their future just taken</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.730" end="00:52:41.550" style="s2">from them pulled out from under their</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.680" end="00:52:45.120" style="s2">feet</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.550" end="00:52:49.350" style="s2">by parents who had committed crimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.120" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">a terrible thing and so for me I there</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.350" end="00:52:54.750" style="s2">is a healing in that awful moment</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:57.930" style="s2">because otherwise I would have remained</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.750" end="00:53:00.900" style="s2">in a in the space of of hatred which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.930" end="00:53:03.450" style="s2">exactly where we need to not be which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.900" end="00:53:07.530" style="s2">exactly that what everyone needs to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.450" end="00:53:12.450" style="s2">out of wherever they can yeah I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.530" end="00:53:15.720" style="s2">I&#39;m finding our current vogue for</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.450" end="00:53:17.070" style="s2">talking about oppression very bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.720" end="00:53:22.470" style="s2">because it to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.070" end="00:53:26.130" style="s2">much of it lacks the I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.470" end="00:53:28.680" style="s2">to call it the texture of really deep</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.130" end="00:53:32.520" style="s2">discussions about how do these crimes</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.680" end="00:53:35.460" style="s2">perpetuate themselves and propagate</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.520" end="00:53:38.190" style="s2">really is a wave in the in the medium of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.460" end="00:53:40.590" style="s2">our generational structure inside of our</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.190" end="00:53:42.210" style="s2">families that you see something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.590" end="00:53:46.380" style="s2">goes wrong and then it cascades</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.210" end="00:53:48.330" style="s2">generation after generation you know in</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.380" end="00:53:53.430" style="s2">my own case that one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.330" end="00:53:55.200" style="s2">wrestle with is that my family I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.430" end="00:54:00.180" style="s2">for the best of reasons became</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.200" end="00:54:02.910" style="s2">interested in far left politics and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.180" end="00:54:06.030" style="s2">blinded them to the horrors of communism</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.910" end="00:54:10.140" style="s2">and Stalinism for a period of time when</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.030" end="00:54:12.000" style="s2">the US was you know not fully aware of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.140" end="00:54:13.770" style="s2">what exactly had been going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.000" end="00:54:17.580" style="s2">Soviet Union it was possible to think</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.770" end="00:54:19.320" style="s2">that that maybe the Soviet Union was</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.580" end="00:54:21.990" style="s2">trying to build a better world they were</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.320" end="00:54:26.700" style="s2">more open to you know blacks migrating</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.990" end="00:54:28.830" style="s2">them to Moscow or you know interracial</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.700" end="00:54:30.900" style="s2">marriages or whatever that that were</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.830" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">less comfortable in the u.s. who knows</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.900" end="00:54:38.040" style="s2">and from that you know a blind eye is</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:42.360" style="s2">turned because we don&#39;t know how to die</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.040" end="00:54:44.280" style="s2">in ala carte politically it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.360" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">to say well these aspects were positive</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.280" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">these aspects were negative and we keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:52.830" style="s2">finding very simplistic solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:55.069" style="s2">work their way through the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.830" end="00:54:56.690" style="s2">world historical spirit</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.069" end="00:54:58.729" style="s2">but you know tens of millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.690" end="00:55:02.059" style="s2">can die at a time as dumb ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.729" end="00:55:04.039" style="s2">explored what work do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.059" end="00:55:07.699" style="s2">should be doing now like what do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.039" end="00:55:09.739" style="s2">think the most important thing is for</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.699" end="00:55:11.989" style="s2">people who can make the leap to</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.739" end="00:55:14.239" style="s2">metacognition and kind of look in on</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.989" end="00:55:19.190" style="s2">themselves and say isn&#39;t it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.239" end="00:55:20.769" style="s2">that I&#39;m simultaneously feeling you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.190" end="00:55:24.279" style="s2">like the both the blessings of</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.769" end="00:55:26.900" style="s2">multiculturalism and the need to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.279" end="00:55:28.369" style="s2">cultures that are exclusive in order</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.900" end="00:55:30.469" style="s2">that there are cultures that can be made</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.369" end="00:55:32.390" style="s2">into multi cultures so you know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.469" end="00:55:35.029" style="s2">that&#39;s a great contradiction right there</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.390" end="00:55:37.309" style="s2">that culturalism is based on exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.029" end="00:55:39.349" style="s2">multiculturalism is based on inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.309" end="00:55:46.099" style="s2">we can&#39;t resolve it what is our work</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.349" end="00:55:55.999" style="s2">right now do you think for 1919 this</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.099" end="00:55:58.219" style="s2">time yeah well I don&#39;t want to go into</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.999" end="00:56:01.249" style="s2">this typical diatribe about we have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.219" end="00:56:02.269" style="s2">reduce polarization and all that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.249" end="00:56:05.059" style="s2">know simoleons</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.269" end="00:56:07.459" style="s2">yeah because in some ways the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.059" end="00:56:14.180" style="s2">polarization induces a lot of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.459" end="00:56:16.369" style="s2">and reactions and forces new things to</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.180" end="00:56:19.729" style="s2">emerge and forces people to look for a</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.369" end="00:56:27.380" style="s2">new way new ways in a new way out of</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.729" end="00:56:28.430" style="s2">this situation well I can only refer to</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.380" end="00:56:30.529" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.430" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">I can&#39;t tell other people what they</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.529" end="00:56:36.670" style="s2">should be doing and so what is a person</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:42.259" style="s2">who has been done this kind of work do</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.670" end="00:56:44.630" style="s2">yes well you&#39;re living in Sweden yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.259" end="00:56:50.150" style="s2">that&#39;s your base of opera yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.630" end="00:56:51.979" style="s2">live in Sweden and and although I I come</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.150" end="00:56:54.289" style="s2">to the United States and and I write in</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.979" end="00:56:56.989" style="s2">English so so therefore I speak here</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.289" end="00:57:01.640" style="s2">really I&#39;ve been involved in doing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.989" end="00:57:07.279" style="s2">work in Sweden and the direction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.640" end="00:57:08.240" style="s2">taken me is that I have become engaged</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.279" end="00:57:12.550" style="s2">in</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.550" end="00:57:19.369" style="s2">have very different areas of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.359" end="00:57:24.920" style="s2">but are working at a very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.369" end="00:57:26.630" style="s2">their field but have decided that it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.920" end="00:57:29.599" style="s2">insufficient that they remain in their</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.630" end="00:57:33.619" style="s2">fields we will not find a way forward</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.599" end="00:57:35.570" style="s2">that way we have to come together in</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.619" end="00:57:39.140" style="s2">different networks with our different</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.570" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">areas of expertise and address problems</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.140" end="00:57:45.980" style="s2">that come up so when I was pulled in by</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:48.230" style="s2">a bunch of IT experts who are fighting</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.980" end="00:57:50.180" style="s2">white supremacy on the internet I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.230" end="00:57:52.700" style="s2">like to use the word fighting let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.180" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">counteracting ok white supremacism on</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.700" end="00:58:00.830" style="s2">the internet and asked to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:03.220" style="s2">some of their projects</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.830" end="00:58:05.839" style="s2">I was wondered what it was I could do</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.220" end="00:58:11.150" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know anything about what</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.839" end="00:58:12.530" style="s2">they do but as it happened they saw that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.150" end="00:58:17.030" style="s2">there were things I was doing they</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.530" end="00:58:19.490" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.030" end="00:58:27.320" style="s2">manifestations of this collaboration is</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.490" end="00:58:30.080" style="s2">that we were called upon to help an area</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.320" end="00:58:33.530" style="s2">of Sweden that was being lamed by white</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.080" end="00:58:36.050" style="s2">supremist white supremacy so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.530" end="00:58:42.950" style="s2">neo-nazi party that had brought a town</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.050" end="00:58:45.530" style="s2">to a halt and as it turned out the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.950" end="00:58:49.099" style="s2">solution was not to try to get at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.530" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">neo-nazis the solution was to move into</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.099" end="00:58:55.160" style="s2">that society and to inspire it to</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:58.910" style="s2">mobilize itself and also to bring in all</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.160" end="00:59:01.510" style="s2">the major stakeholders business the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.910" end="00:59:04.730" style="s2">church local government whatever</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.510" end="00:59:07.280" style="s2">everyone who played a role there and to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.730" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">get them to decide that their community</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.280" end="00:59:14.359" style="s2">was too important to allow the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:18.109" style="s2">things that bound them together</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.359" end="00:59:19.940" style="s2">originally which had had weakened to</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.109" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">just fall apart and I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.940" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:25.710" style="s2">is happening in many parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.200" end="00:59:29.350" style="s2">Western world it&#39;s why we see this</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.710" end="00:59:35.320" style="s2">situation that we&#39;re in that at a</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.350" end="00:59:38.800" style="s2">community level there isn&#39;t the the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.320" end="00:59:40.390" style="s2">the things that bind us together I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.800" end="00:59:42.820" style="s2">know what we&#39;re going to call them that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.390" end="00:59:45.010" style="s2">the bonds okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.820" end="00:59:48.450" style="s2">have weakened they have weakened in</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.010" end="00:59:54.370" style="s2">quality in fact they&#39;re becoming so weak</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.450" end="00:59:56.920" style="s2">that groups like the neo-nazis and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.370" end="01:00:01.390" style="s2">in other places other groups can just</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.920" end="01:00:03.550" style="s2">move in and finish them off so basically</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.390" end="01:00:06.940" style="s2">finish off these bonds between us and</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.550" end="01:00:09.040" style="s2">just slice right through them and so by</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.940" end="01:00:11.050" style="s2">going into this community and saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.040" end="01:00:13.930" style="s2">come on everyone let&#39;s all sit down in</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.050" end="01:00:15.640" style="s2">this church which was usually the</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.930" end="01:00:17.710" style="s2">largest gathering place in a Swedish</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.640" end="01:00:19.300" style="s2">town well not because people are</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.710" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">particularly religious but because</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.300" end="01:00:25.570" style="s2">that&#39;s where people gather and talk</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:27.310" style="s2">about how we can strengthen the bonds</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.570" end="01:00:30.430" style="s2">between us</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.310" end="01:00:35.050" style="s2">within one year people stopped moving</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.430" end="01:00:37.270" style="s2">out of that town and business had double</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.050" end="01:00:42.580" style="s2">down on its investment in that town</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.270" end="01:00:44.410" style="s2">right and to me I guess what I&#39;m what I</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.580" end="01:00:46.270" style="s2">should extract from that as a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.410" end="01:00:50.380" style="s2">general thought about what we should be</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.270" end="01:00:52.990" style="s2">doing it&#39;s seeking just to strengthen</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.380" end="01:00:55.450" style="s2">the bonds between us in whatever way we</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.990" end="01:00:58.660" style="s2">can which is in my view what you and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.450" end="01:01:00.580" style="s2">are doing despite the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.660" end="01:01:04.210" style="s2">to get over a number of emotional</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.580" end="01:01:08.140" style="s2">hurdles I mean to do that but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.210" end="01:01:10.210" style="s2">doing it yeah and this is what needs to</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.140" end="01:01:14.260" style="s2">happen everywhere where it can</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.210" end="01:01:17.560" style="s2">especially among individuals who have</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.260" end="01:01:19.840" style="s2">quite a lot of hurdles to jump in order</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.560" end="01:01:23.320" style="s2">to you know who were there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.840" end="01:01:25.720" style="s2">a lot of emotional difficult emotional</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.320" end="01:01:30.100" style="s2">feelings that you need to overcome in</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.720" end="01:01:33.970" style="s2">order to strengthen that bond</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.100" end="01:01:37.080" style="s2">this has has also been true for me in my</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.970" end="01:01:40.480" style="s2">interactions with the Islamic community</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.080" end="01:01:43.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve been approached by people from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.480" end="01:01:45.430" style="s2">Islamic community who know that there</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.420" end="01:01:50.200" style="s2">has to be Holocaust education in their</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.430" end="01:01:52.780" style="s2">communities but who also know that their</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.200" end="01:01:55.540" style="s2">communities will not welcome hearing it</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.780" end="01:01:57.430" style="s2">from a Jewish person or you know a</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.540" end="01:02:00.130" style="s2">descendant of a Holocaust survivor which</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.430" end="01:02:02.860" style="s2">is terrible it&#39;s not always the case but</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.130" end="01:02:04.330" style="s2">it is the case sometimes because there</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.860" end="01:02:06.610" style="s2">are lots of descendants of Holocaust</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.330" end="01:02:08.320" style="s2">survivors who generously give their time</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.610" end="01:02:11.350" style="s2">to go around speaking about what</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.320" end="01:02:14.280" style="s2">happened to their parents and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.350" end="01:02:16.660" style="s2">grandparents in the Holocaust but often</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.280" end="01:02:20.440" style="s2">at least what I have encountered in</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.660" end="01:02:23.980" style="s2">Sweden is that in in a number of Islamic</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.440" end="01:02:27.850" style="s2">communities it&#39;s they just can&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.980" end="01:02:29.650" style="s2">can&#39;t emotionally break through they</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.850" end="01:02:31.660" style="s2">can&#39;t get over the hurdles they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.650" end="01:02:33.700" style="s2">sit down you know even in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.660" end="01:02:36.570" style="s2">there&#39;s this very bizarre thing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.700" end="01:02:40.270" style="s2">we&#39;re going through where suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.570" end="01:02:44.530" style="s2">slavery which was one kind of a disaster</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.270" end="01:02:48.100" style="s2">that you know obviously was bound up in</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.530" end="01:02:51.630" style="s2">the founding of the United States has a</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.100" end="01:02:54.870" style="s2">tremendous salience inside of the media</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.630" end="01:02:57.820" style="s2">commentariat you have a more recent</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.870" end="01:02:59.380" style="s2">situation like the Holocaust which you</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.820" end="01:03:02.980" style="s2">know is not a North American phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.380" end="01:03:06.670" style="s2">was a European one but it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.980" end="01:03:10.690" style="s2">recent and the you know the body count</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.670" end="01:03:12.670" style="s2">is spectacular and the in the mechanized</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.690" end="01:03:15.640" style="s2">horror and deliberate nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.670" end="01:03:19.570" style="s2">whole thing etc etc is fairly</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.640" end="01:03:21.940" style="s2">unparalleled and it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.570" end="01:03:26.770" style="s2">same kind of salience because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.940" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">somehow bound up in this question of are</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.770" end="01:03:33.030" style="s2">we really talking about oppression or</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:35.650" style="s2">are we really talking about financial</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.030" end="01:03:37.620" style="s2">distribution and redistribution because</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.650" end="01:03:40.540" style="s2">the Jewish community is always</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.620" end="01:03:43.540" style="s2">vulnerable in a violent way but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.540" end="01:03:46.570" style="s2">often very successful in a financial way</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.540" end="01:03:48.940" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve had this theory that you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.570" end="01:03:51.850" style="s2">tell who&#39;s really focused on envy and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.940" end="01:03:54.820" style="s2">has really focused on oppression by how</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.850" end="01:03:56.530" style="s2">do they treat whatever the minority</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.820" end="01:04:01.390" style="s2">communities are that are very</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.530" end="01:04:04.000" style="s2">financially successful in some sphere so</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.390" end="01:04:05.860" style="s2">like overseas Chinese or you have Indian</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.000" end="01:04:08.380" style="s2">communities in East Africa that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.860" end="01:04:11.620" style="s2">vulnerable but are often doing well and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.380" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">the Jewish community is often you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.620" end="01:04:16.360" style="s2">if you&#39;re measuring oppression</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:18.610" style="s2">financially but you&#39;re you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.360" end="01:04:22.810" style="s2">about it as if what you&#39;re really upset</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.610" end="01:04:24.940" style="s2">about is you know murder or one human</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.810" end="01:04:26.890" style="s2">owning another human these things get</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.940" end="01:04:28.540" style="s2">pulled apart based on the on which</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.890" end="01:04:33.610" style="s2">community you&#39;re discussing so for</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.540" end="01:04:35.410" style="s2">whatever reason slavery is very central</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.610" end="01:04:37.750" style="s2">to the current American discussion and</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.410" end="01:04:40.420" style="s2">the vulnerability of Jews is</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.750" end="01:04:45.850" style="s2">increasingly invisible to the far left</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.420" end="01:04:47.500" style="s2">and the far right and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.850" end="01:04:50.710" style="s2">to do about that it just it&#39;s too weird</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.500" end="01:04:54.940" style="s2">because this I mean in human terms this</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.710" end="01:04:56.980" style="s2">is super recent you know there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.940" end="01:05:00.010" style="s2">anyone who can remember slavery and</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.980" end="01:05:02.530" style="s2">thank God it&#39;s moving into the past so</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.010" end="01:05:05.560" style="s2">we have to you know rely on records but</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.530" end="01:05:07.990" style="s2">we still have people walking around who</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.560" end="01:05:10.030" style="s2">are quite old now who were you know in</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.990" end="01:05:14.110" style="s2">the camps or exposed to what was going</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.030" end="01:05:16.930" style="s2">on and you know most of those people</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.110" end="01:05:18.160" style="s2">were children now if they have any</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.930" end="01:05:20.770" style="s2">contact with that at all</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.160" end="01:05:23.950" style="s2">but it feels to me like we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.770" end="01:05:25.600" style="s2">unable to remember the horror and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.950" end="01:05:27.670" style="s2">vulnerability because somehow we just</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.600" end="01:05:29.230" style="s2">feel like it doesn&#39;t matter anymore I</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.670" end="01:05:33.850" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if you have this</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.230" end="01:05:37.750" style="s2">feeling well the thing is that you and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.850" end="01:05:39.820" style="s2">can&#39;t remember the Holocaust because we</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.750" end="01:05:45.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t live through it no we&#39;re both in</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.820" end="01:05:52.750" style="s2">our sort of early mid 50s so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.400" end="01:05:56.790" style="s2">gone but what we remember and I think we</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.750" end="01:05:56.790" style="s2">remember it intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.220" end="01:06:00.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if we won&#39;t you want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.690" end="01:06:04.329" style="s2">call it emotionally or spiritually and</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.520" end="01:06:10.869" style="s2">we recall it in ourselves what we recall</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.329" end="01:06:13.750" style="s2">is the legacy and the reactions of our</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.869" end="01:06:18.700" style="s2">families to the Holocaust that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.750" end="01:06:21.760" style="s2">remember and in some of us it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.700" end="01:06:24.069" style="s2">acute than in other people and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.760" end="01:06:28.660" style="s2">those of us were the memory of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.069" end="01:06:33.190" style="s2">legacy is more acute as in my case for</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.660" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">example I think those people have a very</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.190" end="01:06:44.190" style="s2">strong responsibility to support</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:47.710" style="s2">remembering the legacy of that time</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.190" end="01:06:49.420" style="s2">remembering is gone or will be gone soon</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.710" end="01:06:51.030" style="s2">well because it&#39;s not entirely gone I</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.420" end="01:06:53.619" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t say that because there are</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.030" end="01:06:56.440" style="s2">Holocaust survivors out there doing the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.619" end="01:06:59.890" style="s2">work and continuing to do it but I also</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.440" end="01:07:02.859" style="s2">know I Holocaust survivors have been and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.890" end="01:07:06.099" style="s2">their descendants have been like the</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.859" end="01:07:07.869" style="s2">greatest supporters of my work they are</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.099" end="01:07:10.390" style="s2">the ones who have stood up and said</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.869" end="01:07:11.980" style="s2">carry on when I just didn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.390" end="01:07:14.020" style="s2">you know I could do well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.980" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">selfish aspect of but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.020" end="01:07:18.579" style="s2">also this very weird</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.079" end="01:07:20.170" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t swear that much on</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.579" end="01:07:23.500" style="s2">these programs but I will swear a little</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.170" end="01:07:26.710" style="s2">bit for emphasis there is just this</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.500" end="01:07:29.020" style="s2">incredibly beautiful fuck you to Nazism</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.710" end="01:07:33.460" style="s2">when you invite somebody from that</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.020" end="01:07:36.579" style="s2">lineage as a Jew into your home and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.460" end="01:07:39.579" style="s2">say boy did you guys get us wrong you</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.579" end="01:07:42.339" style="s2">guys were just such dicks you know it</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.579" end="01:07:43.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s meant not to do it justice</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.339" end="01:07:46.240" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing you can say to</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.599" end="01:07:48.490" style="s2">the Holocaust but like all of these</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.240" end="01:07:50.859" style="s2">things that I&#39;m reading on the internet</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.490" end="01:07:56.230" style="s2">about how Jews control everything and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.859" end="01:07:59.500" style="s2">the narrative and you know spend time</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.230" end="01:08:02.470" style="s2">with Jews I don&#39;t know anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.500" end="01:08:05.050" style="s2">being invited as elders of zion to</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.470" end="01:08:07.510" style="s2">examine its protocols it&#39;s just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.050" end="01:08:10.809" style="s2">very bizarre thing that when people</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.510" end="01:08:13.449" style="s2">become divorced from Jews and Judaism</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.809" end="01:08:15.489" style="s2">they start telling incredible stories</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.449" end="01:08:18.489" style="s2">inside of their mind as to what it must</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.489" end="01:08:19.630" style="s2">be and what it represents so I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.489" end="01:08:21.489" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a way in which we</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.630" end="01:08:23.139" style="s2">need you to tell the story I think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.489" end="01:08:23.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which we test our own</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.139" end="01:08:25.839" style="s2">strength</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.770" end="01:08:27.520" style="s2">do what Emma you know because this is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.839" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">struggle for you Julie a little bit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.520" end="01:08:31.270" style="s2">not the easiest thing in the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:32.980" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lineage to lineage</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.270" end="01:08:35.589" style="s2">thing just as there&#39;s a human to human</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.980" end="01:08:37.900" style="s2">and human to human thing I couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.589" end="01:08:40.599" style="s2">more admiring and the lineage to lineage</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.900" end="01:08:42.940" style="s2">thing I&#39;m thinking like what am i doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.599" end="01:08:44.949" style="s2">and so you know the ability to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.940" end="01:08:47.440" style="s2">share be able to share that with you at</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.949" end="01:08:49.569" style="s2">a metacognitive level and to also just</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.440" end="01:08:51.549" style="s2">like laugh at the whole thing you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.569" end="01:08:53.380" style="s2">that to modern human beings are talking</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.549" end="01:08:58.239" style="s2">about something that we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.380" end="01:09:00.369" style="s2">imagine going through ourselves but can</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.239" end="01:09:01.150" style="s2">I say something that what the what am i</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.369" end="01:09:04.509" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.150" end="01:09:08.589" style="s2">question yeah is what we where we need</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.509" end="01:09:10.690" style="s2">to get to to open up this new space that</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.589" end="01:09:12.429" style="s2">is the purpose of your podcast</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.690" end="01:09:14.409" style="s2">well that&#39;s the thing was that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.429" end="01:09:16.509" style="s2">to break out of these things I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.409" end="01:09:22.089" style="s2">concerned for them at the moment in our</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.509" end="01:09:24.819" style="s2">country in the u.s. that the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.089" end="01:09:28.599" style="s2">Democratic Party has gone into this kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.819" end="01:09:33.339" style="s2">of emotional feeling we can&#39;t say no to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.599" end="01:09:36.909" style="s2">anybody and you know diversity is is</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.339" end="01:09:38.770" style="s2">strength and we should sort of there are</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.909" end="01:09:41.380" style="s2">no people who are illegal and why should</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.770" end="01:09:44.199" style="s2">somebody born outside the u.s. be any</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.380" end="01:09:47.559" style="s2">less fortunate than some so this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.199" end="01:09:49.750" style="s2">christlike stance on all things which i</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.559" end="01:09:51.639" style="s2">think is incredibly irresponsible and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.750" end="01:09:54.279" style="s2">very very dangerous because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.639" end="01:09:57.250" style="s2">sustainable and only Christ was Christ</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.279" end="01:09:59.920" style="s2">if anybody at all was Christ on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.250" end="01:10:02.020" style="s2">other hand you see this troglodytic</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.920" end="01:10:04.360" style="s2">perspective which is just like you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.020" end="01:10:09.340" style="s2">I&#39;m tired of feeling guilty and this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.360" end="01:10:13.270" style="s2">our country and very close to</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.340" end="01:10:16.650" style="s2">ethno-nationalism even if it isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.270" end="01:10:18.880" style="s2">the the media portrays it it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.650" end="01:10:20.210" style="s2">inching in directions that I find</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.880" end="01:10:22.580" style="s2">terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.210" end="01:10:25.159" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what to do about it because</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.580" end="01:10:27.530" style="s2">I just want both of these parties to go</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.159" end="01:10:29.120" style="s2">away for very different reasons and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.530" end="01:10:32.090" style="s2">think that they&#39;re feeding off of each</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.120" end="01:10:36.020" style="s2">other and our worst instincts and I feel</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.090" end="01:10:38.540" style="s2">like the hard work is done when people</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.020" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">sit down with people who are very</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.540" end="01:10:42.980" style="s2">different than than them and find out</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:44.690" style="s2">that the conversations they end up</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.980" end="01:10:46.760" style="s2">having don&#39;t don&#39;t sound anything like</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.690" end="01:10:54.890" style="s2">the conversations we might have imagined</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.760" end="01:11:02.840" style="s2">hmm yes and who are prepared to be open</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.890" end="01:11:04.880" style="s2">to an evolution because humans humans</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.840" end="01:11:10.850" style="s2">like everything in little other living</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.880" end="01:11:14.330" style="s2">beings beings on this planet develop</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.850" end="01:11:16.880" style="s2">move forward in an evolutionary way and</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.330" end="01:11:21.530" style="s2">so when you have these parties screaming</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.880" end="01:11:27.500" style="s2">out vision visions to me are very</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.530" end="01:11:29.900" style="s2">dangerous visions of things of how</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.500" end="01:11:34.760" style="s2">things are going to be unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.900" end="01:11:38.770" style="s2">dangerous and you know all of the most</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.760" end="01:11:38.770" style="s2">destructive leaders have had them and</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.920" end="01:11:46.909" style="s2">but people who are inching their way</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.159" end="01:11:51.770" style="s2">forward in this evolution and having</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.909" end="01:11:57.219" style="s2">doing the slow work of repairing the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.770" end="01:12:03.199" style="s2">bonds between us is what is needed and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.219" end="01:12:06.350" style="s2">the other stuff to me is yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.199" end="01:12:10.969" style="s2">it&#39;s always it&#39;s always going to lead to</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.350" end="01:12:14.659" style="s2">a repeat you know just a rerun of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.969" end="01:12:17.179" style="s2">past you know I&#39;ve mentioned this before</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.659" end="01:12:18.890" style="s2">I was going to start the podcast with</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.179" end="01:12:20.360" style="s2">this cousin who I had never met but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.890" end="01:12:26.230" style="s2">been talking to a little bit on and off</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.360" end="01:12:30.580" style="s2">over the years who lived in Indiana and</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.230" end="01:12:32.590" style="s2">she was a mingle a twin who</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.580" end="01:12:34.810" style="s2">I had an incredible story in the camps</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.590" end="01:12:36.940" style="s2">and I spoke to her just before the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.810" end="01:12:38.530" style="s2">podcast started and before she left on</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.940" end="01:12:41.680" style="s2">her and her annual pilgrimage to</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.530" end="01:12:45.220" style="s2">Auschwitz and she was really excited</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.680" end="01:12:46.420" style="s2">about about it she had freed herself by</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.220" end="01:12:51.400" style="s2">having to go to the extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.420" end="01:12:52.810" style="s2">lengths of forgiving dr. Mengele and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.400" end="01:12:54.850" style="s2">first time I heard that I had a cousin</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.810" end="01:12:57.670" style="s2">who had forgiven dr. Mengele I was so</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.850" end="01:13:01.780" style="s2">pissed like how how can you do that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.670" end="01:13:03.670" style="s2">cannot let this person off the hook you</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.780" end="01:13:05.740" style="s2">know that there&#39;s responsibility when I</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.670" end="01:13:09.220" style="s2">talked to her I realized I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.740" end="01:13:11.140" style="s2">understood what a genius move this was</p>

<p begin="01:15:06.100" end="01:15:10.630" style="s2">for example there&#39;s a guy named pascal</p>

<p begin="01:17:09.939" end="01:17:14.079" style="s2">the idea that in Germany is that in all</p>

<p begin="01:17:44.649" end="01:17:51.429" style="s2">focus just on the whole I think your</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.119" end="01:17:54.669" style="s2">goal is to restore the nest and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.429" end="01:18:05.439" style="s2">that work may be pretty tough is that a</p>

<p begin="01:18:05.439" end="01:18:12.760" style="s2">I try to conceptualize that restoration</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.149" end="01:18:14.709" style="s2">as we&#39;re all going to be able to sit</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.760" end="01:18:19.479" style="s2">around the table and be loving to each</p>

<p begin="01:18:36.399" end="01:18:44.349" style="s2">heart a restoration has taken place in</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.269" end="01:18:44.949" style="s2">the sense that I have sympathy I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:18:57.639" end="01:19:02.590" style="s2">so there&#39;s nothing to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.160" end="01:19:04.270" style="s2">about it it&#39;s the victims who should</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.590" end="01:19:11.380" style="s2">decide whether to forgive or not like</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.270" end="01:19:15.210" style="s2">your relative but when it comes to my</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.380" end="01:19:19.210" style="s2">own family my children and my husband</p>

<p begin="01:19:19.210" end="01:19:30.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s sharing a nest of course with</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.070" end="01:19:34.690" style="s2">with the others too and and that part is</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.090" end="01:19:37.420" style="s2">becoming more like the beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.690" end="01:19:41.920" style="s2">painting at the beginning of the series</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.170" end="01:19:49.750" style="s2">released in Sweden in in January and</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.990" end="01:19:52.270" style="s2">Swedish language I was asked to come and</p>

<p begin="01:20:06.370" end="01:20:13.030" style="s2">after I came off this interview I became</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.020" end="01:20:15.190" style="s2">very frightened about how my children</p>

<p begin="01:20:17.350" end="01:20:23.320" style="s2">suddenly it was and I thought how will</p>

<p begin="01:20:44.410" end="01:20:54.160" style="s2">fixed it my daughter my daughter showed</p>

<p begin="01:20:54.160" end="01:21:05.140" style="s2">hold this complexity and she showed me</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.070" end="01:21:08.640" style="s2">by calling me up and saying mom I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.140" end="01:21:10.930" style="s2">proud of you and it wasn&#39;t so much that</p>

<p begin="01:21:14.250" end="01:21:22.199" style="s2">was that she could feel the emotion of</p>

<p begin="01:21:46.540" end="01:21:55.449" style="s2">with that into a society that&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.170" end="01:21:58.090" style="s2">very quickly and so if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.449" end="01:22:01.320" style="s2">that I any restoration work that I hope</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.090" end="01:22:06.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve succeeded in its in in that piece</p>

<p begin="01:22:26.590" end="01:22:29.820" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really like I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.730" end="01:22:33.219" style="s2">talking to your mom and I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.820" end="01:22:35.620" style="s2">letting somebody know that on the other</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.219" end="01:22:37.420" style="s2">side of this it&#39;s not just a question of</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.620" end="01:22:39.090" style="s2">shame and sticking somebody&#39;s head in</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.420" end="01:22:41.920" style="s2">the toilet bowl for the rest of eternity</p>

<p begin="01:22:41.920" end="01:22:47.170" style="s2">of everything it&#39;s a question of it</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.190" end="01:22:49.390" style="s2">really needs to be understood that this</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.170" end="01:22:52.660" style="s2">happened you know it was as bad as we</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.390" end="01:22:54.699" style="s2">say it was and that that is not the</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.660" end="01:22:57.010" style="s2">entire story and in particular this</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.699" end="01:23:00.219" style="s2">issue of passing power back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.010" end="01:23:05.440" style="s2">when people who have lineage and</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.219" end="01:23:08.080" style="s2">connection to the perpetrators of what</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.440" end="01:23:11.500" style="s2">happened during this darkest of periods</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.080" end="01:23:14.739" style="s2">in human history talk about these things</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.500" end="01:23:16.449" style="s2">and own them from the lineage</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.739" end="01:23:19.750" style="s2">perspective because you can&#39;t own it</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.449" end="01:23:22.179" style="s2">personally because it wasn&#39;t you and it</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.750" end="01:23:23.830" style="s2">allows the rest of us to do the other</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.179" end="01:23:26.410" style="s2">part of the work which is to say you</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.830" end="01:23:27.020" style="s2">know I&#39;ve always felt vaguely guilty</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.410" end="01:23:31.070" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.020" end="01:23:34.280" style="s2">how attached I am to Schubert leader or</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.070" end="01:23:35.900" style="s2">you know music is huge for me so you</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.280" end="01:23:38.300" style="s2">know whether it&#39;s Bach or Beethoven er</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.900" end="01:23:40.100" style="s2">yeah me to record Strauss is my favorite</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.300" end="01:23:42.140" style="s2">right there you go and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.100" end="01:23:44.660" style="s2">remember the first time I was in Berlin</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.140" end="01:23:47.720" style="s2">and somebody said my Germanic last name</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.660" end="01:23:49.310" style="s2">I never wanted to go to Germany because</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.720" end="01:23:51.380" style="s2">of my trauma and that suddenly I had</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.310" end="01:23:54.260" style="s2">this question did that sound awful or</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.380" end="01:23:56.750" style="s2">did it sound awesome you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.260" end="01:23:58.580" style="s2">very weird thing to be bound up I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.750" end="01:24:00.470" style="s2">that in part Yiddish which is really</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.580" end="01:24:04.370" style="s2">some version of Judaic middle high</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.470" end="01:24:07.900" style="s2">german we&#39;ve gotten divorced from</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.370" end="01:24:10.670" style="s2">Yiddish Kight the culture that in part</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.900" end="01:24:12.680" style="s2">you know surrounds this language because</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.670" end="01:24:15.410" style="s2">of this horrible history so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.680" end="01:24:18.970" style="s2">there&#39;s so much to be gained from people</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.410" end="01:24:21.800" style="s2">like you you know sort of owning the</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.970" end="01:24:25.160" style="s2">connection to it and talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.800" end="01:24:28.040" style="s2">the deepening of understanding of it and</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.160" end="01:24:29.840" style="s2">the rest of us who are in a position to</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.040" end="01:24:32.990" style="s2">do the other part of that work which</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.840" end="01:24:35.810" style="s2">just letting your mom know I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.990" end="01:24:38.810" style="s2">very easily celebrate things that are</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.810" end="01:24:41.210" style="s2">Germanic which have had a huge impact</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.810" end="01:24:44.110" style="s2">and a hugely positive impact on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.210" end="01:24:46.220" style="s2">world without people like your daughter</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.110" end="01:24:47.840" style="s2">writing books like this and having the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.220" end="01:24:50.720" style="s2">courage to go on the lecture circuit</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.840" end="01:24:52.130" style="s2">talking about the unspeakable and so I</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.720" end="01:24:57.680" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important that we</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.130" end="01:25:01.490" style="s2">figure out how to restore Germany to her</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.680" end="01:25:03.980" style="s2">rightful place in the world order as the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.490" end="01:25:07.280" style="s2">last people to have touched the</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.980" end="01:25:10.340" style="s2">Holocaust from any side you know take</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.280" end="01:25:13.490" style="s2">their take their last spouse the one</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.340" end="01:25:15.380" style="s2">thing out let&#39;s let&#39;s leave on is you</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.490" end="01:25:18.740" style="s2">told me something I didn&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.380" end="01:25:21.470" style="s2">child rearing in Germany and empathy and</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.740" end="01:25:23.390" style="s2">I wonder if you could just share that a</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.470" end="01:25:28.040" style="s2">little bit with our listeners and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.390" end="01:25:30.440" style="s2">I&#39;ll say a couple of words and well I</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.040" end="01:25:33.239" style="s2">didn&#39;t know about it either really</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.440" end="01:25:38.510" style="s2">except through observation in my</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.239" end="01:25:42.389" style="s2">my own experience until death sight</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.510" end="01:25:46.789" style="s2">major German daily newspaper finally</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.389" end="01:25:52.170" style="s2">published the research findings that</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.789" end="01:25:57.389" style="s2">show that child raising techniques that</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.170" end="01:26:00.840" style="s2">were practiced in some of the more</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.389" end="01:26:05.719" style="s2">radical Nazi families but this was this</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.840" end="01:26:05.719" style="s2">was these were techniques that were</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.869" end="01:26:12.809" style="s2">summarized in a book that was written by</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.940" end="01:26:17.039" style="s2">somebody called dr. Johanna Hara in 1934</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.809" end="01:26:21.749" style="s2">this book was published and it was a</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.039" end="01:26:24.269" style="s2">book that made its way into many Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.749" end="01:26:30.360" style="s2">households especially households of ss</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.269" end="01:26:33.059" style="s2">families and these were ideas about how</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.360" end="01:26:35.219" style="s2">to raise children but not only how to</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.059" end="01:26:39.210" style="s2">raise children it was how to raise them</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.219" end="01:26:42.059" style="s2">for the struggle because the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.210" end="01:26:43.739" style="s2">motivating idea behind Hitler&#39;s society</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.059" end="01:26:48.780" style="s2">was that there was a constant struggle</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.739" end="01:26:51.420" style="s2">going on between the races and the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.780" end="01:26:57.329" style="s2">you know the the Aryans and the other</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.420" end="01:27:00.900" style="s2">degenerate people&#39;s and and so the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.329" end="01:27:04.409" style="s2">effect of these practices if if you take</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.900" end="01:27:08.670" style="s2">them in their sum total is to remove</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.409" end="01:27:11.280" style="s2">empathy from people and there were all</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.670" end="01:27:13.619" style="s2">kinds of ways in which this took place</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.280" end="01:27:15.829" style="s2">mothers weren&#39;t supposed to look into</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.619" end="01:27:18.449" style="s2">their infants eyes and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.829" end="01:27:20.219" style="s2">and of course I don&#39;t think that most</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.449" end="01:27:21.749" style="s2">mothers that implemented these things</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.219" end="01:27:27.269" style="s2">were conscious that that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.749" end="01:27:31.260" style="s2">were doing but that was the that was the</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.269" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">effect and I&#39;m not saying that those</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.260" end="01:27:37.139" style="s2">babies ended up with no empathy but what</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.840" end="01:27:41.849" style="s2">the research is showing is that those</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.139" end="01:27:44.519" style="s2">babies that are now elderly people are</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.849" end="01:27:46.019" style="s2">moving into in their 70s if I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.519" end="01:27:47.160" style="s2">if you regard a person in their 70s as</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.019" end="01:27:50.250" style="s2">elderly but anyway there</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.160" end="01:27:55.470" style="s2">I used to but I&#39;m not yeah that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.250" end="01:27:59.340" style="s2">added that but but what is emerging is</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.470" end="01:28:02.840" style="s2">that in families where these techniques</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.340" end="01:28:05.190" style="s2">were implemented in a systematic manner</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.840" end="01:28:10.050" style="s2">the effects on the children were very</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.190" end="01:28:12.390" style="s2">serious and this there was research</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.050" end="01:28:15.270" style="s2">available about this already back in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.390" end="01:28:18.120" style="s2">early 90s but no German paper wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.270" end="01:28:21.210" style="s2">touch it no one wanted to publish it</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.120" end="01:28:21.810" style="s2">long and it was at the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.210" end="01:28:24.840" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.810" end="01:28:26.670" style="s2">dete site at the courage to publish an</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.840" end="01:28:29.850" style="s2">article about this which was almost</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.670" end="01:28:34.640" style="s2">immediately translated into english and</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.850" end="01:28:37.920" style="s2">published in Scientific American and</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.640" end="01:28:40.650" style="s2">without going into the details when I</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.920" end="01:28:43.800" style="s2">read about it I recognized a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.650" end="01:28:50.340" style="s2">things and just emotionally from from</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.800" end="01:28:52.620" style="s2">from things reactions the behavior as</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.340" end="01:28:53.520" style="s2">I&#39;d seen and the generation that came</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.620" end="01:28:55.620" style="s2">before me</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.520" end="01:28:58.530" style="s2">the behavior between my grandmother and</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.620" end="01:29:01.050" style="s2">her children things that I then</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.530" end="01:29:03.980" style="s2">experienced because no one in my family</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.050" end="01:29:06.360" style="s2">really confronted you have to confront</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.980" end="01:29:09.660" style="s2">what came before you in order not to</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.360" end="01:29:13.890" style="s2">repeat it and unfortunately that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.660" end="01:29:17.910" style="s2">happen so I am familiar with some of</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.890" end="01:29:21.720" style="s2">these things and I think this is going</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.910" end="01:29:23.760" style="s2">to be very a very big thing and very</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.720" end="01:29:26.240" style="s2">important for a lot of families that</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.760" end="01:29:29.600" style="s2">this is coming up out into the open now</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.240" end="01:29:32.700" style="s2">I think it&#39;s also important because</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.600" end="01:29:35.400" style="s2">there are other places where extremism</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.700" end="01:29:37.230" style="s2">exists in the world and questions about</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.400" end="01:29:39.570" style="s2">whether the children of extremists</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.230" end="01:29:42.240" style="s2">should be it should remain with those</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.570" end="01:29:47.670" style="s2">extremists or not right and I must say</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.240" end="01:29:50.190" style="s2">with my with with what I know I would</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.670" end="01:29:52.260" style="s2">question whether that&#39;s a good idea in</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.190" end="01:29:55.860" style="s2">all cases because maybe some of those</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.260" end="01:29:58.500" style="s2">children would be better off being</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.860" end="01:30:00.840" style="s2">raised in other families depends on a</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.500" end="01:30:04.530" style="s2">number of things and child of extremists</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.840" end="01:30:07.710" style="s2">I know I don&#39;t know what to say about</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.530" end="01:30:12.060" style="s2">that but but I I think what I can can</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.710" end="01:30:21.150" style="s2">say is that the tendrils of that time</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.060" end="01:30:24.810" style="s2">are so long and so many yeah that the</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.150" end="01:30:27.210" style="s2">remembering yeah will go on in another</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.810" end="01:30:30.180" style="s2">way and it&#39;s going to go on for a very</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.210" end="01:30:32.450" style="s2">long time and it is the remembering will</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.180" end="01:30:35.160" style="s2">happen through those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.450" end="01:30:37.860" style="s2">these child-rearing practices or</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.160" end="01:30:39.590" style="s2">something that have left an imprint on</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.860" end="01:30:44.010" style="s2">families through generations</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.590" end="01:30:47.670" style="s2">what is more shocking is that in 1945</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.010" end="01:30:49.380" style="s2">when the war was over right and this</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.670" end="01:30:51.380" style="s2">this particular book which was called</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.380" end="01:30:54.830" style="s2">the German mother and her first child</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.380" end="01:30:58.320" style="s2">should have been put on a big heap and</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.830" end="01:31:00.540" style="s2">well maybe we should burn books but it</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.320" end="01:31:06.750" style="s2">should have just been it no I want to</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.540" end="01:31:08.850" style="s2">read it and instead the worst Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.750" end="01:31:11.340" style="s2">ideology was taken out of it it was</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.850" end="01:31:14.880" style="s2">republished and also translated to a</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.340" end="01:31:17.010" style="s2">number of European languages and sold</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.880" end="01:31:22.200" style="s2">continued to be sold throughout Europe</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.010" end="01:31:24.570" style="s2">so these ideas continued to affect you</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.200" end="01:31:25.860" style="s2">know people into the 1960s and then 70s</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.570" end="01:31:28.890" style="s2">there was a break with this you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.860" end="01:31:30.620" style="s2">late 60s there were the student revolts</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.890" end="01:31:33.090" style="s2">in Germany and then there was a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.620" end="01:31:34.980" style="s2">and and also student revolts in</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.090" end="01:31:37.800" style="s2">different parts of Europe and so it was</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.980" end="01:31:40.470" style="s2">you yeah exactly and so then this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.800" end="01:31:43.500" style="s2">started to be people distanced</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.470" end="01:31:46.650" style="s2">themselves from this but it continued to</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.500" end="01:31:49.920" style="s2">have an impact after the war so there</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.650" end="01:31:52.410" style="s2">are these continuities that means that</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.920" end="01:31:54.990" style="s2">the tendrils of the Nazis reached even</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.410" end="01:31:57.870" style="s2">further that&#39;s not to say that the</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.990" end="01:31:59.970" style="s2">techniques that were in there are solely</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.870" end="01:32:01.770" style="s2">attributable to the Nazis because they</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.970" end="01:32:03.240" style="s2">also drew on thinking that came before</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.770" end="01:32:04.140" style="s2">then this is you know there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.240" end="01:32:06.720" style="s2">intertwining</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.140" end="01:32:08.610" style="s2">you have responsible and even very high</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.720" end="01:32:09.870" style="s2">german thought with this very dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.610" end="01:32:12.120" style="s2">and lone</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.870" end="01:32:14.220" style="s2">theism authoritarian and</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.120" end="01:32:17.100" style="s2">authoritarianism and of course you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.220" end="01:32:20.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s no country on</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.100" end="01:32:22.800" style="s2">earth that&#39;s been immunized from the</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.190" end="01:32:24.210" style="s2">authoritarian tendencies and you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.800" end="01:32:25.800" style="s2">there are founding murders and</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.210" end="01:32:29.250" style="s2">atrocities found everywhere I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.800" end="01:32:33.210" style="s2">to overdo the idea that this is totally</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.250" end="01:32:35.790" style="s2">singular to Germany but just with this</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.210" end="01:32:37.860" style="s2">empathy riff maybe we could close it out</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.790" end="01:32:40.170" style="s2">by me asking for something that I would</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.860" end="01:32:42.450" style="s2">never be able to ask for if you hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.170" end="01:32:44.550" style="s2">done the hard work and might show a</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.450" end="01:32:47.490" style="s2">payoff to your family and and anyone</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.550" end="01:32:52.680" style="s2">else who&#39;s interested I would never want</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.490" end="01:32:54.780" style="s2">to hear a humanizing story about your</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.680" end="01:32:58.380" style="s2">life with your great with with your</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.780" end="01:33:01.890" style="s2">grandmother and not a Germanic one but</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.380" end="01:33:04.020" style="s2">because of this work I wonder if we</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.890" end="01:33:07.560" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t sort of explore a payoff of it</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.020" end="01:33:09.980" style="s2">which is can you take me into something</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.560" end="01:33:13.350" style="s2">that&#39;s really precious and sweet to you</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.980" end="01:33:16.320" style="s2">about your relationship with your</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.350" end="01:33:21.180" style="s2">grandma as you said it committed not see</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.320" end="01:33:23.520" style="s2">till 103 or whatever it is the this work</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.180" end="01:33:25.530" style="s2">opens up to show what the benefit is of</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.520" end="01:33:27.360" style="s2">actually confronting this that this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.530" end="01:33:29.160" style="s2">something that would be of interest to</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.360" end="01:33:30.630" style="s2">somebody who would would never be of</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.160" end="01:33:36.570" style="s2">interest to me and after it native their</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.630" end="01:33:40.890" style="s2">circumstance when I was writing the last</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.570" end="01:33:42.360" style="s2">chapter of my book and actually it was</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.890" end="01:33:44.850" style="s2">that was the short version of the book</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.360" end="01:33:46.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s no longer the last chapter but</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.850" end="01:33:48.750" style="s2">now it&#39;s somewhere in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.800" end="01:33:50.610" style="s2">book but it is the part of of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.750" end="01:33:52.530" style="s2">pendulum where I reflect on my</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.610" end="01:33:55.470" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s death because she passed</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.530" end="01:34:00.420" style="s2">away in 2014 somewhere in the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.470" end="01:34:05.970" style="s2">where I was doing my research and when I</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.420" end="01:34:08.490" style="s2">first excuse me when I first wrote this</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.970" end="01:34:12.750" style="s2">section about my reflection on her</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.490" end="01:34:15.390" style="s2">passing I hurled my fury at her and then</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.750" end="01:34:19.040" style="s2">I took those pages and I sat in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.390" end="01:34:22.560" style="s2">couch and I thought that&#39;s a lie that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.040" end="01:34:23.610" style="s2">a lie you&#39;re just doing that for</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.560" end="01:34:25.500" style="s2">everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.610" end="01:34:28.050" style="s2">because everybody else wants you to hate</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.500" end="01:34:32.969" style="s2">her yeah but you don&#39;t hate her you</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.050" end="01:34:36.600" style="s2">don&#39;t you love her but you also realize</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.969" end="01:34:38.190" style="s2">that she did she supported very bad</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.600" end="01:34:44.070" style="s2">things yep</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.190" end="01:34:48.510" style="s2">and so I wrote rewrote it and what I</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.070" end="01:34:52.409" style="s2">wrote there was a recognition that my</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.510" end="01:34:55.710" style="s2">grandmother had influenced me and formed</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.409" end="01:34:58.830" style="s2">my life in ways that I can never</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.710" end="01:35:05.000" style="s2">quantify she was an enormous influence</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.830" end="01:35:07.920" style="s2">on my life yeah yes she was and well</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.000" end="01:35:11.369" style="s2">partly led me into this research after</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.920" end="01:35:15.780" style="s2">all it was her willingness to speak with</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.369" end="01:35:21.780" style="s2">me over very very many years about many</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.780" end="01:35:24.239" style="s2">things just not just not certain pieces</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.780" end="01:35:28.050" style="s2">of that the essential truth was just</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.239" end="01:35:29.850" style="s2">that they were an SS couple but she was</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.050" end="01:35:35.210" style="s2">willing to speak with me about very many</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.850" end="01:35:41.280" style="s2">things opened up for me the gray zone</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.210" end="01:35:43.909" style="s2">that women inhabited under Nazism that</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.280" end="01:35:46.980" style="s2">they were both victims and perpetrators</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.909" end="01:35:50.750" style="s2">at the same time because Nazism also</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.980" end="01:35:56.190" style="s2">promoted male violence including at home</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.750" end="01:36:00.239" style="s2">and so I&#39;m very formed by her and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.190" end="01:36:03.630" style="s2">recognized it there and I went back to</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.239" end="01:36:07.230" style="s2">one particular memory which is which is</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.630" end="01:36:10.800" style="s2">a sweet memory of her that I try to keep</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.230" end="01:36:13.650" style="s2">in my mind I don&#39;t cling to it because I</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.800" end="01:36:18.869" style="s2">can actually today hold both the memory</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.650" end="01:36:20.969" style="s2">of her sitting there in a harsh voice</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.869" end="01:36:23.040" style="s2">trying to convince me the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.969" end="01:36:26.239" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen as well as this sweet</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.040" end="01:36:28.739" style="s2">memory but you can&#39;t let one memory</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.239" end="01:36:30.960" style="s2">erase the other one because then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.739" end="01:36:33.900" style="s2">not you&#39;re not dealing with the reality</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.960" end="01:36:36.980" style="s2">you&#39;re not facing the truth so the other</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.900" end="01:36:36.980" style="s2">memory is</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.019" end="01:36:43.800" style="s2">when I was a young girl and I was I was</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.519" end="01:36:47.460" style="s2">kind of chubby as some young girls are</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.800" end="01:36:49.530" style="s2">and my mother sent me to stay with her</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.460" end="01:36:51.300" style="s2">rather than in the apartment where the</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.530" end="01:36:55.110" style="s2">rest of the family were staying because</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.300" end="01:36:58.980" style="s2">my grandmother was into health food into</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.110" end="01:37:02.309" style="s2">healthy food and she had a way of</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.980" end="01:37:04.860" style="s2">handling food in a very sparing way as</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.309" end="01:37:06.360" style="s2">many people from a ward or generation</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.860" end="01:37:11.760" style="s2">people person has been through two world</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.360" end="01:37:14.849" style="s2">wars is very sparing with food and she</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.760" end="01:37:16.949" style="s2">would prepare a muesli for the following</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.849" end="01:37:19.650" style="s2">day the night before because it had to</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.949" end="01:37:24.960" style="s2">it had to rest before you ate it on the</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.650" end="01:37:28.650" style="s2">next morning it was a way of handling</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.960" end="01:37:30.599" style="s2">the fruits of the earth with respect in</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.650" end="01:37:34.289" style="s2">a way that we don&#39;t do in our consumer</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.599" end="01:37:36.840" style="s2">society that&#39;s a problem and we sat</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.289" end="01:37:39.329" style="s2">there grading an apple together and I</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.840" end="01:37:42.349" style="s2">would watch her grading this Apple with</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.329" end="01:37:45.679" style="s2">such reverence into this bowl because</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.349" end="01:37:48.960" style="s2">she really appreciated every ingredient</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.679" end="01:37:53.550" style="s2">and she would talk quietly to me in her</p>

<p begin="01:37:53.550" end="01:38:02.249" style="s2">having food the absence of food why this</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.400" end="01:38:04.639" style="s2">Apple was healthy and the next day the</p>
