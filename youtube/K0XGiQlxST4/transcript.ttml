<p begin="00:00:00.949" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">yesterday I held the preliminary event</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.430" end="00:00:13.200" style="s2">or a new idea which was we nicknamed</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:16.020" style="s2">oxytocin 36 people get together in pairs</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:17.400" style="s2">and answer the 36 questions that are in</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.020" end="00:00:22.289" style="s2">the description of the YouTube video</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.400" end="00:00:25.189" style="s2">that I&#39;m currently doing and it was it</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.289" end="00:00:25.189" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a success</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.449" end="00:00:33.149" style="s2">FaceTime no unzoom we did it on Zoom so</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.170" end="00:00:37.380" style="s2">one of my friends borrowed a paid zoom</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.149" end="00:00:39.600" style="s2">account she was a co-host and then I put</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.380" end="00:00:41.010" style="s2">it out and four people signed up only</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.600" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">one person one of my friends showed up</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.010" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">so Carrie ended up watching well my</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">friends and I did the 36 questions which</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">is why it both was a success and wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">a success one person showed up which</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:56.039" style="s2">theoretically in the past might have not</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">felt like a success but the fact I had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.039" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">co-host this time felt less vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">and more safe and then the person who</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">showed up I really loved and it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:08.070" style="s2">great to sit and have a hour and a half</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">conversation with him then also when</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:13.140" style="s2">putting this together to update you all</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:15.210" style="s2">I had been linking to the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">36 questions and people were like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.210" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2">behind a paywall it hasn&#39;t been hunted</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">behind a paywall for me but so I linked</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">to a different one and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">questions but they have a different</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">procedure because there&#39;s three sets of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">questions 12 12 and 12 and I mean Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:33.570" style="s2">magic turns answering them both and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">takes a lot it takes like an hour and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.570" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">half to go through them all but this</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">article that&#39;s linked suggest actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:43.049" style="s2">spending 15 minutes on the first set and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">when you&#39;re done the 50 the wind 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.049" end="00:01:46.350" style="s2">minutes expires you go on to the second</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">set and it&#39;s been 15 minutes than 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.350" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">minutes and that actually works because</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">we wanted to keep it to an hour for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">zoom conversations however only one</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:57.479" style="s2">person showed up part of that was my</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">branding I was like followed by with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">fellow human being which is too big it</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">needs to be like and I do want to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:07.950" style="s2">develop a deep connection but even</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:09.899" style="s2">that&#39;s probably too big it&#39;s like come</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.950" end="00:02:11.879" style="s2">experience affection for your fellow</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.899" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">human is that is that too big I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.879" end="00:02:17.460" style="s2">know but</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:19.170" style="s2">and also so the possibility of a future</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.460" end="00:02:21.510" style="s2">one I would like to do with a group of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.170" end="00:02:24.020" style="s2">people as opposed to me putting it on</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.510" end="00:02:26.760" style="s2">and hoping a group of people show up or</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.020" end="00:02:29.730" style="s2">I just keep posting them and hope that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.760" end="00:02:32.070" style="s2">people show up which doesn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.730" end="00:02:33.930" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the kind of thing that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.070" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">same person can show up to again and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.930" end="00:02:40.140" style="s2">again that&#39;s not true so like if just</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:42.090" style="s2">Daniel showed up and it&#39;s time we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.140" end="00:02:43.470" style="s2">paired off it doesn&#39;t work but if the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.090" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">three of us show up I guess you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.470" end="00:02:46.830" style="s2">Kerry and Daniel can have a have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:48.660" style="s2">conversation but if it can grow</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.830" end="00:02:50.610" style="s2">naturally if people can bring friends</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:52.590" style="s2">because they enjoy the experience then</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.610" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">there&#39;s always gonna be more people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.590" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">to meet what to pair off with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:03.180" style="s2">was eventually it would be its own</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:06.630" style="s2">platform but if people don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.180" end="00:03:08.790" style="s2">beauty of it if they&#39;re too scared for</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.630" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">whatever reason or two turned off</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.790" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">whatever I&#39;m offering in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">then they&#39;re not going to come and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:16.950" style="s2">experience it to decide for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:19.290" style="s2">is this something of value and so I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.950" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">only offer so much to the world of value</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.290" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">if they&#39;re not taking it right and I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:26.150" style="s2">only offer it in the way I&#39;m currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:29.100" style="s2">offering it I can&#39;t do much else</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.150" end="00:03:30.780" style="s2">luckily Kerry and I have found one</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.100" end="00:03:33.480" style="s2">another and she does fill a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.780" end="00:03:35.310" style="s2">roles that I I can&#39;t bill I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:38.820" style="s2">starting a whole new fire with community</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.310" end="00:03:40.769" style="s2">started because I no longer want to live</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.820" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">in the city I want to live out where I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.769" end="00:03:44.610" style="s2">can have a dog and a cat mother my kid</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:51.570" style="s2">can have a dog in a cat or there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.610" end="00:03:53.010" style="s2">kids where there&#39;s nature but I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.570" end="00:03:56.180" style="s2">none of the financial capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.010" end="00:03:58.170" style="s2">that um usually costs a lot of money I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.180" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">can&#39;t buy the land that you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.170" end="00:04:01.010" style="s2">have enough money for a tiny house even</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">if I was making it myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.010" end="00:04:06.330" style="s2">but I do know the power of groups coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:07.769" style="s2">together I was involved in the cohousing</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.330" end="00:04:09.750" style="s2">community that I&#39;m involved with in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.769" end="00:04:11.510" style="s2">Vancouver since the beginning I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.750" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">couldn&#39;t afford to buy and/or rent there</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.510" end="00:04:16.350" style="s2">so I know what the process is of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">starting a community and what I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.350" end="00:04:21.180" style="s2">to put forward restarting like a Medic a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:23.130" style="s2">meta community conversation not hey</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.180" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">let&#39;s start a new new community I know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:26.910" style="s2">how difficult that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:28.590" style="s2">it&#39;s like find the lands people fall off</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.910" end="00:04:30.810" style="s2">because it&#39;s the rot like and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.590" end="00:04:33.560" style="s2">working with a global community Soho</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.810" end="00:04:35.940" style="s2">trying to figure out what is the meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.560" end="00:04:37.080" style="s2">conversation for that what do you need</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.940" end="00:04:38.010" style="s2">to start a community and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.080" end="00:04:39.750" style="s2">people and there&#39;s actually written a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.010" end="00:04:43.500" style="s2">book on how to start a community which</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.750" end="00:04:44.729" style="s2">he linked but he it&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.500" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">looking for like I&#39;m not looking to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.729" end="00:04:47.820" style="s2">start one community I&#39;m looking to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:49.110" style="s2">a meta community that we can work</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.820" end="00:04:50.430" style="s2">through that process of what does it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.110" end="00:04:51.810" style="s2">take to start a community what what</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.430" end="00:04:54.660" style="s2">would our food systems our clever</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.810" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">education systems look like and create</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.660" end="00:04:57.240" style="s2">what is couple what came out of one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:04:59.550" style="s2">the solution raisins the solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.240" end="00:05:02.729" style="s2">raising on community I&#39;ll just link to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.550" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">the playlist one of the it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.729" end="00:05:07.490" style="s2">few ideas that came out of a solution</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:11.220" style="s2">reason that isn&#39;t technology specific</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.490" end="00:05:12.270" style="s2">specifically it&#39;s the idea of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.220" end="00:05:14.250" style="s2">groups of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.270" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">getting together and solving a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.250" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">problems for the meta community so you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:19.620" style="s2">get you know all the plumbers together</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:21.780" style="s2">and they would solve plumbing for not</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.620" end="00:05:23.160" style="s2">just their community but 100 communities</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.780" end="00:05:25.770" style="s2">right like what what do we need and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.160" end="00:05:28.410" style="s2">plumbing and then not only like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.770" end="00:05:30.180" style="s2">not forming a community and then working</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.410" end="00:05:32.220" style="s2">through this process you&#39;re forming a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:34.229" style="s2">meta community breaking off into smaller</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.220" end="00:05:35.430" style="s2">groups to deal with to tackle the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.229" end="00:05:38.010" style="s2">problem right so you&#39;re not coming up</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.430" end="00:05:39.960" style="s2">with one way to energize it as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.010" end="00:05:41.580" style="s2">community because that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.960" end="00:05:43.470" style="s2">work for all of them have to collect the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.580" end="00:05:45.570" style="s2">information know what&#39;s out there decide</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.470" end="00:05:46.890" style="s2">if and if it works and if not I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.570" end="00:05:50.250" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to create our</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.890" end="00:05:51.450" style="s2">own solar panels but evaluate what&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.250" end="00:05:54.120" style="s2">there what works in what in what</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.450" end="00:05:56.370" style="s2">communities and doing that process and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.120" end="00:05:57.599" style="s2">that could absolutely be done with ten</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.370" end="00:06:00.360" style="s2">thousand people in a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.599" end="00:06:02.460" style="s2">dollars creating that platform that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.360" end="00:06:04.650" style="s2">looks at but it doesn&#39;t even need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.460" end="00:06:05.210" style="s2">a platform in the beginning but anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.650" end="00:06:06.680" style="s2">hope</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.210" end="00:06:09.800" style="s2">vision out there people respond in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.680" end="00:06:11.210" style="s2">that is how they read into the vision</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.800" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">just like yes I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.210" end="00:06:14.870" style="s2">communities yes read this book because</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:17.060" style="s2">it&#39;s in a way so we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.870" end="00:06:18.680" style="s2">put out a doodle poll of when there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.060" end="00:06:21.169" style="s2">some people interested so I put out a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.680" end="00:06:23.240" style="s2">doodle poll that one they would like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.169" end="00:06:25.009" style="s2">meet on Monday or Tuesday and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.240" end="00:06:30.229" style="s2">it becomes a weekly conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.009" end="00:06:32.750" style="s2">even that scheduling people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.229" end="00:06:34.009" style="s2">global is difficult it&#39;s more easy now</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.750" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">the people most people were homeless for</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.009" end="00:06:38.930" style="s2">the time but finding times that work for</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:40.729" style="s2">people around the world but that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.930" end="00:06:43.310" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem we need to solve is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.729" end="00:06:44.419" style="s2">time zones that because there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.310" end="00:06:45.710" style="s2">over the world who speak different</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.419" end="00:06:48.889" style="s2">languages are in different time zones</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.710" end="00:06:54.380" style="s2">how do you coordinate globally I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.889" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">ideas with people okay people have to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.380" end="00:06:59.750" style="s2">willing to try them I can do them and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:01.789" style="s2">what&#39;s the troubleshoot them figure out</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.750" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">what works in the desert there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.789" end="00:07:05.150" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for people there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:08.990" style="s2">percolating in my head that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.150" end="00:07:11.000" style="s2">Peter Joseph did it tweet about Herman</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.990" end="00:07:12.500" style="s2">Oh somewhat starting some TV show about</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.000" end="00:07:13.940" style="s2">solutions like no one would watch</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.500" end="00:07:16.789" style="s2">because you&#39;re all - idiots it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.940" end="00:07:18.110" style="s2">basically his personality and and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.789" end="00:07:19.159" style="s2">people are like no no I watch and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.110" end="00:07:21.560" style="s2">like I&#39;m kidding I&#39;m not gonna actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.159" end="00:07:23.330" style="s2">do that because you know podcasts aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">I think it was a podcast of some of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.330" end="00:07:29.780" style="s2">aren&#39;t as valuable is like let&#39;s say his</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:32.210" style="s2">zeitgeist documentaries and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.780" end="00:07:34.820" style="s2">can we just have a solutions show please</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.210" end="00:07:36.770" style="s2">and even like Peter Joseph who I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.820" end="00:07:39.530" style="s2">is brilliant and I really like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.770" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">zeitgeist movies has had a level of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.530" end="00:07:43.430" style="s2">success in Game a that I don&#39;t think and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:44.719" style="s2">because now he&#39;s so tied to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.430" end="00:07:46.849" style="s2">resource-based economy and the zeitgeist</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.719" end="00:07:49.969" style="s2">movement that he couldn&#39;t possibly see</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.849" end="00:07:51.229" style="s2">ideas outside of that so it which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.969" end="00:07:52.849" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been bringing up since I</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.229" end="00:07:56.990" style="s2">entered the zeitgeist movement like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.849" end="00:07:59.719" style="s2">decade ago was you can&#39;t implement</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.990" end="00:08:01.130" style="s2">something globally you can&#39;t dog on</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.719" end="00:08:02.810" style="s2">everybody&#39;s religion and expect people</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.130" end="00:08:05.659" style="s2">to come on board I have some critique of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.810" end="00:08:07.460" style="s2">the zeitgeist but the biggest one is</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.659" end="00:08:09.080" style="s2">like what do we do now like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.460" end="00:08:10.430" style="s2">actually move forward and their whole is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.080" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">like well we educate people for when</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.430" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a collapse then we&#39;ll be ready</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:16.370" style="s2">for it I&#39;m like that is not how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.240" end="00:08:19.630" style="s2">economy sociology any of it works</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.370" end="00:08:21.710" style="s2">hello and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.630" end="00:08:25.250" style="s2">anyway but there&#39;s something percolating</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.710" end="00:08:27.560" style="s2">about having a show of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.250" end="00:08:30.500" style="s2">actually solving the problems like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.560" end="00:08:33.170" style="s2">solution raising but having it be a core</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.500" end="00:08:34.790" style="s2">group of people who meet and develop</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.170" end="00:08:37.160" style="s2">more of what I have in the Omega group</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.790" end="00:08:38.630" style="s2">and hopefully becomes not just broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.160" end="00:08:40.220" style="s2">where we&#39;re solving the problems and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.630" end="00:08:42.230" style="s2">everyone&#39;s jumping on board but it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.220" end="00:08:44.810" style="s2">inspires other people to start solution</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.230" end="00:08:46.790" style="s2">clubs who get together and have their</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.810" end="00:08:48.920" style="s2">own solution risings every week and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.790" end="00:08:50.840" style="s2">where&#39;s a way we can compile those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.920" end="00:08:53.060" style="s2">that come out of there and vote on them</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.840" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">and Co fund them together because for</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.060" end="00:08:56.360" style="s2">people coming up with one a solution</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:59.270" style="s2">that 10,000 people can implement with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.360" end="00:09:01.340" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.270" end="00:09:04.850" style="s2">it&#39;s basically like one person coming up</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.340" end="00:09:07.490" style="s2">with it it we need to have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.850" end="00:09:10.400" style="s2">developing ideas developing solutions</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.490" end="00:09:12.260" style="s2">that are voluntary but that amalgamate a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.400" end="00:09:15.380" style="s2">lot of people so the risk is spread out</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.260" end="00:09:17.540" style="s2">and people like the ideas everyone puts</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.380" end="00:09:20.840" style="s2">in ten dollars that&#39;s not a high risk</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.540" end="00:09:23.720" style="s2">for any of them or don&#39;t do it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.840" end="00:09:26.290" style="s2">and so even even if and when it fails</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.720" end="00:09:28.670" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not perfect it&#39;s not a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.290" end="00:09:30.920" style="s2">not saying it&#39;s gonna be perfect right</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.670" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">it&#39;s an for ten dollars you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.920" end="00:09:34.460" style="s2">get an entire new food system or you</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">never have to pay a dollar but you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.460" end="00:09:38.540" style="s2">get a food app that helps you need</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:40.460" style="s2">healthier for cheaper and cheaper with</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.540" end="00:09:42.530" style="s2">connection to your neighbors right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.460" end="00:09:44.090" style="s2">starting point and then developing it</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.530" end="00:09:46.340" style="s2">and making it better and better is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.090" end="00:09:47.870" style="s2">we&#39;re doing we&#39;ve had solution reasons</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.340" end="00:09:49.370" style="s2">and some powerful ideas have come out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.870" end="00:09:50.900" style="s2">them and then people want to move</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.370" end="00:09:53.780" style="s2">forward with the idea and I&#39;m like by</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.900" end="00:09:55.940" style="s2">all means go forward with the idea but</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.780" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">for people creating it is just as risky</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.940" end="00:09:59.090" style="s2">as one like you still have to get well</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:00.530" style="s2">do you have ten thousand people no</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.090" end="00:10:02.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the point is it like you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.530" end="00:10:04.220" style="s2">first to have ten thousand people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.060" end="00:10:06.200" style="s2">are willing to fund it Willie and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.220" end="00:10:09.740" style="s2">the idea draws them in enough that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.200" end="00:10:11.960" style="s2">can see they get more benefit than risk</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.740" end="00:10:13.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s only ten dollars of risk so it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.960" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be that high of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.520" end="00:10:18.410" style="s2">benefit in order to draw people in but</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:20.930" style="s2">we&#39;re not we don&#39;t have a platform of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.410" end="00:10:22.280" style="s2">millions of people right so if there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.930" end="00:10:25.510" style="s2">a million people who are gonna watch a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.280" end="00:10:27.560" style="s2">video and one tenth of one percent</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.510" end="00:10:29.150" style="s2">signed up that would be a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.560" end="00:10:31.790" style="s2">they think and one hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.150" end="00:10:33.220" style="s2">starting the community can easily elite</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.790" end="00:10:37.180" style="s2">to ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.220" end="00:10:38.920" style="s2">I can get that right no one set the 1% a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.180" end="00:10:40.300" style="s2">thousand times a thousand is a million</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.920" end="00:10:42.339" style="s2">so it would be a salad some people would</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:47.589" style="s2">be was ten percent would be ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.339" end="00:10:49.480" style="s2">one percent would be ten thousand yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.589" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">and one in a thousand would be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.480" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">thousand well now good good job right oh</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.110" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know what is happening with</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.430" end="00:11:02.139" style="s2">oxytocin thirty six I made it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:04.839" style="s2">kind of there hoping that something</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.139" end="00:11:06.339" style="s2">happens with it if something pops up</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.839" end="00:11:07.899" style="s2">where it&#39;s very obvious a community</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.339" end="00:11:10.180" style="s2">needs it or wants it I will absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.899" end="00:11:11.500" style="s2">host one in the future but I was hoping</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.180" end="00:11:14.319" style="s2">this one would be much more successful</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.500" end="00:11:16.660" style="s2">and people would pair up and then we</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.319" end="00:11:18.579" style="s2">would they want to come back another</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.660" end="00:11:20.470" style="s2">week and then we pair them up again and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.579" end="00:11:21.399" style="s2">ask them to bring a friend but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.470" end="00:11:23.620" style="s2">not what happened</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.399" end="00:11:26.199" style="s2">and it could be like I can always do</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.620" end="00:11:27.759" style="s2">another one but I don&#39;t there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.199" end="00:11:29.800" style="s2">something about asking someone to sit</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.759" end="00:11:31.720" style="s2">with someone for an hour that we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.800" end="00:11:34.149" style="s2">not quite ready with oh we&#39;re ready for</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.720" end="00:11:36.459" style="s2">in society but finding a way that people</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.149" end="00:11:38.399" style="s2">can connect in a way that&#39;s powerful for</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.459" end="00:11:42.069" style="s2">them and then bring them in and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.399" end="00:11:44.170" style="s2">give them tools to generate ideas and</p>
