<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:33.510" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna open by asking you a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.510" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">bit about Jordan Peterson at the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.510" end="00:00:37.620" style="s2">feeling that all over the content and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">all of our channel is about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.620" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">Pederson I think it&#39;s I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:43.469" style="s2">for that is because I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">really interesting window into some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.469" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">the deeper topics that I&#39;m really hoping</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">to to explore with you about masculine</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">and feminine and where we are culturally</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:54.899" style="s2">because I think the phenomena of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:55.949" style="s2">Pederson and the reaction to him for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.899" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">at least there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.949" end="00:01:02.489" style="s2">archetypal about where we are in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">culture and so I&#39;d love to hear what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.489" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">know just what you made of this this</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:08.909" style="s2">incredible kind of phenomena that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">erupting over the last kind of year or</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.909" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">so I was so excited to see Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:22.369" style="s2">Peterson erupted onto the stage and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:29.810" style="s2">know you had particularly part in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.369" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">there is a culture war that is in bright</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.810" end="00:01:35.850" style="s2">precedence I mean we are in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">of a culture war there&#39;s a polarization</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.850" end="00:01:42.210" style="s2">and Jordan Peterson is standing in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">middle as a lightning rod taking all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.210" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">projections from both sides he clearly</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">sees the postmodern ideology and it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">an ideology it&#39;s a system of beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">values that will not lead us to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">promised land it is it is problematic it</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">leads us into a swamp with no exit</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:14.489" style="s2">it is not sustainable he sees it very</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:18.569" style="s2">clearly and in my opinion he sees that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.489" end="00:02:22.410" style="s2">from a modern perspective very brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.569" end="00:02:25.560" style="s2">modern perspective he&#39;s and he has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.410" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">depth because of his understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:31.709" style="s2">Carl Jung and his own work in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">the field of psychology that is deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.709" end="00:02:39.260" style="s2">than most people so people are drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:44.300" style="s2">that depth he sees something much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.260" end="00:02:44.300" style="s2">then other people are seeing right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.069" end="00:02:55.250" style="s2">for me when I see him describing this</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.140" end="00:02:58.380" style="s2">ideology of postmodern a Galit Aryan</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.250" end="00:03:02.100" style="s2">relativism and describing it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.380" end="00:03:06.840" style="s2">precisely and then I listen to Ken</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.100" end="00:03:09.239" style="s2">Wilber describing the same disease there</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.840" end="00:03:11.700" style="s2">are some interesting differences between</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.239" end="00:03:15.890" style="s2">their two descriptions and there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.700" end="00:03:15.890" style="s2">even more interesting similarities</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.670" end="00:03:24.180" style="s2">Jordan Peterson has the depth of Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.630" end="00:03:27.989" style="s2">perspective and Ken has that too he</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.180" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">studied Jung anointment but he has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.989" end="00:03:34.769" style="s2">much bigger philosophical view that is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:38.220" style="s2">little bit more evolved past into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.769" end="00:03:41.730" style="s2">integral Brown but the two perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.220" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">are fascinating to me and both of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">are critical the antidote the medicine</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">for the the post modernity</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">I believe Ken sees and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:04:02.069" style="s2">Jordan Peterson does and Ken has a name</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">for this he calls it a perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.069" end="00:04:10.109" style="s2">madness and it is madness there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">out are the culture war in our our</p>

<p begin="00:04:23.730" end="00:04:28.590" style="s2">madness is kind of best summarized as</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.530" end="00:04:32.420" style="s2">this idea there is no truth and yet that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.590" end="00:04:37.470" style="s2">is a truth that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.420" end="00:04:40.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the Vanille ISM the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.470" end="00:04:43.920" style="s2">relativistic nil ISM which is saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.920" end="00:04:46.980" style="s2">there is no absolute truth and that&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.750" end="00:05:17.780" style="s2">are studies that show that I&#39;m a member</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.950" end="00:05:22.590" style="s2">of the Me Generation narcissistic</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">just breaks my heart open there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.190" end="00:05:40.650" style="s2">out of that no way out and when I work</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:44.280" style="s2">with the Millennials it breaks my heart</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.650" end="00:05:47.880" style="s2">I feel such compassion first of all</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:50.990" style="s2">everybody&#39;s lied to them everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.880" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">told them what they believe is the truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.990" end="00:05:55.950" style="s2">and no one&#39;s told them the truth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">really interesting that you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.950" end="00:05:59.970" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about compassion there</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:02.670" style="s2">because I&#39;d say there&#39;s two there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.970" end="00:06:04.920" style="s2">things firstly the difference I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.670" end="00:06:07.800" style="s2">with with Ken Wilbur&#39;s attitude towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.920" end="00:06:10.320" style="s2">what he calls the broken green and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.800" end="00:06:11.550" style="s2">that this maps on to what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.320" end="00:06:16.500" style="s2">Peterson would describer sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.550" end="00:06:19.980" style="s2">postmodern neo-marxist worldview is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.500" end="00:06:22.230" style="s2">Ken seems to see it as a necessary stage</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.980" end="00:06:24.690" style="s2">of development and I get the sense with</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.230" end="00:06:27.240" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and he&#39;s so he rejects</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.690" end="00:06:29.340" style="s2">it so much that he he doesn&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.240" end="00:06:32.310" style="s2">a necessary stage at all he just sees it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.340" end="00:06:33.780" style="s2">as a complete wrong turn in society but</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.310" end="00:06:35.340" style="s2">the other the other point is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.780" end="00:06:37.650" style="s2">you mentioned compassion for the people</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.340" end="00:06:40.890" style="s2">who are stuck in this this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.650" end="00:06:42.870" style="s2">have where I have a difficulty with with</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.890" end="00:06:44.940" style="s2">Jordan Peterson is that I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.870" end="00:06:47.400" style="s2">that compassion for from him a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.940" end="00:06:50.670" style="s2">the time he attacks it so strongly that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.400" end="00:06:52.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t feel whereas I would like what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.670" end="00:06:55.050" style="s2">would like to see a bit more from him as</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.440" end="00:06:57.540" style="s2">this sense of these people are have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.050" end="00:06:59.010" style="s2">misdirected they&#39;ve been misguided and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.540" end="00:07:02.190" style="s2">sense of sort of almost like fatherly</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.010" end="00:07:03.960" style="s2">kind of concern for them as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.190" end="00:07:06.860" style="s2">need to eradicate this kind of worldview</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.960" end="00:07:08.940" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong it leads to the Gulag data</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.860" end="00:07:10.800" style="s2">which is interesting maybe that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.940" end="00:07:13.860" style="s2">Zen compassion that you&#39;re bringing in</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.140" end="00:07:44.910" style="s2">during the 60s and is characterized by</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.490" end="00:11:18.900" style="s2">knows so this was like putting it a key</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.710" end="00:11:21.930" style="s2">like Jordan Peterson talks about putting</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.180" end="00:11:37.650" style="s2">the Lord because the Lord knows it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.190" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">introduced me to that I began to read</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:31.380" style="s2">started meditating about the same time</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.720" end="00:12:34.350" style="s2">and I there was a an image and a words</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.380" end="00:12:37.050" style="s2">that came out of nowhere as if from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.350" end="00:12:39.060" style="s2">top of the mountain I was worried about</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.050" end="00:12:41.460" style="s2">what am I gonna do when I grow up and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.060" end="00:12:43.770" style="s2">all of a sudden these words boomed out</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.460" end="00:12:45.030" style="s2">of nowhere rather than finding your</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.770" end="00:12:48.270" style="s2">place in the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.030" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">first find yourself and there will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.270" end="00:12:57.620" style="s2">your place Here I am a so-called master</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:13:00.990" style="s2">of Zen a lineage older and Rinzai Zen</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.990" end="00:13:09.879" style="s2">how perfect is this and I had read</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.620" end="00:13:13.689" style="s2">Jung&#39;s work by the time I was 24 I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.879" end="00:13:17.050" style="s2">like you thinks I see the same things</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.689" end="00:13:22.050" style="s2">you saw the movement of collective</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.050" end="00:13:26.500" style="s2">shadows what I see happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.050" end="00:13:28.439" style="s2">breaks my heart open hmm nobody else</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.500" end="00:13:32.439" style="s2">sees what I see</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.439" end="00:13:37.149" style="s2">Jordon Peterson smells it I suspect but</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.439" end="00:13:42.220" style="s2">I doesn&#39;t sound like he sees it what do</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.149" end="00:13:46.199" style="s2">you say I&#39;d rather not say I have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.220" end="00:13:49.750" style="s2">sense that what we are seeing is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.199" end="00:13:53.319" style="s2">eruption of the shadow in a big cultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.750" end="00:13:55.329" style="s2">way and a lot of that is due to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.319" end="00:13:57.850" style="s2">is facilitated by technology we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.329" end="00:13:59.620" style="s2">technology that suddenly so now not</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.850" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">everything before was going through a</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.620" end="00:14:04.420" style="s2">few different channels the broadcaster&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:06.069" style="s2">the the mainstream media and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.420" end="00:14:07.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve democratized the media we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.069" end="00:14:10.509" style="s2">democratized a lot of the information</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.660" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">and so what I see happening is that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.509" end="00:14:17.079" style="s2">have all of these things that were kept</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:19.180" style="s2">out of the behind closed doors or were</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.079" end="00:14:22.149" style="s2">just we assumed we&#39;re not part of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">society anymore now erupting out of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.149" end="00:14:27.639" style="s2">cracks between things</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:30.100" style="s2">beginning to you I agree I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.639" end="00:14:32.589" style="s2">just the beginning of we have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.100" end="00:14:36.040" style="s2">what&#39;s coming I think we maybe have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.589" end="00:14:39.309" style="s2">suspicion I don&#39;t think we do probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.040" end="00:14:41.050" style="s2">but but that&#39;s my sense and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.309" end="00:14:43.750" style="s2">I wonder whether what you&#39;re referring</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.050" end="00:14:45.639" style="s2">to is that same sense that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.750" end="00:14:50.829" style="s2">have to do some serious shadow work as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.639" end="00:14:54.579" style="s2">culture over the next to survive to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.829" end="00:14:56.559" style="s2">survive yeah what you&#39;re pointing to and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.579" end="00:14:59.370" style="s2">what you&#39;re seeing with technology in</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.559" end="00:15:02.170" style="s2">your position as being part of the media</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.370" end="00:15:04.870" style="s2">for the first time in human history I</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.170" end="00:15:07.230" style="s2">have access on my cell phone to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.870" end="00:15:11.470" style="s2">great works of the greatest thinkers and</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.780" end="00:15:27.880" style="s2">before we have the ability to to look on</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.880" end="00:15:35.970" style="s2">these teachers never happened before if</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.500" end="00:15:40.740" style="s2">we have no idea how this is gonna impact</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.970" end="00:15:40.740" style="s2">consciousness and the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.850" end="00:15:51.280" style="s2">we just are in such a bold experiment</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.190" end="00:15:56.650" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to be amazing what</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.280" end="00:15:59.710" style="s2">happens and terrifying I suspect I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.650" end="00:16:02.380" style="s2">hardly wait to see what it is do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.710" end="00:16:04.180" style="s2">have an idea of time scales because</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.380" end="00:16:07.210" style="s2">things seem to be accelerating very</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.180" end="00:16:11.290" style="s2">quickly they are accelerating there is</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.790" end="00:16:27.880" style="s2">persistent illusion so is the south most</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:34.150" style="s2">this ego is so persistent but it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.050" end="00:17:02.770" style="s2">think this is very interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.510" end="00:17:05.620" style="s2">it seems quite clear that whatever was</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.770" end="00:17:10.270" style="s2">sparked in the 60s the culture war that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.620" end="00:17:13.060" style="s2">kind of yes certainly was fueled by what</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.639" end="00:19:49.450" style="s2">so this is those two things shadow work</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.700" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">and evolution you you mentioned shadow</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.450" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">work and that was pretty much the main</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.909" end="00:20:55.029" style="s2">individuals and I guess a whole society</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.309" end="00:21:00.399" style="s2">that&#39;s a really big question and I trust</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.210" end="00:28:38.649" style="s2">we&#39;ve confused is the complementarity of</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.570" end="00:28:54.850" style="s2">is to really ground ourselves in our</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.850" end="00:28:59.980" style="s2">able to meet the in a feminine which we</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.679" end="00:29:02.830" style="s2">also have as men and the outer feminine</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.980" end="00:29:06.480" style="s2">as well and it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.830" end="00:29:08.590" style="s2">the paradox of the sacred marriage of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.480" end="00:29:11.549" style="s2">masculine feminine but that can only</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.590" end="00:29:17.169" style="s2">happen if we really go into our own</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.549" end="00:29:21.100" style="s2">biological reality so I completely agree</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.100" end="00:29:26.649" style="s2">want to add another confusing</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">complication to that confusion that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.649" end="00:29:32.950" style="s2">articulated there are really two things</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:39.669" style="s2">going on that are merged together like</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.950" end="00:29:42.580" style="s2">trauma one is developmental we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.669" end="00:29:45.029" style="s2">from modernity to postmodernity to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.580" end="00:29:49.739" style="s2">something that will work whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.029" end="00:29:55.779" style="s2">post modernity is not working it&#39;s stuck</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.739" end="00:29:59.619" style="s2">it&#39;s not sustainable so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.779" end="00:30:03.669" style="s2">that&#39;s going on then we have this battle</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.619" end="00:30:05.559" style="s2">between masculine and feminine you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.669" end="00:30:09.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like an argument that needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.559" end="00:30:11.710" style="s2">marriage a sacred marriage these two</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.730" end="00:30:14.409" style="s2">things are confusing enough in</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.710" end="00:30:17.230" style="s2">themselves but when we merge them into</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.409" end="00:30:19.629" style="s2">one mess and try to solve the one mess</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.230" end="00:30:21.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a far bigger problem than can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.629" end="00:30:26.090" style="s2">solved it&#39;s a wicked problem that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.950" end="00:30:28.100" style="s2">no solution and we&#39;re stuck there so</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.090" end="00:30:32.360" style="s2">what you&#39;re pointing to is just half of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.100" end="00:30:34.970" style="s2">it there&#39;s another half that is equally</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.360" end="00:30:37.519" style="s2">problematic and the combination and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.970" end="00:30:42.490" style="s2">there&#39;s probably more confusion that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.519" end="00:30:46.149" style="s2">not seeing but this makes it unsolvable</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.490" end="00:30:48.980" style="s2">with this approach we must separate that</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.149" end="00:30:52.850" style="s2">differentiate these two things and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.980" end="00:30:55.340" style="s2">work on them independently and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.850" end="00:31:00.139" style="s2">got one of them very clearly so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.340" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">talk about that one I understand as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.139" end="00:31:06.260" style="s2">that you were part of some of the early</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:09.019" style="s2">explorations of what you might call the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.260" end="00:31:13.970" style="s2">the men&#39;s movement yes could you talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.019" end="00:31:19.970" style="s2">about that Oh be careful how much time</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.970" end="00:31:22.809" style="s2">do you have I was part of an</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.970" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">organization called the mankind project</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.809" end="00:31:32.269" style="s2">something happened after I became very</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:35.960" style="s2">active in the mankind project I had to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.269" end="00:31:39.380" style="s2">go attend to my mother who was ill and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.960" end="00:31:43.630" style="s2">when I came back there was a complete</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:58.909" style="s2">these these men teaching us that we were</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.889" end="00:32:01.190" style="s2">prejudiced and they neglected to mention</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.909" end="00:32:04.250" style="s2">the fact that they were prejudiced as</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.190" end="00:32:07.510" style="s2">well but we could smell it you know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.250" end="00:32:12.950" style="s2">they were prejudiced against prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.510" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">everybody&#39;s with theirs and it stunk</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.770" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">like it absolutely is of course but you</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.560" end="00:33:11.610" style="s2">need to own the fact that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.940" end="00:34:21.880" style="s2">when I try to teat treat people as</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.430" end="00:34:25.090" style="s2">though everybody&#39;s equal it&#39;s such a</p>

<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:47.190" style="s2">hmm and moral dilemmas lie at the core</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.860" end="00:34:49.830" style="s2">of culture wars this is something that</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.830" end="00:34:54.600" style="s2">treat everyone with respect otherwise it</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.200" end="00:34:55.580" style="s2">devalues the currency there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.600" end="00:34:58.260" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.580" end="00:35:01.050" style="s2">treating people with common decency is</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.260" end="00:35:03.150" style="s2">one thing treating everyone you meet</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.050" end="00:35:08.280" style="s2">with respect is something different</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.150" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">because respect is earned I have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.280" end="00:35:12.870" style="s2">little semantic difference in the way I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:14.370" style="s2">would describe that I get the spirit of</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.490" end="00:35:24.600" style="s2">respect everyone this is a mark of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.450" end="00:35:26.790" style="s2">I would call awakened mind respect for</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.600" end="00:35:31.380" style="s2">everyone the difference what must be</p>
