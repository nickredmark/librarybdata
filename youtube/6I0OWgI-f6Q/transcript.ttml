<p begin="00:00:04.440" end="00:00:08.760" style="s2">create a new field of science that</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.600" end="00:00:10.880" style="s2">integrates all the knowledge and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.760" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">cognitive and behavioral sciences and</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.880" end="00:00:17.640" style="s2">uses it to create rigorous methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:23.070" style="s2">for addressing global change in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.640" end="00:00:27.590" style="s2">century specifically I want to study how</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.070" end="00:00:30.840" style="s2">we collectively respond to what I call</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.590" end="00:00:33.149" style="s2">systemic risk by a systemic risk I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">that there are problems that arise in</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.149" end="00:00:39.510" style="s2">one area that affect one system that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:42.800" style="s2">then propagate into other areas in other</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.510" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">systems and can have a cascade effect of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.800" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">damage and harm a recent example as the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:53.370" style="s2">earthquake that took place off of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">coast of Japan in early 2011 that caused</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.370" end="00:00:59.449" style="s2">the creation of a tsunami that tsunami</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">flooded the lowland areas of Japan it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.449" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">spread to where there were nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">reactors went over their walls flooded</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">the reactors caused a meltdown of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">core of those reactors which then caused</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.580" style="s2">a huge explosion a release of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">radioactive material into the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.580" end="00:01:18.020" style="s2">that&#39;s contaminated the region and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">some extent various parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.020" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">so have these problems where there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">different systems that are all</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">interconnected with each other and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">risks flow from one system to another</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">and often unexpected ways ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">didn&#39;t anticipate when we designed those</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">systems and what I found in the last</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">several years is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:42.990" style="s2">particular piece of this problem that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:46.070" style="s2">really essential to get right if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.990" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">going to solve it and that piece is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.070" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">human beings embeddedness into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">system how do people think about and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:55.430" style="s2">understand the systems that are embedded</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:59.250" style="s2">in what are the tools and procedures</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.430" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">protocols that they use to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.250" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">these different systems say when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">a disaster what are the emergency</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2">response protocols</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">how does disaster relief get done how</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">does medical care get provided to people</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">on the ground all the ways that human</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:16.950" style="s2">beings respond and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">to these big challenges when I found is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.950" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">that there are a lot of assumptions out</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.810" end="00:02:23.819" style="s2">there about human beings they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">based on what I call a priori philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.819" end="00:02:30.569" style="s2">which means assumptions that are coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">about beforehand before thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.569" end="00:02:35.099" style="s2">how people actually work but what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:38.280" style="s2">happening is this there was a silent</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.099" end="00:02:40.920" style="s2">revolution in academia where in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.280" end="00:02:42.690" style="s2">cognitive and behavioral sciences a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.920" end="00:02:44.819" style="s2">view of human nature is emerging that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.690" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">scientifically rigorous and cures</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.819" end="00:02:52.079" style="s2">empirically sound testable and extremely</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:54.840" style="s2">useful for answering questions about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.079" end="00:02:58.769" style="s2">human beings connect up or interface</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.840" end="00:03:00.959" style="s2">with global systems so unfortunately all</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.769" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">the knowledge and cognitive science like</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.959" end="00:03:04.470" style="s2">so many fields of knowledge in academia</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:06.420" style="s2">and in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.470" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">they&#39;re siloed from each other and two</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.420" end="00:03:11.510" style="s2">disciplines like psychology and even</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:15.299" style="s2">more narrowly personality research or</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.510" end="00:03:16.980" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience or other areas</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.299" end="00:03:19.950" style="s2">like linguistics in the study of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.980" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">language across cultures and so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.950" end="00:03:23.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve what I found in my study of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:27.359" style="s2">cognitive science is that too many</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.970" end="00:03:30.569" style="s2">researchers and practitioners are stuck</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.359" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">within those categories as boxes they</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.569" end="00:03:34.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know about the findings and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:36.329" style="s2">tools that are coming out of other areas</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.200" end="00:03:38.519" style="s2">and increasingly the problems that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.329" end="00:03:40.170" style="s2">have to address require higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.519" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">synthesis and integration of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.170" end="00:03:47.400" style="s2">in order for them to be solved so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing to do is to enter a ph.d</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.400" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">program preferably at a university that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:54.780" style="s2">has a wide array of very</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:59.069" style="s2">forward-thinking research centers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.780" end="00:04:02.459" style="s2">what I want to do is to map out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.069" end="00:04:04.829" style="s2">knowledge the methodologies that exist</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.459" end="00:04:08.579" style="s2">in the cognitive and behavioral sciences</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.829" end="00:04:12.060" style="s2">that can be packaged together to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.579" end="00:04:14.190" style="s2">more robust tools for analysis as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.060" end="00:04:17.579" style="s2">as implementation tools for actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.190" end="00:04:19.139" style="s2">going in and changing systems designing</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.579" end="00:04:21.570" style="s2">them so that the human interface works</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.139" end="00:04:24.539" style="s2">better so that we can respond to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.570" end="00:04:25.770" style="s2">systemic threats now one example to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.539" end="00:04:26.790" style="s2">really get you thinking more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.770" end="00:04:28.020" style="s2">about this there</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.790" end="00:04:31.230" style="s2">an area of research in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.020" end="00:04:34.260" style="s2">psychology that looks at what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.230" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">metacognition in group process which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.260" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">basically looking at tools that are used</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.020" end="00:04:42.420" style="s2">by people in a group that help them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:44.670" style="s2">work together as a group to have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.420" end="00:04:46.920" style="s2">collective intelligence a really simple</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.670" end="00:04:49.170" style="s2">example is a visualization tool so there</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.920" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">might be that there&#39;s a flow chart that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.170" end="00:04:52.740" style="s2">shows everyone what the project is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:54.540" style="s2">problem they&#39;re solving what all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.740" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">vital pieces are the timeline that needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.540" end="00:04:57.900" style="s2">to be used to solve them and what each</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:00.120" style="s2">person&#39;s part is the tasks and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.900" end="00:05:01.890" style="s2">responsibilities to go through that flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.120" end="00:05:04.230" style="s2">chart and help contribute to solving a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.890" end="00:05:07.350" style="s2">more complex task so that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.230" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">example of a form of metacognition a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.350" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">of thinking embedded outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:13.770" style="s2">individual and in the group that&#39;s used</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">to help them see the complexity and to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.770" end="00:05:17.850" style="s2">see their place and addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:20.570" style="s2">complexity effectively and fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.850" end="00:05:23.670" style="s2">their role so what I want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.570" end="00:05:26.580" style="s2">create an an inventory if you will or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.670" end="00:05:29.190" style="s2">map a taxonomy of all the different</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.580" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">tools and theories the methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.190" end="00:05:33.090" style="s2">that exist in the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:37.110" style="s2">behavioral sciences that could be used</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.090" end="00:05:39.090" style="s2">for disaster relief for designing change</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.110" end="00:05:40.860" style="s2">in urban landscapes to help us</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.090" end="00:05:44.280" style="s2">transition away from fossil fuels and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:47.750" style="s2">other big challenges and I want to apply</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:51.090" style="s2">this knowledge in collaboration with</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.750" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">people who are on the ground trying to</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">I feel like there&#39;s a desperate need for</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.290" end="00:05:59.700" style="s2">this I feel like it doesn&#39;t really exist</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:01.260" style="s2">anywhere and it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.700" end="00:06:03.390" style="s2">been working on for a number of years</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.260" end="00:06:05.420" style="s2">and I know that I can&#39;t finish it</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.390" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">without going back into academia</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.420" end="00:06:09.750" style="s2">pursuing a PhD in partnering with</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">thinking about pursuing a PhD and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:21.720" style="s2">what I hope to accomplish is to create a</p>
