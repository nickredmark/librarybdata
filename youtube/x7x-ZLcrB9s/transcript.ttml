<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">gonna come in from neoplatonic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">theorgia especially sort of a young</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">approach to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">then we talked about maximization</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">this is to the record you may draw it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">from your alexa divinia you may</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">draw it from some of the books you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:08.080" style="s2">reading especially the mclaren</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">right um you may draw it up from</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.080" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">other people these are maxims that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">try to memorize</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">and recite and so that they&#39;re ready to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">hand um</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">they&#39;re ready to hand when you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">uh well particularly for epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">when you&#39;re engaging in the frame</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">widening</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">the maximum should invoke a principle</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">that commits you to the widest</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">framing of your experience remember when</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">we talked about this on wednesday this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">is also</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:37.680" style="s2">the right your identification framing</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.680" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">of what you&#39;re aware of but how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">identifying with it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">and then we took a look at the epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">model which is basically like a medical</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">uh call no man a philosopher who has not</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:53.599" style="s2">alleviated the suffering of others</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">that&#39;s from epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">um and oh i wanted to say one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">one thing that the followers of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">epicureans did</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">was they would actually inscribe the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">maxims all about their</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">their dwelling place they would put them</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">on their hairbrush or</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">take them on the wall put them on their</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">cups and that&#39;s a very powerful strategy</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.080" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">by the way for</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">learning your maxims okay so back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">epicurus and alleviating suffering i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">just going to go over this briefly</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">you did it in detail which you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">the idea is what we&#39;re seeking and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">going to what we&#39;re going to extend to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">today is what this word means</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">at araxia and the idea is um</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">we suffer because we lack ataraxia</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">we&#39;re in turmoil and tumult in</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">conflict and we are that way because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">have we have uneducated desires</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">or we seek pleasure or avoid pain</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">which is also fear uh so let&#39;s let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">that again we have uneducated desires</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">and fears</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">or we have we&#39;re uneducated in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:58.639" style="s2">approach of pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">or in our avoidance of pain and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">what calls causes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">too much so we want to bring rational</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">reflection and rational discernment</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">to bear on the way we experience and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">identify with our pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">and so the desire</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:20.479" style="s2">like i said i think this is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">mistake on epicurus part i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">we desire</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">pleasure i think we desire things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.639" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">give us pleasure and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">and they give us pleasure precisely</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">because they are good for us</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">in some way that&#39;s a neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">criticism but let&#39;s leave it like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">for now</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">uh just for practical purposes uh some i</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">think i believe it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">kira that has a question about like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">is kind of nebulous and hard</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">what can i how can i get a hold of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">and there&#39;s often some resistance around</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">this so one way of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">about the notion of desire and right is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">so think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">these three things</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">okay so when you&#39;re about to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">what&#39;s motivating you what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:13.600" style="s2">motivating uh affect</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">um so you know there&#39;s a want or a need</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">or an</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">urge these all fall under what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">that you look at the motive that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">aspect of it that you look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">what&#39;s the goal okay now these are all</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">bound together this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">this is a way of analyzing it so this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">to bring acuity</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">to your reflection on your desires you</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">look at the motive</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">you look at the goal and then you look</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:40.560" style="s2">at your anticipated sense of reward</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">what is it you anticipate you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">experience not well not with not what</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">not the state of affairs in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">that&#39;s your goal but once you achieve</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">that goal</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">you eat the chocolate right um what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">what&#39;s your anticipated sense of reward</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">is it a physical sensation</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">is it emotional release is it a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">security</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:03.919" style="s2">is it distraction except what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">sense of reward what&#39;s your motive</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">what&#39;s your goal that so if you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">open up this triangle</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">of the aspects that can help you get a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">more acute</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">um and perhaps even more precise</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">or at least accurate um take on your</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">so then what we do is we step back and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">like in the labeling practice within the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">buddhist tradition</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">we but we do more than label we</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">categorize catalog</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">our desires we ask a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">questions because what are we seeking</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">how are we seeking anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to prioritize prior</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">the ties ease</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">and part of what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">we&#39;re instead of confusing</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:57.720" style="s2">intensity with</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">importance we&#39;re trying to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.720" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">intensify</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">what is most rationally reflectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">discerned as</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">important so we ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">first of all is it a mental or physical</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">and we are to we are to prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">prioritize does not mean to exclude it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">means to prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">we have to prioritize mental pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">over physical pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">for both mental and physical pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">we go through a sequence of questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">is it natural is it needed is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:32.640" style="s2">do we is it like import right</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">do we need to take it in in order to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.640" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">remain physically</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">healthy not just merely alive but</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:39.839" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">vital so again not just a passive sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.839" end="00:08:45.919" style="s2">well i survived another day</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:45.919" style="s2">but that sense of no i have vitality</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">mental again not just remain</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">having a mind but you have a mind that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">is healthy that is vital</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">i suggested that the main thing you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">to concentrate when you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">the life of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">is you want to look at those things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">give you an enhanced sense of meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">and what seems to be constitutive of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">is connectedness to oneself to others to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">and how how much things make sense to us</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">and then a sense that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">direction in which we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">your social life we&#39;re gonna like i keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">putting that off because i have a lesson</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">dedicated to that for you</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">when we zero in on the epicurean um</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">notion of friendship and friendship is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">the central thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">in epicureanism it&#39;s the central thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">that encourages us</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">and helps us deal with both our desires</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">and our fears</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">so we ask is it natural</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">is it neces is it necessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">and then we ask is it short-term</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">or long-term and this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">maximization comes in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">and then after we&#39;ve done that we ask</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">about ease of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">and then in order to give us a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">phenomenological touchstone</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">we should be seeking when we&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">give you the practice of trying to turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">the world into a garden as you go for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">walk</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">and this is new research the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">savoring</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">remember that has two components i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">opening up my perception of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.519" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m activating my prehension</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">of all the relationships and patterns</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">and so as i&#39;m moving around</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">i&#39;m paying attention to like textures uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">the tempo</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.800" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">the emotional tone i&#39;m i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">a kind of shamanic synesthesia so when i</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">come to this i almost feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">the the board or the floor</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.959" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">and so i&#39;m i&#39;m participating in right a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">presencing and what that gives me is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">something like a flow state</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">and that flow state and we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">to that a little bit that flow state is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">puts us in touch with the most important</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">what i want to say species but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.480" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">an exemplar yeah that&#39;s what i want</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.320" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">one of the most important exemplars of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">anorexia which is the pure</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">joy of being anorexia doesn&#39;t mean just</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">the freedom from tumult</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">it means the very powerfully present</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">positive pleasure of the pure</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">presence of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you use as a touchstone</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">the the maximization and the savoring</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">act as</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">sort of a sets of constraints that help</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">you zero in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">help you hone in on how you should</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">be uh seeking anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">all right now that brings me into what i</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">want to talk about right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">just to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">extend it a little bit more for us and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">then we get into the set into some</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">and this is this is not in what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">going to teach now is not in</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">epicurus but it is very much in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">spirit of epicurus because as i</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">epicurus has committed to science he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">a proponent of the atomic theory for</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.040" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">and an early proponent of you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">psychological theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">and this has to do with two different</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">ways in which we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">anorexia and this has to do with work</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:50.839" style="s2">michael actor he&#39;s a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">michael actor talks about</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.839" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">meta-motivational</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">modes you can tell he&#39;s an academic</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">now we know what a mode is we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">talked about that when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">meta</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s the co-identification</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">but he talks about here he uses this</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">term he&#39;s talking about the that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">two ways in which we frame</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.440" end="00:13:15.200" style="s2">and identify our arousal now this word</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.200" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">often misunderstood because of freud</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">arousal doesn&#39;t just mean sexual arousal</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">arousal is any sense of intensifying</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">your metabolic metabolic activation</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">and energizing yourself you&#39;re aroused</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:32.880" style="s2">right and so you can be very aroused by</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">a symphony</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.880" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">right etc okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">so after pointed out that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">we actually have most people were</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">and i think this is a mistake that is in</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">epicurus most people think of arousal</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">as a more or less of a single state</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:56.639" style="s2">but actor actually obtained evidence and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">made good arguments for the following</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.639" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">things so what i wanna</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">what this here is my level of arousal</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">so this this means arousal is increasing</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">this here is what&#39;s called your hedonic</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">tone</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">this is how pleasurable how positive</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">is to you and when he noted and what he</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">provided evidence for and this has</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:20.959" style="s2">increased</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">uh since he first proposed it and what</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.959" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">he calls reversal theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">and it lines up with other work that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">quite chicks up behind others</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">is he proposed that there was two</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">different modes</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">in which we relate to our arousal why am</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.800" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">i doing all this</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">because i&#39;m trying to give you a more</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">sophisticated and nuanced understanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">of how we seek anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.839" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">in one form</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">when we have very</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">high levels of arousal</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">we experience that as very negative</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:07.040" style="s2">but when we have very low levels of</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">arousal</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.040" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">we experience that as very positive</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.399" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">and this is the prevalent model by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">way that people have</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">the idea is i work very hard and then i</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">that is right where i can relax and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">that&#39;s where i actually experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">uh most of the pleasure right so it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">looks like this</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">low levels of arousal very high hedonic</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">tone</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">and then it goes down like that he</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:37.360" style="s2">called this the telec mode</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:42.720" style="s2">notice the word i used work</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.360" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">so in metallic mode we have an activity</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">and the activity is for the sake of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">goal</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">so right i&#39;m doing something in order to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">get to the goal state and the goal state</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">is what i want</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">so when my activity is very very high</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">i have i&#39;m very frustrated because high</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:07.759" style="s2">means i haven&#39;t reached the desired goal</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.759" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">but when my arousal is low that means</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve either abandoned it and then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">usually sort of sad or i&#39;ve achieved it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">in which case i now feel very very happy</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">okay so this is relaxation contentment</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">this is frustration</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">that&#39;s italic mode</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:39.199" style="s2">t loss means a purpose that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">working towards</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.199" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">now but what do you really when he</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">pointed out this there&#39;s another mode</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">now both of these don&#39;t both go to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">infinity or anything like that so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">right well limited within sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">the natural range</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">of human variability so</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">he calls this the peritolic mode which</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">is very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">uh shakespeare high the guy who did all</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">the work on flow his</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">idea of the auto metallic mode</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">so this is right</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">more like play this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:21.120" style="s2">we have an activity but we set up goals</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">but the goals are for the sake of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">so what&#39;s what&#39;s an obvious example when</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">i&#39;m playing music i have a goal to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">to the end</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">but if i could shortcut it and get to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">the end faster i don&#39;t go hey that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">great let&#39;s just hit it i can skip the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">song and i can just get to the final</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">hole</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">wow that&#39;s great i&#39;m at the at the end</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">you know what no no</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">the goal is just to give you a structure</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">for an activity that is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">valuable</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">so now what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">the we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">the activity for its own sake the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">problem we have with the word i just</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:18:00.640" style="s2">used is we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">think it as only pertaining to trivial</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">activities</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">to frivolous and trivial things play is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">about fun and that&#39;s a big mistake</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">now when i have very low levels of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">arousal than peritelic</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s boredom</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:26.840" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s not pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">but when i have high levels this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">excitement</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">or even as i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.440" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">the flow state remember what that is we</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">talked about it when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">finding your flow</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the state in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">absorbed and although you&#39;re expending a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">lot of metabolic energy you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">zone</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:50.000" style="s2">and it feels like it&#39;s almost it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">paradoxical it feels almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.000" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">effortless graceful and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">it is both optimally hedonic for you</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re also doing your optimal</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to now erase this</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">so if you want to take another quick</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">look at it right</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">so we have it&#39;s not so crowded visually</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">crowded for you</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">okay so the solid line is italic mode</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">the dotted line is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">the peritonic mode and what that means</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.120" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">is we actually have two anoraxias</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">we have this</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">and we have this</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">and i think that although epicurus often</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">this is implicitly what he is seeking</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">why do i think that what&#39;s my argument</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">because his primary example of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">optimal state which</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">people can be in is in deep flowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.840" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">but he often talks this way now the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">that somebody as</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know brilliant as epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">i think is confusing these two should</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">wake us up to the fact that just like we</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">can be modally confused</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">about the having and the being modes and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:27.760" style="s2">these probably map onto</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">having mode and v8 mode by the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.760" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">we can be modelly confused about how</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">we&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">ataraxia now this anoraxia</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">is good but it tends to be what</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">james cars calls a finite game</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.679" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">because finite games are finite because</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">the point of the game is to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">goal</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">and then be entitled you&#39;re the winner</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">you deserve the relaxation</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">these are what he calls infinite gains</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">you play them for their own sake and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">point of the game is to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:06.640" style="s2">to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">shift the parameters of the game so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.640" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">you can continue to play it</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">so it&#39;s very important when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">seeking anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">to make sure you&#39;re not confusing these</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">and if right and to make sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">also clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">that of the two this is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">actually has</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">the more sustainability to it again</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">i am not saying that this is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">it is but again just like we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">prioritize physical pleasures over</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">mental pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">but we still pursue physical pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">this anorexia over this</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:52.559" style="s2">anorexia we need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">how to play infinite games that put us</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.559" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">state that allow us to save your saver</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">the pure joy of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">at all at all levels of our life our</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:10.840" style="s2">our mental life and our physical life</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:13.919" style="s2">okay there isn&#39;t a specific</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.840" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">practice but i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.919" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">like part of what i&#39;m trying to do on</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.559" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">behalf of epicurus is</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">educate you but extend it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">more recent science</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">so we can get a better understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">how we can be confused about anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:31.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:31.919" style="s2">why philosophical conversation was</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.039" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">actually so</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.919" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">central to epicurus and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">practice i&#39;m going to be teaching you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:41.919" style="s2">extensively on the next time next uh</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:17.359" style="s2">of the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">you can bring into reflection about that</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">good to have you here um observation</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">thinking about mental desires</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">most of my my unhelpful thought patterns</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:30.160" style="s2">or mental addictions self-soothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">strategies that occasionally work</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">causing pernicious partial reinforcement</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.599" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">that the and the the idea of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">is right there&#39;s a reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">um in our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">to the world and to our desires um</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">and that shrinks the framing down</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">and we more and more get focused on</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.640" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">addressing the intensity</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">uh rather than the importance of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">effective state this</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:08.640" style="s2">this happens to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">quite frequently and so um</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.640" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">you know the strategies of maximization</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">of frame whitening</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:20.880" style="s2">of trying to remind yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">um that there are more long-term</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">sustainable um mental pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">a part of it also though um is uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">to give a place where uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">people can address fear</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">um we&#39;ve only talked somewhat also</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">mostly about the desire side of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">um and the trick there</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">is to find a place between just</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">discussing a topic</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">and just doing therapy but to get it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:54.079" style="s2">into something that is not just first</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">person therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">perspective or the third person</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:40:59.760" style="s2">theoretical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s to get into sort of a second person</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.760" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">um which would talk a lot more when we</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">uh the philosophical companionship</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:11.760" style="s2">that&#39;s how her talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s a place that can help us get</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.760" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">out of some of these self-reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s all we have time for for today</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">we&#39;re already going longer i have</p>

<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">because this has a little bit more of a</p>
