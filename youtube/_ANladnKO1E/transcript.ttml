<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">discernment and judgment let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:14.429" style="s2">judgement first because it&#39;s the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:17.210" style="s2">in the most familiar it&#39;s judgment is</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.429" end="00:00:20.760" style="s2">the the capacity that we learn in school</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.210" end="00:00:25.019" style="s2">it&#39;s the ability to remember information</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.760" end="00:00:27.800" style="s2">in some schema and to be able to very</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.019" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">effectively and quickly recognize when</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.800" end="00:00:33.090" style="s2">some portion that information some</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.029" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">pattern is given to us and then select</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.090" end="00:00:37.530" style="s2">the right piece from that schema to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">express back out right so a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.530" end="00:00:43.110" style="s2">example would be if you see four times</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">four to be able to recognize that and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:50.340" style="s2">then say eight and that&#39;s judgment par</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">excellence sorry four plus four is eight</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.340" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">yes you&#39;ve noticed that my capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">judgment has been declining rapidly and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">judgment is is is the both trained by</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">school because judgment is the skill set</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:06.119" style="s2">that we want to need in something like</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.629" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">the blue church it simply wants to need</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.119" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">in any kind of game a structure when it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:13.310" style="s2">reaches maturity because it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">to be able to execute on this</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.630" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">good judgment now of course sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:29.700" style="s2">might think that like I&#39;m saying it very</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">simply to make it simple to understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.700" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">but of course it might be a very big</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">problem all right you may have to be</p>

<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:40.290" style="s2">sailing ship has a lot of stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">and you have to actually make a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.290" end="00:01:43.860" style="s2">specific quick judgment on what the turn</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">left or turn right but the point is that</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.260" end="00:02:32.260" style="s2">were we were investigating mystery as</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.510" end="00:02:34.510" style="s2">mystery it&#39;s the capacity that we use</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.260" end="00:02:39.159" style="s2">when we&#39;re trying for example to do art</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.510" end="00:02:41.079" style="s2">it&#39;s slow it doesn&#39;t have any</p>

<p begin="00:02:49.420" end="00:02:55.000" style="s2">by the quality of like the visual cortex</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.690" end="00:02:58.299" style="s2">thinking but by the subtle quality of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.000" end="00:02:59.530" style="s2">feeling of not even isn&#39;t something able</p>

<p begin="00:02:59.530" end="00:03:05.470" style="s2">but it has a lot of richness to it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.220" end="00:03:07.690" style="s2">when it comes out it&#39;s very clear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.470" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">very strong because you can stand behind</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.690" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">it is that feeling of gut reaction and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:19.900" style="s2">the kind of thing we&#39;re trying to build</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">is this notion of a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.900" end="00:03:24.790" style="s2">collective intelligence and the fact</p>

<p begin="00:03:27.250" end="00:03:33.160" style="s2">and wean ourselves off of an addiction</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.160" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">complexity means that it&#39;s the capacity</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:44.290" style="s2">happening is as I&#39;m relating to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.629" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">everything as open new novel possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.290" end="00:03:50.019" style="s2">complex but I&#39;ve built the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">be able to perceive it and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.019" end="00:03:53.530" style="s2">make sense of it it&#39;s how we make sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:55.510" style="s2">of it really and then what comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.530" end="00:04:01.480" style="s2">me if I can then express it has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.510" end="00:04:02.889" style="s2">quality of surprising clear truth what</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.480" end="00:04:08.290" style="s2">comes to me a cut is a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.889" end="00:04:11.530" style="s2">one is this phrase yes and that is often</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.290" end="00:04:15.720" style="s2">associated with integral theory but and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.530" end="00:04:20.650" style="s2">the other is in how that also relates to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.720" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">operating for example in in Improv</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.650" end="00:04:25.539" style="s2">Theater Improv Theater is always based</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:26.110" style="s2">around yes and so when someone comes up</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.539" end="00:04:28.509" style="s2">with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:31.500" style="s2">with a scenario the one rule in Improv</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.509" end="00:04:33.669" style="s2">Theater is that you never say no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.500" end="00:04:35.050" style="s2">it&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.669" end="00:04:37.090" style="s2">till someone says okay we&#39;re on our</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.050" end="00:04:38.620" style="s2">we&#39;re on a spaceship you go yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.090" end="00:04:42.520" style="s2">on a spaceship and it&#39;s driven by a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.620" end="00:04:44.289" style="s2">penguin and and and yes and and yes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.520" end="00:04:46.629" style="s2">yeah as soon as you say no in on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.289" end="00:04:49.419" style="s2">spaceship or on a fire engine that kills</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.629" end="00:04:50.500" style="s2">the scene almost stone dead yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.419" end="00:04:52.300" style="s2">this is really good you can think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.500" end="00:04:54.219" style="s2">happening there right because to say no</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.300" end="00:04:56.949" style="s2">means that you have some preconceived</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.219" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">notion of what right is as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.949" end="00:05:00.969" style="s2">actually implying some schema that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:03.370" style="s2">telling you a right choice must be and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.969" end="00:05:04.419" style="s2">so the end this isn&#39;t it all right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.370" end="00:05:07.270" style="s2">of course you might also you may be</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.419" end="00:05:09.129" style="s2">seeing yes inside a schema but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.270" end="00:05:10.599" style="s2">saying no is evidence that you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.129" end="00:05:12.819" style="s2">you&#39;re in a schema so it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.599" end="00:05:15.550" style="s2">nice prophylactic way of avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.819" end="00:05:17.319" style="s2">getting caught there&#39;s not foolproof but</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.550" end="00:05:19.479" style="s2">it&#39;s nice but then if you like to think</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.319" end="00:05:20.979" style="s2">about the example like what does yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.479" end="00:05:23.349" style="s2">feel like when you actually say it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.979" end="00:05:24.789" style="s2">because the in Improv Theater the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.349" end="00:05:28.300" style="s2">challenge in real-time</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.789" end="00:05:31.810" style="s2">my actions you&#39;re really in flow is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.300" end="00:05:33.789" style="s2">express something that feels right in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.810" end="00:05:37.089" style="s2">fact everyone there&#39;s a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.789" end="00:05:39.610" style="s2">rightness to it it feels right and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.089" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">lands and people have for they flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.610" end="00:05:43.690" style="s2">they&#39;re uplifted is a levity to it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:44.889" style="s2">is creative right pure creativity so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.690" end="00:05:47.110" style="s2">when you&#39;re trying to do creativity</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.889" end="00:05:49.150" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do collaboration with</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.110" end="00:05:51.460" style="s2">other people in flow and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.150" end="00:05:53.770" style="s2">discernment is that tool it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.460" end="00:05:55.689" style="s2">ability to kind of feel a wholeness and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.770" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">to be able to actually sense from that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.689" end="00:05:59.319" style="s2">wholeness what in fact is precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:01.810" style="s2">right thing right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.319" end="00:06:04.479" style="s2">how does discernment relate to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.810" end="00:06:06.310" style="s2">sovereignty okay so there&#39;s a simple way</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.479" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">to begin so let&#39;s just begin very simply</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.310" end="00:06:14.020" style="s2">and I think it actually unfroze quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">nicely sovereignty is a capacity to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.020" end="00:06:20.349" style="s2">a choice in response to what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:24.370" style="s2">such that your capacity in the next</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.349" end="00:06:26.529" style="s2">moment is at least as good at making a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.370" end="00:06:28.389" style="s2">choice so it&#39;s a way of being in</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.529" end="00:06:30.580" style="s2">relationship with your environment where</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.389" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">you are constantly able to continue to</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:36.729" style="s2">just sovereignty in sort of a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.419" end="00:06:38.170" style="s2">practical sense now what&#39;s underneath</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.729" end="00:06:41.690" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.170" end="00:06:43.190" style="s2">well there&#39;s a bunch of different things</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.690" end="00:06:44.450" style="s2">that are inside that so when I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.190" end="00:06:46.790" style="s2">this notion I&#39;m actually saying that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.450" end="00:06:51.140" style="s2">sovereignty has a certain sphere to me I</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.790" end="00:06:52.670" style="s2">feel that it is a space of volume and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.140" end="00:06:56.180" style="s2">what I mean by that is that sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.670" end="00:06:58.370" style="s2">is always contextual if I happen to be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.180" end="00:07:00.260" style="s2">good skateboarder for example and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.370" end="00:07:01.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a hill at say a two degree grade</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.260" end="00:07:05.060" style="s2">you might say that I am sovereign in</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.970" end="00:07:06.950" style="s2">that context which means that I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.060" end="00:07:08.750" style="s2">continue to be on the skateboard such</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.950" end="00:07:10.190" style="s2">that the next moment I can continue to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.750" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">be on the skateboard such - the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.190" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">moment I can continue to be on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:15.830" style="s2">skateboard right if the grade becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:18.050" style="s2">much steeper it&#39;s beyond my capacity as</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.830" end="00:07:19.760" style="s2">a skateboarder then I it&#39;s the point is</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.050" end="00:07:21.680" style="s2">moves out of my sovereignty and I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.760" end="00:07:23.060" style="s2">in a situation where I&#39;m going to become</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.680" end="00:07:24.950" style="s2">destabilized I will fall off the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.060" end="00:07:28.520" style="s2">skateboard I&#39;m no longer able to respond</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.950" end="00:07:29.570" style="s2">to my circumstances so now of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.520" end="00:07:31.610" style="s2">when I say sphere what I mean is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.570" end="00:07:33.800" style="s2">sort of infinitely dimensional I can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.610" end="00:07:38.030" style="s2">sovereign its regard to all possible</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.800" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">things and each point is in or out so</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.030" end="00:07:42.950" style="s2">that&#39;s one element nurse is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:44.570" style="s2">embodied capacity to be able to respond</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.950" end="00:07:47.780" style="s2">to the circumstances that you find</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.570" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">yourself in so as to be equally or</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.780" end="00:07:52.270" style="s2">better position to respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:54.290" style="s2">circumstances you find yourself in next</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.270" end="00:07:56.150" style="s2">now what we can do is we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.290" end="00:07:58.250" style="s2">now go meta and by the way this med is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.150" end="00:07:59.540" style="s2">still included in the concept because if</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.250" end="00:08:02.690" style="s2">you think about what I just said things</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.540" end="00:08:04.850" style="s2">like learning are a fundamental capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.690" end="00:08:06.500" style="s2">because learning is about being able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.850" end="00:08:10.310" style="s2">increase my capacity to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.500" end="00:08:11.810" style="s2">respond to my environment so if I can</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.310" end="00:08:13.850" style="s2">find a way to make it so that when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.810" end="00:08:16.970" style="s2">encountering experience experiences</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.850" end="00:08:20.030" style="s2">coming at me that the way that I respond</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.970" end="00:08:21.920" style="s2">to that experience not only allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.030" end="00:08:24.890" style="s2">still be well positioned with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.920" end="00:08:27.580" style="s2">the experience but also to grow which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.890" end="00:08:30.350" style="s2">to say to learn then that&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.580" end="00:08:32.270" style="s2">sovereign that&#39;s increasing the size of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.350" end="00:08:34.820" style="s2">my sphere and so sovereignty is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.270" end="00:08:36.380" style="s2">simultaneously a sort of state of where</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.820" end="00:08:39.590" style="s2">you are in relationship to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:41.240" style="s2">happening but also a disposition of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.590" end="00:08:43.340" style="s2">you relate to the possibility of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.240" end="00:08:47.210" style="s2">could happen to be able to increase your</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.340" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">capacity to grow as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.210" end="00:08:51.010" style="s2">relationships with reality that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:51.010" style="s2">happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:56.660" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s actually a third</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.450" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">point which is we might call meta meta</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.660" end="00:09:09.230" style="s2">which is to take a perspective on being</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:11.780" style="s2">in the world which is able to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.230" end="00:09:15.350" style="s2">of the difference between making</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.780" end="00:09:20.630" style="s2">conscious choices and having unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.350" end="00:09:23.930" style="s2">reactions and to be able to choose to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.630" end="00:09:26.450" style="s2">orient yourself so as to more and more</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.930" end="00:09:28.990" style="s2">be in this place so at the top</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.450" end="00:09:32.960" style="s2">sovereignty is fundamentally that choice</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.990" end="00:09:36.050" style="s2">the choice to orient yourself more and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.960" end="00:09:38.900" style="s2">more towards more and more being able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.050" end="00:09:41.330" style="s2">make conscious choices about how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.900" end="00:09:43.310" style="s2">going to respond to reality and less and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.330" end="00:09:45.470" style="s2">less being relegated to making</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.310" end="00:09:48.050" style="s2">unconscious reactions to how you respond</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.470" end="00:09:50.780" style="s2">to reality and how does that relate to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.050" end="00:09:52.580" style="s2">sense making we talked about incense</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.780" end="00:09:55.640" style="s2">making that at the very least there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.580" end="00:09:57.800" style="s2">two distinctions two kinds of sense that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.640" end="00:10:02.450" style="s2">we can talk about we can talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:06.410" style="s2">kind of sense making that is judgment</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.450" end="00:10:10.660" style="s2">that is very hardwired it has an input</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.410" end="00:10:10.660" style="s2">process output characteristic and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.690" end="00:10:15.770" style="s2">there&#39;s another kind of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.650" end="00:10:18.170" style="s2">that is determined that has a way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.770" end="00:10:26.210" style="s2">being in response a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.170" end="00:10:31.100" style="s2">novelty and is creative okay and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.210" end="00:10:34.730" style="s2">happens is is that if you&#39;re biased</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.100" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">towards this approach then what happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.730" end="00:10:38.030" style="s2">is is that when as long as the things</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:42.350" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with are in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.030" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">within that capacity you will be okay if</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.350" end="00:10:47.180" style="s2">it can I feel quite effective you may be</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.910" end="00:10:49.280" style="s2">very adapted to that context but you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.180" end="00:10:51.770" style="s2">be very fragile to anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.280" end="00:10:53.750" style="s2">outside of your sovereignty so it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.770" end="00:10:56.450" style="s2">happen is is that if you&#39;ve got a high</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.750" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">bias towards judgment then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.450" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">fragile to novelty and of course in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:02.210" style="s2">finite time you look eventually come</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:02.600" style="s2">into some kind of novelty and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.210" end="00:11:05.420" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.600" end="00:11:06.889" style="s2">trouble so it fundamentally creates we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.420" end="00:11:08.779" style="s2">make all simulated sovereignty or</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.889" end="00:11:12.819" style="s2">fragile sovereignty which is in</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.779" end="00:11:16.519" style="s2">sovereignty at all by contrast if</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.819" end="00:11:19.779" style="s2">discernment is a primary quality then</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.519" end="00:11:22.370" style="s2">your and if your if your sovereign and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.779" end="00:11:23.540" style="s2">bias towards discernment which means</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.370" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">that you are able to respond to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.540" end="00:11:32.449" style="s2">happening but you&#39;re not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:34.850" style="s2">through a causal reactive habit based</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.449" end="00:11:36.860" style="s2">mechanism but rather are doing it</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.850" end="00:11:38.839" style="s2">through an embodied capacity to sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.860" end="00:11:41.269" style="s2">what is really happening and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.839" end="00:11:44.600" style="s2">consciously choose how you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.269" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">act in that context you&#39;re open to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.600" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">novelty not only open to novelty in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:50.000" style="s2">sense that it won&#39;t break you but rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:52.190" style="s2">you&#39;re open to novelty in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.000" end="00:11:54.230" style="s2">it will be a source of learning a source</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.190" end="00:11:59.540" style="s2">of growth so you might say that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.230" end="00:12:02.300" style="s2">discernment is the crown the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.540" end="00:12:03.709" style="s2">interface layer the way that one is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.300" end="00:12:07.399" style="s2">be able to actually show you this notion</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.709" end="00:12:10.250" style="s2">of sovereignty in its deepest sense and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.399" end="00:12:12.319" style="s2">you might say the judgment is the trick</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.250" end="00:12:14.810" style="s2">the judgment puts you in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.319" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">you feel very powerful but you&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.810" end="00:12:20.540" style="s2">fact sovereign why is it so difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:22.579" style="s2">show up with genuine thinking in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.540" end="00:12:29.470" style="s2">environment or in in the structures that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.579" end="00:12:31.970" style="s2">we have at the moment ah so in nature</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.470" end="00:12:35.029" style="s2">the capacities of discernment and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.970" end="00:12:39.079" style="s2">judgment of thinking and well thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.029" end="00:12:41.810" style="s2">stone thinking fast are both always</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.079" end="00:12:43.459" style="s2">available and you sort of fluidly move</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.810" end="00:12:45.769" style="s2">between them sometimes it&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.459" end="00:12:47.870" style="s2">great to have a schema that just</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.769" end="00:12:49.850" style="s2">iterates you know if you&#39;re driving your</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.870" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">car you would like to have your mind be</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.850" end="00:12:52.850" style="s2">able to do with the things you actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.990" end="00:12:54.980" style="s2">render all of that into habit and allow</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.850" end="00:12:56.990" style="s2">that have to do its job but you stay</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.980" end="00:12:59.029" style="s2">fluid ideally so that if circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.990" end="00:13:00.019" style="s2">change or actually able to shift into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.029" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">space where you&#39;re actually able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.019" end="00:13:04.610" style="s2">prove new more conscious of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:06.019" style="s2">happening so in nature both this happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.610" end="00:13:07.550" style="s2">so the distinction that I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.019" end="00:13:08.660" style="s2">is the distinction between this where</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.550" end="00:13:12.920" style="s2">they&#39;re actually a nice balance</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.660" end="00:13:15.649" style="s2">ultimately discernment is the holder to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.920" end="00:13:16.950" style="s2">a situation which is simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.649" end="00:13:20.070" style="s2">where this</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.950" end="00:13:22.290" style="s2">takes itself as being this so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.070" end="00:13:23.700" style="s2">this and every time this is called for</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.370" end="00:16:49.110" style="s2">construction well in the domain of</p>

<p begin="00:17:04.140" end="00:17:09.660" style="s2">bind thinking and make it in service to</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.660" end="00:17:12.839" style="s2">course by nature shift the niche and</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.839" end="00:17:18.780" style="s2">tiger and can you link that to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.050" end="00:17:22.560" style="s2">of a debate like like for example the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.780" end="00:17:25.310" style="s2">thinker Titans showing up as oh yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.560" end="00:17:25.310" style="s2">first let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.440" end="00:17:35.720" style="s2">in debates actually I think quite quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.730" end="00:17:42.269" style="s2">an interesting phenomenon so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.720" end="00:17:47.490" style="s2">look at it and think about it if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.269" end="00:17:50.730" style="s2">notice debate is a social event and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.490" end="00:17:52.440" style="s2">is fundamentally rhetorical well it may</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.730" end="00:17:57.029" style="s2">of course present itself as having a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.440" end="00:17:58.679" style="s2">truth-seeking function it shows up under</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.029" end="00:18:02.909" style="s2">the thing about the language like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.679" end="00:18:05.159" style="s2">score points in debate there&#39;s a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.909" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">of combat and conflict which means of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.159" end="00:18:08.370" style="s2">course a feeling of winning in debate in</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:10.350" style="s2">fact that&#39;s the whole point of debate</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.370" end="00:18:12.419" style="s2">one side wins so you&#39;re not in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.350" end="00:18:14.370" style="s2">collaborative space at all</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.419" end="00:18:16.830" style="s2">thinking is by definition collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.370" end="00:18:18.389" style="s2">it works best but only works in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.830" end="00:18:20.490" style="s2">collaborative space and it works really</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.389" end="00:18:23.159" style="s2">well in a collaborative space so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.490" end="00:18:25.049" style="s2">thinking enters into a collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.159" end="00:18:26.340" style="s2">space debate is in fact intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.049" end="00:18:28.139" style="s2">non collaborative but it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.340" end="00:18:29.940" style="s2">showing up as being something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.139" end="00:18:32.279" style="s2">trying to be a true seeking function and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.940" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">it&#39;s performative right debate is about</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.279" end="00:18:36.330" style="s2">being able to say the right thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:39.480" style="s2">right way to create an effect in the</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.909" end="00:19:08.850" style="s2">you to become a simulated thinker in the</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.790" end="00:21:22.420" style="s2">keeps popping into my head is the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.120" end="00:21:25.110" style="s2">the Disney cartoon with the large bully</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.420" end="00:21:27.460" style="s2">I think his name is Gaston and like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.110" end="00:21:29.740" style="s2">the inventor right that&#39;s a classic</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.460" end="00:21:32.940" style="s2">example and Gaston we know is it is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.740" end="00:21:35.740" style="s2">only not smart or clever but is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.940" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">foolish and the bully and the inventor</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.740" end="00:21:40.780" style="s2">in fact kind of is a little bit foolish</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:41.920" style="s2">but seems like he&#39;s not mindless but</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.780" end="00:21:44.380" style="s2">clearly it just comes off as being</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.920" end="00:21:46.060" style="s2">completely incompetent Gascon Khan knows</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.190" end="00:21:53.500" style="s2">already because thinking is</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.980" end="00:21:59.740" style="s2">that anyway so what what comes next in</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.700" end="00:22:02.049" style="s2">the war on sense-making if the sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.740" end="00:22:04.840" style="s2">making framework that we have relied on</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.049" end="00:22:06.669" style="s2">for so long is disintegrating where are</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.840" end="00:22:08.140" style="s2">we going next great so let&#39;s take a look</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.669" end="00:22:10.299" style="s2">at it from sort of one hand in the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.140" end="00:22:12.190" style="s2">hand on the one hand we have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.299" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">continuing acceleration of the war on</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.190" end="00:22:17.169" style="s2">since making the concept of deep fakes</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:18.370" style="s2">for example I think is useful I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.169" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">it&#39;s begun to show up in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.370" end="00:22:23.049" style="s2">contemporary consciousness this is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:25.870" style="s2">the ability to generate media like even</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.049" end="00:22:28.390" style="s2">video that are fake but in fact look</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.870" end="00:22:30.760" style="s2">really real and let&#39;s by hypothesis say</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.390" end="00:22:33.490" style="s2">our forensic li indistinguishable from</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.760" end="00:22:36.010" style="s2">really real at least not easily so I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.490" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">create a video that has pick your</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.010" end="00:22:39.309" style="s2">favorite person and have them doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:41.919" style="s2">something that you might consider be</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.309" end="00:22:45.400" style="s2">very bad and I&#39;m gonna name names or</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.919" end="00:22:47.590" style="s2">name acts and I can do it in software by</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.400" end="00:22:48.850" style="s2">the way this is crucial because what</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.590" end="00:22:51.910" style="s2">software does is it takes something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.850" end="00:22:54.100" style="s2">you just in the hands of five very</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.910" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">sophisticated people and puts in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.100" end="00:22:59.040" style="s2">hands of an arbitrary 13 year old kid in</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:01.150" style="s2">about five years and so deep fakes is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.040" end="00:23:03.130" style="s2">moving through the arc of getting really</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.150" end="00:23:04.780" style="s2">good and is gonna be going down the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.130" end="00:23:05.950" style="s2">software path and of course what that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.780" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">means among other things by the way this</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.950" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">is just just one example the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:13.270" style="s2">trust video is going to be going to zero</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:14.860" style="s2">pretty soon</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.270" end="00:23:16.600" style="s2">which of course means in the broader</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.860" end="00:23:20.650" style="s2">picture the ability to trust anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.600" end="00:23:21.730" style="s2">that is intermediated is zero so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.650" end="00:23:23.380" style="s2">the war on sense making by the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.730" end="00:23:28.030" style="s2">you&#39;re better to trust anything that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.380" end="00:23:30.490" style="s2">intermediated is zero if in listening to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.030" end="00:23:32.140" style="s2">that that feels challenging that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.490" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">very good response because in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.140" end="00:23:36.010" style="s2">contemporary environment it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:39.250" style="s2">madness it is the equivalent of being</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.010" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">completely insane right the inability to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.250" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">and to trust your senses or your</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:47.770" style="s2">thoughts at the social level very</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:49.390" style="s2">problematic okay so well on the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.770" end="00:23:52.630" style="s2">right hands so what do we do about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.390" end="00:23:53.950" style="s2">like what&#39;s the response and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.630" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">response well there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.950" end="00:23:57.850" style="s2">ways of framing it but the basic</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:59.020" style="s2">response is kind of just working</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.850" end="00:24:00.970" style="s2">backwards is that you can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.020" end="00:24:01.780" style="s2">anything that&#39;s intermediated well that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.970" end="00:24:03.790" style="s2">means you have to actually start</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.780" end="00:24:08.710" style="s2">beginning a chain</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.790" end="00:24:12.490" style="s2">that is relational and trustworthy there</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.710" end="00:24:15.640" style="s2">to reconstruct a trustworthy extended</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.490" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">network of real relationships and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.640" end="00:24:20.100" style="s2">is this is crucial this has not actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">even normally considered by</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.100" end="00:24:23.470" style="s2">technologists at the blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:24.520" style="s2">community for example is endeavor to</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.470" end="00:24:26.440" style="s2">figure out to solve a problem by</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.520" end="00:24:29.890" style="s2">removing trust entirely from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.440" end="00:24:32.740" style="s2">equation and a booth I can prove that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.890" end="00:24:35.380" style="s2">can&#39;t work but in this case I&#39;m simply</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.740" end="00:24:38.500" style="s2">proposing that it can&#39;t work and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.380" end="00:24:39.910" style="s2">appropriate answer is to actually create</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.500" end="00:24:42.460" style="s2">trust go the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.910" end="00:24:44.530" style="s2">double down on trust and double down on</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.460" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">your own ability as an individual to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.530" end="00:24:48.430" style="s2">trustworthy in yourself this is crucial</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:53.140" style="s2">by the way as I think we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.430" end="00:24:54.430" style="s2">in other components the priority now</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.140" end="00:24:56.620" style="s2">gets put on the individual to become</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.430" end="00:24:58.780" style="s2">sovereign the party becomes an</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:09.580" style="s2">up in relationship because a network</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.840" end="00:25:26.470" style="s2">is a characteristic of a world of</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.470" end="00:25:29.740" style="s2">about in the narrow space of the war on</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.150" end="00:25:32.170" style="s2">sense making but let&#39;s open up the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.740" end="00:25:34.930" style="s2">container alright in any in any world</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.170" end="00:25:37.000" style="s2">where our technological capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.930" end="00:25:38.290" style="s2">continuing to increase what that means</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.000" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">is that the world is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.290" end="00:25:44.590" style="s2">changing more faster well obviously what</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.610" end="00:25:47.140" style="s2">that means is that there&#39;s more novelty</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.590" end="00:25:49.750" style="s2">more new stuff to deal with and so just</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.140" end="00:25:52.120" style="s2">to be able to survive the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.750" end="00:25:55.720" style="s2">a world of accelerating change means</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.120" end="00:25:57.420" style="s2">building a collective intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.720" end="00:26:00.820" style="s2">is fundamentally builds around</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.420" end="00:26:02.740" style="s2">discernment and has real relationship so</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.820" end="00:26:07.750" style="s2">that the entire network is trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.740" end="00:26:09.100" style="s2">as a whole that&#39;s what&#39;s next you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.750" end="00:26:11.830" style="s2">talked about kind of the indie</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.100" end="00:26:14.560" style="s2">integration of red and blue that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.830" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">all the children of blue ah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.560" end="00:26:18.560" style="s2">really important thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:20.300" style="s2">so yeah I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.560" end="00:26:22.460" style="s2">spoken about this before so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.300" end="00:26:25.100" style="s2">things that I noticed as I was observing</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.460" end="00:26:29.570" style="s2">anthropologically what was going on was</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.100" end="00:26:32.120" style="s2">that there was a certain phenotype a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.570" end="00:26:36.650" style="s2">tractor that was happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.120" end="00:26:38.990" style="s2">red-blue distinction that individuals</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.650" end="00:26:43.240" style="s2">who were attracted to read had a certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.990" end="00:26:49.190" style="s2">characteristic to them they had more of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.240" end="00:26:50.360" style="s2">the warrior archetype and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.190" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">maps to some of the stuff that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.360" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">seen for example in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.440" end="00:26:57.050" style="s2">personality type maps to conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:59.390" style="s2">but in a well-functioning community</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.050" end="00:27:00.830" style="s2">these various phenotypes actually relate</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.390" end="00:27:02.330" style="s2">to each other through real relationships</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.830" end="00:27:03.620" style="s2">and so the strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.330" end="00:27:06.380" style="s2">balance each other out</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.620" end="00:27:08.390" style="s2">you know openness and diligence or</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.380" end="00:27:09.860" style="s2">whatever is called are in relationships</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.390" end="00:27:11.540" style="s2">conscientiousness thank you our</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.860" end="00:27:13.310" style="s2">relationship with each other and so they</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.540" end="00:27:14.420" style="s2">each serve but we&#39;ve actually had as</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.310" end="00:27:16.790" style="s2">we&#39;ve made we tend to have a partition</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.420" end="00:27:19.130" style="s2">where conscientiousness is creating its</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.790" end="00:27:21.170" style="s2">own separate niche and it&#39;s attracting</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.130" end="00:27:22.250" style="s2">itself to itself and openness is</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.170" end="00:27:24.680" style="s2">creating its own nation attracting</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.250" end="00:27:27.800" style="s2">itself to itself and so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.680" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a was a shift or a movement of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.800" end="00:27:32.330" style="s2">these demographics even physically like</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.950" style="s2">physically relocating in space to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.330" end="00:27:35.810" style="s2">concentrated and certainly politically</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.950" end="00:27:40.430" style="s2">and so what ended up happening was is</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.810" end="00:27:43.040" style="s2">that because the typology that began to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.430" end="00:27:46.760" style="s2">move towards blue happened to be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.040" end="00:27:49.100" style="s2">typology that was advantage during the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.760" end="00:27:51.530" style="s2">rise of the church so the structure that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.100" end="00:27:54.830" style="s2">became the blue church it sort of ended</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.530" end="00:27:57.140" style="s2">up being in charge of that era and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.830" end="00:27:58.580" style="s2">typology that was attracted to red found</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.140" end="00:28:00.770" style="s2">itself in a situation where I had to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.580" end="00:28:02.270" style="s2">innovate or lose and of course lost and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.770" end="00:28:04.160" style="s2">then it began to innovate but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.270" end="00:28:06.340" style="s2">typology is a typology and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.160" end="00:28:11.150" style="s2">certain capacity around things like</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.340" end="00:28:13.460" style="s2">physical courage and loyalty that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.150" end="00:28:15.950" style="s2">valued intrinsically I&#39;m arguing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.460" end="00:28:18.260" style="s2">proposing at a physical level that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.950" end="00:28:20.750" style="s2">much more valuable within this group</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.260" end="00:28:22.730" style="s2">than it is over here and so it builds a</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.750" end="00:28:24.260" style="s2">different kind of group that behaves</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.730" end="00:28:26.660" style="s2">differently and is good at different</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.260" end="00:28:29.010" style="s2">things so if you&#39;re in a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.660" end="00:28:30.990" style="s2">things are beginning to become chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.010" end="00:28:32.820" style="s2">these guys are actually really well</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.990" end="00:28:34.919" style="s2">positioned because they will naturally</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.820" end="00:28:36.840" style="s2">tend to pull together though and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.919" end="00:28:40.500" style="s2">actually tend to bind they&#39;ll naturally</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.840" end="00:28:43.679" style="s2">tend to do what they said they would do</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.500" end="00:28:45.780" style="s2">they form good solid teams they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.679" end="00:28:46.890" style="s2">wildly creative teams but of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.780" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">because they&#39;ve had to evolve it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.890" end="00:28:50.220" style="s2">actually ended is in pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:51.510" style="s2">stuff so this is team red by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.220" end="00:28:53.790" style="s2">believe this is the case</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.510" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve spent meaningful time watching it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.790" end="00:28:56.700" style="s2">too pelagic what&#39;s happening here and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">that is who these people more or less</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.700" end="00:29:00.059" style="s2">show up to be of course you&#39;ve got a big</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:02.850" style="s2">chunk of disaffected four trainers over</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.059" end="00:29:05.940" style="s2">here who are chaotic as hell but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.850" end="00:29:06.600" style="s2">mass that&#39;s here is of that sort it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.940" end="00:29:08.070" style="s2">actually kind of an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.600" end="00:29:09.540" style="s2">relationship the four trainers create</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.070" end="00:29:11.910" style="s2">the openness that&#39;s necessary to allow</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.540" end="00:29:13.770" style="s2">this thing to evolve but they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.910" end="00:29:18.390" style="s2">fundamentally we want to be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.770" end="00:29:20.940" style="s2">team well you know Blue has the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.390" end="00:29:22.200" style="s2">challenge of not having a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.940" end="00:29:24.330" style="s2">characteristics and openness</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.200" end="00:29:25.950" style="s2">unfortunately ends in vapor all right to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.330" end="00:29:28.250" style="s2">be fully openness in fact it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.950" end="00:29:29.940" style="s2">almost evaporate and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.250" end="00:29:31.559" style="s2">collapsing event what do they call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.940" end="00:29:35.070" style="s2">they eat their own like it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.559" end="00:29:39.720" style="s2">become a a process of balkanization</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:41.220" style="s2">internally and atomization which is part</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.720" end="00:29:44.010" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening that&#39;s part of where</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.220" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">we are so when I say the the children of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.010" end="00:29:49.830" style="s2">blue what I mean is the the rescuing of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:52.740" style="s2">this typology</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.830" end="00:29:54.929" style="s2">and of the effects the human capacities</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.740" end="00:29:58.679" style="s2">that is currently being held here from</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.929" end="00:30:01.020" style="s2">its capture by the structures of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.679" end="00:30:03.030" style="s2">blue church into a truly liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.020" end="00:30:05.549" style="s2">and into a space where it may in fact be</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.030" end="00:30:07.919" style="s2">able to re-establish relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.549" end="00:30:10.500" style="s2">these type ologies and these capacities</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.919" end="00:30:11.640" style="s2">in themselves or in others and I know</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.500" end="00:30:13.740" style="s2">that it&#39;s quite available there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.640" end="00:30:16.230" style="s2">question that there is a story that can</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.740" end="00:30:19.620" style="s2">be told here that is vastly more</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.230" end="00:30:20.760" style="s2">powerful than this story and infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.620" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">powerful in this drug which I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.760" end="00:30:25.650" style="s2">up to zero and in that context when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:30.240" style="s2">get basically cooking of as a Rijo &#39;less</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.650" end="00:30:32.190" style="s2">a reformation of a whole human community</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:33.960" style="s2">that actually has the capacity to bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.190" end="00:30:35.669" style="s2">in these aspects in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.960" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">with each other the question of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.669" end="00:30:41.549" style="s2">is just obviously more creative and more</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.670" style="s2">resilient at the same time which was why</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.549" end="00:30:50.800" style="s2">they exist in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.670" end="00:30:52.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I mean by that well as</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.800" end="00:30:53.770" style="s2">I&#39;ve said many times the first step is</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.120" end="00:30:56.950" style="s2">to admit you&#39;ve got a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.770" end="00:30:59.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a necessity I&#39;ll speak about</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.950" end="00:31:03.580" style="s2">blue first necessity on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.410" end="00:31:07.080" style="s2">people who are captured to no longer be</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.580" end="00:31:07.080" style="s2">captured and where&#39;s the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.350" end="00:31:11.890" style="s2">what does Bob Marley say none but</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:13.810" style="s2">ourselves can free our minds you got a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.890" end="00:31:15.700" style="s2"> free your mind like recognize</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.810" end="00:31:18.010" style="s2">that you are in fact captured that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.700" end="00:31:21.340" style="s2">blue church and that the orthodoxy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.010" end="00:31:23.530" style="s2">that the habits of mind and the ideology</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.340" end="00:31:27.220" style="s2">and ideological thinking in general are</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.530" end="00:31:30.130" style="s2">all wrong the whole category is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.220" end="00:31:31.720" style="s2">and if you&#39;re running that code you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.130" end="00:31:33.130" style="s2">running that code which means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.720" end="00:31:34.510" style="s2">running code and you&#39;re running somebody</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.130" end="00:31:35.500" style="s2">else&#39;s code which means you&#39;re not free</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.510" end="00:31:37.810" style="s2">you&#39;re not autonomous you&#39;re not an</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.500" end="00:31:40.950" style="s2">agent you are in fact an NPC so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.810" end="00:31:43.630" style="s2">get it straight you are actually an NPC</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.950" end="00:31:45.430" style="s2">realize it accept it and then choose no</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.630" end="00:31:48.670" style="s2">longer to be alright so that&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.430" end="00:31:50.350" style="s2">first step I would call that red pill in</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.670" end="00:31:52.300" style="s2">which because it that should mean but of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.350" end="00:31:53.830" style="s2">course that term has been co-opted and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.300" end="00:31:56.500" style="s2">spun all over the place so I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.830" end="00:31:58.780" style="s2">call it waking up and then taking</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.500" end="00:32:00.190" style="s2">responsibility becoming conscious is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.780" end="00:32:01.600" style="s2">good term but not becoming false</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.190" end="00:32:03.490" style="s2">conscious cuz that linked to that whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.600" end="00:32:05.770" style="s2">category is sucked all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.490" end="00:32:06.400" style="s2">into it so spiritual bypass is another</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.770" end="00:32:08.140" style="s2">problem over here</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.400" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">but actually becoming conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.140" end="00:32:12.760" style="s2">stepping into responsibility in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:13.420" style="s2">deepest possible sense saying okay while</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.760" end="00:32:15.220" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.420" end="00:32:17.170" style="s2">I can tell lots of narratives about how</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.220" end="00:32:18.790" style="s2">all kinds of structural is going on</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.170" end="00:32:20.380" style="s2">about all kinds of historical artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.790" end="00:32:21.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone on and how all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.380" end="00:32:23.650" style="s2">things that are coming from there and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.400" end="00:32:25.060" style="s2">there and they are bad the only thing I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.650" end="00:32:27.220" style="s2">can truly ever be responsible for is</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.060" end="00:32:29.350" style="s2">myself so I&#39;ll take that first and then</p>

<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:51.610" style="s2">world at all then you can start doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.540" end="00:32:54.490" style="s2">effective things live with other people</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.610" end="00:32:55.900" style="s2">that&#39;s fun and by the way when you&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:32:56.440" end="00:33:00.040" style="s2">you can actually do effective things in</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.820" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">the world with these kinds of people so</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.040" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:16.350" style="s2">the biggest challenge is here have to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.260" end="00:33:19.990" style="s2">with what I would call narrow tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.350" end="00:33:21.880" style="s2">in-group groupthink is actually stronger</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.990" end="00:33:23.230" style="s2">here these guys got captured by</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.880" end="00:33:24.940" style="s2">groupthink but it&#39;s not natural to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.230" end="00:33:27.250" style="s2">openness it&#39;s natural here natural is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.940" end="00:33:29.140" style="s2">say okay here&#39;s the truth we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.250" end="00:33:34.120" style="s2">gonna more or less say yes and March</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.140" end="00:33:37.210" style="s2">right and anger right if this group over</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.120" end="00:33:39.100" style="s2">here could go the wrong direction I</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.210" end="00:33:44.110" style="s2">don&#39;t think they are yet and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.100" end="00:33:47.170" style="s2">values of that 1950s through 90 mm I</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.110" end="00:33:49.030" style="s2">sense of right and to do the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.170" end="00:33:51.070" style="s2">like a lot of the values that were the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.030" end="00:33:54.250" style="s2">last half of the 20th century are still</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.070" end="00:33:56.620" style="s2">actually held here they&#39;re not racist in</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.250" end="00:33:58.060" style="s2">a deep sense and they quite distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.620" end="00:33:59.800" style="s2">would be happy to protect people from</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.060" end="00:34:01.900" style="s2">racists who are racist and deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.800" end="00:34:03.640" style="s2">broadly speaking but they could go</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.900" end="00:34:05.410" style="s2">sideways right this thing has a</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.640" end="00:34:05.890" style="s2">possibility of moving there that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.410" end="00:34:07.540" style="s2">be terrible</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.890" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">that would actually be well I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.540" end="00:34:12.160" style="s2">like it at the end like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:14.440" style="s2">recovery from that and so it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.160" end="00:34:16.750" style="s2">important to avoid it and most of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.440" end="00:34:18.850" style="s2">causes it is actually creating a context</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.750" end="00:34:21.630" style="s2">for their only way to be in integrity at</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.850" end="00:34:24.400" style="s2">all is to continue to become more</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.630" end="00:34:26.170" style="s2">together and more extreme so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.400" end="00:34:31.690" style="s2">create some space that doesn&#39;t happen it</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.170" end="00:34:35.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to and then the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.690" end="00:34:38.590" style="s2">of course is to actually have openness</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.880" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">yes actually encounter to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.590" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">natural tendency to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:49.059" style="s2">hmm you know it&#39;s interesting I know</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:52.329" style="s2">exactly what the right answer is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.059" end="00:34:55.990" style="s2">answer is it actually to be able to know</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.329" end="00:34:59.349" style="s2">what truth feels like this team actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.990" end="00:35:03.999" style="s2">is not biased towards head they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.349" end="00:35:06.190" style="s2">as capturable by thinking they can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.999" end="00:35:08.140" style="s2">captured by charismatic manipulation at</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.190" end="00:35:11.200" style="s2">the body level that&#39;s was very important</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.140" end="00:35:13.210" style="s2">to distinguish between those two and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.200" end="00:35:15.190" style="s2">they can also make short-term pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.210" end="00:35:17.859" style="s2">trade-offs which is also something to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.190" end="00:35:20.680" style="s2">careful for but to really be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.859" end="00:35:26.009" style="s2">deep into what is fundamentally true</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.680" end="00:35:29.589" style="s2">like valor virtue honesty integrity</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.009" end="00:35:31.749" style="s2">courage like values that are so deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.589" end="00:35:34.390" style="s2">that they echo down throughout the ages</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.749" end="00:35:35.799" style="s2">and hold those at the absolute center</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.390" end="00:35:37.720" style="s2">without the slightest bit of movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.799" end="00:35:39.519" style="s2">off of them and these guys have to hold</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.720" end="00:35:41.289" style="s2">they have to stand and learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.519" end="00:35:42.819" style="s2">stand and become absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.289" end="00:35:44.170" style="s2">vulnerable to the forces that want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.819" end="00:35:46.569" style="s2">pull them they&#39;re like you know that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.170" end="00:35:48.460" style="s2">scene that the great image of the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.569" end="00:35:50.440" style="s2">rally ethics Nuremberg whatever Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.460" end="00:35:52.239" style="s2">right there&#39;s like a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.440" end="00:35:55.450" style="s2">people in the Nazi salute there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.239" end="00:35:57.039" style="s2">one dude like that right there could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.450" end="00:35:58.809" style="s2">that guy you need a couple of those guys</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.039" end="00:36:02.230" style="s2">ideally a lot but at least a couple</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.809" end="00:36:06.369" style="s2">enough to hold well this thing comes</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.230" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">back and then okay let&#39;s come together</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.369" end="00:36:13.210" style="s2">and I should mention by the way I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:16.569" style="s2">using language that has a very masculine</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.210" end="00:36:19.059" style="s2">feel to it because I am a man and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.569" end="00:36:22.599" style="s2">speak that language very naturally but</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.059" end="00:36:24.849" style="s2">this is very much not that story you</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.599" end="00:36:26.410" style="s2">might even say a much more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.849" end="00:36:27.880" style="s2">level and unfortunately it is very</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.410" end="00:36:29.980" style="s2">challenging to be able to express</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.880" end="00:36:31.569" style="s2">because it&#39;s been more thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.980" end="00:36:34.539" style="s2">captured than anything else in our world</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.569" end="00:36:36.220" style="s2">is simply to actually allow the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.539" end="00:36:38.739" style="s2">to show up and express itself naturally</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.220" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">for what it really is that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.739" end="00:36:43.960" style="s2">deepest answer and what I just said in</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:46.239" style="s2">both cases is that in men and women and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.960" end="00:36:50.589" style="s2">any other kind of being that happens to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.239" end="00:36:52.390" style="s2">want to show up so like the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.589" end="00:36:54.460" style="s2">shows up over here in red that I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.390" end="00:36:56.200" style="s2">describing those virtues each one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.460" end="00:36:58.200" style="s2">those virtues is what it is and is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.200" end="00:37:00.510" style="s2">meaningful person</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.200" end="00:37:03.660" style="s2">I see in the context to which it is has</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.510" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">sworn fealty to the feminine in its most</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.660" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">fundamental archetypal sense that is why</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:11.400" style="s2">it is meaningful that is how it evolved</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:13.530" style="s2">that&#39;s how it exists right so if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.400" end="00:37:15.750" style="s2">don&#39;t have that it&#39;s not real if you do</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.530" end="00:37:18.900" style="s2">have that it is real and then this</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.750" end="00:37:20.579" style="s2">capacity is able to come back but it has</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.900" end="00:37:22.920" style="s2">to completely get out of this whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.579" end="00:37:25.560" style="s2">concept of ideology and completely get</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.920" end="00:37:29.339" style="s2">out of the whole concept of simulated</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.560" end="00:37:36.950" style="s2">thinking getting in the way of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.339" end="00:37:40.859" style="s2">natural capacity to feel and discern and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.950" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">to be able to relax away from fear to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.859" end="00:37:45.750" style="s2">become invulnerable but becoming</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:48.210" style="s2">fearless in the context of what might</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.750" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">happen I really liked I&#39;ve went through</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.210" end="00:37:56.579" style="s2">the foundation with some assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:57.869" style="s2">peace I love the peace about how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.579" end="00:38:00.690" style="s2">in the middle of a potentially a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.869" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">thousand-year disruption wave we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.690" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">know the answers but culture may have</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:06.780" style="s2">the answers culture itself that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">really good to kind of recap sure and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.780" end="00:38:11.609" style="s2">how is that that stored at the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">level the myth our ethic level right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.609" end="00:38:16.530" style="s2">how big is the crisis and where do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:18.180" style="s2">look at the answers can just walk it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.530" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">down yeah all right so the basic premise</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.180" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">is to begin like this the first thing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:28.740" style="s2">kind of allow yourself to accept is</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:30.900" style="s2">something that is real is the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.740" end="00:38:32.760" style="s2">that I&#39;ve used as history happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.900" end="00:38:35.130" style="s2">very odd to me actually the people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.760" end="00:38:37.140" style="s2">are perfectly capable of knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.130" end="00:38:39.089" style="s2">for example the Roman Empire rose and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.140" end="00:38:40.520" style="s2">fell it actually happened there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.089" end="00:38:43.770" style="s2">question that occurred in reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.520" end="00:38:44.819" style="s2">somehow are incapable of perceiving the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.770" end="00:38:47.550" style="s2">notion that therefore it might happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.819" end="00:38:50.310" style="s2">again so let&#39;s just accept the notion</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.550" end="00:38:53.460" style="s2">that that kind of thing happens on</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.310" end="00:38:58.050" style="s2">occasion all right be open to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.460" end="00:38:59.760" style="s2">possibility okay next okay well how how</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.050" end="00:39:00.900" style="s2">do those kinds of things show up well</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.760" end="00:39:02.280" style="s2">there&#39;s and I&#39;m not going to go through</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.900" end="00:39:04.079" style="s2">this in detail we can if you&#39;d like but</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.280" end="00:39:05.190" style="s2">there&#39;s certain characteristics that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.079" end="00:39:07.380" style="s2">can actually begin to take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.190" end="00:39:12.180" style="s2">they give us a sense of when where</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.380" end="00:39:13.980" style="s2">things are and well where we are is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.180" end="00:39:15.210" style="s2">she rather challenging and we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.980" end="00:39:19.290" style="s2">situation which is definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.210" end="00:39:21.390" style="s2">awesome and probably is quite bad okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.290" end="00:39:24.319" style="s2">well how bad how big an order of</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.390" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">magnitude trouble are we looking at well</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.319" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">let&#39;s just take a couple of examples to</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">kind of gauge the order of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.309" end="00:39:35.880" style="s2">let&#39;s just start with one everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.319" end="00:39:37.020" style="s2">involved the whole world every single</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.880" end="00:39:39.240" style="s2">human on the planet is involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.020" end="00:39:41.970" style="s2">door that has never happened before</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.240" end="00:39:43.109" style="s2">before right now any time any trouble</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.970" end="00:39:45.450" style="s2">has emerged it&#39;s been a tiny tiny</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.109" end="00:39:47.010" style="s2">fraction the human family the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.450" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">collapse of all time the bronze age</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.010" end="00:39:53.069" style="s2">collapse happened right there and it hit</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.960" end="00:39:55.770" style="s2">you know 15% most of the cities but 15%</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.069" end="00:39:57.510" style="s2">of the people now everybody&#39;s involved</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.770" end="00:39:59.250" style="s2">so if anything goes sideways that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.510" end="00:40:02.309" style="s2">vaguely the order of magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.250" end="00:40:04.440" style="s2">something of that kind it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.309" end="00:40:06.270" style="s2">a lot bigger like a lot lot bigger</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.440" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">because these things reinforce each</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.270" end="00:40:11.220" style="s2">other you mean notice that when things</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:13.319" style="s2">go south people become less good at</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.220" end="00:40:17.069" style="s2">dealing with each other gently which</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.319" end="00:40:20.309" style="s2">makes it worse Shh let&#39;s try another one</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.069" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">we have nukes lots of us have nukes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.309" end="00:40:23.309" style="s2">we&#39;re getting better at making nukes so</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:24.390" style="s2">more of us are going to have news and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.309" end="00:40:26.700" style="s2">don&#39;t just have nukes we also have</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.390" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">CRISPR which means the big people can</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.700" end="00:40:30.540" style="s2">start making genetic weapons that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:31.859" style="s2">new cliking capacity anding over time</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.540" end="00:40:33.450" style="s2">not too long from now we&#39;re also going</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.859" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">to have micro drones that can target</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.450" end="00:40:38.099" style="s2">assassinate pretty much anybody</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">unconsciously fill in the blank wish to</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.099" end="00:40:43.770" style="s2">say that up until now no matter how hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:46.619" style="s2">we tried we couldn&#39;t really kill that</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.770" end="00:40:48.119" style="s2">many of us we&#39;ve tried really hard we</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.619" end="00:40:49.530" style="s2">have guns and bullets and gas and still</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.119" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t kill that many of us to take a</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.530" end="00:40:53.069" style="s2">look at the human population even the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:54.750" style="s2">Black Plague is like a little did it now</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.069" end="00:41:00.070" style="s2">we can&#39;t in fact kill everybody or at</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.750" end="00:41:03.230" style="s2">least mostly everybody okay next</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.070" end="00:41:05.000" style="s2">technological change I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.230" end="00:41:07.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen the charts to show the pace</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.000" end="00:41:09.670" style="s2">of technological change but if you look</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.700" end="00:41:13.640" style="s2">at a graph that goes like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.670" end="00:41:15.560" style="s2">and you&#39;re here things are different</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.640" end="00:41:18.530" style="s2">than they were when you were here and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.560" end="00:41:20.510" style="s2">the 1940s was like here in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.530" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">pace of change that was going on you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.510" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">know they in the the degree to which our</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:28.040" style="s2">actuation commences our capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:31.220" style="s2">things in the world is accelerating is</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.040" end="00:41:33.290" style="s2">really not comprehensible to anyone I</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.220" end="00:41:35.360" style="s2">wrote an essay called the generation of</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.290" end="00:41:36.680" style="s2">Magan where I talked about if the amount</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.360" end="00:41:39.740" style="s2">of change is continuing to move this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.680" end="00:41:41.420" style="s2">current pace then the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.740" end="00:41:44.300" style="s2">people who are the current generation I</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.420" end="00:41:47.750" style="s2">think it&#39;s like 30 years from now will</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.300" end="00:41:49.550" style="s2">be 1 million times more than now and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.750" end="00:41:52.310" style="s2">kind of get a sense of that that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.550" end="00:41:55.550" style="s2">going from inventing language to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.310" end="00:41:56.690" style="s2">computer in a single generation and of</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.550" end="00:41:58.630" style="s2">course we already have computers so what</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.690" end="00:42:03.170" style="s2">that looked like</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.630" end="00:42:04.910" style="s2">that&#39;s big Shh it&#39;s like three or four</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.170" end="00:42:07.700" style="s2">more oh sorry climate we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.910" end="00:42:09.980" style="s2">whole world every single one of our</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.700" end="00:42:11.930" style="s2">activities has a characteristic that it</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.980" end="00:42:13.810" style="s2">generates an externality it is not well</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.930" end="00:42:15.890" style="s2">processed by the complex environment</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.810" end="00:42:17.420" style="s2">when we&#39;re relatively lightweight</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.890" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">there&#39;s not many of us and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.420" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">engaging a lot of those activities the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:25.100" style="s2">complex environment can still process it</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:26.690" style="s2">sometimes heavy metals not so much well</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.100" end="00:42:29.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of us and we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.690" end="00:42:30.350" style="s2">increasingly intensive activities so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.150" end="00:42:32.510" style="s2">not really talking about climate change</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.350" end="00:42:35.240" style="s2">which has kind of been scary</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.510" end="00:42:36.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s like this bit on the scale I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.240" end="00:42:38.810" style="s2">talking about comprehensive destructured</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.680" end="00:42:41.510" style="s2">the entire complex web of the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.810" end="00:42:43.910" style="s2">across every single bind I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.510" end="00:42:46.490" style="s2">about concentration of heavy metals</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.910" end="00:42:48.200" style="s2">hormones I&#39;m talking about the complete</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.490" end="00:42:49.730" style="s2">depletion of oxygen in oceans I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.200" end="00:42:51.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a show</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.730" end="00:42:53.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s n-dimensional it&#39;s all over the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.530" end="00:42:54.980" style="s2">place and each one reinforces the others</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.060" end="00:42:56.690" style="s2">so it&#39;s at some point all we need is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.980" end="00:42:58.070" style="s2">little tipping point here then you get</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.690" end="00:43:00.650" style="s2">cascade effects that run all over the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.070" end="00:43:02.990" style="s2">place I can go on by the way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.650" end="00:43:05.570" style="s2">about 500 of these each one of which</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.990" end="00:43:07.250" style="s2">tells the same story it&#39;s big the order</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.570" end="00:43:08.540" style="s2">of magnitude is at least a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.250" end="00:43:09.770" style="s2">years and probably on the order of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.540" end="00:43:12.230" style="s2">million years we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.770" end="00:43:13.019" style="s2">origin of humanity big and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.230" end="00:43:15.329" style="s2">bigger than that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.019" end="00:43:17.069" style="s2">as in the inflection point yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.329" end="00:43:18.689" style="s2">transition that we&#39;re facing right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.069" end="00:43:20.819" style="s2">the magnitude of the thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.689" end="00:43:23.130" style="s2">dealing with the magnitude of what we</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.819" end="00:43:26.009" style="s2">have to be capable responding to if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.130" end="00:43:28.140" style="s2">want to be able to deal with it is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.009" end="00:43:29.249" style="s2">biggest thing humanity has ever faced by</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.140" end="00:43:31.649" style="s2">a large margin</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.249" end="00:43:33.779" style="s2">so it&#39;s as challenging as the process of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.649" end="00:43:35.719" style="s2">becoming human at all and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.779" end="00:43:38.909" style="s2">bigger than that I can just keep going</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.719" end="00:43:40.799" style="s2">so now the question is how long God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.909" end="00:43:42.029" style="s2">name did we deal with that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.799" end="00:43:45.059" style="s2">proposition that I was making in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.029" end="00:43:46.949" style="s2">particular article is well we probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.059" end="00:43:50.130" style="s2">have another slightest idea and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.949" end="00:43:53.069" style="s2">working as human beings we&#39;re we live a</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.130" end="00:43:54.749" style="s2">hundred years and most of that is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.069" end="00:43:56.729" style="s2">in a thirty year window</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.749" end="00:43:59.369" style="s2">we&#39;re actually agentic lee acting out in</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.729" end="00:44:01.799" style="s2">the world so we&#39;re not really wired to</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.369" end="00:44:04.859" style="s2">deal with things that are magnitudes</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.799" end="00:44:06.269" style="s2">larger than that we aren&#39;t well designed</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.859" end="00:44:07.829" style="s2">to perceive things that are much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.269" end="00:44:12.899" style="s2">than us from are smaller than us in</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.829" end="00:44:15.089" style="s2">scale space or time so then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.899" end="00:44:16.949" style="s2">ask ourselves what might be what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.089" end="00:44:19.169" style="s2">thing might be would be part of for</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.949" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">being relationship with that is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.169" end="00:44:23.099" style="s2">of thing that ordeals and orders of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:25.559" style="s2">magnitude that are even vaguely in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.099" end="00:44:26.939" style="s2">size that we&#39;re dealing with and so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.559" end="00:44:29.489" style="s2">proposition is that perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.939" end="00:44:30.869" style="s2">something like culture maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.489" end="00:44:32.189" style="s2">something deeper than culture like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.869" end="00:44:35.509" style="s2">generator functionally gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.189" end="00:44:39.649" style="s2">culture itself like innovation in</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.509" end="00:44:39.649" style="s2">evolution it&#39;s something in that order</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.679" end="00:44:43.019" style="s2">well the mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.219" end="00:44:45.529" style="s2">yeah so when you say the myth but strong</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.019" end="00:44:51.389" style="s2">structures what I what I hear is either</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.529" end="00:44:52.979" style="s2">culture or evolution in its depth so let</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.389" end="00:44:54.299" style="s2">me take that what I mean by that so a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.979" end="00:44:56.579" style="s2">culture wants a culture I mean is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.299" end="00:44:58.349" style="s2">that thing that humans do now I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.579" end="00:45:00.809" style="s2">go deeper than that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.349" end="00:45:03.209" style="s2">spell out what that means oh why sure</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.809" end="00:45:04.949" style="s2">with culture might say it&#39;s a myth so</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.209" end="00:45:07.019" style="s2">what what does it mean I&#39;m gonna get to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.949" end="00:45:10.159" style="s2">mathematics in a second so when I say</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.019" end="00:45:13.669" style="s2">culture what I mean is we create</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.159" end="00:45:17.609" style="s2">artifacts institutions stories</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.669" end="00:45:19.559" style="s2">technologies that actuate our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.609" end="00:45:23.939" style="s2">increase our capacity to think and to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.559" end="00:45:26.910" style="s2">in the world and that change us and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.939" end="00:45:29.279" style="s2">we create them they create us and to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.910" end="00:45:30.359" style="s2">we co-evolved but their artifacts that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.279" end="00:45:32.069" style="s2">are produced by us through our</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.359" end="00:45:34.140" style="s2">intelligence through our hands and our</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.069" end="00:45:36.809" style="s2">capacity to do things in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.140" end="00:45:40.349" style="s2">this one of the things that we do is we</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.809" end="00:45:42.359" style="s2">retell stories and when we tell stories</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.349" end="00:45:44.190" style="s2">we will often find that our stories are</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.359" end="00:45:47.190" style="s2">built around these mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.190" end="00:45:48.809" style="s2">archetypes now there&#39;s two possible ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.190" end="00:45:49.619" style="s2">of grasping this notion of mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.809" end="00:45:51.509" style="s2">archetype</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.619" end="00:45:52.740" style="s2">well three one has to say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.509" end="00:45:55.079" style="s2">nonsense but I&#39;m going to ignore that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.740" end="00:45:56.339" style="s2">one the second is the most common is to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.079" end="00:45:58.259" style="s2">say well it&#39;s an artifact of culture</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.339" end="00:46:00.420" style="s2">that cultures have been telling stories</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.259" end="00:46:02.220" style="s2">for a long time and to the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.420" end="00:46:04.200" style="s2">which certain stories have been showing</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.220" end="00:46:06.650" style="s2">up over and over again which means that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.200" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">there in cultures they&#39;ve been around or</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.650" end="00:46:11.250" style="s2">they keep showing up in culture it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:13.859" style="s2">of the two they have a high density to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.250" end="00:46:15.210" style="s2">them they have a perennial nough stew</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.859" end="00:46:16.470" style="s2">them and so they were kind of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.210" end="00:46:18.930" style="s2">you might want to consider counting on</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.470" end="00:46:20.009" style="s2">when things get squishy so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.930" end="00:46:20.819" style="s2">way of taking a look at it so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.009" end="00:46:22.289" style="s2">doing that something that&#39;s in the order</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.819" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">of magnitude of say a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.289" end="00:46:25.980" style="s2">that by itself is enough if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:28.920" style="s2">to be trying to search for what are the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.980" end="00:46:31.019" style="s2">kinds of things that pass on through</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.920" end="00:46:32.690" style="s2">thousand year cycles we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.019" end="00:46:35.670" style="s2">be looking for the deep mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.690" end="00:46:37.710" style="s2">locations in our stories and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.670" end="00:46:40.349" style="s2">in our bodies so let&#39;s talk about our</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.710" end="00:46:44.279" style="s2">bodies because the same threat works at</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.349" end="00:46:47.130" style="s2">a longer scale our bodies are narratives</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.279" end="00:46:49.759" style="s2">in a sense meaning that the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.130" end="00:46:52.289" style="s2">things that have been showing up for now</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.759" end="00:46:53.970" style="s2">thousands of generations the things have</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.289" end="00:46:56.549" style="s2">been showing that made us Homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.970" end="00:46:59.130" style="s2">sapiens instincts that are wired into us</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.549" end="00:47:03.000" style="s2">at a very deep level at a precognitive</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.130" end="00:47:04.500" style="s2">level are still mythopoetic in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.000" end="00:47:05.849" style="s2">deeper sense meaning that they are the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.500" end="00:47:08.759" style="s2">kinds of things that showed up because</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.849" end="00:47:11.369" style="s2">they continue to show up protect your</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.759" end="00:47:13.559" style="s2">young is a mythopoetic this is in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.369" end="00:47:16.710" style="s2">body it is physical because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.559" end="00:47:18.660" style="s2">any being that has young that are not</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.710" end="00:47:19.920" style="s2">fish and being that has a small number</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.660" end="00:47:22.200" style="s2">of young that are relatively vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.920" end="00:47:24.750" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t embody protect your young is</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.200" end="00:47:26.309" style="s2">quickly extinguished now of course we</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.750" end="00:47:27.750" style="s2">can be conscious of that and have it as</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.309" end="00:47:30.990" style="s2">a virtue but our body naturally</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.750" end="00:47:32.730" style="s2">expresses it and so that process is even</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.990" end="00:47:34.440" style="s2">deeper it&#39;s because okay well what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.730" end="00:47:36.450" style="s2">that what&#39;s happening there is there a</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.440" end="00:47:38.670" style="s2">story in that are there deep threads</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.450" end="00:47:40.259" style="s2">that are actually showing up that brings</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.670" end="00:47:40.839" style="s2">us to where we are now</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.259" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">now that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.839" end="00:47:45.640" style="s2">say well the mythopoetic stories are</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:47.829" style="s2">both they&#39;re both narratives that have</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.640" end="00:47:51.609" style="s2">happened to keep showing up and they are</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.829" end="00:47:54.460" style="s2">also wisdom that has been endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.609" end="00:47:56.950" style="s2">find the deepest threads that have been</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.460" end="00:48:01.420" style="s2">showing up in our bodies that are as</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.950" end="00:48:02.769" style="s2">deep as we can go and to reify them into</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.420" end="00:48:04.690" style="s2">things that can be made available to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.769" end="00:48:07.690" style="s2">consciousness so they can we find them</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.690" end="00:48:08.920" style="s2">and do them well that is the ground upon</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.690" end="00:48:11.190" style="s2">which you can build something they might</p>
