<p begin="00:00:05.960" end="00:00:12.389" style="s2">so our next speaker has requested I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:14.360" style="s2">introduce him as a professor in exile</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.389" end="00:00:16.680" style="s2">from Evergreen State College down in</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.360" end="00:00:30.289" style="s2">Washington State so please give a warm</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.680" end="00:00:35.190" style="s2">welcome for dr. Brett Weinstein hi there</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.289" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">thank you for that nice warm welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:40.050" style="s2">it&#39;s great to see so many people who as</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:43.410" style="s2">I understand it are gathered because</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.050" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">they are interested in Liberty I must</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.410" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2">say I also am quite interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:49.950" style="s2">Liberty so I&#39;m looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">talking to many of you and to the panel</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.950" end="00:00:55.559" style="s2">discussion that will come later I should</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">say I had some jokes that I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.559" end="00:01:01.379" style="s2">open up with but somebody warned me that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">I should not make jokes about hockey</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.379" end="00:01:08.060" style="s2">while in Canada so there goes the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:10.979" style="s2">15 minutes of what I was planning to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.060" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">you can learn a lot from what people</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.979" end="00:01:15.869" style="s2">tell you you&#39;re not allowed to joke</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">about in a particular location my wife</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.869" end="00:01:20.909" style="s2">and I went on our honeymoon in Turkey</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:22.350" style="s2">and we were told that Turks are very</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.909" end="00:01:24.630" style="s2">warm people who will talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.350" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">just about anything but don&#39;t joke about</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.630" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">Ataturk so Ataturk if you&#39;re in Turkey</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">hockey if you&#39;re in Canada these are</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">topics to be treated carefully all right</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">so um yeah the title of my talk is how</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">the magic trick is done I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:43.100" style="s2">odd position at the moment and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">position is as somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.100" end="00:01:49.229" style="s2">analytically fascinated by systems and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">the way they evolve and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.229" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">I&#39;m at the center of an event that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">presumably many of you know about at</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:57.930" style="s2">Evergreen State College so I&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">opportunity to watch this system evolve</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.930" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">from a vantage point that few people</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">have and it means that my analytical</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:08.069" style="s2">side has been tracking the way such</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:10.950" style="s2">movements function and has been learning</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.069" end="00:02:12.989" style="s2">an amazing amount at a tremendous rate</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.950" end="00:02:13.970" style="s2">just by virtue of the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.989" end="00:02:17.270" style="s2">so much to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.970" end="00:02:19.370" style="s2">scene and to be discussed alternative</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.270" end="00:02:22.250" style="s2">title for the talk that I rejected is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.370" end="00:02:24.850" style="s2">evergreen is your future because as much</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.250" end="00:02:27.380" style="s2">as I think what happened at Evergreen is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.850" end="00:02:29.600" style="s2">extraordinary I do think what it is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.380" end="00:02:31.610" style="s2">ahead of the curve and if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.600" end="00:02:34.310" style="s2">careful what happened at Evergreen is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.610" end="00:02:35.870" style="s2">going to happen everywhere and we really</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.310" end="00:02:39.590" style="s2">ought to be careful because as much as</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.870" end="00:02:42.530" style="s2">what took place at Evergreen was absurd</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.590" end="00:02:44.380" style="s2">and therefore in some ways potentially</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.530" end="00:02:47.450" style="s2">amusing if you weren&#39;t trapped in it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.380" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">what it represents is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.450" end="00:02:52.250" style="s2">dangerous and I don&#39;t just mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:53.750" style="s2">dangerous even to the university system</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.250" end="00:02:57.320" style="s2">which would be bad enough but really</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.750" end="00:03:00.020" style="s2">dangerous to civilization itself because</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.320" end="00:03:02.630" style="s2">the university system is where those who</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.020" end="00:03:06.530" style="s2">run civilization figure out how to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.630" end="00:03:08.840" style="s2">and if we take the the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.530" end="00:03:10.310" style="s2">whereby we train people how to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.840" end="00:03:12.470" style="s2">critically and carefully and how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.310" end="00:03:15.709" style="s2">discover things that are true that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.470" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">don&#39;t they don&#39;t expect or into it then</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.709" end="00:03:19.880" style="s2">civilization is going to lose its</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:22.100" style="s2">ability to navigate and I must say I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.880" end="00:03:25.790" style="s2">find that prospect absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.100" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">frightening so my plan is to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.790" end="00:03:29.750" style="s2">little bit about some observations some</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:32.660" style="s2">of these observations have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.750" end="00:03:35.180" style="s2">place in a kind of a logical progression</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.660" end="00:03:37.160" style="s2">other ones stand isolated but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.180" end="00:03:39.709" style="s2">nonetheless I think it&#39;s worth your time</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.160" end="00:03:42.140" style="s2">to have heard them from what I guess is</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.709" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">an insider perspective so you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.140" end="00:03:49.400" style="s2">recognize them when they happen in other</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:52.340" style="s2">places so let&#39;s talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.400" end="00:03:54.769" style="s2">humor we brushed on that topic a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.340" end="00:03:58.970" style="s2">bit to begin with but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.769" end="00:04:02.090" style="s2">that is decidedly humorless about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.970" end="00:04:04.310" style="s2">social justice warrior culture and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.090" end="00:04:06.980" style="s2">must say when I find people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.310" end="00:04:09.290" style="s2">humorless it doesn&#39;t necessarily tell me</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.980" end="00:04:11.510" style="s2">that they&#39;re bad but it does send up a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.290" end="00:04:13.880" style="s2">warning flag and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.510" end="00:04:17.750" style="s2">because humor has a very special role to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.880" end="00:04:22.010" style="s2">play for human civilization we navigate</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.750" end="00:04:24.590" style="s2">gray area nuance the counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.010" end="00:04:26.840" style="s2">that which is not what it seems all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.590" end="00:04:29.510" style="s2">those things are navigated normally</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.840" end="00:04:31.550" style="s2">humor it&#39;s a way in which we can tread</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.510" end="00:04:34.040" style="s2">into that territory without committing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.550" end="00:04:37.010" style="s2">ourselves fully but investigating what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.040" end="00:04:41.540" style="s2">actually true so a humorless movement is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:43.370" style="s2">in some sense a mobile it cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.540" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">convinced that it has something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.370" end="00:04:46.930" style="s2">and it cannot redirect itself and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">when we look at the social justice</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.930" end="00:04:52.040" style="s2">revolution and we find it very committed</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:54.860" style="s2">to things that are not even superficial</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.040" end="00:04:57.949" style="s2">superficially reasonable part of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.860" end="00:04:59.479" style="s2">must have happened is its own commitment</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.949" end="00:05:01.729" style="s2">to the idea that what it already</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.479" end="00:05:03.800" style="s2">believes is sufficiently true that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.729" end="00:05:07.190" style="s2">does not need to redirect in any way</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.800" end="00:05:12.020" style="s2">that commitment has kept it on a steady</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.190" end="00:05:14.229" style="s2">bearing that cannot be disrupted next</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.020" end="00:05:18.440" style="s2">thing to say is that some stories</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.229" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">diagnose a system and so the story of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.440" end="00:05:23.030" style="s2">what happened at Evergreen happens to</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:25.400" style="s2">have diagnosed several systems some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.030" end="00:05:28.100" style="s2">which we are all involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.400" end="00:05:32.180" style="s2">certainly diagnosed the press in a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.100" end="00:05:34.419" style="s2">that I find most disturbing so let&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.180" end="00:05:35.900" style="s2">the moment be overly overly</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.419" end="00:05:37.700" style="s2">black-and-white about it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.900" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">dichotomized the press into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.700" end="00:05:42.710" style="s2">nominally left-leaning and the nominally</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:45.560" style="s2">right leaning press the left-leaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.710" end="00:05:49.669" style="s2">press with some significant exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.560" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">came very late to the story and was very</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.669" end="00:05:53.630" style="s2">reluctant about reporting it to their to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:57.830" style="s2">the extent it was willing to report it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.630" end="00:06:01.070" style="s2">at all now why is that so well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.830" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">afraid the answer is the story did not</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.070" end="00:06:05.570" style="s2">fit the left narrative in fact it said</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:07.910" style="s2">there was something wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.570" end="00:06:10.460" style="s2">standard left narrative that needed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.910" end="00:06:13.099" style="s2">be understood and so the left press</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.460" end="00:06:15.410" style="s2">rather than figure out how to report the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.099" end="00:06:17.479" style="s2">story decided it would rather not report</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.410" end="00:06:20.030" style="s2">the story and maybe just wait it out see</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.479" end="00:06:22.099" style="s2">if the story would go away now if I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.030" end="00:06:28.010" style="s2">just be clear about what the problem was</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.099" end="00:06:32.539" style="s2">at Evergreen we had bigots of color even</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.010" end="00:06:35.450" style="s2">worse we had black bigots of color that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.539" end="00:06:37.640" style="s2">is not a comfortable story for the left</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.450" end="00:06:40.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a story the left does not like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.640" end="00:06:42.620" style="s2">a story I do not like nonetheless that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.760" end="00:06:44.450" style="s2">what happened and therefore if you were</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.620" end="00:06:46.730" style="s2">to approach the Evergreen story</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.450" end="00:06:49.160" style="s2">journalistically you would be compelled</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.730" end="00:06:50.840" style="s2">to figure out how to report that story</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.160" end="00:06:54.380" style="s2">and to the extent that it reflected</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.840" end="00:06:56.600" style="s2">badly on the left narrative so be it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.380" end="00:06:58.910" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the way the press works now</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.600" end="00:07:02.090" style="s2">in part we could say shame on the press</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.910" end="00:07:03.740" style="s2">but we could also say well why is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.090" end="00:07:06.140" style="s2">press reluctant to report</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.740" end="00:07:08.780" style="s2">counterintuitive stories for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.140" end="00:07:10.340" style="s2">you would imagine that that would draw a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.780" end="00:07:13.460" style="s2">certain number of people to read a</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.490" end="00:07:20.480" style="s2">right so you might imagine that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.650" end="00:07:21.860" style="s2">would be some draw for the left press to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.480" end="00:07:25.220" style="s2">report a story that doesn&#39;t sound like</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.860" end="00:07:28.130" style="s2">normal on the other hand in a market the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.220" end="00:07:30.230" style="s2">press has to compete long term against</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.130" end="00:07:31.790" style="s2">other elements of the press and one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.230" end="00:07:34.250" style="s2">the things that the press like other</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.790" end="00:07:36.860" style="s2">entities do is it tells us things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.250" end="00:07:39.560" style="s2">reinforce the beliefs we already hold in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.860" end="00:07:41.780" style="s2">order to get us to come back and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.560" end="00:07:44.900" style="s2">there is some reflex there to simply</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.780" end="00:07:50.330" style="s2">reject a story in which the bigots are</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.900" end="00:07:51.500" style="s2">black the right-leaning press did</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.330" end="00:07:55.130" style="s2">something different</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.500" end="00:07:57.590" style="s2">the right-leaning press engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.130" end="00:08:00.050" style="s2">regular journalism now I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.590" end="00:08:02.330" style="s2">every entity on the right but I do mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.050" end="00:08:04.730" style="s2">in general there were a number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.330" end="00:08:06.890" style="s2">publications that are decidedly</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.730" end="00:08:09.110" style="s2">right-of-center that reported the story</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.890" end="00:08:10.940" style="s2">perfectly straight now</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.110" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t necessarily know that as</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.940" end="00:08:14.930" style="s2">outsiders to the story but as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:17.090" style="s2">who knew the players of the story could</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.930" end="00:08:18.530" style="s2">spot every error that was reported every</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.090" end="00:08:20.840" style="s2">time the press said something that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.530" end="00:08:22.640" style="s2">factually incorrect it was obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.840" end="00:08:25.310" style="s2">and to my wife who was also a professor</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.640" end="00:08:27.020" style="s2">at Evergreen and it was not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.310" end="00:08:29.210" style="s2">obvious to the public so I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.020" end="00:08:31.310" style="s2">which press outlets did the best job</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.210" end="00:08:33.320" style="s2">which ones did their homework which ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.310" end="00:08:36.380" style="s2">figured out who was who and what their</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.320" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">roles were and campus reform did a great</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:41.110" style="s2">job the Weekly Standard did a great job</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:44.570" style="s2">The Wall Street Journal did a great job</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.110" end="00:08:46.790" style="s2">so what I&#39;m telling you is that in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.570" end="00:08:48.710" style="s2">particular case there was an outbreak of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.790" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">great journalism on the right because</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.710" end="00:08:53.330" style="s2">the story didn&#39;t conflict with anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">that forced the right leading press into</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.330" end="00:08:57.499" style="s2">a contortion</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:59.509" style="s2">now I don&#39;t think either right or left</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.499" end="00:09:00.949" style="s2">really has the answer at the moment I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.509" end="00:09:02.180" style="s2">think both right and left are a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.949" end="00:09:05.870" style="s2">confused and they&#39;re confused about</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.180" end="00:09:08.420" style="s2">different things but this story says</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.870" end="00:09:10.699" style="s2">something about the press and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.420" end="00:09:15.350" style="s2">polarization and what its implications</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.699" end="00:09:19.550" style="s2">are for society the core issue is one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.350" end="00:09:21.740" style="s2">narrative there are narratives that run</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.550" end="00:09:23.899" style="s2">underneath what the press reports either</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.740" end="00:09:26.029" style="s2">right or left and to the extent that a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.899" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">story violates the core narrative it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.029" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">problem to the extent that it validates</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:33.889" style="s2">a core narrative it is seen as positive</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:35.839" style="s2">what we as consumers of journalism</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.889" end="00:09:37.999" style="s2">should be thinking is there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.839" end="00:09:40.100" style="s2">that the press is built around</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.999" end="00:09:42.319" style="s2">narratives and that it is doing any kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.100" end="00:09:44.120" style="s2">of analysis whatsoever that depends on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.319" end="00:09:46.850" style="s2">particular story of matching a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.120" end="00:09:49.189" style="s2">what we should want is a press that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.850" end="00:09:51.350" style="s2">non ideological and reports the story as</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.189" end="00:09:53.029" style="s2">it is and to the extent that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.350" end="00:09:55.819" style="s2">validates some narrative in the outer</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.029" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">world so be it but narrative should not</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.819" end="00:10:00.019" style="s2">be driving our journalism and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:02.300" style="s2">diagnosis of the system here is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.019" end="00:10:04.519" style="s2">narrative is playing a profound role in</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.300" end="00:10:09.319" style="s2">everything but you can only see it when</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.519" end="00:10:12.949" style="s2">something causes an error another system</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.319" end="00:10:15.949" style="s2">that was diagnosed by this fiasco is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.949" end="00:10:19.819" style="s2">university system the university system</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.949" end="00:10:22.819" style="s2">has been engaged in multiple jobs in</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.819" end="00:10:25.670" style="s2">society it certainly plays an important</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.819" end="00:10:28.069" style="s2">role in training people to function but</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.670" end="00:10:30.500" style="s2">it&#39;s also involved in industry and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.069" end="00:10:32.120" style="s2">involved in markets and it is involved</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.730" end="00:10:40.009" style="s2">is counterproductive to the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.699" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">inquiry and that should probably be our</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.009" end="00:10:45.319" style="s2">primary take-home message here is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:47.269" style="s2">inquiry is essential and it cannot start</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.490" end="00:14:20.430" style="s2">can&#39;t be answered because there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.970" end="00:14:53.130" style="s2">there is a system of things that if one</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.130" end="00:14:58.680" style="s2">example there are linguistic traps and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.430" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">there are many of them so a linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.680" end="00:15:03.750" style="s2">trap involves something like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:06.090" style="s2">redefinition of a word like racism or</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.750" end="00:15:08.610" style="s2">white supremacy so the word gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.090" end="00:15:11.460" style="s2">redefined and it gets redefined in a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.610" end="00:15:13.460" style="s2">that sets the bar incredibly low so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.460" end="00:15:16.530" style="s2">really you can&#39;t help a trip over it</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.460" end="00:15:18.540" style="s2">having tripped over it the penalty phase</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.530" end="00:15:21.690" style="s2">takes the definition right back to its</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.540" end="00:15:24.060" style="s2">traditional one so if you turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.690" end="00:15:26.340" style="s2">a white supremacist because you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.060" end="00:15:27.900" style="s2">failed to properly confront a system</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.340" end="00:15:30.750" style="s2">that has been deemed guilty of white</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.900" end="00:15:32.490" style="s2">supremacy then the penalty for white</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.750" end="00:15:34.950" style="s2">supremacy is as if you have burned a</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.030" end="00:18:27.890" style="s2">it reworks the world to avail itself of</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.890" end="00:18:32.970" style="s2">so when I say self-defense some circuit</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.350" end="00:18:35.070" style="s2">in your mind goes off because you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.970" end="00:18:36.780" style="s2">that if you are defending yourselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.070" end="00:18:37.830" style="s2">you&#39;re entitled to do things that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.780" end="00:18:41.160" style="s2">would not under ordinary circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.830" end="00:18:42.930" style="s2">be entitled to do you cannot kill</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.930" end="00:18:45.870" style="s2">self-defense and then you absolutely can</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.460" end="00:18:48.810" style="s2">and you&#39;ll walk away scot-free</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.870" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">so self-defense is a very powerful</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.179" end="00:23:07.989" style="s2">them so that nobody would listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.190" end="00:23:11.759" style="s2">that was the idea and it didn&#39;t matter</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.299" end="00:23:20.440" style="s2">all right there are two kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.179" end="00:23:22.299" style="s2">within the social justice movement you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.440" end="00:23:24.129" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily tell them apart</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.299" end="00:23:26.440" style="s2">because the current system their current</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.129" end="00:23:29.590" style="s2">circumstances make them sound alike</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.440" end="00:23:31.600" style="s2">the first group by far the much larger</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.590" end="00:23:34.570" style="s2">group and the much more difficult one</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:36.580" style="s2">for people like me to figure out what to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.570" end="00:23:39.730" style="s2">do with our people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.580" end="00:23:42.309" style="s2">against oppression I am against</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.730" end="00:23:46.299" style="s2">oppression so ordinarily I would think</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.309" end="00:23:49.330" style="s2">these would be my natural allies but yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.299" end="00:23:50.980" style="s2">they attack me the second group inside</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.330" end="00:23:54.399" style="s2">the movement are people who wish to turn</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.980" end="00:23:57.789" style="s2">the tables of oppression those would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.399" end="00:24:00.399" style="s2">my enemies the fact is though the ones</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.789" end="00:24:02.529" style="s2">who wish to confront oppression and to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.399" end="00:24:06.220" style="s2">undo it don&#39;t realize what they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.529" end="00:24:09.580" style="s2">signed up for many of the prime movers</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.220" end="00:24:11.529" style="s2">in the movement are actually bad actors</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:13.299" style="s2">who have not shared the plan with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.529" end="00:24:14.710" style="s2">rank-and-file of the movement so many of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.299" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">the people inside the movement are</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.710" end="00:24:19.389" style="s2">well-intentioned but not skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:25.659" style="s2">enough and have fallen into something</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.389" end="00:24:28.090" style="s2">unholy the allies tend to sign on based</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.659" end="00:24:30.790" style="s2">on what I would call the label on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.090" end="00:24:33.910" style="s2">box so there&#39;s a box</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.790" end="00:24:36.070" style="s2">it says equity on it and then people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.910" end="00:24:39.700" style="s2">asked well are you in favor of racial</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.070" end="00:24:43.030" style="s2">equity most people would answer yes okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.700" end="00:24:46.180" style="s2">you&#39;re with us but what&#39;s in the box is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.030" end="00:24:47.650" style="s2">not actually equity and so one finds if</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.180" end="00:24:49.390" style="s2">you sign up based on the label of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.650" end="00:24:54.220" style="s2">box if you&#39;ve signed up for something</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.390" end="00:24:56.770" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t bargain for there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.220" end="00:24:58.330" style="s2">another reason that allies sign on with</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.770" end="00:25:00.010" style="s2">the bad actors who are driving the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.330" end="00:25:02.830" style="s2">social justice movement and that is out</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.010" end="00:25:05.350" style="s2">of fear of being targeted themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.830" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">we have a very dangerous movement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.350" end="00:25:12.580" style="s2">proven that it has the power to harm</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:15.070" style="s2">people and many people who fear that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.580" end="00:25:18.250" style="s2">might come for them that it might ferret</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.070" end="00:25:21.070" style="s2">out some kind of hidden white supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.250" end="00:25:22.990" style="s2">in their minds or something sign up in</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.070" end="00:25:24.490" style="s2">an effort to demonstrate that they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.990" end="00:25:29.530" style="s2">good people so that the movement does</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.490" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">not come after them we also have what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.530" end="00:25:34.600" style="s2">would call marginal coalition members</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:37.450" style="s2">who have signed up in in an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.600" end="00:25:40.180" style="s2">get ahead for fear that they will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.450" end="00:25:42.840" style="s2">shunted on to the other side so the</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:54.010" style="s2">sort of future idealized state is based</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.370" end="00:25:56.170" style="s2">on how much historical oppression you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.010" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">have faced based on which populations</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:03.370" style="s2">been now I will point out that even if</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.030" end="00:26:04.300" style="s2">we accept intersectionality on its own</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.090" end="00:30:16.789" style="s2">well it&#39;s very uncomfortable and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.710" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">I got into big trouble for tweeting that</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.139" end="00:30:32.870" style="s2">term black supremacy not once did</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.889" end="00:30:41.899" style="s2">effectively that that was an impolite</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.630" end="00:30:44.179" style="s2">term for it but we had all seen it we</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.899" end="00:30:45.740" style="s2">had all seen the circumstance where</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.179" end="00:30:49.480" style="s2">people would walk into a room and they</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.309" end="00:31:05.059" style="s2">so in some sense it&#39;s undeniable that</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.220" end="00:31:05.870" style="s2">what was being pursued was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.059" end="00:31:08.269" style="s2">supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.870" end="00:31:08.690" style="s2">my feeling is I&#39;m against any kind of</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.120" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">game theory is at the core of what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.850" end="00:35:33.540" style="s2">think about all the time but I must say</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:34.650" style="s2">if there&#39;s one subject that I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.540" end="00:35:37.829" style="s2">people would</p>

<p begin="00:35:41.789" end="00:35:45.569" style="s2">theory would be at the top of the list</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.140" end="00:35:48.029" style="s2">when I say game theory to people though</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.569" end="00:35:49.950" style="s2">I very often get a strange reaction it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.029" end="00:35:53.190" style="s2">has some kind of a bad stigma associated</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.950" end="00:35:56.250" style="s2">with it and I think what goes on is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.190" end="00:35:57.950" style="s2">term game is confusing to people when</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.950" end="00:36:02.549" style="s2">problems in civilization and you say</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.510" end="00:36:04.140" style="s2">well this is really a question of game</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.549" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">theory it sounds like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.140" end="00:36:08.549" style="s2">trivializing the issue so we need to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:11.279" style="s2">we either need to rename game theory or</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.549" end="00:36:13.500" style="s2">get over that stigma and realize that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.279" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">game theory the meaning of the term game</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.500" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">in the situation is that this is about</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:20.730" style="s2">complex systems in which there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:22.710" style="s2">competition in which there is winning</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.730" end="00:36:25.319" style="s2">and losing and it describes all such</p>

<p begin="00:36:32.130" end="00:36:36.690" style="s2">things that we&#39;re trying to sort out and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.020" end="00:36:39.180" style="s2">understanding the game theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.690" end="00:36:43.980" style="s2">social justice movement is I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.180" end="00:36:51.569" style="s2">essential if we are going to if we are</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.980" end="00:36:54.420" style="s2">going to defeat it so there are three</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.569" end="00:36:56.490" style="s2">kinds of players in the movement and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.420" end="00:36:58.440" style="s2">they are motivated to be there by three</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.490" end="00:37:01.349" style="s2">different things there are the prime</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.440" end="00:37:02.819" style="s2">movers which I described already the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.349" end="00:37:05.369" style="s2">prime movers are people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.819" end="00:37:08.010" style="s2">advancing their own agenda and are most</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.369" end="00:37:11.220" style="s2">likely to be conscious of what they are</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.010" end="00:37:13.559" style="s2">doing they get ahead through</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.220" end="00:37:15.420" style="s2">manipulation presumably they are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.559" end="00:37:18.029" style="s2">source of many of the linguistic traps</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.420" end="00:37:19.829" style="s2">and the policy proposals and the cost</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.029" end="00:37:23.789" style="s2">driving that allows the movement to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.829" end="00:37:27.029" style="s2">function the second group of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.789" end="00:37:29.279" style="s2">after the prime movers are the tools so</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.029" end="00:37:31.289" style="s2">the tools in the movement are people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.279" end="00:37:34.859" style="s2">have signed up maybe because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.289" end="00:37:36.750" style="s2">heard a sound bite about what sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.859" end="00:37:38.369" style="s2">values they are pursuing and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.750" end="00:37:41.250" style="s2">haven&#39;t looked any more deeply into it</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.369" end="00:37:42.990" style="s2">and they find themselves being bossed</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.250" end="00:37:45.660" style="s2">around and told how to serve the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.990" end="00:37:47.789" style="s2">movement best we saw a lot of this at</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.660" end="00:37:48.760" style="s2">Evergreen many of the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.789" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.760" end="00:37:56.350" style="s2">a sort of intersectional reversal of</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.350" end="00:38:03.250" style="s2">themselves white students now you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.180" end="00:38:06.310" style="s2">understand this more deeply if you look</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.250" end="00:38:08.500" style="s2">into their own discussions about ally</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.310" end="00:38:11.020" style="s2">shape so we&#39;ve all heard about ally ship</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.500" end="00:38:15.970" style="s2">and probably many of us in this room</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.020" end="00:38:17.740" style="s2">have a sort of a conflict within</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.970" end="00:38:21.970" style="s2">ourselves when we hear that term I know</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.740" end="00:38:24.280" style="s2">that I certainly did I regard myself as</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.970" end="00:38:26.470" style="s2">an ally of people who have been</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.280" end="00:38:28.540" style="s2">historically oppressed it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.470" end="00:38:30.220" style="s2">that that&#39;s the right thing to be to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.540" end="00:38:32.620" style="s2">understand that historical oppression</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.220" end="00:38:35.860" style="s2">has an implication in the present and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.620" end="00:38:38.680" style="s2">that it it carries obligations on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.860" end="00:38:40.360" style="s2">other hand in order to be an ally within</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.680" end="00:38:42.670" style="s2">the movement one has to sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.360" end="00:38:44.980" style="s2">certain things that I was never going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.670" end="00:38:46.140" style="s2">sign up for and probably most of you</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.980" end="00:38:50.380" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t either</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.140" end="00:38:53.160" style="s2">so what are those things well Ally is</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.380" end="00:38:56.530" style="s2">one of these terms that&#39;s been redefined</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.160" end="00:38:59.860" style="s2">Ally if we speak in common parlance is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.530" end="00:39:02.080" style="s2">term that connotes a symmetrical peer</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.860" end="00:39:03.880" style="s2">relationship to nations Ally with each</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.080" end="00:39:05.740" style="s2">other that doesn&#39;t put one in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.880" end="00:39:08.380" style="s2">the other it means that they&#39;re teaming</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.740" end="00:39:10.060" style="s2">up for some sort of a common goal that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.380" end="00:39:13.030" style="s2">not how it is inside this movement</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.060" end="00:39:15.400" style="s2">inside the movement Ally ship is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.030" end="00:39:18.100" style="s2">definitely a subordinate relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.400" end="00:39:21.120" style="s2">I&#39;m told that many of the students who</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.100" end="00:39:23.560" style="s2">came to protests me at my classroom I</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.120" end="00:39:25.330" style="s2">knew none of these students by the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.560" end="00:39:28.180" style="s2">all of the students who showed up were</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.330" end="00:39:30.520" style="s2">brand new to me many of them apparently</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.180" end="00:39:32.980" style="s2">showed up not knowing why they were</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.520" end="00:39:34.540" style="s2">there to protest they were told it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.980" end="00:39:35.740" style="s2">their obligation to the movement and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.540" end="00:39:37.360" style="s2">that they should show up and they were</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.740" end="00:39:38.920" style="s2">given a piece of paper that described</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.360" end="00:39:40.510" style="s2">things they were supposed to say and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.920" end="00:39:42.940" style="s2">will say many of them I think were</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.510" end="00:39:45.010" style="s2">confounded by actually talking to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.940" end="00:39:48.100" style="s2">because I wasn&#39;t the cartoon that they</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.010" end="00:39:49.480" style="s2">had been told I was I&#39;m an anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.100" end="00:39:51.190" style="s2">and they thought they were confronting a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.480" end="00:39:53.950" style="s2">racist and that was initially confusing</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.190" end="00:39:55.720" style="s2">to them and when they discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.950" end="00:39:58.150" style="s2">little paradox what happened is they</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.720" end="00:40:00.850" style="s2">went into a very automatic mode rather</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.150" end="00:40:01.930" style="s2">than come back and tell whoever had</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.850" end="00:40:03.400" style="s2">instructed them to show</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.930" end="00:40:04.690" style="s2">my class hey I think he got something</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.400" end="00:40:07.780" style="s2">wrong because that guy didn&#39;t sound like</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.690" end="00:40:09.099" style="s2">you told us he was gonna sound they went</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.780" end="00:40:10.869" style="s2">into some mode where they started</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.099" end="00:40:12.579" style="s2">chanting and they started reading from</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.869" end="00:40:14.020" style="s2">this piece of paper rather than have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.579" end="00:40:17.710" style="s2">confront was that what was actually in</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.020" end="00:40:19.329" style="s2">front of them so it is the subordinate</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.710" end="00:40:22.109" style="s2">relationship and in fact it gets even</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.329" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">worse than subordinate there is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.109" end="00:40:28.300" style="s2">discussion I ran into online in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:32.290" style="s2">there was a very explicit equivalency</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.300" end="00:40:35.380" style="s2">made between a lie ship and being an</p>

<p begin="00:40:35.380" end="00:40:39.819" style="s2">the job of the social justice movement</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.119" end="00:40:41.160" style="s2">was breaking the rules and breaking the</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.160" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">committed to the values that the</p>

<p begin="00:41:12.040" end="00:41:16.180" style="s2">these are people who are really</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.480" end="00:41:18.099" style="s2">opportunists they don&#39;t need to sign up</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.180" end="00:41:19.960" style="s2">for this stuff but they get ahead by</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.099" end="00:41:22.059" style="s2">doing so and some of them are perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.960" end="00:41:24.609" style="s2">cynical some of them may be self-deluded</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.059" end="00:41:26.790" style="s2">but there are many different types at</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.609" end="00:41:28.450" style="s2">Evergreen we had administrators</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.790" end="00:41:31.410" style="s2">administrators who find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.450" end="00:41:34.390" style="s2">getting ahead by signing up for this</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.410" end="00:41:37.000" style="s2">muscular movement within the faculty and</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.390" end="00:41:38.950" style="s2">the students to challenge them might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.000" end="00:41:42.609" style="s2">costly to one&#39;s career but to simply</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.950" end="00:41:44.380" style="s2">sign up and advance their cause leaves</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.609" end="00:41:47.140" style="s2">you as an administrator much less likely</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.380" end="00:41:49.240" style="s2">to be targeted so there&#39;s a duality to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.140" end="00:41:51.160" style="s2">the role because on the one hand the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.240" end="00:41:55.690" style="s2">social justice movement structures</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.160" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">itself so that administrators will make</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.690" end="00:42:01.049" style="s2">this choice and the administrators do so</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">because many administrators are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.049" end="00:42:06.900" style="s2">cynical self promoting people and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:10.780" style="s2">it&#39;s affect it&#39;s effectively a</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.900" end="00:42:15.290" style="s2">partnership between two cynical entities</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.780" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">you&#39;ll also find this amongst podcasters</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.290" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">and and journalists so these people by</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">writing stories that flatter this</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:28.460" style="s2">viewpoint get a ready-made readership or</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:30.710" style="s2">listenership and if your well being as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.460" end="00:42:32.150" style="s2">podcaster or a journalist comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.710" end="00:42:34.520" style="s2">fact that you&#39;ve got a lot of eyes on</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.150" end="00:42:37.190" style="s2">your pieces then standing out as</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.520" end="00:42:38.780" style="s2">somebody who is who is advancing this</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.190" end="00:42:43.240" style="s2">particular cause is a way to get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.780" end="00:42:46.099" style="s2">and so they do it and professors too</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.240" end="00:42:49.570" style="s2">especially at Evergreen there were a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.099" end="00:42:52.420" style="s2">number of professors who took a lead in</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.570" end="00:42:58.640" style="s2">defending the strategic equity proposal</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.420" end="00:43:00.290" style="s2">who were initially its target so they</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.640" end="00:43:02.119" style="s2">were initially its target and then they</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.290" end="00:43:04.609" style="s2">switched and they became aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.119" end="00:43:06.380" style="s2">advocates and then they became allies to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.609" end="00:43:09.050" style="s2">this movement which I think these</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.380" end="00:43:11.329" style="s2">professors had identified as likely to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.050" end="00:43:15.170" style="s2">win and if this movement wins and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.329" end="00:43:18.740" style="s2">advances its professors into powerful</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.170" end="00:43:21.380" style="s2">roles on hiring committees and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.740" end="00:43:23.599" style="s2">advances its proposals through the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.380" end="00:43:25.339" style="s2">faculty governance structure then those</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.599" end="00:43:28.250" style="s2">people who have been strong advocates</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.339" end="00:43:30.440" style="s2">during the process of ascent are likely</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.440" end="00:43:36.859" style="s2">you&#39;re challenged you&#39;re liable to fall</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:39.589" style="s2">by the wayside okay so that gives you</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.859" end="00:43:41.000" style="s2">some sense of who the players are now I</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.589" end="00:43:43.369" style="s2">want to talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.000" end="00:43:47.890" style="s2">system that they bring along with them I</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.369" end="00:43:50.540" style="s2">call it a hermetically sealed system and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.890" end="00:43:52.220" style="s2">you will probably those of you who have</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.540" end="00:43:54.740" style="s2">faced these arguments will have</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.220" end="00:43:56.900" style="s2">encountered the frustration of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.740" end="00:44:00.260" style="s2">challenge them logically and not being</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.900" end="00:44:01.700" style="s2">able to make any headway at all and what</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.260" end="00:44:03.740" style="s2">I submit to you is that the reason she</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.700" end="00:44:06.230" style="s2">can&#39;t make headway is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.740" end="00:44:08.060" style="s2">essentially a flowchart in which every</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.230" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">single argument you could conceivably</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.060" end="00:44:13.160" style="s2">make has been mapped and if you make a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:14.510" style="s2">new argument then the closest thing on</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.160" end="00:44:16.069" style="s2">the map will be assumed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.510" end="00:44:17.660" style="s2">argument that you&#39;ve made and you will</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.069" end="00:44:20.839" style="s2">be shunted to the proper response to</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.660" end="00:44:23.569" style="s2">shut it down right there is no defeating</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.839" end="00:44:25.670" style="s2">this thing and it&#39;s composed of several</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.569" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">different kinds of components so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.670" end="00:44:31.310" style="s2">first one is bad assumption</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.010" end="00:44:32.870" style="s2">there are bad assumptions that if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.310" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">don&#39;t look at them to carefully might</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.870" end="00:44:35.840" style="s2">sound like they have some truth in them</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:37.340" style="s2">but if you scrutinize them you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.840" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">discover they don&#39;t but once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.340" end="00:44:44.150" style="s2">accepted them what they cause you to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:48.320" style="s2">conclude is some radically bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.150" end="00:44:51.640" style="s2">upside-down universe so here are some</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.320" end="00:44:55.820" style="s2">examples lived experience Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.640" end="00:44:57.350" style="s2">population analysis right so population</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.820" end="00:44:59.390" style="s2">level analysis is what we would</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.350" end="00:45:01.790" style="s2">typically do in a scientific study we</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.390" end="00:45:04.280" style="s2">would look at some sort of pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.790" end="00:45:08.120" style="s2">we&#39;d say is this pattern the result of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.280" end="00:45:11.330" style="s2">some cause like for example bias that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.120" end="00:45:12.620" style="s2">exists inside the system well if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.330" end="00:45:14.960" style="s2">take the assumption that lived</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.620" end="00:45:18.020" style="s2">experience is actually the only valid</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.960" end="00:45:20.150" style="s2">thing and that population level analysis</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.020" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">is somehow incapable of recovering what</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.150" end="00:45:25.310" style="s2">it is that takes place in people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:27.020" style="s2">well then you will discover that all</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.310" end="00:45:28.970" style="s2">sorts of people have stories to tell</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.020" end="00:45:31.340" style="s2">about oppression that they&#39;ve faced</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.970" end="00:45:33.800" style="s2">which might well not stand up if it were</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.340" end="00:45:36.860" style="s2">scrutinized in some sort of rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.800" end="00:45:40.220" style="s2">dispassionate way so to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.860" end="00:45:43.640" style="s2">trivial example you know if let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.220" end="00:45:45.860" style="s2">woman is walking down the street and all</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.640" end="00:45:47.600" style="s2">right let&#39;s make this person let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.860" end="00:45:49.220" style="s2">woman is walking down the street and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.600" end="00:45:51.650" style="s2">am walking down the street in the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.220" end="00:45:54.590" style="s2">direction and I look at her in a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.650" end="00:45:57.320" style="s2">that she finds uncomfortable well she</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.590" end="00:46:00.710" style="s2">may have the sense that I have had some</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.320" end="00:46:03.110" style="s2">ill intent now if she doesn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.710" end="00:46:05.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve looked at the guy who followed her</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.110" end="00:46:08.210" style="s2">in exactly the same way she is incapable</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.570" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">of calibrating her experience it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.210" end="00:46:12.830" style="s2">failing of hers it&#39;s just a failing of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:15.470" style="s2">the anecdote she&#39;s had one experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.830" end="00:46:17.990" style="s2">but she has no idea maybe I&#39;m a guy who</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.470" end="00:46:19.370" style="s2">gives people awkward looks right maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.990" end="00:46:21.200" style="s2">it has nothing to do with her being</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.370" end="00:46:22.760" style="s2">female at all but she&#39;s not in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.200" end="00:46:25.660" style="s2">position to know that because she&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.760" end="00:46:27.590" style="s2">one experience so this is why in fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.660" end="00:46:29.330" style="s2">scientific analysis looks the way it</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.590" end="00:46:31.100" style="s2">does because we are well aware that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.330" end="00:46:32.870" style="s2">things can look very much like something</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.100" end="00:46:34.790" style="s2">but when you analyze at a population</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.870" end="00:46:37.700" style="s2">level you may discover that the cause is</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.790" end="00:46:39.980" style="s2">something very different also I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.700" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">point out that if you really do believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.980" end="00:46:43.549" style="s2">as I do that there</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:44.779" style="s2">our structural biases in our system that</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.549" end="00:46:47.269" style="s2">are important and have major</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.779" end="00:46:50.359" style="s2">consequences the way to establish that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.269" end="00:46:51.980" style="s2">is with a a dispassionate analysis at</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.359" end="00:46:54.769" style="s2">the level of populations where you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.980" end="00:46:58.009" style="s2">see that there is a real consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.769" end="00:46:59.180" style="s2">some sort of process so signing up for</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.009" end="00:47:02.630" style="s2">this bad assumption that lived</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.819" end="00:47:08.450" style="s2">imagine that it is very empowering if</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.769" end="00:47:09.769" style="s2">you find yourself in a group that is</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.489" end="00:53:03.269" style="s2">and we borrow discomfort from the</p>

<p begin="00:54:37.709" end="00:54:42.119" style="s2">because I have many friends left at</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.049" end="00:54:44.969" style="s2">Evergreen on the faculty amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.119" end="00:54:46.650" style="s2">students and on the staff I hear things</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.969" end="00:54:49.709" style="s2">about what&#39;s taking place on the campus</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.650" end="00:54:52.559" style="s2">there&#39;s currently a conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.709" end="00:54:54.599" style="s2">that involves me and why I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.559" end="00:54:56.519" style="s2">successful at surviving their challenge</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.599" end="00:54:58.199" style="s2">and I know it&#39;s false</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.519" end="00:55:01.349" style="s2">I can&#39;t necessarily convince anybody</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.199" end="00:55:02.789" style="s2">else of this but the very fact that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.349" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">in a position to say well actually that</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.789" end="00:55:05.969" style="s2">conspiracy didn&#39;t happen and I&#39;m one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:08.069" style="s2">very few people who can say for sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.969" end="00:55:09.479" style="s2">that that&#39;s the case it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.069" end="00:55:11.819" style="s2">powerful position to be and nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.479" end="00:55:14.159" style="s2">to hear that conspiracy theory bubbling</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.819" end="00:55:16.890" style="s2">through the campus as an explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.159" end="00:55:19.319" style="s2">why they found themselves so embarrass</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.890" end="00:55:23.579" style="s2">in the case of their protest against me</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.319" end="00:55:25.499" style="s2">is fascinating so their assumption is if</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.579" end="00:55:29.400" style="s2">you make gains against them you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.499" end="00:55:34.189" style="s2">engaged in some kind of conspiracy okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.400" end="00:55:36.700" style="s2">now these bad assumptions result in</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.189" end="00:55:38.589" style="s2">conclusions that are themselves false</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.700" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">these conclusions are where the work</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.589" end="00:55:44.589" style="s2">actually happens so the conclusions are</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:45.940" style="s2">what allows them to wield power let me</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.589" end="00:55:48.849" style="s2">give you some examples of some bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.940" end="00:55:51.430" style="s2">conclusions one is if you oppose an</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.849" end="00:55:54.369" style="s2">equity proposal then you are against</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.430" end="00:55:56.200" style="s2">equity now this was a major trap at</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.369" end="00:55:58.030" style="s2">Evergreen because there was a really bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.200" end="00:55:59.740" style="s2">equity proposal in motion and if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.030" end="00:56:01.780" style="s2">cared about the college you had to stand</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.740" end="00:56:03.550" style="s2">up and say so and if you said so then it</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.780" end="00:56:07.000" style="s2">was evidence of some major defect in</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.550" end="00:56:08.710" style="s2">your character another bad conclusion is</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.000" end="00:56:12.810" style="s2">that if you defend yourself against</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.710" end="00:56:16.660" style="s2">accusations of racism you are evidencing</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.810" end="00:56:19.089" style="s2">racism now this is a very clever little</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.660" end="00:56:20.950" style="s2">trap which makes it impossible to know</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.089" end="00:56:22.390" style="s2">how to react and the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.950" end="00:56:25.960" style="s2">in the face of such a thing if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.390" end="00:56:31.000" style="s2">simply trying to stay alive is keep your</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.960" end="00:56:35.400" style="s2">thoughts to yourself and the final one</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.000" end="00:56:37.960" style="s2">is that if you defend yourself against</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.400" end="00:56:41.349" style="s2">accusations of white supremacy then</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.960" end="00:56:46.960" style="s2">actually you are hoping to preserve your</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.349" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">own privilege all right at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:50.890" style="s2">this talk what I what I&#39;d hope to do was</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:53.800" style="s2">to talk about two more synthetic ideas</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.890" end="00:56:56.500" style="s2">about where we are what it means and</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.800" end="00:56:58.329" style="s2">what we might do about it the first one</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.500" end="00:57:01.510" style="s2">is something I call cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.329" end="00:57:04.569" style="s2">insecurity and it is the idea that many</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.510" end="00:57:07.630" style="s2">people find themselves unable to stand</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.569" end="00:57:10.900" style="s2">up and say what needs to be said because</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.630" end="00:57:15.790" style="s2">of certain ways that society is</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.900" end="00:57:19.900" style="s2">presently structured so it is true that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.790" end="00:57:22.540" style="s2">a tenured professor at a State College</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.900" end="00:57:25.150" style="s2">is in a pretty secure position relative</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.540" end="00:57:27.099" style="s2">to other places in society that might</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.150" end="00:57:30.940" style="s2">one might find themselves on the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.099" end="00:57:32.589" style="s2">hand it is also true that a small number</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.940" end="00:57:34.300" style="s2">of things going wrong in one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.589" end="00:57:36.730" style="s2">relationship with one&#39;s employer</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.300" end="00:57:39.400" style="s2">suddenly puts a great many things in</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.730" end="00:57:40.780" style="s2">jeopardy simultaneously so I knew this</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.400" end="00:57:43.180" style="s2">to be the case and I was making this</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.780" end="00:57:45.310" style="s2">argument long before what happened at</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.180" end="00:57:46.869" style="s2">Evergreen had occurred I was making it</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.310" end="00:57:49.450" style="s2">as an abstraction but now I&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.869" end="00:57:49.980" style="s2">through this episode and I&#39;ve felt I</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.450" end="00:57:54.330" style="s2">felt</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.980" end="00:57:57.960" style="s2">personally so what goes wrong if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.330" end="00:58:00.660" style="s2">have a problem with your employer well</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.960" end="00:58:02.940" style="s2">it jeopardizes your mortgage it</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.660" end="00:58:05.580" style="s2">jeopardizes your retirement it</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.940" end="00:58:07.830" style="s2">jeopardizes your health care it</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.580" end="00:58:10.290" style="s2">jeopardizes your ability to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.830" end="00:58:12.800" style="s2">live in the same place that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.290" end="00:58:16.320" style="s2">things to go wrong simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.800" end="00:58:19.710" style="s2">the implication of this is that many</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.320" end="00:58:22.859" style="s2">people who appear to be fairly secure in</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.710" end="00:58:26.490" style="s2">their place in society actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.859" end="00:58:30.540" style="s2">reasonable fear of things going suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.490" end="00:58:32.609" style="s2">wrong and having a spectacular loss of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.540" end="00:58:35.730" style="s2">security and that that keeps people in</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.609" end="00:58:38.460" style="s2">line who would otherwise stand up now my</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.730" end="00:58:41.340" style="s2">contention is that this insecurity has</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.460" end="00:58:45.510" style="s2">in part perhaps unconsciously been</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.340" end="00:58:48.359" style="s2">cultivated by a political apparatus that</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.510" end="00:58:52.290" style="s2">would prefer that we do not challenge it</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.359" end="00:58:54.630" style="s2">and so in effect those things that keep</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.290" end="00:58:56.100" style="s2">people relatively compliant because</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.630" end="00:58:59.010" style="s2">they&#39;re afraid of what happens if they</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.100" end="00:59:00.900" style="s2">stand up those things have advanced and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.010" end="00:59:02.940" style="s2">I think what has happened is that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.900" end="00:59:05.220" style="s2">social justice movement has tapped into</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.940" end="00:59:07.230" style="s2">that very same mechanism so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.220" end="00:59:09.900" style="s2">that the social justice movement can</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.230" end="00:59:13.740" style="s2">challenge a professor and cause them to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.900" end="00:59:15.840" style="s2">have to leave the university is a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.740" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">frightening fact for lots of people and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.840" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">so what I experienced on the inside of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:23.850" style="s2">Evergreen was tremendous support from</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:26.820" style="s2">people who refused to speak and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.850" end="00:59:28.350" style="s2">mentioned this many times I I emailed my</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.820" end="00:59:30.990" style="s2">colleagues about it and I said you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.350" end="00:59:32.520" style="s2">we have a culture of fear on this campus</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.990" end="00:59:34.109" style="s2">and I can&#39;t tell you how many people</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.520" end="00:59:35.850" style="s2">have approached me privately and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.109" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">told me they&#39;re supportive of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.850" end="00:59:38.820" style="s2">saying and they hope I&#39;ll keep saying it</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:40.020" style="s2">but they&#39;re not going to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.820" end="00:59:41.700" style="s2">themselves because they&#39;re afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.020" end="00:59:43.619" style="s2">what will happen I can&#39;t even say that</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.700" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong I mean clearly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.619" end="00:59:48.810" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:50.970" style="s2">so that culture of fear results in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.810" end="00:59:52.980" style="s2">number of things a it results in</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.970" end="00:59:54.990" style="s2">arguments that need to be made not being</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.980" end="00:59:57.810" style="s2">made it results in those who are making</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.990" end="01:00:00.750" style="s2">arguments that need to be made being</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.810" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">isolated but maybe most disastrously it</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.750" end="01:00:04.230" style="s2">results in a completely false impression</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:07.290" style="s2">to the outside world of</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.230" end="01:00:10.440" style="s2">where the the preponderance of opinion</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.290" end="01:00:12.930" style="s2">is it looks if you look at Evergreen and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.440" end="01:00:16.560" style="s2">you look at who says what it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.930" end="01:00:18.570" style="s2">I was one of very few voices that</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.560" end="01:00:19.950" style="s2">disagreed with this equity proposal</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.570" end="01:00:22.230" style="s2">which suggests that maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.950" end="01:00:24.000" style="s2">something off about me on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.230" end="01:00:25.830" style="s2">if you were capable of listening into</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.000" end="01:00:27.359" style="s2">the private conversations as well as the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.830" end="01:00:29.010" style="s2">public conversations you would</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.359" end="01:00:30.780" style="s2">understand that evergreen was fiercely</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.010" end="01:00:33.960" style="s2">divided over the proposals that were</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.780" end="01:00:36.930" style="s2">advancing so it colors the narrative in</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.960" end="01:00:39.570" style="s2">a very in a very dangerous way and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.930" end="01:00:41.970" style="s2">results in what I would call an epidemic</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.570" end="01:00:44.070" style="s2">of cowardice so we have an epidemic of</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.970" end="01:00:46.109" style="s2">cowardice in the university system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.070" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">a mirror for the epidemic of cowardice</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.109" end="01:00:53.220" style="s2">that we have in our political system as</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.720" end="01:00:56.430" style="s2">well and the important take-home lesson</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.220" end="01:01:00.300" style="s2">is that if you want to win this game if</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.430" end="01:01:01.950" style="s2">you want the values that probably speak</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.300" end="01:01:04.590" style="s2">for all of us the desire to see</p>

<p begin="01:01:12.840" end="01:01:18.390" style="s2">way to get there is to cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.660" end="01:01:20.670" style="s2">security for those who stand up you want</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.390" end="01:01:22.800" style="s2">people who stand up they&#39;re going to pay</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.670" end="01:01:24.810" style="s2">a price because those who are trying to</p>

<p begin="01:01:49.260" end="01:01:54.330" style="s2">very odd circumstance where although</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.869" end="01:01:56.520" style="s2">I&#39;ve been on the left for my whole life</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.330" end="01:01:58.340" style="s2">I now find that many of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.520" end="01:02:00.930" style="s2">are most interested in talking to me are</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.340" end="01:02:02.310" style="s2">somewhere over on the right and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.930" end="01:02:04.350" style="s2">done a lot of thinking about what this</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.310" end="01:02:07.650" style="s2">means and what its implications are for</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.350" end="01:02:09.060" style="s2">us and I want to give you a brief model</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.650" end="01:02:12.210" style="s2">that I think suggests something about</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.060" end="01:02:13.800" style="s2">where we should be headed many of you</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.210" end="01:02:15.430" style="s2">have probably taken what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.800" end="01:02:17.619" style="s2">political compass test</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.430" end="01:02:19.750" style="s2">I want to be a little bit cautious about</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.619" end="01:02:22.900" style="s2">this I cannot vouch for the political</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.750" end="01:02:25.839" style="s2">compass test ability to place you on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.900" end="01:02:29.109" style="s2">map but what I do want to defend is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.839" end="01:02:31.720" style="s2">two axis model that it argues for when</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.109" end="01:02:34.660" style="s2">looking at political questions so if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.720" end="01:02:38.440" style="s2">think in your mind of an x-axis and a</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.660" end="01:02:40.690" style="s2">y-axis on the x axis are left and right</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.440" end="01:02:44.380" style="s2">those are political left and right on</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.690" end="01:02:46.599" style="s2">the y axis our authoritarians on the top</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.380" end="01:02:48.460" style="s2">and libertarians on the bottom so</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.599" end="01:02:50.109" style="s2">libertarian here does not mean economic</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.460" end="01:02:52.270" style="s2">libertarian it means people who favor</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.109" end="01:02:55.720" style="s2">Liberty as perhaps the highest human</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.270" end="01:02:58.270" style="s2">value now the reason I raised this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.720" end="01:03:00.309" style="s2">because I&#39;m ever more convinced that</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.270" end="01:03:03.130" style="s2">left and right are not particularly</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.309" end="01:03:05.220" style="s2">meaningful axes at this moment in</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.130" end="01:03:08.770" style="s2">history and there&#39;s a reason for that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.220" end="01:03:12.369" style="s2">find that I have very easy comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.770" end="01:03:14.619" style="s2">conversations with libertarians on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.369" end="01:03:18.339" style="s2">right in the bottom right hand quadrant</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.619" end="01:03:20.500" style="s2">of that map I am far over in the bottom</p>

<p begin="01:03:27.490" end="01:03:32.230" style="s2">have almost complete overlap in our</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.140" end="01:03:34.329" style="s2">values if you if I as a left libertarian</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.230" end="01:03:38.410" style="s2">ask a right libertarian how they feel</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.329" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">about a fair system they favor it just</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.410" end="01:03:41.049" style="s2">as I do and the reason that they favor</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:43.510" style="s2">it is quite clear</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.049" end="01:03:46.780" style="s2">the reason they favor it is because a</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.510" end="01:03:49.270" style="s2">fair system works better the more people</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.780" end="01:03:51.760" style="s2">who have access to the market the more</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.270" end="01:03:53.559" style="s2">people who are capable of innovating and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.760" end="01:03:55.660" style="s2">delivering things to the market the</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.559" end="01:03:58.089" style="s2">better the market discovers new things</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.660" end="01:04:00.970" style="s2">that are valuable so a crew right</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.089" end="01:04:02.920" style="s2">libertarian favors a fair system and a</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.970" end="01:04:06.359" style="s2">true left libertarian favors a fair</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.920" end="01:04:09.220" style="s2">system where we differ is over policy</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.359" end="01:04:11.920" style="s2">those on the left are traditionally a</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.220" end="01:04:13.900" style="s2">bit over enthusiastic about meddling</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.920" end="01:04:16.569" style="s2">with a system in order to make it better</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.900" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">and they tend not to appreciate the full</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.569" end="01:04:19.900" style="s2">significance of the unintended</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:22.809" style="s2">consequences that tend to come along</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.900" end="01:04:25.720" style="s2">with policy those on the right tend to</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.809" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">be a bit overly cautious about tinkering</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.720" end="01:04:29.170" style="s2">and so they will shoot down a proposal</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.760" end="01:04:31.360" style="s2">that might in fact be</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.170" end="01:04:33.460" style="s2">beneficial because they fear the</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.360" end="01:04:36.100" style="s2">unintended consequences perhaps more</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.460" end="01:04:38.620" style="s2">than they need to but in an era where</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.100" end="01:04:40.810" style="s2">nobody on left or right knows what</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.620" end="01:04:42.510" style="s2">policies we should be advocating there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.810" end="01:04:45.730" style="s2">very little reason for these two</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.510" end="01:04:47.860" style="s2">quadrants to disagree we agree on what a</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.730" end="01:04:50.320" style="s2">good society would look like we may not</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.860" end="01:04:51.970" style="s2">agree on how fair society is presently</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.320" end="01:04:54.250" style="s2">and we may not agree on the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.970" end="01:04:58.270" style="s2">tinkering but we agree that fairness is</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.250" end="01:05:01.260" style="s2">a good thing and the really important</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.270" end="01:05:05.710" style="s2">point is that we also agree that</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.260" end="01:05:08.050" style="s2">authoritarianism is a great danger we</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.710" end="01:05:09.970" style="s2">should be united those of us on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.050" end="01:05:12.220" style="s2">libertarian left and the libertarian</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.970" end="01:05:15.940" style="s2">right should be united against</p>

<p begin="01:05:18.280" end="01:05:22.510" style="s2">advantage if we take it seriously and</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.320" end="01:05:24.610" style="s2">the reason that it does is that the</p>
