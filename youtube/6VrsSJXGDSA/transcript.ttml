<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">gonna start off</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:02.070" style="s2">he has three sections to his</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">presentation so at the end of each</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.070" end="00:01:06.900" style="s2">section if you have questions on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">section now you can ask them then if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">have questions just about cults in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:13.799" style="s2">general or the topic in general then if</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:15.479" style="s2">you could queue them up in the event</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.799" end="00:01:17.189" style="s2">text like we normally do for these</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.479" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">things and again if you want me to read</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.189" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">out your question please let me know</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.490" end="00:01:26.109" style="s2">that you you want me to read it out so</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:29.109" style="s2">with that I will turn it over to Nick</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.109" end="00:01:29.109" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.080" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">I will briefly add I was asked to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">this as opposed to wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">indoctrinate everybody into my specific</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">take on cults so I expect some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:49.440" style="s2">disagreement here but hopefully it is it</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:53.670" style="s2">is nonetheless useful the layout that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.440" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">have is initially going over my personal</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">history and the cultic groups that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">have participated in from there I want</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:07.080" style="s2">to do a brief a brief kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">exploration of the etymology of the word</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.080" end="00:02:12.360" style="s2">cult and it&#39;s kind of used through time</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">and how that&#39;s changed quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.360" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">dramatically particularly in in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">century I then I&#39;m going to add pose</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:26.490" style="s2">what I&#39;ve kind of my own sense making</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">and how I&#39;ve gone about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.490" end="00:02:30.870" style="s2">integrating these experiences and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:34.890" style="s2">little bit of an alternative framing</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.870" end="00:02:40.459" style="s2">around the concept of a cult and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.890" end="00:02:40.459" style="s2">the final section is going over</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.600" end="00:02:50.530" style="s2">you know what the necessary features are</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:53.290" style="s2">in the systems we we normally view as as</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.530" end="00:02:55.570" style="s2">cultic and then how the there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.290" end="00:02:59.770" style="s2">good and bad versions of these things</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.570" end="00:03:03.490" style="s2">and how things can kind of end up on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.770" end="00:03:07.450" style="s2">slippery slope of moving into these</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.490" end="00:03:09.520" style="s2">unhealthier forms and that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.450" end="00:03:13.870" style="s2">where where hopefully there will be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.520" end="00:03:15.790" style="s2">most actual use as far as like ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.870" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">develop and a written are and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.790" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">of stuff are</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.250" end="00:03:25.810" style="s2">yeah so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:31.900" style="s2">launch right into it I&#39;ve been in rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.810" end="00:03:35.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve interacted with four cults one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.900" end="00:03:38.830" style="s2">which I joined consciously it advertised</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.860" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">itself as a cult and that was the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.830" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">recent one I had experienced</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.160" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">so yeah my very first experience with</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.710" end="00:03:55.410" style="s2">dealing with kind of overtly or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:59.930" style="s2">classically cultic systems was when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.410" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">was about 19 my friend and I were quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.930" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">disillusioned with the status quo life</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:08.730" style="s2">we were living of working at Starbucks</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:11.580" style="s2">and trying to have our pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.730" end="00:04:15.690" style="s2">spirituality developing on the side and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.580" end="00:04:18.470" style="s2">so we made a rather radical decision to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.690" end="00:04:22.410" style="s2">take up the woofing program that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.470" end="00:04:25.920" style="s2">worldwide opportunities on organic farms</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.410" end="00:04:29.790" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a Craigslist ad type set</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.920" end="00:04:33.270" style="s2">up of organic farms that are able to put</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.790" end="00:04:36.480" style="s2">up ads or classifieds for opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.270" end="00:04:40.410" style="s2">to work with them any sort of trade it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.480" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">could be just living and food you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.410" end="00:04:45.930" style="s2">room and board they could pay you right</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:48.740" style="s2">it&#39;s all there and then they give a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.930" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">description of of their specific farm</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.740" end="00:04:55.460" style="s2">and a lot of this was in the effort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:59.300" style="s2">trying to learn from farming or</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.460" end="00:05:05.820" style="s2">permaculture skills so that we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.300" end="00:05:07.830" style="s2">basically create our own cult and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.820" end="00:05:09.570" style="s2">specific ad we ended up choosing had</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.830" end="00:05:12.450" style="s2">advertised itself as a type of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.570" end="00:05:16.590" style="s2">meditation center and retreat with an</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.450" end="00:05:19.500" style="s2">emphasis on organic farming it was on</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.590" end="00:05:23.310" style="s2">the Big Island of Hawaii out in an area</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.500" end="00:05:26.660" style="s2">called or the town is called Pahoa and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.310" end="00:05:26.660" style="s2">the area is called Puna</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.240" end="00:05:33.240" style="s2">it is a pretty wild place it&#39;s the area</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:36.539" style="s2">that tourists go to see the active</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.240" end="00:05:39.030" style="s2">volcano flow out there and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.539" end="00:05:42.539" style="s2">areas under constant threat of being</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.030" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">wiped out by the volcano as recent as</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.539" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">the 80s it took out a huge town and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:51.810" style="s2">wiped out the highway out there and as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">side effect no insurance companies will</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:56.520" style="s2">will protect any of the land or</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">buildings out there and none of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.520" end="00:06:01.470" style="s2">utility companies will put out new lines</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">or anything so there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.470" end="00:06:06.169" style="s2">actual electricity all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:11.430" style="s2">infrastructure was built before the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.169" end="00:06:14.580" style="s2">and most of people&#39;s water functions off</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.430" end="00:06:17.750" style="s2">of water catchment that area is</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.580" end="00:06:21.720" style="s2">considered the wettest area in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.750" end="00:06:24.449" style="s2">there&#39;s a specific valley in that area</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.720" end="00:06:26.569" style="s2">that gets over 600 inches of rainfall a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.449" end="00:06:26.569" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.370" end="00:06:37.000" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s it it it&#39;s an area of of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.900" end="00:06:39.190" style="s2">the u.s. that attracts people that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.000" end="00:06:41.650" style="s2">very much trying to live under the radar</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.190" end="00:06:45.100" style="s2">for one reason or another whether that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.650" end="00:06:48.729" style="s2">be they&#39;re very bizarre efforts to live</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.100" end="00:06:53.500" style="s2">an alternative life or their effort to</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.729" end="00:06:55.690" style="s2">dodge some legal issues that they had so</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.500" end="00:06:57.669" style="s2">many false identities over there many</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.690" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">people with some very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.669" end="00:07:03.460" style="s2">histories and then many people doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:08.700" style="s2">some some very bizarre experimental</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.460" end="00:07:12.310" style="s2">cultural projects so when we showed up</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.700" end="00:07:15.190" style="s2">you know we had our backpacks we had no</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.310" end="00:07:17.800" style="s2">car transportation we were pretty deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.190" end="00:07:21.900" style="s2">not even very much you know very little</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.800" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">money so we were very dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.900" end="00:07:27.699" style="s2">scenario that we were entering to just</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:30.490" style="s2">meet our daily needs needs of food and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.699" end="00:07:34.030" style="s2">lodging and it became immediately</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.490" end="00:07:36.010" style="s2">apparent on the car ride to the property</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.030" end="00:07:37.900" style="s2">that we were going to be staying at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.010" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">we were not dealing with just this kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.900" end="00:07:44.139" style="s2">of open-ended Meditation Center but</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:46.090" style="s2">rather a very specific form of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.139" end="00:07:48.460" style="s2">meditation center and that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.090" end="00:07:51.940" style="s2">communicated by the constant whispering</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.460" end="00:07:54.729" style="s2">we heard of a repeating mantra under the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.940" end="00:07:57.099" style="s2">car full of people&#39;s breath that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.729" end="00:08:01.830" style="s2">taking us there and they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.099" end="00:08:01.830" style="s2">reciting the Harry Krishna mantra</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.770" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">this was a Harry Krishna cult and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.460" end="00:08:11.409" style="s2">Harry Krishna&#39;s as a larger group have</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:17.349" style="s2">been identified as at least being cultic</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.409" end="00:08:21.159" style="s2">if not overtly a cult the specific setup</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.349" end="00:08:23.560" style="s2">that we were participating in most would</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.079" end="00:09:15.160" style="s2">mission of just kind of randomly heading</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.149" end="00:09:19.899" style="s2">out to find some people that were doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.160" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">something different than the norm and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.899" end="00:09:25.110" style="s2">ended up becoming very close with them</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.639" end="00:09:36.389" style="s2">heard lots of stories basically that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.470" end="00:09:39.870" style="s2">when new people showed up they would put</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.389" end="00:09:42.269" style="s2">on a very nice welcoming face and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.870" end="00:09:45.660" style="s2">when people you know we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.269" end="00:09:48.180" style="s2">committed or or new people had given up</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.660" end="00:09:50.910" style="s2">and left they would take on a much more</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.880" end="00:10:02.550" style="s2">there and everything also on Saturdays</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.209" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">we were taken to a connecting farms set</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:08.550" style="s2">up and this was kind of a the actual hub</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:12.089" style="s2">of the Harry Krishna&#39;s within that area</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.550" end="00:10:15.690" style="s2">I was a very large group they owned tens</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.089" end="00:10:19.350" style="s2">of thousands of acres they ran all</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.690" end="00:10:22.529" style="s2">different types of farms you know there</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.350" end="00:10:24.569" style="s2">was probably upwards of five to six</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.529" end="00:10:26.759" style="s2">hundred members of this particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.569" end="00:10:29.160" style="s2">branch and then they all had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.759" end="00:10:31.380" style="s2">subdivisions where they would have they</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.160" end="00:10:34.170" style="s2">would build around a specific person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.380" end="00:10:37.500" style="s2">house or or whatever but the main guy</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.170" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">running the whole thing his title or</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.500" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">name which is clearly not his real name</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:48.930" style="s2">was Garuda and on Saturdays they&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:51.930" style="s2">a big party where they would do the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.930" end="00:10:57.470" style="s2">chanting and dance that is very common</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.930" end="00:10:57.470" style="s2">to the Krishna branch of Hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.440" end="00:11:04.230" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a form of devotional</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.080" end="00:11:07.230" style="s2">dance where they would all recite the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.230" end="00:11:09.390" style="s2">mantra man I can&#39;t remember what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.230" end="00:11:11.199" style="s2">name of the damn word is for singing</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.390" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">mantras</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.199" end="00:11:18.249" style="s2">that&#39;s frustrating and then they would</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:21.100" style="s2">invite large groups of very random</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.249" end="00:11:23.170" style="s2">people often people they just collected</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.100" end="00:11:26.350" style="s2">off the street as they were hit trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.170" end="00:11:28.509" style="s2">to hitchhike in the area or drug addicts</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.350" end="00:11:30.609" style="s2">or or whatever and they would offer them</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.509" end="00:11:32.649" style="s2">a free meal and then the partake in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.609" end="00:11:34.509" style="s2">dance and this was one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.649" end="00:11:35.559" style="s2">mechanisms by which they gathered new</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.509" end="00:11:37.709" style="s2">new people</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.559" end="00:11:40.749" style="s2">many of these people being too</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.709" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">incapacitated to actually leave the area</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.749" end="00:11:49.449" style="s2">as it&#39;s very hard to get around out</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:51.730" style="s2">there without a car Garuda&#39;s farm had I</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.449" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know the full number of</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.930" end="00:12:00.010" style="s2">probably between fifty and a hundred it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.060" end="00:12:02.140" style="s2">was hard to keep track of how many</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.010" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">people there actually were working</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.140" end="00:12:05.980" style="s2">because the property was so large and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:08.710" style="s2">the farm was so large that you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.980" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">quite keep track of everyone that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.710" end="00:12:16.150" style="s2">participating in it but basically he had</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:19.390" style="s2">people work in twelve plus hour days six</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.150" end="00:12:21.610" style="s2">days a week working this farm that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.390" end="00:12:24.450" style="s2">would sell the produce at a farm stand</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.610" end="00:12:27.970" style="s2">in the area</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.450" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">all of them collected food stamps from</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.970" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">from the state which in Hawaii was about</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:34.870" style="s2">three hundred dollars a month and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:37.210" style="s2">they would all donate their food stamps</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.870" end="00:12:38.860" style="s2">to the group so there was very little</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.210" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">overhead for the people to participate</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.860" end="00:12:44.080" style="s2">there other than having some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:48.420" style="s2">very basic level of lodging I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.080" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">sleeping under a tarp during this period</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.420" end="00:12:53.650" style="s2">it&#39;s actually interesting we left the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:55.990" style="s2">people we were with because it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.650" end="00:12:57.820" style="s2">creeping us out after about two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.990" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">and we moved to a neighboring part that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.820" end="00:13:04.570" style="s2">was still within the Krishna&#39;s set up</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:07.090" style="s2">but was way less hands-on it was a noni</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.570" end="00:13:10.380" style="s2">farm I don&#39;t know if anyone knows what</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.090" end="00:13:13.990" style="s2">noni fruit is but it is a horrifyingly</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.380" end="00:13:17.170" style="s2">disgusting fruit that is often marketed</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.990" end="00:13:21.520" style="s2">as some type of extreme superfood and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.170" end="00:13:27.340" style="s2">sells for a very high premium smells</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.520" end="00:13:30.430" style="s2">like stomach acid or bile so there we</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.340" end="00:13:32.920" style="s2">slept in a abandoned School Bus on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.430" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">farm property and and you know we&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.920" end="00:13:38.550" style="s2">and do our four hours of work a day</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:41.890" style="s2">largely just collecting the bags that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.550" end="00:13:45.220" style="s2">lord knows how many random workers were</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.890" end="00:13:47.830" style="s2">collecting off the trees all day long I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.220" end="00:13:52.200" style="s2">mean that the territory that we drove to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.830" end="00:13:52.200" style="s2">collect these bags was was enormous</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.710" end="00:13:58.150" style="s2">often with many kind of temporary</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.660" end="00:14:00.580" style="s2">structures randomly placed throughout</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.150" end="00:14:04.030" style="s2">the farms for for the workers to live in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.580" end="00:14:07.470" style="s2">that was also under garuda saying but</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.030" end="00:14:07.470" style="s2">not his actual residence</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.940" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">yeah so this was the initial kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.540" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">interfacing with these alternative</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:18.460" style="s2">groups it was very clear and I was very</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:23.240" style="s2">uncomfortable I was coming from a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.460" end="00:14:25.460" style="s2">individualist and you know coming just</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.240" end="00:14:29.780" style="s2">recently coming out of a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.460" end="00:14:32.810" style="s2">atheistic phase through my teenage years</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.780" end="00:14:35.320" style="s2">and was kind of opening my mind to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.810" end="00:14:38.980" style="s2">spiritual practices without the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.320" end="00:14:38.980" style="s2">metaphysics largely</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.900" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">so yeah whoo we did not get along with</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.330" end="00:14:47.640" style="s2">the people there I often would would</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:49.980" style="s2">bring up arguments and and start kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.640" end="00:14:53.160" style="s2">philosophical debates in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.980" end="00:14:55.170" style="s2">their their practices and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.160" end="00:14:57.870" style="s2">that&#39;s how we ended up at the farm the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.170" end="00:14:59.460" style="s2">farm ended up being too much eventually</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.870" end="00:15:03.570" style="s2">and we moved out of the farm and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.460" end="00:15:06.450" style="s2">actually rented a cabin from the guy</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.570" end="00:15:10.440" style="s2">that owned all the monetary resources</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.450" end="00:15:14.310" style="s2">for this whole group who also had rumors</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.440" end="00:15:16.950" style="s2">of murdering two people the dramas in</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.310" end="00:15:19.290" style="s2">Pahoa had were like normal dramas but</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.950" end="00:15:22.410" style="s2">like blown out times ten or a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.290" end="00:15:26.330" style="s2">just like in little interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.410" end="00:15:30.420" style="s2">struggles where like extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.330" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">dramatic I&#39;ve told some of these stories</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:37.160" style="s2">yes so basically we saw what they were</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.970" end="00:15:39.800" style="s2">doing we saw him we clearly didn&#39;t fit</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.800" end="00:15:44.540" style="s2">quite a bit of friction and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.860" end="00:15:46.730" style="s2">time it was really interesting talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.540" end="00:15:48.650" style="s2">to a lot of these people and getting to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.730" end="00:15:52.220" style="s2">know them and hearing their life stories</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.650" end="00:15:54.590" style="s2">because so many of them were were you</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.940" end="00:16:30.980" style="s2">things so immediately we could kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.820" end="00:16:33.940" style="s2">see that while this wasn&#39;t something we</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.980" end="00:16:37.940" style="s2">wanted to do there was certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.940" end="00:16:39.980" style="s2">distinct gray area where we could</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.940" end="00:16:43.310" style="s2">acknowledge that sound bits of this were</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.980" end="00:16:45.260" style="s2">pretty creepy and yet it also seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.310" end="00:16:51.760" style="s2">be legitimately helping a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.260" end="00:16:54.410" style="s2">people so yeah we eventually moved out</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.760" end="00:16:56.150" style="s2">one of the two people that had moved in</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.410" end="00:16:58.100" style="s2">before us had a car that he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.150" end="00:17:00.050" style="s2">borrowing from his friend that lived on</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.100" end="00:17:03.890" style="s2">the island so we had some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.050" end="00:17:07.550" style="s2">mobility the group of the four of us was</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.890" end="00:17:11.270" style="s2">three guys and one girl when we moved</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.550" end="00:17:14.120" style="s2">out to this very remote location by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.270" end="00:17:17.780" style="s2">way it was it was a shack in about a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.120" end="00:17:21.350" style="s2">mile deep into the jungle ten miles from</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.780" end="00:17:23.209" style="s2">the town so you went out on the main</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.350" end="00:17:25.490" style="s2">highway out there until you hit a sign</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.209" end="00:17:27.380" style="s2">that said end of the road and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.490" end="00:17:32.510" style="s2">where in the 80s the lava flow had just</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.380" end="00:17:35.030" style="s2">wiped out the freeway and then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.510" end="00:17:37.010" style="s2">to cross this lava field eventually</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.030" end="00:17:39.830" style="s2">you&#39;d come to a spot where the freeway a</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.010" end="00:17:41.900" style="s2">brief stretch of it still existed and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.830" end="00:17:44.120" style="s2">then you would see a breadfruit tree</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.900" end="00:17:47.290" style="s2">which if people aren&#39;t familiar is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.120" end="00:17:52.309" style="s2">tree that grows a very large spiky fruit</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.290" end="00:17:54.110" style="s2">kind of like a jackfruit and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.309" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">where you turned right into the jungle</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.110" end="00:17:59.179" style="s2">and walked for about a mile and ended up</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:00.710" style="s2">at a shack and we lived in that Shack so</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.179" end="00:18:03.020" style="s2">it was very difficult for us there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.710" end="00:18:06.350" style="s2">much traffic going out to a highway that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.020" end="00:18:08.809" style="s2">terminates in a lava field so it was not</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.350" end="00:18:11.419" style="s2">particularly easy to get back into town</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.809" end="00:18:15.049" style="s2">we were probably walking upwards of 15</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.419" end="00:18:17.240" style="s2">miles a day on average you know about</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.049" end="00:18:18.230" style="s2">five miles until you were deep enough in</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.240" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">the highway that there were</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.230" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">neighborhoods where people were driving</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:24.950" style="s2">and so you could get a ride to and from</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">and then you know whatever walking we</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.950" end="00:18:30.740" style="s2">were doing in the town and in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:32.750" style="s2">surrounding area we are running off</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.740" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">water catchment that was infested with</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.750" end="00:18:36.650" style="s2">mosquito larvae which was great we</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:42.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize that until about two</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.650" end="00:18:44.299" style="s2">weeks in we ate quite quite a number of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.710" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">mosquito larvae it was infested with</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.299" end="00:18:51.169" style="s2">cockroaches as well there&#39;s no natural</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:56.830" style="s2">predators in Hawaii so all of the nasty</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.169" end="00:19:00.919" style="s2">critters reproduce without limit and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.830" end="00:19:04.790" style="s2">about a week and a half into this me and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.919" end="00:19:07.040" style="s2">the girl the one girl got together which</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.790" end="00:19:10.549" style="s2">sent the two guys off on their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.040" end="00:19:12.950" style="s2">journey and one of the two guys my</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.549" end="00:19:15.559" style="s2">friend and the guy that she had come</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.950" end="00:19:18.440" style="s2">with we&#39;re the two guys he had the car</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.559" end="00:19:20.690" style="s2">so we were suddenly stranded out in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.440" end="00:19:22.429" style="s2">very remote area without a vehicle they</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.690" end="00:19:24.940" style="s2">said they&#39;d be back in a few days that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.429" end="00:19:27.980" style="s2">they were going for a hiking trip and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.940" end="00:19:30.890" style="s2">about a week in we realized that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.980" end="00:19:34.940" style="s2">probably weren&#39;t coming back with no</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.890" end="00:19:36.740" style="s2">word from them we very naively held on</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.940" end="00:19:38.290" style="s2">to the hope that they would return for</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.740" end="00:19:39.990" style="s2">quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.290" end="00:19:41.790" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.990" end="00:19:44.429" style="s2">so then yeah it was just me and her out</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.790" end="00:19:46.920" style="s2">there and eventually we heard word of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.429" end="00:19:50.940" style="s2">other community that was a little closer</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.920" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">to town and had other people there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.940" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">also very dangerous as a white person to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:20:01.980" style="s2">be hitchhiking on those roads you hear</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:06.090" style="s2">many very very gross stories of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.980" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">locals abusing obviously non-local</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.090" end="00:20:12.210" style="s2">people there to very extreme degrees you</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:14.340" style="s2">know one of the stories a few years</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.210" end="00:20:16.650" style="s2">before we&#39;d gotten there was a girl</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.340" end="00:20:19.770" style="s2">camping at one of the national parks and</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.650" end="00:20:22.800" style="s2">you know a group of method out locals</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.770" end="00:20:25.050" style="s2">came raped her ran her over with I ran</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.800" end="00:20:28.280" style="s2">her over with their truck broke her hip</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.050" end="00:20:31.530" style="s2">raped her and then threw her off a cliff</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.280" end="00:20:36.120" style="s2">and he would regularly he&#39;ll hear</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.530" end="00:20:38.040" style="s2">stories of them you know just turning</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.120" end="00:20:40.830" style="s2">the car a little because you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.040" end="00:20:43.260" style="s2">on the edge of a highway and running</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.830" end="00:20:45.540" style="s2">people over so you didn&#39;t want to go out</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.260" end="00:20:47.700" style="s2">at night you wanted to have some type of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.540" end="00:20:51.510" style="s2">community that offered you some type of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.700" end="00:20:55.320" style="s2">security and the ability to you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.510" end="00:21:02.309" style="s2">have extra resources while no one had</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.320" end="00:21:05.400" style="s2">refrigerators so we moved to a place</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.309" end="00:21:08.429" style="s2">called cinder land which called itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.400" end="00:21:12.570" style="s2">an eco village and this was actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.429" end="00:21:15.750" style="s2">quite a bit of fun it was basically a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.570" end="00:21:19.320" style="s2">hippie commune built out of a lava field</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.750" end="00:21:26.010" style="s2">that a guy named Jesus of cinder land</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.320" end="00:21:28.050" style="s2">with a Z G Z us jez us had bought and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.010" end="00:21:31.320" style="s2">restored and it was actually very</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.050" end="00:21:33.960" style="s2">beautiful and the month-and-a-half that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.320" end="00:21:36.330" style="s2">we were there Jesus was actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.960" end="00:21:40.290" style="s2">mainland going apparently through an</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.330" end="00:21:42.990" style="s2">identity crisis so it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.290" end="00:21:46.290" style="s2">relatively mild living there and many of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.990" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">the more cultic aspects were muted and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.290" end="00:21:51.300" style="s2">it was largely just a bunch of hippies</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.940" end="00:21:53.670" style="s2">that would have a big marijuana pizza</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.300" end="00:21:58.440" style="s2">party on Saturdays to compete with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.670" end="00:22:02.040" style="s2">Krishna&#39;s food party so he&#39;s two rival</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.440" end="00:22:04.020" style="s2">groups each trying to indoctrinate or at</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.040" end="00:22:08.190" style="s2">least interest people in their little</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.020" end="00:22:12.960" style="s2">setup battling over over where to go on</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.190" end="00:22:15.930" style="s2">Saturday night so yeah they&#39;d make pot</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.960" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">pizza and then have a big drum circle</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.930" end="00:22:20.040" style="s2">and kind of anyone was invited to come</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:25.770" style="s2">hang out as usually groups of around 80</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.040" end="00:22:30.060" style="s2">people show up eventually we decided to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.770" end="00:22:32.430" style="s2">come back to the mainland and ironically</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.060" end="00:22:36.540" style="s2">I didn&#39;t actually realize how cult the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.430" end="00:22:41.330" style="s2">cinder land was until about a decade</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.540" end="00:22:47.310" style="s2">later when they came up on reza aslan</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.330" end="00:22:49.650" style="s2">cult project he was doing with with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.310" end="00:22:53.100" style="s2">with a media organization I forget which</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.650" end="00:22:55.920" style="s2">one but yes cinder land was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.100" end="00:22:58.020" style="s2">places he visited and it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.920" end="00:23:01.500" style="s2">the giant tarps that we were all</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.020" end="00:23:06.810" style="s2">sleeping under were intended to be sales</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.750" end="00:25:40.110" style="s2">a very interesting time I avenged</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">came back to the mainland with the girl</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.110" end="00:25:50.020" style="s2">we moved to a cabin she eventually got</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:58.100" style="s2">developed some mixture of schizophrenia</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.100" end="00:26:08.090" style="s2">that resulted in a very strong suicidal</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.409" end="00:26:24.999" style="s2">particularly well although it gave me a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.929" end="00:26:29.700" style="s2">very clear idea of how deeply open we</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.999" end="00:26:33.850" style="s2">are to having our sense of reality just</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.700" end="00:26:37.210" style="s2">overcome by someone who was clearly</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.289" end="00:26:47.950" style="s2">was so I could see myself getting sucked</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.009" end="00:26:49.809" style="s2">into her psychosis even as I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.950" end="00:26:53.729" style="s2">to help her deal with it and bring her</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.809" end="00:26:53.729" style="s2">back kind of down-to-earth</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.910" end="00:27:01.150" style="s2">skipping over most of that outside of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.120" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">how it pertains to this discussion we</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.150" end="00:27:09.930" style="s2">eventually broke up or well she thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:13.060" style="s2">I was I was a form of the Antichrist and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.930" end="00:27:17.950" style="s2">had been infected by a parasitic alien</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.060" end="00:27:20.170" style="s2">living on my back which eventually led</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.950" end="00:27:21.960" style="s2">to her leaving yeah I&#39;ve got a weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.170" end="00:27:24.520" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.960" end="00:27:27.340" style="s2">it seemed some of the head nods in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:29.110" style="s2">baby no it&#39;s so odd because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.340" end="00:27:32.770" style="s2">that about you for like the first like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.110" end="00:27:34.420" style="s2">couple of times I met you I was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.770" end="00:27:36.540" style="s2">actually you&#39;re pretty cool yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.420" end="00:27:36.540" style="s2">weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.290" end="00:27:50.190" style="s2">so yeah she she moved out eventually her</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.630" end="00:27:52.050" style="s2">psychosis got exponentially worse</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.190" end="00:27:55.050" style="s2">without someone to kind of offer some</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.050" end="00:27:58.310" style="s2">sense of grounding there her parents</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.050" end="00:28:00.810" style="s2">eventually came out to the area and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.310" end="00:28:02.670" style="s2">rescued her if you will she ended up</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.810" end="00:28:06.380" style="s2">getting electroshock therapy to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.670" end="00:28:11.460" style="s2">rebalance her out likely heavy doses of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.380" end="00:28:14.120" style="s2">psychotropic stabilizers that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.460" end="00:28:17.490" style="s2">eventually led due to her seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.120" end="00:28:20.340" style="s2">recovering so that&#39;s it has at least a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.490" end="00:28:25.770" style="s2">decent end at the end of the the story</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.340" end="00:28:30.330" style="s2">they&#39;re following that situation I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.770" end="00:28:34.410" style="s2">quite extremely depressed it had taken</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.330" end="00:28:38.730" style="s2">in all of its forms a tremendous toll on</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.410" end="00:28:41.460" style="s2">on my sense of self and self worth and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.730" end="00:28:43.500" style="s2">and all these kind of things so I spent</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.460" end="00:28:46.710" style="s2">a good year and quite a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.500" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">depression following that whole scenario</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.710" end="00:28:53.130" style="s2">and interestingly a right as I started</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:55.050" style="s2">kind of coming out of it I picked up</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.130" end="00:28:56.850" style="s2">some hobbies rock climbing and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.050" end="00:29:02.250" style="s2">made friends and started connecting</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.850" end="00:29:03.960" style="s2">myself back to to life I developed type</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.900" end="00:29:21.950" style="s2">so that took a little bit of a blow I</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.450" end="00:29:26.390" style="s2">recovered fairly quickly</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.950" end="00:29:28.910" style="s2">oh no I&#39;m skipping stuff cult 3 so this</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.390" end="00:29:32.710" style="s2">is in-between breaking up with the girl</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.910" end="00:29:32.710" style="s2">and getting type 1 diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.779" end="00:29:40.440" style="s2">cult 3 was the same friend that I had</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.259" end="00:29:42.179" style="s2">done do Hawaii with we went through</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.440" end="00:29:45.239" style="s2">about a year where we weren&#39;t on great</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.179" end="00:29:48.149" style="s2">terms due to the dramas of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.239" end="00:29:51.299" style="s2">and eventually we you know became</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.149" end="00:29:53.729" style="s2">friends again and everything was good he</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.299" end="00:29:57.119" style="s2">had a person that gave a a guest</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.729" end="00:29:59.789" style="s2">lecturer at his college you know many</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.119" end="00:30:02.340" style="s2">years before all this stuff happened who</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.789" end="00:30:04.859" style="s2">had heavily inspired him with kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.340" end="00:30:10.529" style="s2">this New Age message in a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.859" end="00:30:13.529" style="s2">robust symbolic system of love and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.529" end="00:30:15.089" style="s2">know I can I&#39;ll go more into this but he</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.529" end="00:30:19.019" style="s2">had left a very deep impression on him</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.089" end="00:30:20.849" style="s2">the guy had run a a permaculture farm so</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.019" end="00:30:25.429" style="s2">again in the pursuit of trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.849" end="00:30:27.659" style="s2">permaculture he contacted this guy and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.429" end="00:30:30.059" style="s2">asked if we could come out to his farm</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.659" end="00:30:31.830" style="s2">and learn some permaculture and at this</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.059" end="00:30:37.259" style="s2">time my friend now had a wife and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.830" end="00:30:42.450" style="s2">child a two-year-old and so all of us</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.259" end="00:30:44.180" style="s2">went out to this guy&#39;s farm in Idaho on</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.110" end="00:30:54.210" style="s2">and it quickly became obvious upon going</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.470" end="00:30:57.779" style="s2">there that there was a lot more to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.210" end="00:31:01.169" style="s2">story than just permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.779" end="00:31:02.789" style="s2">and so we later found out that this guy</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.169" end="00:31:05.789" style="s2">basically had run a pretty an</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.960" end="00:31:23.639" style="s2">it ends up that he had used McKenna&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.639" end="00:31:30.179" style="s2">took everything from it including the</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.280" end="00:33:24.179" style="s2">tremendously common in all worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.340" end="00:33:26.429" style="s2">whether they are religious or not and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.179" end="00:33:28.140" style="s2">do have a theory for why that is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.429" end="00:33:30.390" style="s2">not very complicated writes the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.140" end="00:33:33.270" style="s2">externalization of our own death</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.390" end="00:33:35.190" style="s2">projected upon the world so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.270" end="00:33:39.720" style="s2">interface with it and come to terms with</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.190" end="00:33:42.800" style="s2">it and likewise forming some idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.720" end="00:33:45.420" style="s2">hope from within these modes of deep</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.800" end="00:33:50.190" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.420" end="00:33:52.140" style="s2">um anyways I was battling this guy</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.190" end="00:33:54.930" style="s2">constantly you know I had a much</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.140" end="00:33:59.100" style="s2">stronger grasp of at least some amount</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.930" end="00:34:02.100" style="s2">of science science currently to be able</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.100" end="00:34:04.250" style="s2">to push back against him quite strongly</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.100" end="00:34:07.950" style="s2">and I should point out you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.250" end="00:34:09.540" style="s2">interfacing with these three cults again</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.950" end="00:34:13.740" style="s2">coming deeply from my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.540" end="00:34:16.290" style="s2">individualist mythos I viewed myself as</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.740" end="00:34:18.120" style="s2">like a a pressure tester you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.290" end="00:34:21.510" style="s2">could see clearly and so I could fight</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.120" end="00:34:24.540" style="s2">and argue these these scenarios better</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.510" end="00:34:27.240" style="s2">than most could and and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.540" end="00:34:30.030" style="s2">grew as I interacted with one after</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.240" end="00:34:32.820" style="s2">another after another and I had started</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.030" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">to learn particularly in these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.820" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">new agey groups where people have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:40.320" style="s2">tendency to heavily idealize the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:42.840" style="s2">positive side of the spectrum and to try</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.320" end="00:34:45.870" style="s2">and disown their negative emotions or</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.840" end="00:34:48.210" style="s2">shadow to ruin a cult leader in these</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.870" end="00:34:50.250" style="s2">scenarios is very easy all you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.210" end="00:34:53.100" style="s2">do is get them to reveal their their</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.250" end="00:34:55.590" style="s2">shadow in some extravagant way and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.100" end="00:34:57.390" style="s2">usually takes very little actual pushing</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.590" end="00:34:59.160" style="s2">to get them to do so</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.390" end="00:35:01.050" style="s2">and then you can just point out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.160" end="00:35:05.250" style="s2">hypocrisy between their message and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.050" end="00:35:07.260" style="s2">their behavior so yeah new New Age cults</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.250" end="00:35:10.730" style="s2">are very easy to take down if you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.260" end="00:35:10.730" style="s2">interested in doing so</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.750" end="00:35:18.609" style="s2">we got kicked out from there about a</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">month and a half after trying to make it</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.609" end="00:35:24.099" style="s2">work and my constant arguing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:30.700" style="s2">arguments get getting pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.099" end="00:35:32.770" style="s2">heated and and yeah we left and I lived</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.700" end="00:35:35.079" style="s2">I moved to Santa Cruz which is where I</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.770" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">still AM after the Idaho later in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.079" end="00:35:41.589" style="s2">year after getting diabetes got diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:44.559" style="s2">moved here to Santa Cruz about three</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.589" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">months after I was diagnosed and had</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.559" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">been here since</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.200" end="00:35:54.550" style="s2">went through you know I started playing</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.900" end="00:35:56.680" style="s2">around quite heavily there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.550" end="00:35:58.300" style="s2">really interesting groups I be I hung</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.680" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">out with when I first moved here the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.300" end="00:36:03.130" style="s2">whole music in just there</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:06.340" style="s2">groups in the area some of them are new</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.130" end="00:36:09.190" style="s2">AG groups and all kinds of stuff I had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.340" end="00:36:11.400" style="s2">lot of fun that was a method of social</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.190" end="00:36:16.930" style="s2">relating that I had not well-developed</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.400" end="00:36:20.140" style="s2">before then I eventually got a job at a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.930" end="00:36:22.150" style="s2">major jewelry producer within the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.140" end="00:36:26.920" style="s2">festival community called third eye</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.150" end="00:36:29.640" style="s2">pinecones who have a bit of a cult</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.920" end="00:36:31.780" style="s2">following with in the festival community</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.640" end="00:36:34.060" style="s2">and I ended up working with them for</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.780" end="00:36:37.180" style="s2">about three years until I finally went</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.060" end="00:36:40.420" style="s2">to a festival and my illusions had</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.180" end="00:36:42.700" style="s2">dropped about what was happening within</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.420" end="00:36:44.740" style="s2">these festival and New Age communities</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.700" end="00:36:50.170" style="s2">and just how rampant they were with</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.740" end="00:36:54.330" style="s2">absolute and how artificial the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.170" end="00:36:58.170" style="s2">supposed growth and transformation was</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.330" end="00:37:03.220" style="s2">and this actually created in me a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.170" end="00:37:05.560" style="s2">strongly manic state as as my worldview</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.220" end="00:37:08.950" style="s2">that I had been using for quite a number</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.560" end="00:37:12.010" style="s2">of years kind of in the Peter Sounion</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.950" end="00:37:15.720" style="s2">sense the Deadwood all burnt very</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.010" end="00:37:15.720" style="s2">rapidly and all at once</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.850" end="00:37:22.750" style="s2">and I go into more detail I&#39;ve done five</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.140" end="00:37:24.280" style="s2">interviews with Paul van der clay on his</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.750" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">channel where I run through a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.280" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">this in a lot more detail and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:32.200" style="s2">shared this specific part earlier in one</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:36.250" style="s2">of our discussions sharing a religious</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.200" end="00:37:38.920" style="s2">experience but basically you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.250" end="00:37:41.230" style="s2">in this relatively manic phase I had the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.920" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">distinct sensation of being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.230" end="00:37:47.620" style="s2">into people or through people</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:50.230" style="s2">not quite psychic but something almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.620" end="00:37:53.410" style="s2">more like I could actually I was not</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.230" end="00:37:55.660" style="s2">blinding myself intentionally to any of</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.410" end="00:37:57.850" style="s2">the signals people were putting out and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.660" end="00:38:01.030" style="s2">they were putting out so many signals</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.850" end="00:38:04.450" style="s2">that it was really easy to see the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.030" end="00:38:08.440" style="s2">artifice of their identity</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.450" end="00:38:10.810" style="s2">also the sim symbolic impact of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.440" end="00:38:13.180" style="s2">world in the modern world became very</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.810" end="00:38:16.300" style="s2">transparent there was almost this</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.180" end="00:38:19.450" style="s2">constant revelation of a death wish of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.300" end="00:38:22.210" style="s2">hope for her apocalypse seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.450" end="00:38:24.340" style="s2">screaming from everything from the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.210" end="00:38:28.030" style="s2">we structured our cities to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.340" end="00:38:32.080" style="s2">architecture to the mode people behaved</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.030" end="00:38:34.390" style="s2">when interacting with these systems all</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.080" end="00:38:37.270" style="s2">of which I almost described as a type of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.390" end="00:38:39.820" style="s2">flow extreme flow state that I could not</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.270" end="00:38:44.470" style="s2">leave I could not get out of it I could</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.820" end="00:38:46.420" style="s2">not come back to norm and ironically</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.470" end="00:38:49.210" style="s2">this was in many ways what I had been</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.420" end="00:38:50.950" style="s2">dreaming was my ideal state while</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.210" end="00:38:53.320" style="s2">partaking in these kind of New Age</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.950" end="00:38:56.590" style="s2">communities you know Oh finally I could</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.320" end="00:38:58.330" style="s2">see and upon finally seeing all I could</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.590" end="00:39:00.580" style="s2">wish for was that I wish I could stop</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.330" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">seeing so much like please I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.580" end="00:39:07.330" style="s2">to see what I&#39;m you know the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:11.400" style="s2">the situation let me be back in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.330" end="00:39:11.400" style="s2">of dream of what this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.700" end="00:39:17.380" style="s2">eventually I realized that if I laid</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.590" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">myself out on the floor in a classically</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.380" end="00:39:25.540" style="s2">prayer or submission like position that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:28.390" style="s2">I found some relief and again I I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.540" end="00:39:31.750" style="s2">describe this in very physical terms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.390" end="00:39:33.970" style="s2">like feeling energy moving through the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.750" end="00:39:37.020" style="s2">body or like which areas of my nervous</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.970" end="00:39:37.020" style="s2">system we&#39;re being lit up</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.890" end="00:39:45.480" style="s2">in that position it felt like the energy</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.470" end="00:39:47.940" style="s2">could actually flow all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.480" end="00:39:51.029" style="s2">the spine and could leave the body</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.940" end="00:39:54.230" style="s2">instead of kind of regurgitating inside</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.029" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">of the body leading to this</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.230" end="00:39:59.130" style="s2">schizophrenic like state where my</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:02.160" style="s2">delusions were being filled with so much</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.130" end="00:40:04.499" style="s2">of this kind of psychic energy that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.160" end="00:40:08.999" style="s2">started to manifest themselves in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.499" end="00:40:11.430" style="s2">phenomenology I spent a number of days</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.999" end="00:40:13.680" style="s2">spending a lot of time in that position</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.430" end="00:40:16.589" style="s2">again just because it was the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:20.940" style="s2">I could find relief in and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.589" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">this led to a very powerful religious</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.940" end="00:40:26.849" style="s2">experience of some type of being</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">interfacing with me touching me on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.849" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">forehead which led to this enormous</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:36.119" style="s2">sensation of like clearing out where</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:38.970" style="s2">these kind of like blockages in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.119" end="00:40:40.559" style="s2">energy and the body were suddenly opened</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.970" end="00:40:44.460" style="s2">and the energy could just fall through</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.559" end="00:40:49.349" style="s2">without me like getting into these manic</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.460" end="00:40:52.230" style="s2">states as a side effect and then it told</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.349" end="00:40:54.809" style="s2">me to get up get off my knees like quit</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.230" end="00:40:59.880" style="s2">you know quit whatever you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.809" end="00:41:02.910" style="s2">right there that&#39;s not and I was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.880" end="00:41:05.900" style="s2">relieved from this state and most</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.910" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">bizarrely my type 1 diabetes went away</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.900" end="00:41:12.390" style="s2">temporarily and as measured you know I</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:15.420" style="s2">was doing finger prick tests it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.390" end="00:41:17.489" style="s2">like magic or something or I just</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.420" end="00:41:20.910" style="s2">thought it was gone it was physically</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.489" end="00:41:23.579" style="s2">not responding I stopped taking insulin</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.910" end="00:41:27.950" style="s2">for about a month after about a month</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.579" end="00:41:31.109" style="s2">that destabilized and I had noticed this</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.950" end="00:41:33.509" style="s2">destabilization phenomenologically as</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.109" end="00:41:36.029" style="s2">well as I was trying to interface with</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.509" end="00:41:38.099" style="s2">the world and go to do my job and all</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.029" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">these things in these rather extravagant</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.099" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">states of mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.769" end="00:41:47.329" style="s2">another two weeks I think it was a total</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.109" end="00:41:52.039" style="s2">of a month and a half I was off insulin</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.329" end="00:41:55.069" style="s2">and then yeah a month afterwards it had</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.039" end="00:41:57.230" style="s2">started to destabilize two weeks later I</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.069" end="00:41:59.299" style="s2">took insulin again because my blood</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.230" end="00:42:05.329" style="s2">Sugar&#39;s were totally off the map once</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.299" end="00:42:08.299" style="s2">again and in that state I had basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.329" end="00:42:10.609" style="s2">created an ultimatum at my job where</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.299" end="00:42:12.920" style="s2">either I could play a role in the upper</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.609" end="00:42:15.829" style="s2">management of the company or I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.920" end="00:42:17.869" style="s2">leave and during that time actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.829" end="00:42:19.999" style="s2">right after coming back from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.869" end="00:42:23.749" style="s2">festival I got a random friend two-week</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.999" end="00:42:25.670" style="s2">request on Facebook from the person that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.749" end="00:42:27.480" style="s2">ended up being the cult leader of cult</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.670" end="00:42:29.970" style="s2">number four</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.480" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2">so going through this state you know I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.970" end="00:42:34.200" style="s2">was interacting with him but mostly in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:36.869" style="s2">sense of battling I was trying to take</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.200" end="00:42:40.680" style="s2">him down in the way that I dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.869" end="00:42:43.590" style="s2">previous cult leaders and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.680" end="00:42:46.350" style="s2">was fun and all this stuff and I found</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.590" end="00:42:49.590" style="s2">that even at the highest state I had</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.350" end="00:42:53.910" style="s2">experienced I could not take this person</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.590" end="00:42:58.710" style="s2">down so the perfect confluence of events</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.910" end="00:43:01.230" style="s2">all lined up and I basically upon it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.710" end="00:43:03.510" style="s2">bizarre story in itself how almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.230" end="00:43:06.810" style="s2">successful I was in taking over a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.510" end="00:43:09.710" style="s2">company that I just decided I should run</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.810" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">for no reason at all like they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.710" end="00:43:16.470" style="s2">really bizarrely considering actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:20.070" style="s2">letting me run this company eventually I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.470" end="00:43:22.470" style="s2">kind of blew my you know I lost</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.070" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">my patience to deal with the situation</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.470" end="00:43:27.840" style="s2">and they were able to see that break and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">go oh okay we need to you know push this</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.840" end="00:43:35.670" style="s2">person out properly so so I left that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:38.460" style="s2">company and in this kind of bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.670" end="00:43:43.890" style="s2">state of coming down from this very</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.460" end="00:43:47.790" style="s2">ecstatic state and finding myself in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.890" end="00:43:50.070" style="s2">very you know separated from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.790" end="00:43:52.560" style="s2">the systems that I was partaking in to</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.070" end="00:43:55.080" style="s2">contextualize my life leading up to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.560" end="00:43:59.720" style="s2">moment holy I&#39;ve almost gone for an</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.080" end="00:43:59.720" style="s2">hour good lord I need to speed it up</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.890" end="00:44:04.600" style="s2">that&#39;s intense Wow</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.000" end="00:44:15.250" style="s2">I basically viewed it as as as this sign</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.560" end="00:44:16.750" style="s2">that I had I clearly had something to</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.250" end="00:44:20.290" style="s2">learn from this person</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.750" end="00:44:22.930" style="s2">I did not naively go that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.290" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">magical person or anything like that but</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.930" end="00:44:30.430" style="s2">rather viewed it in this kind of deeply</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:32.500" style="s2">uh you know pragmatic sense of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.430" end="00:44:34.690" style="s2">they&#39;ve learned something I haven&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.500" end="00:44:37.450" style="s2">whatever they learned is deeply related</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.690" end="00:44:41.320" style="s2">to emotional processing that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.450" end="00:44:45.820" style="s2">unskilled at and emotional stability</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.320" end="00:44:49.950" style="s2">so I ended up eventually after a number</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.820" end="00:44:49.950" style="s2">of months joining that cult</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.870" end="00:44:54.950" style="s2">and this is where the star story is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.150" end="00:44:57.830" style="s2">lot harder for me to tell because</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.950" end="00:45:00.110" style="s2">there&#39;s so many aspects and because all</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.830" end="00:45:03.890" style="s2">of it was taking place online there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.110" end="00:45:09.110" style="s2">not a clear lived in narrative that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.890" end="00:45:11.300" style="s2">can relate and in for the Gov brevity</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.110" end="00:45:15.640" style="s2">and I probably should this is the area I</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.300" end="00:45:15.640" style="s2">should least have applied brevity but</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.300" end="00:45:22.940" style="s2">basically this cult started as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.610" end="00:45:25.820" style="s2">transformational type set up and as the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.940" end="00:45:28.850" style="s2">kind of inability of it to deliver on</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.820" end="00:45:31.730" style="s2">what it had said it could deliver on</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.850" end="00:45:37.070" style="s2">became more apparent it started sliding</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.730" end="00:45:39.080" style="s2">into more authoritarian takes until</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.070" end="00:45:41.240" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like okay we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.080" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">getting to the ends so it must mean our</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.240" end="00:45:46.070" style="s2">means it&#39;s not as important as we</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:49.700" style="s2">thought and there&#39;s a slide from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.070" end="00:45:53.300" style="s2">means being primary to the ends being</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.700" end="00:45:57.320" style="s2">primary and sacrificing the means in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.300" end="00:46:01.750" style="s2">the process and eventually it went from</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.320" end="00:46:05.500" style="s2">its cult formation as a pseudo temple</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.750" end="00:46:08.360" style="s2">pseudo religious structure to a pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.500" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">militaristic structure and started</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.360" end="00:46:15.230" style="s2">calling itself using military</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:17.810" style="s2">terminology there was about to two or</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.230" end="00:46:20.030" style="s2">three weeks maybe a month after it made</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.810" end="00:46:22.670" style="s2">that change that I went ok this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.030" end="00:46:24.860" style="s2">something clearly has gone wrong I could</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.670" end="00:46:28.730" style="s2">pull away from it enough to see the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.860" end="00:46:32.810" style="s2">trend and I left the people that did not</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.730" end="00:46:35.360" style="s2">leave you know it took a while but after</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.810" end="00:46:40.520" style="s2">about this was also its transition from</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.360" end="00:46:43.280" style="s2">URL to IRL so moving from online only to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.520" end="00:46:45.500" style="s2">like there there bring in people all</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.280" end="00:46:48.440" style="s2">into the same area under the same roof</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.500" end="00:46:51.530" style="s2">and are getting a lot more hands-on with</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.440" end="00:46:55.690" style="s2">its techniques and so I never ended up</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.530" end="00:46:58.310" style="s2">meeting the the leaders in person</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.690" end="00:47:00.599" style="s2">although I had met a couple of the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.310" end="00:47:03.190" style="s2">members</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.599" end="00:47:06.339" style="s2">and that whole thing I could really</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.190" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">spend a lot of time talking about in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.339" end="00:47:15.190" style="s2">details of how incredibly powerful its</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:19.210" style="s2">manipulations were and how counter to</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.190" end="00:47:22.540" style="s2">many of the concepts people have of I of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.210" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">cults is but I&#39;m hoping it will kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.540" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">come through in the later sections and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:29.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve already spent way too much time</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:31.300" style="s2">here so you can also go look at the Paul</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.710" end="00:47:33.310" style="s2">van der clay videos where I talk a</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.300" end="00:47:35.980" style="s2">little bit more about this if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.310" end="00:47:38.020" style="s2">you&#39;re interested I will try and end it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.980" end="00:47:40.470" style="s2">there for now and see if anyone has any</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.020" end="00:47:40.470" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.150" end="00:47:51.400" style="s2">does anyone else have a question</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.620" end="00:47:54.250" style="s2">I do but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.400" end="00:47:58.930" style="s2">missed a lot of what you said make so</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.250" end="00:48:01.510" style="s2">just from the last guess half an hour so</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.930" end="00:48:03.039" style="s2">I have so many questions the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.510" end="00:48:04.779" style="s2">I want to say is I feel like I should</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.039" end="00:48:09.010" style="s2">have paid for that even just like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.779" end="00:48:14.549" style="s2">last bit that I heard would I pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.010" end="00:48:17.260" style="s2">it was yea credible to listen to your</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.549" end="00:48:18.789" style="s2">unusually insightful about what would</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.260" end="00:48:21.099" style="s2">have been what seemed to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.789" end="00:48:22.599" style="s2">like discombobulating experiences right</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.099" end="00:48:24.730" style="s2">I got like a lot of people just have no</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.599" end="00:48:26.619" style="s2">insight like it&#39;s a very strange time in</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.730" end="00:48:28.569" style="s2">my life and but you like it was this it</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.619" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">was structured this way I was drawn</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.569" end="00:48:34.029" style="s2">because I was and and so yeah anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:38.980" style="s2">just yeah I would have paid the question</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.029" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">is you think that as a personality you</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.980" end="00:48:42.339" style="s2">know there&#39;s something called the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:44.829" style="s2">authoritarian personality into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.339" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">old kind of somewhat hackneyed collage</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.829" end="00:48:47.380" style="s2">achill construct and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">take it to me like some you know like</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.380" end="00:48:51.059" style="s2">Hitler or authoritarian personality</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">trait it&#39;s more the people who had drawn</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.059" end="00:48:56.500" style="s2">people who seem to exude some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:58.059" style="s2">authority interestingly and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.500" end="00:49:00.099" style="s2">if this is true in every case but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.059" end="00:49:02.529" style="s2">seems to be that you were drawn by a</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.099" end="00:49:04.839" style="s2">kind of a challenge yes I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.529" end="00:49:06.520" style="s2">bunk this because I&#39;m and then somehow</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.839" end="00:49:09.039" style="s2">you&#39;re like turned around</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.520" end="00:49:11.380" style="s2">yeah so why is it that you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.039" end="00:49:13.329" style="s2">drawn to something in that sense not as</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.380" end="00:49:14.920" style="s2">a true believer from day one right but</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.329" end="00:49:17.170" style="s2">as you go into challenged things and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.920" end="00:49:19.960" style="s2">then somehow you like wait what just</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.170" end="00:49:21.640" style="s2">happened there I&#39;m yeah so is that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.960" end="00:49:24.309" style="s2">make of that facet of your personality</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.640" end="00:49:28.900" style="s2">so it is interesting too because I never</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.309" end="00:49:32.260" style="s2">dropped the challenge in Coke for I like</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.900" end="00:49:34.329" style="s2">literally it made use of people&#39;s doubt</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.260" end="00:49:38.049" style="s2">as part of its structure it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.329" end="00:49:40.359" style="s2">constantly infighting so I never</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.049" end="00:49:42.579" style="s2">actually let go of the idea that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.359" end="00:49:44.380" style="s2">like either here to believe in this and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.579" end="00:49:46.049" style="s2">follow it or I&#39;m here to destroy it</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.380" end="00:49:50.529" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.049" end="00:49:53.079" style="s2">and so again like I went into it with</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.529" end="00:49:57.700" style="s2">like a really deeply pragmatic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.079" end="00:50:00.010" style="s2">framework and a lot of it was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.700" end="00:50:02.500" style="s2">almost like a cheesy old kung fu movie</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.010" end="00:50:04.420" style="s2">you know like yeah I brought my best</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.500" end="00:50:05.260" style="s2">kung fu against them you know this</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.420" end="00:50:07.900" style="s2">master</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.260" end="00:50:10.390" style="s2">he easily defeated me even at my peak so</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.900" end="00:50:13.090" style="s2">then I you know go okay well I&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.390" end="00:50:23.230" style="s2">your kung-fu then it&#39;s you know beat me</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.090" end="00:50:25.750" style="s2">master I will join the right Oh was it</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.230" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">it&#39;s because you&#39;re scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.750" end="00:50:29.940" style="s2">inclined in some sense right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:32.770" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t likely we&#39;re trying to argue</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.940" end="00:50:35.290" style="s2">no a particular kind of crystal against</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.770" end="00:50:38.590" style="s2">a particular kind of you know like rune</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.290" end="00:50:40.120" style="s2">sign or trying to falsify and find</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.590" end="00:50:42.730" style="s2">contradictions and collapse the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.120" end="00:50:46.330" style="s2">view great Oh what was it rational</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.730" end="00:50:49.150" style="s2">arguments this guy had or you you answer</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.330" end="00:50:51.430" style="s2">yeah we just hit 25 people maybe let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.150" end="00:50:56.580" style="s2">turn off our cameras cause otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.430" end="00:50:56.580" style="s2">people are gonna get blocked sorry going</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.500" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">it was not rationally based and it made</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.710" end="00:51:12.760" style="s2">very obvious use of not rationality but</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:15.980" style="s2">a very different style of argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.760" end="00:51:19.880" style="s2">it was very deeply involved in in</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.980" end="00:51:22.190" style="s2">trolling and basically the efficacy of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.880" end="00:51:24.140" style="s2">trolling and how deep of an effect it</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.190" end="00:51:27.670" style="s2">can have on someone&#39;s perception of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.140" end="00:51:27.670" style="s2">themselves in their worldview</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.830" end="00:51:36.560" style="s2">and in many ways it could attack the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.360" end="00:51:38.450" style="s2">overuse of rationality itself granted it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.560" end="00:51:41.150" style="s2">did so in a very particular way so</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.450" end="00:51:43.540" style="s2">there&#39;s aspects here of kind of classic</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.150" end="00:51:47.570" style="s2">you know Lifton&#39;s thought stopping</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.540" end="00:51:49.370" style="s2">techniques and yet the thought stopping</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.570" end="00:51:52.190" style="s2">techniques were not thought stopping in</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.370" end="00:51:54.220" style="s2">and of themselves rather they very</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.190" end="00:51:57.350" style="s2">deeply focused one on their</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.220" end="00:51:59.420" style="s2">phenomenological experience and asked</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.350" end="00:52:02.150" style="s2">the person if you&#39;re going to make the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.420" end="00:52:04.760" style="s2">argument know where you&#39;re making it</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.150" end="00:52:08.060" style="s2">from and what tools you&#39;re using and why</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.760" end="00:52:11.270" style="s2">you&#39;re using them so there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.060" end="00:52:14.450" style="s2">like shadow integration type stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.270" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">cult 4 and that was part of what made me</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.450" end="00:52:19.040" style="s2">go you know oh I clearly have something</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">to learn here as belonging and all these</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:24.620" style="s2">kind of new agey circles for so long I</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:28.250" style="s2">had kind of subconsciously picked up the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.620" end="00:52:31.490" style="s2">lack of integration of the shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.250" end="00:52:34.700" style="s2">then I I had the weakness in my ability</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.490" end="00:52:36.590" style="s2">to wield the shadow very blatantly</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.700" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">called to my attention just by</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.590" end="00:52:40.950" style="s2">interacting with this person these</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:42.510" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.950" end="00:52:45.650" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if that answered your</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.510" end="00:52:53.010" style="s2">question or not but no no it does</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.650" end="00:52:56.339" style="s2">basically the rational way of pulling</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.010" end="00:52:58.980" style="s2">you to question rational underpinnings</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.339" end="00:53:00.780" style="s2">we write this on your rationality by</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.980" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">removing their foundation effectively</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.780" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">yes kind of jujitsu move nothing going</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:09.960" style="s2">to Jitsu but yeah yeah thanks dogs right</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:12.570" style="s2">thank you and a lot of it was like why</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.960" end="00:53:15.180" style="s2">am i it was a legitimate question of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.570" end="00:53:18.329" style="s2">like why am i placing so much faith in</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.180" end="00:53:20.910" style="s2">my intellect when I am also overtly</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.329" end="00:53:23.490" style="s2">aware of its ability to itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.910" end="00:53:26.849" style="s2">and what I saw and then was a type of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.490" end="00:53:29.310" style="s2">like deep ontological security that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.849" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">was lacking and was trying to make up</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.310" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">for by overintellectualizing everything</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:40.660" style="s2">that&#39;s how I interpreted it I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.650" end="00:53:43.580" style="s2">interpreted it at the time at least I</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.660" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">can I ask a gratuitous bonus question</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.580" end="00:53:51.860" style="s2">please say I&#39;m just saying alright yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:53.270" style="s2">no just let&#39;s give you a quick just</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.860" end="00:53:55.190" style="s2">because he has a lot more to go through</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.270" end="00:53:56.570" style="s2">and there&#39;s a few other questions I</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.190" end="00:53:58.850" style="s2">think for this section</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.570" end="00:54:02.270" style="s2">yeah then I&#39;ll pause but thanks so much</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.850" end="00:54:03.770" style="s2">Michael it was awesome great they kill</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.270" end="00:54:05.770" style="s2">me I think you had a question on this</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.770" end="00:54:09.660" style="s2">section</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.770" end="00:54:12.460" style="s2">yeah can you hear me okay yep</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.660" end="00:54:14.380" style="s2">yeah I actually just I was getting some</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.460" end="00:54:17.470" style="s2">lag and I actually missed a detail that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.380" end="00:54:22.089" style="s2">I was really curious to know I heard you</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.470" end="00:54:24.790" style="s2">say that you got a job at a fashionable</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.089" end="00:54:26.349" style="s2">jewelry company and then I lost you and</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.790" end="00:54:29.320" style="s2">then I heard that you were in that crazy</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.349" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">manic state and I missed how you got</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.320" end="00:54:35.020" style="s2">there he could maybe just recap that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:40.960" style="s2">yeah Jana I&#39;m gonna temporarily mute</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.020" end="00:54:42.820" style="s2">there we go um yeah so I was you know we</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.960" end="00:54:44.740" style="s2">were working out of a garage at a house</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.820" end="00:54:49.060" style="s2">you know pumping out these these</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.740" end="00:54:52.420" style="s2">pendants and us the actual craftsmen</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.060" end="00:54:54.550" style="s2">behind it had very lint little</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.420" end="00:54:57.369" style="s2">interfacing with the festival circuit</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.550" end="00:54:59.950" style="s2">side of it and so I I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.369" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">operating under this bizarre mythology</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.950" end="00:55:04.330" style="s2">of what I thought I was doing and what I</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:06.760" style="s2">thought was going on in the festival</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.330" end="00:55:09.160" style="s2">circuits particularly the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.760" end="00:55:11.580" style="s2">spiritually oriented ones which were the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.160" end="00:55:16.690" style="s2">ones that we were largely dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.580" end="00:55:18.609" style="s2">and it was upon being invited after</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.690" end="00:55:21.339" style="s2">about two and a half almost three years</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.609" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">of working for the company to go see the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.339" end="00:55:26.800" style="s2">festival end of it that my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:31.750" style="s2">mythos with which I was using to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.800" end="00:55:35.080" style="s2">contextualize my my you know life came</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.750" end="00:55:37.720" style="s2">crumbling down quite rapidly and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.080" end="00:55:40.839" style="s2">seemed to spark the the burning of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.720" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">Deadwood moment or the burning very hot</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.839" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">as I&#39;ve called it before</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.530" end="00:55:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s quite interesting thank you</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.220" end="00:55:54.270" style="s2">anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.800" end="00:55:59.530" style="s2">just on this section was general</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.810" end="00:55:59.530" style="s2">questions at the end</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.280" end="00:56:07.140" style="s2">Oh Thank You Jada vids Curtin is indeed</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.400" end="00:56:11.150" style="s2">the word I could not think of for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.140" end="00:56:11.150" style="s2">Harry Krishna&#39;s singing</p>

<p begin="00:56:22.110" end="00:56:26.610" style="s2">your your question there Jada vids for</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.210" end="00:56:29.000" style="s2">the end is it&#39;s a little off topic for</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.610" end="00:56:29.000" style="s2">this section</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.640" end="00:56:40.539" style="s2">and DMT how are cults economically</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.960" end="00:56:43.539" style="s2">viable there&#39;s endless ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.539" end="00:56:46.380" style="s2">they can form economically viable</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.539" end="00:56:49.329" style="s2">strategies coal for was deeply not</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.380" end="00:56:51.160" style="s2">economically viable but the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.329" end="00:56:54.609" style="s2">Krishna&#39;s had definitely figured that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.160" end="00:56:58.930" style="s2">whole thing out yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.609" end="00:57:03.300" style="s2">quite a many number of ways one might go</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.930" end="00:57:05.700" style="s2">about doing so okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.300" end="00:57:07.230" style="s2">so though to try and get through this</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.700" end="00:57:09.030" style="s2">we&#39;re already halfway through which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.230" end="00:57:11.160" style="s2">not a good sign for being able to make</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.030" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">it through a lot of the material that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.160" end="00:57:16.650" style="s2">had planned it may be that we could</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">split this up if it&#39;s seen we can only</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.650" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">do a part two right so yeah that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:27.030" style="s2">actually might be useful almost viewing</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:29.520" style="s2">this whole section as problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.030" end="00:57:33.690" style="s2">formulation and then maybe doing a</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.520" end="00:57:35.850" style="s2">briefer part two where we go over some</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.690" end="00:57:38.250" style="s2">of the potential answers to those</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.850" end="00:57:40.560" style="s2">problems yeah I think people are finding</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.250" end="00:57:42.900" style="s2">this story pretty fascinating so so</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.560" end="00:57:45.150" style="s2">especially on this the latest coat where</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.900" end="00:57:48.120" style="s2">you said it&#39;s probably useful to go into</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.150" end="00:57:51.660" style="s2">more detail that was right that might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.120" end="00:57:53.460" style="s2">great right yeah yeah I could yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.660" end="00:57:55.740" style="s2">that makes sense we could do that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.460" end="00:58:00.720" style="s2">then and then dive into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.740" end="00:58:03.510" style="s2">framing stuff so yeah cope for was</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.720" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">really interesting in that by any normal</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.510" end="00:58:10.980" style="s2">definition of not normal by almost any</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:13.650" style="s2">normal oh my gosh I did it again any</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.980" end="00:58:16.680" style="s2">scholarly definition of cult that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.650" end="00:58:21.300" style="s2">usually touted by supposed cult experts</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.680" end="00:58:24.210" style="s2">it was technically not a cult however it</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.300" end="00:58:28.170" style="s2">called itself a cult and very obviously</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.210" end="00:58:30.450" style="s2">had many features that would make one</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.170" end="00:58:31.110" style="s2">say this is a cult even if in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.450" end="00:58:34.140" style="s2">details</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.110" end="00:58:39.110" style="s2">avoided the scholarly definition of what</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.140" end="00:58:39.110" style="s2">a cult was yes cat</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.059" end="00:58:47.610" style="s2">okay so Oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.830" end="00:58:57.150" style="s2">with the Catholics she&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.610" end="00:58:59.550" style="s2">opinionated very so for one the leaders</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.150" end="00:59:03.360" style="s2">of the cult were not taken as some type</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.550" end="00:59:05.520" style="s2">of like super Authority combating them</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.360" end="00:59:08.250" style="s2">questioning them was entirely welcome</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:12.210" style="s2">and it very much again took on that kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.250" end="00:59:14.970" style="s2">of like kungfu vibe and eventually after</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.210" end="00:59:17.010" style="s2">losing to the same person so many times</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.970" end="00:59:20.180" style="s2">you just kind of accept that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.010" end="00:59:27.800" style="s2">gonna lose the next time as well but</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.180" end="00:59:31.020" style="s2">invited you know this cut this frame of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.800" end="00:59:34.920" style="s2">not agreeing for the sake of agreeing or</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.020" end="00:59:37.950" style="s2">creating this intense mythos around the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.920" end="00:59:42.230" style="s2">leaders granted that did become more</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.950" end="00:59:42.230" style="s2">present later in the cults development</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.030" end="00:59:48.280" style="s2">we might be able to tie some of this in</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.790" end="00:59:50.590" style="s2">well keep giving a description and we</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.280" end="00:59:53.710" style="s2">can try and play with it a little within</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.590" end="00:59:57.210" style="s2">the description uh if you look into</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.710" end="00:59:59.440" style="s2">Lifton&#39;s eight tenants of thought reform</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.210" end="01:00:01.630" style="s2">for people that aren&#39;t familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.440" end="01:00:03.400" style="s2">liftin he kind of wrote the book not</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.630" end="01:00:05.950" style="s2">kind of he literally wrote the book on</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.400" end="01:00:10.170" style="s2">brainwashing that came out of him</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.950" end="01:00:14.380" style="s2">analyzing the Maoist Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.170" end="01:00:18.550" style="s2">indoctrination methods one you know the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.380" end="01:00:21.940" style="s2">first one in his list is Malou control</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.550" end="01:00:26.680" style="s2">or controlling the information that one</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.940" end="01:00:29.500" style="s2">has access to one may be very familiar</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.680" end="01:00:33.510" style="s2">with that in the idea of these thought</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.500" end="01:00:37.870" style="s2">bubbles that form from having a eyes</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.510" end="01:00:40.840" style="s2">guide what we think we will or what we</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.870" end="01:00:43.870" style="s2">will click on and so there&#39;s a very deep</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.840" end="01:00:46.660" style="s2">level of Malou control just operating in</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.870" end="01:00:50.290" style="s2">our lives now as as as a matter of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.660" end="01:00:53.100" style="s2">course from organizing and making use of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.290" end="01:00:53.100" style="s2">the Internet</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.360" end="01:00:59.370" style="s2">there was none of that in this cult it</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.970" end="01:01:03.020" style="s2">directly interfaced with culture with</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.370" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">pop culture there was no containment on</p>

<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:12.330" style="s2">anything like that or what the trusted</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.900" end="01:01:13.710" style="s2">sources of information were in some</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.330" end="01:01:16.140" style="s2">sense all sources of information</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.710" end="01:01:19.590" style="s2">including those in the cults were to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.140" end="01:01:24.330" style="s2">considered suspect granted it did have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.590" end="01:01:26.610" style="s2">way of organizing what ended up being</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.330" end="01:01:28.980" style="s2">really powerful techniques for</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.610" end="01:01:33.480" style="s2">communicating a worldview just by</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.980" end="01:01:36.030" style="s2">juxtaposing content siphoned off of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.480" end="01:01:38.280" style="s2">internet from any number of sources so</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.030" end="01:01:43.110" style="s2">by basically in the same way that people</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.280" end="01:01:44.760" style="s2">would make a tumblr board where you</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.110" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">could hone in on a sense of their</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.760" end="01:01:49.740" style="s2">aesthetic just by them collecting media</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:52.110" style="s2">in a particular way they made</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.740" end="01:01:54.660" style="s2">extravagant use of that to try and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.110" end="01:01:57.480" style="s2">communicate ideas much more so than</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.660" end="01:02:01.320" style="s2">actually communicating the ideas and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.480" end="01:02:04.650" style="s2">might add that many cults nowadays are</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.320" end="01:02:09.360" style="s2">moving I think Oh in some sense away</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.650" end="01:02:12.570" style="s2">from the idea of millou control and into</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.360" end="01:02:15.210" style="s2">the idea of millou flooding which is to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.570" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">say that if you flood the information</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.210" end="01:02:21.150" style="s2">sources that a person has access to they</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:24.990" style="s2">will perform the millou control of their</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.150" end="01:02:27.480" style="s2">own accord by projecting their worldview</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.990" end="01:02:29.670" style="s2">onto the information just so that they</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.480" end="01:02:33.060" style="s2">can navigate the world and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.670" end="01:02:37.260" style="s2">really subtle change that I think has</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.060" end="01:02:41.220" style="s2">really profound effects in in how people</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.260" end="01:02:43.850" style="s2">go about sense making and in our in our</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.220" end="01:02:43.850" style="s2">current time</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.670" end="01:02:48.269" style="s2">let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.680" end="01:02:53.050" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.530" end="01:02:55.660" style="s2">oops</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.050" end="01:02:59.260" style="s2">I think what I&#39;m gonna try and do here</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.660" end="01:03:01.930" style="s2">is pull in liftin overtly</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.260" end="01:03:07.600" style="s2">and kind of go through his list of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.930" end="01:03:10.060" style="s2">thought reform and mind control bits and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.600" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">then kind of relate them to coke for and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.060" end="01:03:16.420" style="s2">try and show how they&#39;re both similar</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:18.880" style="s2">and different and how how new forms of</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.420" end="01:03:20.680" style="s2">cultic structures might might be</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.880" end="01:03:24.300" style="s2">effective in an age where it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.680" end="01:03:24.300" style="s2">harder to recognize them as such</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.210" end="01:03:32.490" style="s2">so using that as a primer the the next</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.160" end="01:03:35.520" style="s2">one that that lifts and brings up as</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.490" end="01:03:37.920" style="s2">mystical manipulation and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.520" end="01:03:39.930" style="s2">overt manipulation of experiences to</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.920" end="01:03:46.290" style="s2">make them appear spontaneous when they</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.930" end="01:03:48.930" style="s2">are in fact controlled and intended so</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.290" end="01:03:50.970" style="s2">this is like magic right the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.930" end="01:03:52.710" style="s2">magician has a very specific way of</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.970" end="01:03:54.780" style="s2">focusing your attention on certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.710" end="01:03:56.520" style="s2">things so that you can&#39;t see the trick</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.780" end="01:03:58.970" style="s2">and then surprising you with the trick</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.520" end="01:03:58.970" style="s2">at the end</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.350" end="01:04:05.590" style="s2">and I would say that this is ever less</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.020" end="01:04:07.720" style="s2">present well it&#39;s tricky because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.590" end="01:04:09.750" style="s2">still extraordinarily present in pseudo</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.720" end="01:04:13.420" style="s2">religious or religious or or</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.750" end="01:04:18.430" style="s2">transformative communities even</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.420" end="01:04:21.130" style="s2">political but it&#39;s it&#39;s you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.430" end="01:04:23.710" style="s2">a lot of like the conspiracy theory you</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.130" end="01:04:25.650" style="s2">can attach patterns to things and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.710" end="01:04:27.970" style="s2">suddenly make them appear mystical</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.650" end="01:04:29.890" style="s2">regardless of whether was someone was</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.970" end="01:04:32.260" style="s2">intending to give you the impression</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.890" end="01:04:34.360" style="s2">that it was mystical or not and I would</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.260" end="01:04:37.300" style="s2">say another big side effect of this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.360" end="01:04:40.390" style="s2">the huge uptick in psychedelics which</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.300" end="01:04:43.390" style="s2">opens up the pattern finding systems in</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.390" end="01:04:45.850" style="s2">the brain so wide that you basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.390" end="01:04:47.530" style="s2">don&#39;t even need to trick the person you</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.850" end="01:04:52.540" style="s2">just have to get them to trick</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.530" end="01:04:54.730" style="s2">themselves or even you know very</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.540" end="01:04:57.730" style="s2">slightly give the indication that they</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.730" end="01:05:00.250" style="s2">should be on psychotropic substances as</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.730" end="01:05:02.920" style="s2">some form of enlightenment or something</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.250" end="01:05:05.260" style="s2">along those lines that&#39;s not to say that</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.920" end="01:05:07.300" style="s2">they cannot have a positive effect but</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.260" end="01:05:14.080" style="s2">it is to say that they can very very</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.300" end="01:05:16.060" style="s2">easily be manipulated there was yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.080" end="01:05:19.870" style="s2">quote for there was a lot less of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.060" end="01:05:22.540" style="s2">but there was a very in the overt sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.870" end="01:05:26.950" style="s2">but there was very much the</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.540" end="01:05:30.520" style="s2">conspiratorial very wide net cast for</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.950" end="01:05:32.440" style="s2">pattern recognition granted it was also</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.520" end="01:05:35.340" style="s2">part of the cult to not be on any</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.440" end="01:05:35.340" style="s2">substances</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.960" end="01:05:43.630" style="s2">so yeah you get kind of a interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.099" end="01:05:47.890" style="s2">juxtaposition their demand for purity in</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.630" end="01:05:51.830" style="s2">many ways cult for was anti purity and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.890" end="01:05:53.330" style="s2">purity very deeply at the same time so</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.830" end="01:05:56.180" style="s2">one of the things they asked was that</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.330" end="01:05:59.270" style="s2">everyone wear white granted I never</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.180" end="01:06:01.369" style="s2">ended up actually doing this but some of</p>

<p begin="01:07:07.400" end="01:07:14.680" style="s2">carried with it a deep LeeAnn type Urist</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.930" end="01:07:17.510" style="s2">connotation and it was very deeply</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.680" end="01:07:20.119" style="s2">focused on integration of the shadow and</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.510" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">not trying to pretend you are something</p>

<p begin="01:07:34.609" end="01:07:40.790" style="s2">familiar forms of purity testing that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.220" end="01:07:44.599" style="s2">normally come across right there was no</p>

<p begin="01:07:44.599" end="01:07:49.220" style="s2">like that although it did have very</p>

<p begin="01:07:52.369" end="01:08:01.329" style="s2">was to be extraordinarily pure in your</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.789" end="01:08:04.660" style="s2">physical life so as to open up more</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.329" end="01:08:07.099" style="s2">flexibility in your emotional life and</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.660" end="01:08:10.249" style="s2">you know one of their tenants was that</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.099" end="01:08:14.210" style="s2">they believed that basically we had this</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.249" end="01:08:17.540" style="s2">inverted that that people were trying</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.210" end="01:08:20.630" style="s2">far too hard to create an image of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.540" end="01:08:23.690" style="s2">emotional purity and sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.630" end="01:08:25.639" style="s2">physical purity on its altar so right</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.690" end="01:08:28.429" style="s2">you see the the false</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.639" end="01:08:30.409" style="s2">you know Instagram star or youtube star</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.429" end="01:08:33.290" style="s2">and they always make sure the room</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.409" end="01:08:35.150" style="s2">behind them is impeccable and organized</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.290" end="01:08:38.659" style="s2">and they&#39;ve got all their makeup on and</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.150" end="01:08:40.520" style="s2">the lighting is just right meanwhile you</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.659" end="01:08:43.009" style="s2">know the camera falls down one day and</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.520" end="01:08:45.949" style="s2">you see behind you know their veil and</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.009" end="01:08:48.589" style="s2">it&#39;s just this shithole you know rat</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.949" end="01:08:51.469" style="s2">nest of a place they&#39;re living in or you</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.589" end="01:08:53.540" style="s2">know like however that may be occurring</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.469" end="01:08:57.409" style="s2">so they they were trying to take that</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.540" end="01:08:59.810" style="s2">image focus and flip it on its head and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.409" end="01:09:02.389" style="s2">I think there is actually you know there</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.810" end="01:09:04.429" style="s2">is as much as I would like to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.389" end="01:09:06.230" style="s2">everything about the cult was a</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.429" end="01:09:07.699" style="s2">and they were evil there were many</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.230" end="01:09:10.100" style="s2">aspects where it&#39;s like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.699" end="01:09:11.509" style="s2">actually not entirely off-base that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.100" end="01:09:14.359" style="s2">probably should be paying more attention</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.509" end="01:09:16.429" style="s2">to the purity of our environments</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.359" end="01:09:19.279" style="s2">ironically this was well before Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.429" end="01:09:21.799" style="s2">Pederson hit the market and his main</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.279" end="01:09:25.219" style="s2">message of course main mean being the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.799" end="01:09:27.650" style="s2">clean your room mean and how that offers</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.219" end="01:09:29.889" style="s2">one a certain level of emotional</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.650" end="01:09:29.889" style="s2">stability</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.240" end="01:09:39.150" style="s2">confession is the next on Lifton&#39;s list</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.370" end="01:09:41.940" style="s2">and this is normally a way to to gain</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.150" end="01:09:45.740" style="s2">power over a person by blackmailing I</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.940" end="01:09:48.600" style="s2">can also be a way to guilt trip them</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.740" end="01:09:51.930" style="s2">into feeling like they need whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.600" end="01:09:54.990" style="s2">is you&#39;re selling in a type of you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.930" end="01:09:57.420" style="s2">racketeering manner</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.990" end="01:09:59.880" style="s2">I would I would add to this that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.420" end="01:10:01.950" style="s2">idea of confession while still very</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.880" end="01:10:04.580" style="s2">prevalent obviously like this is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.950" end="01:10:06.930" style="s2">whole hyper leftist thing of course</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.580" end="01:10:09.800" style="s2">along with the purity moral purity</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.930" end="01:10:09.800" style="s2">testing but</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.500" end="01:10:15.960" style="s2">I would also say that we in many ways</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.350" end="01:10:20.190" style="s2">have replaced the idea of confession</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.960" end="01:10:22.590" style="s2">with the idea of authenticity which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.190" end="01:10:26.610" style="s2">to say one should unapologetically be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.590" end="01:10:28.920" style="s2">confessional list which is arguably what</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.610" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">the original purpose of confession was</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.920" end="01:10:35.550" style="s2">but so yeah you know one more bit to pay</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:37.980" style="s2">attention to and how these ideas kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.550" end="01:10:42.000" style="s2">have morphed since the time of Lifton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.980" end="01:10:44.310" style="s2">writing and you got two ends there the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.000" end="01:10:46.680" style="s2">guilt complex of confession and then the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.310" end="01:10:49.410" style="s2">honest positive aspect of confession</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.680" end="01:10:53.760" style="s2">which I think there is much value to but</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.410" end="01:10:55.830" style="s2">it is also dangerous sacred science the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.760" end="01:10:57.510" style="s2">group&#39;s doctrine or ideology is</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.830" end="01:11:01.500" style="s2">considered to be the ultimate truth</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.510" end="01:11:04.020" style="s2">beyond all questioning or dispute again</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.500" end="01:11:06.930" style="s2">the cult specifically it did not have</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.020" end="01:11:10.170" style="s2">this orientation towards ideology in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.930" end="01:11:13.050" style="s2">normal sense it very much had its quite</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.170" end="01:11:16.440" style="s2">rigid practices and ways of doing so and</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.050" end="01:11:18.540" style="s2">yet rationalize them on a deeply</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.440" end="01:11:21.840" style="s2">pragmatic basis rather than an</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.540" end="01:11:23.970" style="s2">ideological basis and again I think that</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.840" end="01:11:26.220" style="s2">is a transition that really needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.970" end="01:11:30.030" style="s2">paid attention to as people move forward</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.220" end="01:11:32.790" style="s2">in these types of things and I think a</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.030" end="01:11:36.030" style="s2">lot of this comes from the the switch in</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.790" end="01:11:39.900" style="s2">having a normative objective truth as</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.030" end="01:11:43.890" style="s2">the standard the cultural standard to</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.900" end="01:11:47.010" style="s2">having this much more subjective concept</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.890" end="01:11:49.980" style="s2">of truth that is largely defined on</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.010" end="01:11:54.300" style="s2">one&#39;s ability to exhibit narcissistic</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.980" end="01:11:56.790" style="s2">power right how to overwhelm someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.300" end="01:11:59.850" style="s2">subjectivity with your own subjectivity</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.790" end="01:12:01.850" style="s2">and how that changes the nature of what</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.850" end="01:12:04.020" style="s2">we might consider a sacred science</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.850" end="01:12:05.940" style="s2">however you of course you then have</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.020" end="01:12:09.420" style="s2">projects like Verve a keys where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.940" end="01:12:13.800" style="s2">kind of a mixture of having a sacred</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.420" end="01:12:16.900" style="s2">science and and this kind of pragmatic</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.800" end="01:12:19.120" style="s2">basis and this at</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.900" end="01:12:21.940" style="s2">to deal with it by removing metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.120" end="01:12:24.640" style="s2">and I have I have support and critique</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.940" end="01:12:27.180" style="s2">in all of that motion there&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.640" end="01:12:27.180" style="s2">to be aware of</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.520" end="01:12:33.960" style="s2">loading the language and thought</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.780" end="01:12:35.460" style="s2">terminating cliches this is perhaps one</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.960" end="01:12:38.280" style="s2">of the aspects that people are more</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.460" end="01:12:41.130" style="s2">familiar with there&#39;s been quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.280" end="01:12:45.840" style="s2">of discussion in Verve a Keyes group</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.130" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">about the idea of reinventing terms as</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.840" end="01:12:53.100" style="s2">it is a form of loading the language and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:56.219" style="s2">right thought terminating cliches are</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.100" end="01:12:59.310" style="s2">almost platitudes or mean structures</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.219" end="01:13:02.489" style="s2">that allow one to communicate in</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.310" end="01:13:05.130" style="s2">ideology without having to explain the</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.489" end="01:13:07.080" style="s2">ideology in a way that makes the person</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.130" end="01:13:11.730" style="s2">on the receiving end believe that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.080" end="01:13:14.280" style="s2">self-evident there&#39;s lots of ways to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.730" end="01:13:16.320" style="s2">that and the both of these are so deeply</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.280" end="01:13:18.150" style="s2">written into what it means to use</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.320" end="01:13:20.880" style="s2">language at all that I think we have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.150" end="01:13:24.630" style="s2">be really careful about drawing lines in</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.880" end="01:13:29.010" style="s2">this territory cult for very much had</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.630" end="01:13:31.020" style="s2">heavy manipulation of language and one</p>

<p begin="01:13:34.920" end="01:13:43.130" style="s2">it very heavily misspelled things to the</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.890" end="01:14:52.870" style="s2">went all over the place in that regard</p>

<p begin="01:15:06.940" end="01:15:12.190" style="s2">I would say again this is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.550" end="01:15:15.160" style="s2">related to sacred science in that it</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.190" end="01:15:18.940" style="s2">seems like we are switching doctrine</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.160" end="01:15:21.310" style="s2">over person to person over person again</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.940" end="01:15:23.530" style="s2">because we are losing our grip on there</p>

<p begin="01:15:23.530" end="01:15:27.489" style="s2">and a side effect of this is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.570" end="01:15:31.449" style="s2">entered into this battling of</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.489" end="01:15:37.000" style="s2">ontological States or or perhaps more</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.449" end="01:15:38.949" style="s2">accurately narcissistic States so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.000" end="01:15:42.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of ways you could go into</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.949" end="01:15:44.920" style="s2">that cult for flirted on the edge of</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.250" end="01:15:49.690" style="s2">this you know it very deeply cared and</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.920" end="01:15:52.210" style="s2">ended many processes to to look at and</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.690" end="01:15:54.250" style="s2">record and deeply pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.210" end="01:15:57.190" style="s2">people&#39;s subjective experience</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.250" end="01:15:59.170" style="s2">however it also reinterpreted those</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.190" end="01:16:02.770" style="s2">experiences within a frame it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.170" end="01:16:05.350" style="s2">sense-making framework and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.770" end="01:16:08.620" style="s2">is fundamental to any type of therapy so</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.350" end="01:16:11.699" style="s2">I think if one again draws the line too</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.620" end="01:16:15.670" style="s2">harshly here you&#39;re gonna throw out most</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.699" end="01:16:18.760" style="s2">systems any type of transformational</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.670" end="01:16:22.690" style="s2">system in the process so we might want</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.760" end="01:16:25.239" style="s2">to reframe that question later and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.690" end="01:16:27.400" style="s2">the final one with liftin is dispensing</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.239" end="01:16:30.610" style="s2">of existence the group has the</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.400" end="01:16:32.800" style="s2">prerogative to decide who has the right</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.610" end="01:16:35.080" style="s2">to exist and who does not this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.800" end="01:16:36.940" style="s2">usually not literal but means that those</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.080" end="01:16:39.370" style="s2">in the outside world are not saved</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.940" end="01:16:42.300" style="s2">unenlightened unconscious and they must</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.370" end="01:16:44.949" style="s2">be converted to the group&#39;s ideology</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.300" end="01:16:47.739" style="s2">again in cult for this was partially</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.949" end="01:16:51.400" style="s2">true and partially not true it</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.739" end="01:16:53.770" style="s2">definitely had a bifurcation in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.400" end="01:16:56.140" style="s2">in-group and the out-group it did not</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.770" end="01:16:58.660" style="s2">then suppose that the people had to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.140" end="01:17:02.770" style="s2">literally in the cult to be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.660" end="01:17:04.989" style="s2">in-group and likewise being in the cult</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.770" end="01:17:09.880" style="s2">did not save you from being in the out</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.989" end="01:17:13.390" style="s2">group so yeah there&#39;s a lot of fuzziness</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.880" end="01:17:15.760" style="s2">here particularly when interacting with</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.390" end="01:17:19.780" style="s2">liftin and thinking that it&#39;s giving us</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.760" end="01:17:20.760" style="s2">a really useful tool for for interacting</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.780" end="01:17:23.579" style="s2">with systems as</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.760" end="01:17:25.559" style="s2">they now operate there is a lot of value</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.579" end="01:17:27.389" style="s2">here there&#39;s also a lot that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.559" end="01:17:30.210" style="s2">questionable and there&#39;s a lot that has</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.389" end="01:17:32.699" style="s2">transformed so radically that paying to</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.210" end="01:17:35.309" style="s2">strongly attend too much attention to</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.699" end="01:17:36.989" style="s2">lifting can actually blind you to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.309" end="01:17:40.079" style="s2">way other ways in which one might be</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.989" end="01:17:42.599" style="s2">manipulated or you know have their</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.079" end="01:17:45.960" style="s2">thoughts contextualized by an external</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.599" end="01:17:49.639" style="s2">system oh that was a lot of talking do</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.960" end="01:17:49.639" style="s2">we have any questions on this whole pit</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.010" end="01:17:58.030" style="s2">so how do you think these cult leaders</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.540" end="01:17:59.380" style="s2">manipulate people into these worldviews</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.030" end="01:18:03.120" style="s2">like what do you think the strategy is</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.380" end="01:18:03.120" style="s2">there how do you think they&#39;re effective</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.349" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">oh man I think it fun like if in my own</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.510" end="01:18:16.250" style="s2">sense making people have a deep</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:19.739" style="s2">solipsistic vulnerability right this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.250" end="01:18:21.840" style="s2">its can&#39;t right it starts a can&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.739" end="01:18:23.790" style="s2">is kind of like the whole thrust of</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.840" end="01:18:26.810" style="s2">post-modernism but it&#39;s there in each</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.790" end="01:18:29.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really become part of our</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.810" end="01:18:34.380" style="s2">context is it&#39;s kind of realizing how</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.880" end="01:18:36.510" style="s2">vulnerable we are as in this very cell</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.380" end="01:18:39.409" style="s2">up cystic manner right one can always</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.510" end="01:18:42.179" style="s2">cast doubt on one&#39;s self or you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.409" end="01:18:46.409" style="s2">perceptions not only of themselves but</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.179" end="01:18:49.409" style="s2">of the world around them and people have</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.409" end="01:18:53.070" style="s2">been making use of that vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.409" end="01:18:56.489" style="s2">now for a very long time right this the</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.070" end="01:18:59.190" style="s2">century of the self documentary goes</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.489" end="01:19:02.159" style="s2">into how this was played with with in</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.190" end="01:19:04.820" style="s2">much more secular contexts with the</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.159" end="01:19:09.420" style="s2">development of propaganda and</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.820" end="01:19:12.179" style="s2">advertising and public relations from</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.420" end="01:19:15.659" style="s2">Freud&#39;s nephew so putting to use</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.179" end="01:19:20.239" style="s2">psychoanalysis to manipulate very large</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.659" end="01:19:22.739" style="s2">groups of people into hard like behavior</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.239" end="01:19:25.920" style="s2">so you know at some level the question</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.739" end="01:19:29.130" style="s2">is like how does at why does advertising</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.920" end="01:19:31.889" style="s2">work and it&#39;s tamiya just seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.130" end="01:19:36.030" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s part and parcel of human</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.889" end="01:19:39.179" style="s2">sense making to begin with and we can we</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.030" end="01:19:41.040" style="s2">can definitely dive more into that sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.179" end="01:19:47.219" style="s2">making and its vulnerabilities and how</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.040" end="01:19:52.249" style="s2">they&#39;re misused against us and likewise</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.219" end="01:19:57.269" style="s2">you know some amount of it is is is</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.249" end="01:19:58.469" style="s2">deeply owning how insanely vulnerable we</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.269" end="01:20:01.559" style="s2">are in this regard</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.469" end="01:20:04.579" style="s2">right and in many ways I I have in at</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.559" end="01:20:07.440" style="s2">times kind of blamed the ideology of</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.579" end="01:20:09.780" style="s2">individualism for atrophying people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.440" end="01:20:12.389" style="s2">ability to recognize this because we</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.780" end="01:20:15.420" style="s2">rationalize all of our behavior as</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.389" end="01:20:19.070" style="s2">coming from us when the very very vast</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.420" end="01:20:21.179" style="s2">majority of it is coming from our</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.070" end="01:20:23.429" style="s2">affiliations with the people in our</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.179" end="01:20:26.210" style="s2">lives with the groups we interact with</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.429" end="01:20:29.239" style="s2">and with it with the culture that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.210" end="01:20:29.239" style="s2">participate in</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.620" end="01:20:36.580" style="s2">- that answer the question that was very</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.410" end="01:20:38.870" style="s2">interesting thank you Mark get it yet a</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.580" end="01:20:43.040" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.870" end="01:20:46.370" style="s2">yeah Nick who one of the things I hear</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.040" end="01:20:47.690" style="s2">talked about a lot where this is coming</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.370" end="01:20:49.910" style="s2">from necessarily I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.690" end="01:20:53.810" style="s2">related to the game a game D thing is</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.910" end="01:20:56.750" style="s2">the concept of this mean Plex</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.810" end="01:20:59.930" style="s2">being the force that manipulates people</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.750" end="01:21:02.450" style="s2">and so you know from bad I imagine for</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.930" end="01:21:06.320" style="s2">various reasons I&#39;m sure surprised no</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.450" end="01:21:08.480" style="s2">one that that the mean Plex must play or</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.320" end="01:21:10.850" style="s2">some version of a mean Plex must play a</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.480" end="01:21:12.680" style="s2">role in some of these cults and so I</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.850" end="01:21:14.930" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get ahead of your stories</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.680" end="01:21:17.660" style="s2">or the pieces that you&#39;re laying out</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.930" end="01:21:20.000" style="s2">here so I&#39;ll just couch this in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.660" end="01:21:21.020" style="s2">context of you know so far four cults</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.000" end="01:21:23.240" style="s2">one through four</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.020" end="01:21:25.820" style="s2">have you seen elements that you would</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.240" end="01:21:30.020" style="s2">describe as a mean Plex that interact in</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.820" end="01:21:33.410" style="s2">a way that is significant to encouraging</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.020" end="01:21:37.190" style="s2">people to adhere in to the cults right</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.410" end="01:21:41.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a great question absolutely I would</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.190" end="01:21:43.460" style="s2">say more fundamentally than</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.000" end="01:21:45.590" style="s2">well it&#39;s it gets a little tricky right</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.460" end="01:21:50.210" style="s2">because I will later go on to try and</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.590" end="01:21:54.500" style="s2">play with the idea of Colt and in many</p>

<p begin="01:21:54.500" end="01:22:00.820" style="s2">mean plexes interface with sociology</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.240" end="01:22:06.640" style="s2">right so it&#39;s it&#39;s not just in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.980" end="01:22:10.040" style="s2">worldview as a subjective filtering</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.640" end="01:22:13.430" style="s2">neither is it wholly located in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.040" end="01:22:16.730" style="s2">outside groups and the social structures</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.430" end="01:22:17.570" style="s2">but it seems to be this this bizarre or</p>

<p begin="01:22:17.570" end="01:22:23.540" style="s2">well perhaps natural marriage of how our</p>

<p begin="01:22:23.540" end="01:22:28.220" style="s2">sociological structures as we go about</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.700" end="01:22:31.550" style="s2">interacting with the world through our</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.220" end="01:22:34.880" style="s2">our meme plexus if you will</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.550" end="01:22:38.900" style="s2">cult four was most obviously overtly</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.880" end="01:22:44.230" style="s2">aware of the use of memes and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.900" end="01:22:48.670" style="s2">creation of meme plexus as as kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.230" end="01:22:53.240" style="s2">distortion fields by which one uses</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.670" end="01:22:55.820" style="s2">right but the meme to create and it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.240" end="01:22:59.690" style="s2">very overtly involved with creating a</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.820" end="01:23:02.210" style="s2">very robust memeplex now these meme</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.690" end="01:23:04.610" style="s2">plexes were of course obviously present</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.210" end="01:23:08.420" style="s2">in all the other cults as well yet there</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.610" end="01:23:13.940" style="s2">was some sense of naivety or or a lack</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.420" end="01:23:16.580" style="s2">of awareness about that aspect in that</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.940" end="01:23:20.240" style="s2">they they still believed in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.580" end="01:23:26.240" style="s2">modernist notion that they had some</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.240" end="01:23:28.760" style="s2">access to a to a a legitimate truth that</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.240" end="01:23:32.900" style="s2">justified the mean Plex and took it out</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.760" end="01:23:35.690" style="s2">of the meta understanding of what a a</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.900" end="01:23:37.530" style="s2">belief system is doing or a worldview is</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.690" end="01:23:39.840" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.530" end="01:23:48.179" style="s2">man I feel like I&#39;m rambling so much I</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.840" end="01:23:52.829" style="s2">hope this is coherent guys I had a quick</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.179" end="01:23:55.619" style="s2">follow-up because I always I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.829" end="01:23:58.579" style="s2">trying to wonder if you know if you</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.619" end="01:24:02.550" style="s2">think that that my formulation that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.579" end="01:24:05.730" style="s2">memeplex is the mediating force for a</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.550" end="01:24:08.099" style="s2">type of participatory manipulation would</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.730" end="01:24:10.920" style="s2">be a correct formulation for the cult</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.099" end="01:24:13.079" style="s2">you&#39;ve experienced yes it would and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.920" end="01:24:15.809" style="s2">would also add that that type of</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.079" end="01:24:19.099" style="s2">manipulation is entirely unavoidable and</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.809" end="01:24:24.239" style="s2">so I I would focus the question around</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.099" end="01:24:27.570" style="s2">not how do we how do we you know get out</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.239" end="01:24:29.130" style="s2">of meme plexes but how do we make how do</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.570" end="01:24:31.050" style="s2">we how do we judge which ones are</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.130" end="01:24:34.789" style="s2">healthy and have constructive effects</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.050" end="01:24:39.360" style="s2">from those you know proper mediation</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.789" end="01:24:43.960" style="s2">from those that are are you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.360" end="01:24:46.360" style="s2">creating negative or disastrous effects</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.960" end="01:24:48.550" style="s2">yeah I think I think yeah that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.360" end="01:24:50.620" style="s2">was yesterday so I&#39;m just gonna stick my</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.550" end="01:24:55.860" style="s2">tongue out metaphorically i&#39;m irrational</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.620" end="01:24:59.230" style="s2">and and maybe fact here yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.860" end="01:25:03.280" style="s2">did you have any negative repercussions</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.230" end="01:25:11.500" style="s2">for leaving any of these four coats um</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.280" end="01:25:15.580" style="s2">no not by the cults themselves but yes</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.500" end="01:25:18.040" style="s2">on the other end just because at least</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.580" end="01:25:19.900" style="s2">particularly in cult for which i</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.040" end="01:25:21.760" style="s2">actually looked at the dates recently i</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.900" end="01:25:24.010" style="s2">was interacting with cult for for about</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.760" end="01:25:29.440" style="s2">a year and a half and i was in the cult</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.010" end="01:25:31.929" style="s2">for a little over a year but right just</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.440" end="01:25:37.110" style="s2">as a side effect of interacting with it</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.929" end="01:25:37.110" style="s2">you you accrue you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.560" end="01:25:45.730" style="s2">your your community your sense of</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.870" end="01:25:48.820" style="s2">meaning in life like all these things</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.730" end="01:25:51.520" style="s2">get sucked up into belonging in the cult</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.820" end="01:25:54.670" style="s2">so even if the cult had no repercussions</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.520" end="01:25:57.790" style="s2">whatsoever for saying no and matter of</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.670" end="01:26:00.000" style="s2">fact the cult constantly was asking for</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.790" end="01:26:02.650" style="s2">consent</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.000" end="01:26:06.370" style="s2">did you could be is the person after</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.650" end="01:26:09.679" style="s2">living the last one yes yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.370" end="01:26:14.959" style="s2">you experienced it after every cult</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.679" end="01:26:16.849" style="s2">uh mostly after for the cult for I I had</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.959" end="01:26:19.070" style="s2">some amounts of it in the other ones but</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.849" end="01:26:23.389" style="s2">they were mostly easy enough to dismiss</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.070" end="01:26:26.360" style="s2">and I was I was confident enough in my</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.389" end="01:26:28.039" style="s2">deconstruction of their systems that it</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.360" end="01:26:30.619" style="s2">didn&#39;t have as strong of a negative</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.039" end="01:26:33.260" style="s2">effect also I did not build nearly as</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.619" end="01:26:35.949" style="s2">deep of relationships within those those</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.260" end="01:26:35.949" style="s2">other three</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.820" end="01:26:45.080" style="s2">you talked about being delusional at</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.880" end="01:26:46.430" style="s2">some point did the cult did the first</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.080" end="01:26:49.670" style="s2">two cults I think it was between the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.430" end="01:26:51.440" style="s2">second and third maybe did they get you</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.670" end="01:26:54.700" style="s2">to that today it induced that state</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.440" end="01:26:54.700" style="s2">somehow in you</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.019" end="01:27:01.159" style="s2">no but staying in a one-room cabin with</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.369" end="01:27:17.429" style="s2">a schizophrenic bipolar person</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.159" end="01:27:21.229" style="s2">definitely did Jo move you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.429" end="01:27:21.229" style="s2">talking please mute your mics guys</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.470" end="01:27:29.070" style="s2">did I I don&#39;t know if I answered your</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.210" end="01:27:32.570" style="s2">question sufficiently I actually forget</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.070" end="01:27:32.570" style="s2">when I brought up delusion</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.370" end="01:27:39.650" style="s2">yeah no you were you were sick yeah no</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.370" end="01:27:42.320" style="s2">you I thought you said it was right</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.650" end="01:27:47.000" style="s2">before you had were diagnosed with</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.320" end="01:27:48.320" style="s2">diabetes and I think yeah so that that</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.000" end="01:27:51.500" style="s2">must have been when I was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.320" end="01:27:57.950" style="s2">being with the the girl that I met in</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.500" end="01:28:00.170" style="s2">Hawaii unrelated to this did you ever</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.950" end="01:28:09.040" style="s2">experience like losing touch with</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.170" end="01:28:09.040" style="s2">reality when he was in the cult</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.840" end="01:28:17.550" style="s2">it really depends on how you like</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.929" end="01:28:19.920" style="s2">psychotic kind of break no no not in</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.550" end="01:28:22.909" style="s2">obvious although there was a background</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.920" end="01:28:26.699" style="s2">effect that participating in the cult</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.909" end="01:28:28.650" style="s2">seemed to create a pseudo bipolar state</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.699" end="01:28:32.969" style="s2">in people of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.650" end="01:28:36.210" style="s2">manic-depressive swinging but it was it</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.969" end="01:28:38.730" style="s2">was well within normal limits to not you</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.210" end="01:28:40.829" style="s2">know require medication or anything like</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.730" end="01:28:42.750" style="s2">that it was just very clear that there</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.829" end="01:28:44.670" style="s2">were these periods where you know if</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.750" end="01:28:47.090" style="s2">there would be a burst of energy that</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.670" end="01:28:49.920" style="s2">felt like a form of insight and</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.090" end="01:28:52.619" style="s2">following it would kind of lead to</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.920" end="01:28:56.280" style="s2">another following state of a depressive</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.619" end="01:28:59.579" style="s2">cycle and that seemed to be present in</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.280" end="01:29:03.989" style="s2">everyone in the cult I might also add</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.579" end="01:29:09.000" style="s2">that Pavlov had a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.989" end="01:29:12.989" style="s2">experiment with two different types of</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.000" end="01:29:14.969" style="s2">kind of dispositions of dog one kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.989" end="01:29:18.360" style="s2">excitable and happy the other kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.969" end="01:29:21.059" style="s2">calm and they did this project where</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.360" end="01:29:23.550" style="s2">they would reward the dog for being able</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.059" end="01:29:27.659" style="s2">to pick out the circle compared to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.550" end="01:29:29.940" style="s2">ellipse and then they slowly started</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.659" end="01:29:32.969" style="s2">distorting the circle to be more of an</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.940" end="01:29:35.369" style="s2">ellipse or an ellipses and they would</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.969" end="01:29:38.130" style="s2">make the ellipses more like a circle</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.369" end="01:29:38.639" style="s2">until the dog couldn&#39;t tell which one</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.130" end="01:29:42.059" style="s2">was which</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.639" end="01:29:46.670" style="s2">and so the the punishment and the reward</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.059" end="01:29:50.010" style="s2">started appearing random to the dog and</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.670" end="01:29:51.960" style="s2">in each of the the different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.010" end="01:29:53.940" style="s2">temper temperaments of the dogs the ones</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.960" end="01:29:58.110" style="s2">that were previously kind of excitable</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.940" end="01:30:00.329" style="s2">became aggressive and and would start</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.110" end="01:30:04.139" style="s2">snapping and stuff like that whereas as</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.329" end="01:30:07.170" style="s2">the more mild-mannered happy dog became</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.139" end="01:30:09.389" style="s2">depressed upon interfacing with this</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.170" end="01:30:11.760" style="s2">system and that was certainly happening</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.389" end="01:30:16.670" style="s2">within cult for this kind of constant</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.760" end="01:30:19.260" style="s2">motion where you couldn&#39;t tell what</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.670" end="01:30:22.840" style="s2">behavior you were performing was going</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.260" end="01:30:26.820" style="s2">to be rewarded or punished</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.840" end="01:30:30.580" style="s2">and how that seemed to feed into this</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.820" end="01:30:33.280" style="s2">pseudo bipolar like state that it seemed</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.580" end="01:30:35.170" style="s2">to induce in people so you said you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.280" end="01:30:37.360" style="s2">that was mainly online so you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.170" end="01:30:40.679" style="s2">living there and what in what manner did</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.360" end="01:30:44.130" style="s2">the this enforcement take place</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.679" end="01:30:46.979" style="s2">uh it would be through through social</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.130" end="01:30:51.539" style="s2">media so just like you know calling you</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.979" end="01:30:57.829" style="s2">out on your you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.539" end="01:31:00.840" style="s2">public humiliation to some degree of</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.829" end="01:31:05.010" style="s2">rewards were just quite simple you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.840" end="01:31:07.769" style="s2">use the the like button or whatever yeah</p>

<p begin="01:32:09.539" end="01:32:17.999" style="s2">different with it then then the popular</p>

<p begin="01:32:17.999" end="01:32:23.699" style="s2">might also add that Mike detection</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.639" end="01:32:28.920" style="s2">criteria as I will probably get into</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.699" end="01:32:32.400" style="s2">next time is much much broader than than</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.920" end="01:32:37.170" style="s2">the way that the word is is commonly</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.400" end="01:32:38.999" style="s2">used however I would I would entirely</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.170" end="01:32:43.110" style="s2">say that there are many aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.999" end="01:32:45.710" style="s2">classic formation going on in in that</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.110" end="01:32:45.710" style="s2">whole realm</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.640" end="01:32:54.310" style="s2">also you see it on the right you see it</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.860" end="01:32:56.050" style="s2">like you see it everywhere it&#39;s once he</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.310" end="01:32:58.000" style="s2">kind of get a really clear idea of how</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.050" end="01:33:00.220" style="s2">it works it&#39;s hard not to see it</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.000" end="01:33:02.820" style="s2">everywhere and that might be an over</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.220" end="01:33:05.500" style="s2">detection problem it could also be</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.820" end="01:33:07.600" style="s2">pointing towards just some fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.500" end="01:33:10.000" style="s2">quality of of the nature of our</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.600" end="01:33:15.970" style="s2">sociological structures which is where</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.000" end="01:33:17.590" style="s2">my mind has gone with it seems to be in</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.970" end="01:33:19.360" style="s2">a question of degree like a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.590" end="01:33:21.700" style="s2">things that you talked about you know we</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.360" end="01:33:27.220" style="s2">see even elements here and elements you</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.700" end="01:33:29.500" style="s2">know everywhere so yeah these criteria</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.220" end="01:33:32.550" style="s2">would it be more on the extreme that we</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.500" end="01:33:36.400" style="s2">have to be worried about rather than</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.550" end="01:33:38.650" style="s2">yeah the the extreme for sure although I</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.400" end="01:33:40.750" style="s2">think there&#39;s also a danger in over</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.650" end="01:33:44.110" style="s2">characterizing it as existing on the</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.750" end="01:33:46.030" style="s2">extreme in which we allow much subtler</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.110" end="01:33:50.650" style="s2">but still extraordinarily effective</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.030" end="01:33:53.770" style="s2">forms of manipulation to creep in what</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.650" end="01:33:56.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to do as I&#39;ll again get into</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.770" end="01:33:59.380" style="s2">probably next time is is try and ask ok</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.980" end="01:34:02.440" style="s2">some of these things are are fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.380" end="01:34:04.990" style="s2">or are necessary it seems a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.440" end="01:34:08.110" style="s2">useful to me to ask how can this tool be</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.990" end="01:34:11.650" style="s2">used destructively or against someone or</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.110" end="01:34:16.270" style="s2">weaponized and how can they be used</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.650" end="01:34:18.520" style="s2">positively or constructively healthfully</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.270" end="01:34:22.720" style="s2">to promote health within a sociological</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.520" end="01:34:24.700" style="s2">system well but these people these</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.720" end="01:34:27.070" style="s2">people didn&#39;t consider themselves to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.700" end="01:34:31.890" style="s2">causing harm right or do you think they</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.070" end="01:34:31.890" style="s2">did oh yeah no they had no oh</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.070" end="01:34:36.480" style="s2">good intentions but they also had no no</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.050" end="01:34:40.080" style="s2">scruples about saying yeah I&#39;m attacking</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.480" end="01:34:41.970" style="s2">your ego right or like yeah this is</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.080" end="01:34:46.080" style="s2">probably gonna hurt or yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.970" end="01:34:48.990" style="s2"> up right now so again there was</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.080" end="01:34:51.810" style="s2">no purity or goodness as a moral</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.990" end="01:34:54.240" style="s2">standard within it very few people who</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.810" end="01:34:55.740" style="s2">have bad intentions it&#39;s just often that</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.240" end="01:34:59.820" style="s2">they have such good intentions that</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.740" end="01:35:02.250" style="s2">justifies terrible things exactly yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.820" end="01:35:05.760" style="s2">think there&#39;s a problem also NIC I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.250" end="01:35:10.620" style="s2">instead in your sorry I think Manny was</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.760" end="01:35:13.770" style="s2">trying to get in well I was I was</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.620" end="01:35:17.450" style="s2">wondering about this this ability to see</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.770" end="01:35:20.840" style="s2">through people when you referenced a</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.450" end="01:35:26.760" style="s2">similar thing rather seeing true Colts</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.840" end="01:35:33.140" style="s2">right so like did it disappear or did</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.760" end="01:35:36.990" style="s2">you integrate it in some way yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.140" end="01:35:40.500" style="s2">largely it felt like just the vision got</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.990" end="01:35:42.900" style="s2">cloudy and I started re-entering a kind</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.500" end="01:35:45.240" style="s2">of deeply solipsistic take where it felt</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.900" end="01:35:47.430" style="s2">like I could see things I could make</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.240" end="01:35:50.010" style="s2">sense of things but there was this</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.430" end="01:35:52.500" style="s2">underlying phenomenological quality that</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.010" end="01:35:55.590" style="s2">what I was actually seeing was my own</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.500" end="01:35:58.830" style="s2">projection upon the world whereas this</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.590" end="01:36:01.590" style="s2">seeing very clearly state felt like I</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.830" end="01:36:04.530" style="s2">was actually interacting with the world</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.590" end="01:36:07.710" style="s2">I was I was picking up signals from it</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.530" end="01:36:10.290" style="s2">not from regurgitated signals that I was</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.710" end="01:36:14.430" style="s2">projecting on to it and then consuming</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.290" end="01:36:16.890" style="s2">again I had spent a lot of time trying</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.430" end="01:36:19.590" style="s2">to develop that ability and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.890" end="01:36:23.160" style="s2">upon realizing what I considered the the</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.590" end="01:36:26.430" style="s2">fruition right kind of the the the</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.160" end="01:36:29.520" style="s2">the full form of that type of seeing I</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.430" end="01:36:32.340" style="s2">found myself in a very deep type of Hell</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.520" end="01:36:34.410" style="s2">which is not what I was expecting having</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.340" end="01:36:38.720" style="s2">pursued such a type of vision in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.410" end="01:36:38.720" style="s2">many years leading up to that experience</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.580" end="01:36:44.100" style="s2">Nik could you also see a type of heaven</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.540" end="01:36:53.760" style="s2">yes and I would say that when that</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.180" end="01:36:57.180" style="s2">vision was functioning properly which is</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.760" end="01:36:58.950" style="s2">to say when the I had that experience of</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.180" end="01:37:02.100" style="s2">the the thing touching and then this</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.950" end="01:37:04.470" style="s2">clearing of the of the state where I</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.100" end="01:37:06.600" style="s2">could ground the energy back into the</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.470" end="01:37:10.830" style="s2">the earth instead of regurgitating it</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.600" end="01:37:12.540" style="s2">out the top of my head I definitely</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.830" end="01:37:16.040" style="s2">still had the sense of seeing very</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.540" end="01:37:21.410" style="s2">clearly but it flowed in this very deep</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.040" end="01:37:24.660" style="s2">phenomenological sense of a gothic love</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.410" end="01:37:28.230" style="s2">that was not coming from me but which</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.660" end="01:37:32.120" style="s2">was seemingly fully informing my action</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.230" end="01:37:32.120" style="s2">and my my</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.190" end="01:37:38.440" style="s2">sense of the world and there was a very</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.680" end="01:37:41.550" style="s2">deep you know particularly after that of</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.440" end="01:37:45.820" style="s2">after that event this very deep sense of</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.550" end="01:37:47.500" style="s2">of not even a heaven as separate from</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.820" end="01:37:51.190" style="s2">what is currently happening but rather</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.500" end="01:37:57.340" style="s2">the heaven that was obviously and always</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.190" end="01:38:01.230" style="s2">present even in the very you know messed</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.340" end="01:38:01.230" style="s2">up world I found myself in</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.210" end="01:38:05.469" style="s2">go ahead actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.739" end="01:38:08.739" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.840" end="01:38:16.920" style="s2">I would pay money I would pay money</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.420" end="01:38:20.070" style="s2">let&#39;s justwell say that again very much</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.920" end="01:38:23.730" style="s2">appreciate extremely mixed no and say I</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.070" end="01:38:27.060" style="s2">will pay money it&#39;s like I would but</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.730" end="01:38:31.020" style="s2">really yeah oh I meant I appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.060" end="01:38:33.240" style="s2">compliment not the money when you were</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.020" end="01:38:35.610" style="s2">going like ah you know I I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.240" end="01:38:38.790" style="s2">wasting time I was like just take time</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.610" end="01:38:43.380" style="s2">like more just you know as much detail</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.790" end="01:38:45.300" style="s2">you can describe it in um your comments</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.380" end="01:38:47.850" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.300" end="01:38:51.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a really interesting notion who</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.850" end="01:38:52.590" style="s2">have developed or even to believe you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.030" end="01:38:54.160" style="s2">developed this ability to see through</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.590" end="01:38:56.140" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.160" end="01:38:58.390" style="s2">have a distillation of something which</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.140" end="01:39:00.580" style="s2">is fundamental you might say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.390" end="01:39:02.080" style="s2">fundamental to cults but really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.580" end="01:39:04.420" style="s2">just fundamentally human it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.080" end="01:39:06.040" style="s2">cults ramped it up more it&#39;s not they</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.420" end="01:39:07.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t doing something alien I think</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.040" end="01:39:09.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a mistake people make when I they</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.960" end="01:39:13.840" style="s2">do this it&#39;s just so human to us that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.940" end="01:39:16.090" style="s2">why it works right so eing it you you</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.840" end="01:39:19.330" style="s2">you get this ability to see through</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.090" end="01:39:21.160" style="s2">people it&#39;s choking because it&#39;s self</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.330" end="01:39:24.100" style="s2">referential you realize you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.160" end="01:39:27.540" style="s2">too right actually in this and so my</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.100" end="01:39:32.230" style="s2">question is do you think that that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.540" end="01:39:34.920" style="s2">you found it no like a lens by which you</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.230" end="01:39:38.770" style="s2">could really navigate people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.920" end="01:39:41.200" style="s2">motivations or at least see the game</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.770" end="01:39:43.570" style="s2">that they were playing or the game we</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.200" end="01:39:45.490" style="s2">humans play the games that entities play</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.570" end="01:39:47.590" style="s2">conscious entities play right and by</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.490" end="01:39:50.530" style="s2">reference yourself it&#39;s kind of choking</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.590" end="01:39:53.080" style="s2">the heaven that you see there is that</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.530" end="01:39:55.000" style="s2">this like yeah a gapek kind of notion</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.080" end="01:39:57.130" style="s2">that we&#39;re all doing this like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.000" end="01:39:59.050" style="s2">blame you anymore than I can blame me is</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.130" end="01:40:01.000" style="s2">that in those three worlds so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.050" end="01:40:04.060" style="s2">talking about the lensing and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.000" end="01:40:06.430" style="s2">transparency the notion which becomes</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.060" end="01:40:08.500" style="s2">choking and then finally that like wait</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.430" end="01:40:10.420" style="s2">a minute it could be a heaven here</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.500" end="01:40:11.770" style="s2">because I realize you&#39;re not the evil</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.420" end="01:40:14.470" style="s2">guy pulling the string you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.770" end="01:40:16.360" style="s2">doing what I&#39;m doing we&#39;re in this is my</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.470" end="01:40:20.050" style="s2">analysis off there is that roughly oh</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.360" end="01:40:22.870" style="s2">you feel it or interpreted so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.050" end="01:40:25.240" style="s2">some interesting bits here usually I I</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.870" end="01:40:27.490" style="s2">try I did not do as well a job this time</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.240" end="01:40:29.230" style="s2">but I try and hedge my description of</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.490" end="01:40:32.590" style="s2">those experiences by saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.230" end="01:40:33.580" style="s2">describing the phenomenological state I</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.590" end="01:40:37.840" style="s2">was in</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.580" end="01:40:41.080" style="s2">rather than granted there is overt signs</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.840" end="01:40:44.500" style="s2">and responses from the people around me</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.080" end="01:40:47.590" style="s2">that lend me to the belief that there</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.500" end="01:40:49.990" style="s2">was something there there was a sense in</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.590" end="01:40:56.590" style="s2">which I was seeing more deeply in those</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.990" end="01:40:59.200" style="s2">moments than is the standard so yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.590" end="01:41:01.590" style="s2">gets a little confusing but to be on the</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.200" end="01:41:04.630" style="s2">safe side I try and locate it as a in</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.590" end="01:41:06.869" style="s2">phenomenology um felt felt like you</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.630" end="01:41:11.519" style="s2">could make sense right</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.869" end="01:41:14.969" style="s2">um so there&#39;s two bits there because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.519" end="01:41:17.579" style="s2">one I was responding to the state I had</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.969" end="01:41:19.619" style="s2">before being in the cult of this</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.579" end="01:41:21.929" style="s2">religious experience in the state I</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.619" end="01:41:24.149" style="s2">found myself in after it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.929" end="01:41:27.629" style="s2">where I&#39;ve had this a gothic love in</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.149" end="01:41:30.090" style="s2">this kind of clarity however within the</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.629" end="01:41:32.789" style="s2">cult there was also this sense of a type</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.090" end="01:41:35.969" style="s2">of clarity but the phenomenology felt</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.789" end="01:41:38.989" style="s2">really off right there was no a gothic</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.969" end="01:41:41.729" style="s2">love it was more of oh my ego is a</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.989" end="01:41:45.119" style="s2">construct everyone else&#39;s egos are</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.729" end="01:41:48.119" style="s2">constructs I can play a game inside of</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.119" end="01:41:50.280" style="s2">these constructs and I can push on them</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.119" end="01:41:51.989" style="s2">I can see through the game they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.280" end="01:41:54.570" style="s2">playing because I see through the game</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.989" end="01:41:56.639" style="s2">I&#39;m playing by interacting with them but</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.570" end="01:41:59.399" style="s2">there was a kind of harsh cynicism to</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.639" end="01:42:03.179" style="s2">the whole thing that was rationalized on</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.399" end="01:42:06.599" style="s2">a vision of heaven that was not</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.179" end="01:42:10.289" style="s2">available within my phenomenology at all</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.599" end="01:42:12.719" style="s2">while doing the interactions you were</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.289" end="01:42:15.749" style="s2">never really a true believer were more</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.719" end="01:42:17.610" style="s2">like you had a like a dissociative frame</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.749" end="01:42:20.959" style="s2">where you were sort of an anthropologist</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.610" end="01:42:25.949" style="s2">Owens right he&#39;s famous right Bernstein</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.959" end="01:42:26.369" style="s2">yeah no I&#39;d still pay I pay a book or</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.949" end="01:42:30.360" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.369" end="01:42:34.019" style="s2">um so much there you said Paul van der</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.360" end="01:42:36.539" style="s2">clay did I get that right yeah yeah he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.019" end="01:42:38.969" style="s2">got a YouTube channel I think he has a</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.539" end="01:42:41.579" style="s2">playlist I can try and find it and post</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.969" end="01:42:44.519" style="s2">it but uh I&#39;ve done five interviews with</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.579" end="01:42:46.019" style="s2">him they&#39;re pretty wide-ranging and I go</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.519" end="01:42:49.409" style="s2">over a lot of what I talked about here</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.019" end="01:42:51.689" style="s2">in those I&#39;d be really grateful of it</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.409" end="01:42:53.129" style="s2">just as a kind of reference I think that</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.689" end="01:42:57.329" style="s2">you won&#39;t be doing this till the end of</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.129" end="01:43:00.409" style="s2">time if you have a link to those Ida</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.329" end="01:43:03.840" style="s2">Pete I yeah you could post yeah I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.409" end="01:43:05.639" style="s2">throw it in a vent text when I get a</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.840" end="01:43:10.039" style="s2">moment we&#39;ve only got about ten minutes</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.639" end="01:43:10.039" style="s2">left so uh yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.330" end="01:43:20.360" style="s2">did we have a further question it looks</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.540" end="01:43:22.700" style="s2">like there&#39;s a few in the text yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.360" end="01:43:24.020" style="s2">think so Jay David&#39;s had a follow-up</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.700" end="01:43:27.140" style="s2">your reference to picking up signals</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.020" end="01:43:28.910" style="s2">directly direct right relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.140" end="01:43:33.290" style="s2">the world versus regurgitated ones</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.910" end="01:43:36.250" style="s2">reminds me of Greene halls actual</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.290" end="01:43:39.699" style="s2">thinking versus simulated thinking oh</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.250" end="01:43:42.429" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s an interesting parallel</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.699" end="01:43:46.270" style="s2">yeah I would have to I would have to</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.429" end="01:43:48.969" style="s2">remind myself of the the specific ways</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.270" end="01:43:52.300" style="s2">he&#39;s talked about those two and yet I</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.969" end="01:43:55.780" style="s2">can I can kind of hint at the similarity</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.300" end="01:43:57.070" style="s2">there and Skyler Skyler has a question</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.780" end="01:43:59.830" style="s2">but he wants to hear your personal</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.070" end="01:44:04.449" style="s2">definition of cult first before before</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.830" end="01:44:08.650" style="s2">asking right so this is what I was</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.449" end="01:44:14.230" style="s2">hoping to get into in in the the second</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.650" end="01:44:18.790" style="s2">section here because I have quite a I do</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.230" end="01:44:21.070" style="s2">syncretic definition of cult and and I I</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.790" end="01:44:24.270" style="s2">had set up a whole plan of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.070" end="01:44:26.920" style="s2">popular scholarly definitions of cult</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.270" end="01:44:29.440" style="s2">where some of the problems are and what</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.920" end="01:44:35.199" style="s2">I wanted to pose as a more useful</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.440" end="01:44:37.719" style="s2">framing my definition of cult basically</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.199" end="01:44:42.280" style="s2">comes down to it is the meeting ground</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.719" end="01:44:45.100" style="s2">of phenomenology in sociology now or</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.280" end="01:44:48.790" style="s2">where worldviews interface with social</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.100" end="01:44:51.100" style="s2">groups and that is a very loose</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.790" end="01:44:54.280" style="s2">definition however what I think it</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.100" end="01:44:58.239" style="s2">allows us to do is to move the normative</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.280" end="01:45:00.969" style="s2">boundary to the descriptor right so by</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.239" end="01:45:04.449" style="s2">by highlighting what type of cult one is</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.969" end="01:45:07.260" style="s2">is interfacing with we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.449" end="01:45:09.610" style="s2">offer ourselves quite a bit more clarity</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.260" end="01:45:13.630" style="s2">particularly in the cultural situation</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.610" end="01:45:16.210" style="s2">we currently find ourselves in where</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.630" end="01:45:18.699" style="s2">where you know everyone the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.210" end="01:45:21.610" style="s2">crisis has everyone looking at everyone</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.699" end="01:45:23.890" style="s2">else as if they are in a cult and so I</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.610" end="01:45:25.840" style="s2">think we need to kind of like play with</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.890" end="01:45:29.300" style="s2">this idea in a bit of a different way</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.840" end="01:45:31.670" style="s2">then then we have in</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.300" end="01:45:36.770" style="s2">but I make a much stronger argument for</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.670" end="01:45:39.800" style="s2">that it in my notes at least this guy</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.770" end="01:45:44.780" style="s2">did you want to ask your question</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.800" end="01:45:49.370" style="s2">I&#39;m sure I&#39;m kind of referencing I guess</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.780" end="01:45:51.590" style="s2">in my head especially called for seemed</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.370" end="01:45:54.140" style="s2">to remind me a lot of the cult of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.590" end="01:45:58.610" style="s2">individual and the more reconstitution</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.140" end="01:46:00.500" style="s2">of society the kind of the the logical</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.610" end="01:46:03.400" style="s2">limitations of that like how you can</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.500" end="01:46:06.080" style="s2">take that argument really to an extreme</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.400" end="01:46:08.180" style="s2">you said you kind of joined it for the</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.080" end="01:46:11.180" style="s2">expressed goal of calling out the</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.180" end="01:46:14.060" style="s2"> you saw in there yeah every</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.180" end="01:46:16.070" style="s2">time the guy could kind of one-up you in</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.060" end="01:46:19.670" style="s2">an argument so at a certain point kind</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.070" end="01:46:21.950" style="s2">of fuel like there&#39;s or one down me he</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.670" end="01:46:25.640" style="s2">could get underneath me right he could</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.950" end="01:46:28.130" style="s2">always pull out the rug and that was not</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.640" end="01:46:30.890" style="s2">a move I was familiar with alright</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.130" end="01:46:33.200" style="s2">alright and yeah so that&#39;s kind of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.890" end="01:46:35.240" style="s2">very interested in linguistics and how</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.200" end="01:46:37.590" style="s2">that could play effect because it seems</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.240" end="01:46:39.660" style="s2">like you have</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.590" end="01:46:43.650" style="s2">an idea that&#39;s kind of floating around</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.660" end="01:46:45.750" style="s2">the the server and idea is a domicile so</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.650" end="01:46:48.770" style="s2">the lack of a home belonging writing</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.750" end="01:46:52.350" style="s2">well-fitted together and it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.770" end="01:46:55.800" style="s2">that group since they were so honed in</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.350" end="01:46:58.410" style="s2">on attacking one another&#39;s positions you</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.800" end="01:47:01.020" style="s2">figured oh here&#39;s where I could actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.410" end="01:47:02.940" style="s2">get something done and the ground was</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.020" end="01:47:05.130" style="s2">still not able to stay solid under you</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.940" end="01:47:06.420" style="s2">so I was kind of wondering now that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.130" end="01:47:07.860" style="s2">heard your kind of definition of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.420" end="01:47:10.320" style="s2">cult is kind of the meeting ground</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.860" end="01:47:14.310" style="s2">between a personal phenomenology and how</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.320" end="01:47:17.580" style="s2">the group can interact I think I can see</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.310" end="01:47:19.170" style="s2">why the words so bitch there but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.580" end="01:47:21.750" style="s2">this is wondering if any of the dama</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.170" end="01:47:26.940" style="s2">side conversations have kind of clicked</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.750" end="01:47:29.820" style="s2">with you and oh yeah yeah I you know I</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.940" end="01:47:32.720" style="s2">even kind of directly brought this up</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.820" end="01:47:39.210" style="s2">with verve a key during the bevery</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.720" end="01:47:43.080" style="s2">conversation we had with him and and you</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.210" end="01:47:45.240" style="s2">know the Dhamma side aspect I find very</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.080" end="01:47:48.410" style="s2">important and and perhaps what</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.240" end="01:47:51.530" style="s2">characterized that religious experience</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.410" end="01:47:53.940" style="s2">that I was relating to before cult for</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.530" end="01:47:57.720" style="s2">more than anything was this</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.940" end="01:48:01.050" style="s2">extraordinarily deep sense of the relief</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.720" end="01:48:03.540" style="s2">of Dhamma side that I was in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.050" end="01:48:07.920" style="s2">home and always had been home and could</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.540" end="01:48:14.490" style="s2">never not be home granted I eventually</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.920" end="01:48:18.060" style="s2">found myself not home and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.490" end="01:48:22.890" style="s2">that the the code for thing also played</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.060" end="01:48:26.130" style="s2">on this dhamma side aspect in that it</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.890" end="01:48:30.710" style="s2">was in some sense very much trying to</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.130" end="01:48:30.710" style="s2">make a home in the participatory</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.300" end="01:48:37.810" style="s2">and and in some sense remind people of</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.810" end="01:48:39.340" style="s2">the home that they are in in existing in</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.810" end="01:48:41.200" style="s2">the first place</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.340" end="01:48:42.880" style="s2">granted they were able to make use of</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.200" end="01:48:46.300" style="s2">that and kind of bend it towards</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.880" end="01:48:48.630" style="s2">specific goals especially given more</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.300" end="01:48:48.630" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.590" end="01:48:59.070" style="s2">as far as is Dom aside making people</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.130" end="01:49:01.530" style="s2">extraordinarily easy to to manipulate in</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.070" end="01:49:04.400" style="s2">this way III think that&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.530" end="01:49:07.500" style="s2">something that&#39;s very important as well</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.400" end="01:49:09.480" style="s2">and perhaps also relates to what I was I</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.500" end="01:49:11.639" style="s2">was saying there a moment ago about how</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.480" end="01:49:13.579" style="s2">how the meaning crisis has everyone</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.639" end="01:49:16.619" style="s2">viewing everyone else as being in a cult</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.579" end="01:49:19.949" style="s2">to begin with and in some sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.619" end="01:49:23.000" style="s2">almost like that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.949" end="01:49:27.030" style="s2">projection of the others down the side</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.000" end="01:49:30.539" style="s2">and how bizarrely there&#39;s almost this</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.030" end="01:49:33.719" style="s2">sense of alienation in our claiming of a</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.539" end="01:49:36.420" style="s2">group identity at all and then we seem</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.719" end="01:49:41.099" style="s2">to have a negative individualistic</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.420" end="01:49:45.719" style="s2">response to that in the disclaiming of</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.099" end="01:49:47.610" style="s2">of another&#39;s group identity well that</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.719" end="01:49:50.389" style="s2">was convoluted did that answer anything</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.610" end="01:49:52.829" style="s2">sorry yeah</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.389" end="01:49:55.949" style="s2">it really reminded me of something about</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.829" end="01:49:58.170" style="s2">the the way we our solutions we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.949" end="01:50:00.739" style="s2">fix on fix it on the solutions and later</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.170" end="01:50:04.409" style="s2">of course they become our problems so</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.739" end="01:50:05.439" style="s2">yeah that I can help help a lot so thank</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.409" end="01:50:06.960" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="01:50:46.929" end="01:50:55.870" style="s2">I&#39;ve laid down the rocks we&#39;re coming up</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.540" end="01:50:58.870" style="s2">to two two hours</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.870" end="01:51:02.929" style="s2">this has been just like absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.870" end="01:51:04.820" style="s2">fascinating and did you have anything</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.929" end="01:51:07.699" style="s2">else just on on this Nick that you</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.820" end="01:51:12.100" style="s2">wanted to wrap up with or or did you</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.699" end="01:51:12.100" style="s2">want to bring part one do it to a close</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.079" end="01:51:18.460" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to think it seems like this</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.570" end="01:51:20.530" style="s2">is a good place to leave off we went</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.460" end="01:51:22.329" style="s2">over the history we got to explore some</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.530" end="01:51:26.559" style="s2">ideas within the context of my</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.329" end="01:51:29.710" style="s2">experience I think it would be awkward</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.559" end="01:51:31.750" style="s2">to try and squeeze in the etymology of</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.710" end="01:51:38.050" style="s2">the word cult at this point and would</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.750" end="01:51:40.690" style="s2">leave it off on an awkward note so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.050" end="01:51:43.150" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t think I have much else to</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.690" end="01:51:46.090" style="s2">add here likewise I feel myself</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.150" end="01:51:49.090" style="s2">unraveling a bit after having spoken so</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.090" end="01:51:52.690" style="s2">much so I&#39;m not sure how much longer I</p>

<p begin="01:51:55.329" end="01:52:01.090" style="s2">what was said before that you really</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.880" end="01:52:02.949" style="s2">should write a book it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
