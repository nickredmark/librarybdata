<p begin="00:00:00.480" end="00:00:04.479" style="s2">so today I want to offer a book review</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.920" end="00:00:06.269" style="s2">of what I think is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.479" end="00:00:08.770" style="s2">important books that I&#39;ve ever read</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.269" end="00:00:10.360" style="s2">philosophy in the flesh the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.770" end="00:00:12.490" style="s2">mind and it&#39;s challenge to Western</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.360" end="00:00:15.580" style="s2">thought by George Lakoff and Mark</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.490" end="00:00:18.550" style="s2">Johnson this book is really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.580" end="00:00:21.730" style="s2">because it does a critique of the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.550" end="00:00:23.949" style="s2">2,000 years of philosophy through the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.730" end="00:00:26.339" style="s2">lens of contemporary cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.949" end="00:00:29.829" style="s2">so they take insights from linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.339" end="00:00:32.410" style="s2">psychology neuroscience anthropology and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.829" end="00:00:34.770" style="s2">other related fields and then they go</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.410" end="00:00:37.570" style="s2">back and reevaluate the foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.770" end="00:00:39.760" style="s2">philosophy over the last two millennia</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.570" end="00:00:42.370" style="s2">and one of the things that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.760" end="00:00:44.770" style="s2">powerful in this book is they introduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.370" end="00:00:47.170" style="s2">a concept that they call empirically</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.770" end="00:00:50.260" style="s2">responsible philosophy which basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.170" end="00:00:52.360" style="s2">means that for a philosophical idea to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.260" end="00:00:54.220" style="s2">be legitimate it has to be consistent</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.360" end="00:00:55.690" style="s2">with what we know from other domains of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.220" end="00:00:59.320" style="s2">knowledge but how the world actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.690" end="00:01:01.000" style="s2">works and so they go through and look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.320" end="00:01:04.600" style="s2">all the foundational concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.000" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">philosophy so causation time what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.600" end="00:01:10.720" style="s2">means to be a person morality the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:13.960" style="s2">concepts for self and other such things</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.720" end="00:01:17.229" style="s2">and they show that when we understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.960" end="00:01:19.870" style="s2">how the human mind works in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.229" end="00:01:21.490" style="s2">natural embodiment meaning that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.870" end="00:01:23.530" style="s2">kinds of minds we have are shaped by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.490" end="00:01:25.960" style="s2">kinds of brains we have the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.530" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">bodies we have and the kinds of social</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.960" end="00:01:29.530" style="s2">and physical environments we find</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.520" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">ourselves in that when we take this</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.530" end="00:01:33.549" style="s2">perspective which is now the established</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:35.650" style="s2">scientifically valid way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.549" end="00:01:37.750" style="s2">understanding the mind then we can go</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.650" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">back and critique the ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.750" end="00:01:43.390" style="s2">that have been developed over the last</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">2,000 years and find the kind of do a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.390" end="00:01:47.680" style="s2">separation of the wheat from the chaff</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:49.720" style="s2">showing which pieces are good and valid</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.680" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">and can still be kept and which ones</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.720" end="00:01:54.460" style="s2">need to be updated or modified to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:57.159" style="s2">reflect what we now know and what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.460" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">really love about this book is that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.159" end="00:02:03.850" style="s2">gives us a way of understanding what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:05.830" style="s2">universally true about the human</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.850" end="00:02:07.450" style="s2">condition meaning there are things about</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.830" end="00:02:09.340" style="s2">the way our brains work in our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.450" end="00:02:11.140" style="s2">the way that our bodies are structured</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.340" end="00:02:13.730" style="s2">that are universal for all human beings</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.140" end="00:02:16.819" style="s2">and how we can then use that as</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.730" end="00:02:19.730" style="s2">dation from which to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.819" end="00:02:22.190" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the world so one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.730" end="00:02:24.110" style="s2">the big discoveries of social science in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.190" end="00:02:25.970" style="s2">the 20th century was that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.110" end="00:02:28.250" style="s2">perspective that we take is always going</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.970" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">to have some level of subjectivity so</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.250" end="00:02:31.640" style="s2">there&#39;s always going to be some bias or</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">incompleteness from any particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.640" end="00:02:36.739" style="s2">viewpoint well that is a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:38.510" style="s2">critique of the philosophical traditions</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.739" end="00:02:40.970" style="s2">that assume it&#39;s possible to have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.510" end="00:02:44.060" style="s2">universal what&#39;s called a bird&#39;s-eye</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.970" end="00:02:46.790" style="s2">view to see how the world is outside of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.060" end="00:02:49.489" style="s2">a specific perspective turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.790" end="00:02:53.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible to do that but there</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.489" end="00:02:54.920" style="s2">are actually ways to take an approach to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.090" end="00:02:57.410" style="s2">building knowledge from within our</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.920" end="00:03:00.200" style="s2">perspectives and then validate them by</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.410" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">critique and argument and debate among</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.200" end="00:03:04.129" style="s2">other people who have slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.790" end="00:03:06.890" style="s2">perspectives in order to get at what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.129" end="00:03:08.750" style="s2">true and real and so this book answers</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.890" end="00:03:10.489" style="s2">that question and results at once and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.750" end="00:03:13.370" style="s2">for all so when you hear people talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.489" end="00:03:14.840" style="s2">about how there&#39;s this relativism and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.370" end="00:03:16.940" style="s2">that there are things that just can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.840" end="00:03:18.980" style="s2">known because we&#39;re always within a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.940" end="00:03:22.280" style="s2">subjective experience it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.980" end="00:03:23.590" style="s2">kind of a naive view of relativism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.280" end="00:03:27.109" style="s2">actually a more nuanced understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.590" end="00:03:29.630" style="s2">that lets us get back to what is real</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.109" end="00:03:31.579" style="s2">outside of our own perspectives but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.630" end="00:03:34.130" style="s2">can only get to it by going through our</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.579" end="00:03:36.500" style="s2">perspectives and then comparing with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.130" end="00:03:39.859" style="s2">perspectives of others around us and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.500" end="00:03:41.450" style="s2">this approach to philosophy is developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.859" end="00:03:44.299" style="s2">beautifully and powerfully in this book</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.450" end="00:03:46.519" style="s2">philosophy in the flesh which I really I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.299" end="00:03:49.190" style="s2">can&#39;t recommend this highly enough it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.519" end="00:03:51.049" style="s2">such a fantastic book for anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.190" end="00:03:53.530" style="s2">wants to understand how to create</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.049" end="00:03:57.049" style="s2">empirically responsible philosophies of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.530" end="00:03:59.870" style="s2">economics politics or other social</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.049" end="00:04:02.840" style="s2">theories and then use them for design of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.870" end="00:04:05.930" style="s2">say urban environments economic policy</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.840" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">social policy and so on and so forth so</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.930" end="00:04:09.349" style="s2">that&#39;s it I highly recommend this book</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:13.569" style="s2">philosophy in the flesh by George Lakoff</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.349" end="00:04:13.569" style="s2">in Mark Johnson enjoy</p>
