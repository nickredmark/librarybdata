<p begin="00:03:41.480" end="00:03:46.940" style="s2">modernized it in some sense because</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:49.700" style="s2">Freud viewed the human being as in some</p>

<p begin="00:04:01.790" end="00:04:09.080" style="s2">literature but we do all the time in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.060" end="00:04:10.610" style="s2">literature and drama and movies and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.080" end="00:04:13.220" style="s2">sort of representation is extra</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.220" end="00:04:18.530" style="s2">pay to watch it and it is very strange</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.860" end="00:04:20.870" style="s2">if you think about it because if the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.530" end="00:04:24.230" style="s2">spectre of pure destructiveness is laid</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.870" end="00:04:26.090" style="s2">out in front of you on a stage there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.230" end="00:04:27.710" style="s2">no logical reason to assume that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.090" end="00:04:29.960" style="s2">would voluntarily expose yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.710" end="00:04:34.460" style="s2">that to that and pay for the privilege</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.960" end="00:04:38.780" style="s2">of doing so but you do and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.460" end="00:04:41.270" style="s2">for that one of the reasons for that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.780" end="00:04:43.520" style="s2">that you need to know what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.270" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">personality is partly so you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:47.900" style="s2">recognize elements of it if they</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:52.430" style="s2">manifest themselves in front of you or</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.900" end="00:04:56.060" style="s2">within you and partly because you really</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.430" end="00:04:59.150" style="s2">can&#39;t understand good until you</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.060" end="00:05:02.390" style="s2">understand evil and so if you&#39;re ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.150" end="00:05:05.720" style="s2">wondering why why good itself seems to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.390" end="00:05:07.610" style="s2">be such a limited resource it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.720" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">worthwhile remembering that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.610" end="00:05:13.760" style="s2">get there without going somewhere you</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:17.090" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go first and so that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.090" end="00:05:23.180" style="s2">to start with a Shakespearean quote</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.680" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">seems appropriate from titus and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.180" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">dronicus which is a very violent play a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">play that&#39;s essentially about vengeance</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:37.340" style="s2">and one of Shakespeare&#39;s characters says</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.690" end="00:15:33.060" style="s2">in part from the analysis of the story</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:35.070" style="s2">of Cain and Abel in in in Genesis the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.060" end="00:15:36.570" style="s2">first story about real human beings is</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.070" end="00:15:38.220" style="s2">the story about Cain and Abel because</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.570" end="00:15:39.589" style="s2">Adam and Eve were made by God right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.220" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t really call them</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.589" end="00:15:47.399" style="s2">normal humans Cain and Abel are the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:51.450" style="s2">first humans and Cain is very resentful</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.399" end="00:15:54.420" style="s2">and deceitful and vengeful and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.450" end="00:15:56.940" style="s2">reason for that from which it&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.420" end="00:16:01.110" style="s2">explained in the story is that Cain</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.940" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">sacrifices aren&#39;t accepted by God now</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.110" end="00:16:04.709" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for modern people to</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:07.529" style="s2">understand what a sacrifice is because</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.709" end="00:16:10.500" style="s2">why why would you offer up to God</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.529" end="00:16:12.990" style="s2">some remnant of an animal for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.500" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">but you know people along while back</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.990" end="00:16:17.760" style="s2">acted things out before they could</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:19.320" style="s2">understand them and they had a more</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.760" end="00:16:21.420" style="s2">concrete view of the world I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.320" end="00:16:23.130" style="s2">assumed God was in the cosmos because if</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.420" end="00:16:24.870" style="s2">you look up in the night sky especially</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.130" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">if it&#39;s dark it overwhelms you you see</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.870" end="00:16:29.910" style="s2">the transcendent and the infinite and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:32.579" style="s2">it&#39;s the sensation and experience of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.910" end="00:16:35.160" style="s2">that that allows for the attribution of</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.579" end="00:16:36.839" style="s2">God and his dwelling place to the heaven</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.160" end="00:16:38.250" style="s2">so that&#39;s not so ridiculous because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.839" end="00:16:40.260" style="s2">do see the infinite when you&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.250" end="00:16:43.529" style="s2">under this guy at night in the dark and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.260" end="00:16:45.899" style="s2">if God&#39;s up there since smoke rises if</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.529" end="00:16:48.060" style="s2">you burn something while God can tell if</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.899" end="00:16:50.940" style="s2">what you&#39;re offering is of quality or</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.060" end="00:16:54.449" style="s2">not now we have the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.940" end="00:16:57.089" style="s2">equivalent which is I asked my students</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.449" end="00:16:58.680" style="s2">what sacrifices did your parents make so</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.089" end="00:17:00.540" style="s2">that you could go to university and of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.680" end="00:17:03.810" style="s2">course they can answer that and no time</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.540" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">flat and whether that sacrifice worked</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.810" end="00:17:07.650" style="s2">depends on how well the child does at</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:08.730" style="s2">university but what that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.650" end="00:17:10.980" style="s2">means is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.730" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">the sacrifice of the parents found favor</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.980" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">well with reality but you can substitute</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:19.170" style="s2">God for that with no loss of meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:24.030" style="s2">so modern people obviously believe that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.170" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">if you sacrifice properly then reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.030" end="00:17:29.220" style="s2">will shine its benevolent face on you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:31.290" style="s2">otherwise we wouldn&#39;t work so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.220" end="00:17:34.800" style="s2">so different from those archaic people</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.290" end="00:17:37.290" style="s2">now Cain makes sacrifices and God</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.800" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like them now the story&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.290" end="00:17:42.780" style="s2">ambivalent about why it might just be</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:44.670" style="s2">that God&#39;s arbitrary I mean it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.780" end="00:17:46.170" style="s2">no shortage of arbitrariness on the part</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.670" end="00:17:47.640" style="s2">of God in the Old Testament which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.170" end="00:17:49.500" style="s2">part of the reason that people have</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.640" end="00:17:51.720" style="s2">modern people have trouble with that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.500" end="00:17:54.540" style="s2">book because they say well I could never</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.720" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">believe in a God who&#39;s that arbitrary or</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.540" end="00:18:01.290" style="s2">even cruel but the ancient Israelites</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">weren&#39;t that foolish they knew that life</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.290" end="00:18:06.810" style="s2">could be that arbitrary and cruel no</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:09.180" style="s2">matter what you believe so it could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.810" end="00:18:11.970" style="s2">that god it just has it in for Cain or</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.180" end="00:18:14.100" style="s2">it could be that Cain is just not really</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.970" end="00:18:15.780" style="s2">offering up the best quality sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.100" end="00:18:18.090" style="s2">and so he&#39;s trying to pull one over on</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.780" end="00:18:21.570" style="s2">God and everyone else and in fact that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.090" end="00:18:24.900" style="s2">is what God accuses him of if you read</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.570" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">the story very carefully Cain is mad</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.900" end="00:18:31.110" style="s2">because Abel&#39;s getting everything and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:33.150" style="s2">everyone loves Abel lots of crops his</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.110" end="00:18:35.460" style="s2">flocks are flourishing all the girls</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.150" end="00:18:36.960" style="s2">love him plus he&#39;s a really good guy so</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.460" end="00:18:38.790" style="s2">you can&#39;t even hate him with good</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.960" end="00:18:42.750" style="s2">conscience which is extremely annoying</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.790" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">especially to Cain so King goes and has</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.750" end="00:18:46.740" style="s2">a chat with God he says what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:51.540" style="s2">stupid place have you made here</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.740" end="00:18:54.420" style="s2">he means reality I&#39;m like working myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.540" end="00:18:56.340" style="s2">to the bone and you know all I get is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.420" end="00:18:58.560" style="s2">the dregs and then there&#39;s old Abel out</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.340" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">there and you know everything he touches</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.560" end="00:19:03.780" style="s2">turns to gold what&#39;s up with you which</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">is kind of arrogant if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.780" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">it right because he is talking to God</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">after all it isn&#39;t clear that Cain</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:11.400" style="s2">understands everything about being and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:15.890" style="s2">there&#39;s always the possibility that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.400" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">Cain&#39;s fault - not gods but that isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.890" end="00:19:21.830" style="s2">hypothesis that Cain is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:24.919" style="s2">entertain so God says to him basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.830" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">sin which means to miss the bullseye by</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.919" end="00:19:33.019" style="s2">the way crouches at your doorstep like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:36.679" style="s2">predatory and sexually aroused hunting</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.019" end="00:19:39.769" style="s2">cat and you invited in and let it have</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.679" end="00:19:43.940" style="s2">its way with you by which he means not</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.769" end="00:19:47.330" style="s2">only is Cain attacked by sin so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.940" end="00:19:50.120" style="s2">but that it&#39;s a creative Union sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.330" end="00:19:51.769" style="s2">attack sin comes in and Cain plays with</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.120" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">it and develops it and puts his own</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.769" end="00:19:58.639" style="s2">twist on it he produces something new</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.990" end="00:20:00.289" style="s2">out of it it&#39;s obvious decane that God</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.639" end="00:20:01.669" style="s2">isn&#39;t willing to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.289" end="00:20:04.429" style="s2">the terrible state of being as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.669" end="00:20:07.549" style="s2">consequence of this accusation and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.429" end="00:20:10.309" style="s2">makes him extremely mad extremely mad</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.549" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">and he kills Abel</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.309" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">and then if you follow the story closely</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:18.620" style="s2">you can see that God tells everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:19.820" style="s2">to leave Cain alone don&#39;t don&#39;t kill him</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.620" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">and the reason for that is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.820" end="00:20:25.100" style="s2">a propensity for that kind of vengeful</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:26.600" style="s2">killing to expand exponentially out into</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.100" end="00:20:27.980" style="s2">the community which in fact is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.600" end="00:20:31.279" style="s2">happens in the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.980" end="00:20:34.220" style="s2">and the end the the last one of Cain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.279" end="00:20:37.639" style="s2">descendants named is actually tubal Cain</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.220" end="00:20:39.980" style="s2">and he is by tradition the first person</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.639" end="00:20:44.350" style="s2">who makes weapons of war so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.980" end="00:20:47.450" style="s2">that individual resentment manifested as</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.350" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">homicidal rage is the precondition for</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.450" end="00:20:52.159" style="s2">the spread of that mode of being into</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:54.039" style="s2">the broader community and the danger</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.159" end="00:20:58.570" style="s2">there is that will degenerate into</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.039" end="00:21:01.070" style="s2">everyone against everyone Harris</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.570" end="00:21:03.620" style="s2">moral is just another word and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.070" end="00:21:05.899" style="s2">I think we are all a waste of natural</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.620" end="00:21:07.970" style="s2">resources and should be killed off and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.899" end="00:21:10.340" style="s2">since humans have the ability to choose</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.970" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">and I&#39;m human I think I will choose to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.340" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">kill and damage as much as nature allows</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:17.929" style="s2">me so take that eat napalm and lead</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">someone&#39;s bound to say what were they</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.929" end="00:21:22.220" style="s2">thinking when we go natural-born killers</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.480" end="00:21:24.470" style="s2">or when we&#39;re planning it so this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.220" end="00:21:26.750" style="s2">what I&#39;m thinking I have a goal to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.470" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">destroy as much as possible so I must</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.750" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">not be sidetracked by my feelings of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:34.190" style="s2">sympathy mercy or any of that keep this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:35.539" style="s2">in mind I want to burn the world now</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.190" end="00:21:37.220" style="s2">part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.539" end="00:21:40.729" style="s2">and kills Abel is because Abel is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.220" end="00:21:43.729" style="s2">favored by God and so Cain is actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.729" end="00:21:45.889" style="s2">not only taking revenge against Abel and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.729" end="00:21:48.019" style="s2">against his own insufficiency and he</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.889" end="00:21:51.229" style="s2">gets suffering he&#39;s actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.019" end="00:21:55.249" style="s2">revenge against God and being itself and</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.229" end="00:21:57.649" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what he wants to do hate</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.249" end="00:21:59.359" style="s2">I&#39;m full of hate and I love it I want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.649" end="00:22:01.489" style="s2">grab some weak little freshmen and tear</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.359" end="00:22:04.279" style="s2">them apart like a wolf show them who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.540" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">thought as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.550" end="00:27:34.470" style="s2">Milton apparently liked Satan more than</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:36.810" style="s2">he liked any of the other characters in</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.470" end="00:27:39.240" style="s2">that and that amazingly weren&#39;t a modern</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.810" end="00:27:40.350" style="s2">interpretation why would that be modern</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.240" end="00:27:44.520" style="s2">and what do you mean by that well</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.350" end="00:27:46.530" style="s2">because Milton was a genius and the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.520" end="00:27:53.310" style="s2">he represented Satan in Paradise Lost</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.530" end="00:27:55.170" style="s2">was as a rebel and he didn&#39;t paint him</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.310" end="00:27:56.850" style="s2">in black and white so to speak he gave</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.170" end="00:28:01.050" style="s2">him all the attributes that an admirable</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.850" end="00:28:02.580" style="s2">rebel would have and people enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.050" end="00:28:06.030" style="s2">identifying with the figure of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.580" end="00:28:08.250" style="s2">admirable rebel but what&#39;s what Satan</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.030" end="00:28:10.710" style="s2">was rebelling against wasn&#39;t what an</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.250" end="00:28:12.300" style="s2">admirable rebel would rebel against he</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.710" end="00:28:15.630" style="s2">wasn&#39;t rebelling the way Christ say</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.300" end="00:28:16.590" style="s2">rebelled in his time against the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.630" end="00:28:18.750" style="s2">increasing</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.590" end="00:28:21.690" style="s2">tendency of the religious state to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.750" end="00:28:23.250" style="s2">become dogmatic and tyrannical Satan was</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.690" end="00:28:25.650" style="s2">rebelling against the idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.250" end="00:28:27.900" style="s2">was something that exceeded his power</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.650" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">and that was transcendent while human</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.900" end="00:28:31.159" style="s2">beings do that all the time especially</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:34.049" style="s2">modern human beings so the idea that</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.049" end="00:28:38.010" style="s2">think can&#39;t be placed at Milton&#39;s feet</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:40.289" style="s2">he opened the door to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.010" end="00:28:42.360" style="s2">interpretation and that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.289" end="00:28:44.779" style="s2">because part of for example the reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.360" end="00:28:47.370" style="s2">that these modes of thinking were so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.779" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">powerful and compelling to Harris was</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.370" end="00:28:54.779" style="s2">that they allowed him the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:29:00.200" style="s2">construing himself as an admirable rebel</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.779" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">even though what he was was a momentary</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.200" end="00:29:05.250" style="s2">embodiment of the eternal desire to</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.330" end="00:29:42.049" style="s2">Harris does a good job of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.049" end="00:29:45.299" style="s2">everyone knows that life is tragic and</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.080" end="00:30:15.330" style="s2">being then we should just eradicate the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.679" end="00:30:16.730" style="s2">whole mess and people think like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.330" end="00:30:20.190" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.730" end="00:30:23.070" style="s2">I&#39;m curious you work not only as an</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.190" end="00:30:25.380" style="s2">academic professor of psychology you</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.070" end="00:30:29.100" style="s2">also have a practice you have a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.380" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">practice is there any possible use for</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.100" end="00:30:32.550" style="s2">these great icon</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:34.440" style="s2">of Western or Eastern any literature</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.550" end="00:30:38.190" style="s2">which all have in them as you say the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.440" end="00:30:41.670" style="s2">sort of balance or opposition of good</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.190" end="00:30:43.380" style="s2">and evil is there any possible clinical</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.670" end="00:30:45.540" style="s2">use for that oh if you see people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.380" end="00:30:48.360" style="s2">are really in trouble like really in</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.540" end="00:30:51.180" style="s2">trouble you can&#39;t address their problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.360" end="00:30:53.460" style="s2">without using archetypal language it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.180" end="00:30:57.720" style="s2">not possible so for example I had a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.460" end="00:30:59.910" style="s2">client who lived in a web of lies that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.720" end="00:31:01.350" style="s2">was pretty much infinite I tried for</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.910" end="00:31:03.660" style="s2">years to get to the bottom of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.350" end="00:31:06.590" style="s2">familial lies the lie was we love you</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.660" end="00:31:09.420" style="s2">and we&#39;re helping you when the truth was</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.590" end="00:31:10.940" style="s2">you should have been born a boy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.420" end="00:31:13.140" style="s2">we&#39;ve hated you ever since you were born</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.940" end="00:31:14.160" style="s2">but we&#39;re not going to tell you that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.140" end="00:31:15.630" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna let anyone else know</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.160" end="00:31:19.350" style="s2">that because we need a facade of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.630" end="00:31:21.210" style="s2">benevolence now and for her this person</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.350" end="00:31:23.670" style="s2">to even begin to understand what was</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.210" end="00:31:26.550" style="s2">going on in her family there was no</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.670" end="00:31:28.740" style="s2">escaping archetypal language I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.550" end="00:31:31.920" style="s2">was hellish people died in that house</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.740" end="00:31:33.210" style="s2">and I made very little headway every</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.920" end="00:31:37.320" style="s2">time I got to the bottom of some</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.210" end="00:31:40.290" style="s2">absolutely horrendous betrayal betrayers</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.320" end="00:31:42.510" style="s2">were in Dante&#39;s Inferno they were right</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.290" end="00:31:45.150" style="s2">in the center of Hell right they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.510" end="00:31:47.870" style="s2">the worst of the criminal so to speak I</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.150" end="00:31:52.260" style="s2">get to the bottom of some god-awful</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.870" end="00:31:53.880" style="s2">decades-long brilliantly played betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.260" end="00:31:56.730" style="s2">and there&#39;d be another one at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.880" end="00:31:59.100" style="s2">of that I was wondering specifically</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.730" end="00:32:02.370" style="s2">though whether you&#39;d actually used texts</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.100" end="00:32:03.960" style="s2">in in conversation or patients yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.370" end="00:32:06.210" style="s2">you have talked about farce or you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.960" end="00:32:08.670" style="s2">lots of my patients have come from</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.210" end="00:32:12.020" style="s2">religious backgrounds I mean one of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.670" end="00:32:15.720" style="s2">was a relatively unsuccessful chaplain</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.020" end="00:32:18.420" style="s2">who was suddenly fired from her job and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.720" end="00:32:22.380" style="s2">then was hit by a car so that wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.420" end="00:32:25.740" style="s2">good day um all in one day yes yes and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.380" end="00:32:27.510" style="s2">there was just there was no escaping the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.740" end="00:32:29.100" style="s2">religious dimension I mean the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.510" end="00:32:31.560" style="s2">about religious the religious dimension</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.100" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">sits at the bottom of life I mean people</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.560" end="00:32:34.710" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that they think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.170" style="s2">set of superstitions it&#39;s like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.710" end="00:32:38.580" style="s2">a set of superstitions or if it is then</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.170" end="00:32:40.620" style="s2">you might ask yourself a why do you</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.580" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">continue to go see it played out time</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.620" end="00:32:44.669" style="s2">and time again on stage</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:47.220" style="s2">is what are you just entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.669" end="00:32:48.600" style="s2">yourself it&#39;s like you&#39;re not whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.220" end="00:32:51.450" style="s2">you know it or not you&#39;re educating</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.600" end="00:32:53.220" style="s2">yourself you&#39;re seeing near archetypal</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.220" end="00:32:59.549" style="s2">elements of human behavior laid out for</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.890" end="00:33:00.750" style="s2">you by geniuses dramatically and part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.549" end="00:33:03.870" style="s2">the reason that you get the information</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">that way is that no you&#39;re not smart</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.870" end="00:33:09.480" style="s2">enough to understand it abstractly and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">neither is anyone else it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.480" end="00:33:14.760" style="s2">complicated that even now all we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:16.470" style="s2">really do is see it played out it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.760" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">difficult for us to transform that into</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.470" end="00:33:22.770" style="s2">fully articulated philosophy it took me</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:25.020" style="s2">15 years of work three hours a day to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.770" end="00:33:27.059" style="s2">develop the ideas that and really like</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.020" end="00:33:32.340" style="s2">that was every day I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.059" end="00:33:34.860" style="s2">this obsessively for four decades and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.340" end="00:33:36.990" style="s2">took me that long to reach the level of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.860" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">articulation where I could tell the sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.990" end="00:33:41.820" style="s2">of story I told today it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:43.860" style="s2">complicated material and so it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.820" end="00:33:46.230" style="s2">predicated on the idea which which I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.860" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">believe to be true is that reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.230" end="00:33:53.640" style="s2">itself is a forum for action it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:55.260" style="s2">place of objective things and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.640" end="00:33:57.870" style="s2">that I also believe that if you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.870" end="00:34:03.059" style="s2">because Darwin believed that we are</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.059" end="00:34:07.950" style="s2">of our actions and so our actions are</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.429" end="00:34:15.510" style="s2">well actions have patterns we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.530" end="00:34:17.460" style="s2">character we have a nature that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.510" end="00:34:18.990" style="s2">you can that&#39;s why dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.460" end="00:34:21.060" style="s2">representations can be distributed</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.990" end="00:34:23.730" style="s2">worldwide and everyone understands them</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.060" end="00:34:26.190" style="s2">and they understand them in some sense</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.190" end="00:34:31.800" style="s2">remember I showed Pinocchio to my son</p>

<p begin="00:34:31.800" end="00:34:37.560" style="s2">story about confronting chaos and</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.370" end="00:35:23.160" style="s2">because you know what should you show</p>

<p begin="00:35:29.850" end="00:35:37.710" style="s2">you do is launch them out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.410" end="00:35:39.810" style="s2">like like edible prey it&#39;s a bad idea so</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.500" end="00:36:21.120" style="s2">right right before our eyes and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:37:08.950" end="00:37:13.690" style="s2">and sociological and until I got to the</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.510" end="00:38:40.930" style="s2">know and I don&#39;t think you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:43.030" style="s2">understand it until you understand</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.110" end="00:38:52.180" style="s2">about this line of investigation is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.950" end="00:38:54.010" style="s2">that part exists and you could</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.180" end="00:38:59.740" style="s2">understand it but you probably won&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.010" end="00:39:03.790" style="s2">it&#39;s no bloody wonder so when I started</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.740" end="00:39:06.190" style="s2">the psychological investigation I read a</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.790" end="00:39:08.950" style="s2">lot of mythology a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.190" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">comparative religion and see the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:12.820" style="s2">religious stories are the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:18.070" style="s2">narratives you know they sort of if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.820" end="00:39:20.950" style="s2">think of behavior or or drama as having</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.070" end="00:39:22.570" style="s2">a grammar the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.950" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">grammar of behavior and drama is</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.570" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">religious and the reason it&#39;s related</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:30.760" style="s2">it&#39;s religious because it&#39;s the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:32.710" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t go any deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.760" end="00:39:35.079" style="s2">that that&#39;s how things are like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.710" end="00:39:38.650" style="s2">human being the archetypal human being</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.079" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">is a hero voluntarily confronting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.650" end="00:39:43.329" style="s2">unknown that&#39;s what we are and if we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:39:43.329" end="00:39:47.290" style="s2">is not a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.579" end="00:39:48.369" style="s2">it&#39;s also something that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.290" end="00:39:51.070" style="s2">this is what&#39;s really interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.369" end="00:39:53.380" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying I would would say and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.070" end="00:39:56.859" style="s2">I may be mischaracterizing civilization</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.380" end="00:40:00.310" style="s2">or 20th century political reality but</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.859" end="00:40:01.780" style="s2">many people I think given the fact you</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.310" end="00:40:03.550" style="s2">say it&#39;s a fact and I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.780" end="00:40:05.950" style="s2">grounded in something really archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.550" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">and perhaps really just really basic DNA</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.950" end="00:40:11.859" style="s2">there&#39;s evil and there&#39;s good most</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:15.310" style="s2">people would want to say okay let&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.859" end="00:40:17.079" style="s2">on getting rid of evil and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.310" end="00:40:18.820" style="s2">good luck I think you&#39;re saying no</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.079" end="00:40:20.349" style="s2">that&#39;s not what you have to do oh no I</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.820" end="00:40:22.060" style="s2">think that is what you have to do but</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.349" end="00:40:24.730" style="s2">you don&#39;t do it by getting rid of other</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.060" end="00:40:26.500" style="s2">people&#39;s evil you get you do it by</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.730" end="00:40:28.060" style="s2">getting rid of your own like I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.500" end="00:40:31.180" style="s2">you an experiment you can try this is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.060" end="00:40:34.180" style="s2">great experiment try not to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.180" end="00:40:35.950" style="s2">that isn&#39;t true for a month you know and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.180" end="00:40:38.170" style="s2">you say well what about white lies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.950" end="00:40:39.609" style="s2">like well you know that&#39;s your problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.170" end="00:40:41.380" style="s2">you see if you can figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.609" end="00:40:43.420" style="s2">tell so you know you might say your wife</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.380" end="00:40:45.400" style="s2">says how do I look in this dress and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.420" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">know you don&#39;t think she looks very good</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.400" end="00:40:49.240" style="s2">and so you say you look great honey and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:50.500" style="s2">that&#39;s real good but that isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.240" end="00:40:52.660" style="s2">right answer the right answer is</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.500" end="00:40:55.630" style="s2">something like don&#39;t ask me manipulative</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.660" end="00:40:58.810" style="s2">questions yeah I know that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.630" end="00:41:00.579" style="s2">look it&#39;s a little harsh a and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.810" end="00:41:02.200" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t actually formulate it that way</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.579" end="00:41:03.730" style="s2">I would say well you know I don&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.200" end="00:41:06.369" style="s2">questions like that or something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.730" end="00:41:07.900" style="s2">that so the truth wouldn&#39;t be that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.369" end="00:41:10.210" style="s2">know you look hideous in that dress and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.900" end="00:41:13.210" style="s2">only a [ __ ] would wear it that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.210" end="00:41:15.460" style="s2">not the truth you know the truth is more</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.210" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">sophisticated than that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.460" end="00:41:18.910" style="s2">people are telling lies all the time to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:20.410" style="s2">spare other people&#39;s feelings and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.910" end="00:41:23.069" style="s2">have all sorts of good reasons for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.410" end="00:41:27.550" style="s2">like there are no good reasons for life</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.069" end="00:41:29.740" style="s2">you pollute your speech by lying and one</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.550" end="00:41:31.780" style="s2">of the most fundamental presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.740" end="00:41:33.910" style="s2">of Western culture and this is I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.780" end="00:41:34.770" style="s2">the most perhaps the most brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.910" end="00:41:37.190" style="s2">disguise</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.770" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">we&#39;re human beings ever made is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.190" end="00:41:45.270" style="s2">chaos is transformed into order by the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">word and you are all speakers of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.270" end="00:41:51.270" style="s2">word and if you want chaos to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:53.250" style="s2">transformed into hell then lie if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.270" end="00:41:56.820" style="s2">want chaos to be transformed into heaven</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.250" end="00:42:01.620" style="s2">then tell the truth fighting evil does</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.820" end="00:42:03.180" style="s2">matter but it&#39;s not corporations you</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.620" end="00:42:06.180" style="s2">know some of them are evil obviously</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.180" end="00:42:08.010" style="s2">some of them aren&#39;t you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.180" end="00:42:09.780" style="s2">corporations it&#39;s not socio political</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.010" end="00:42:15.780" style="s2">structures none of those things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.780" end="00:42:17.910" style="s2">like fix up your speech fix up your</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.780" end="00:42:20.190" style="s2">family and then if you can manage that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.910" end="00:42:22.230" style="s2">which is very difficult then maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.190" end="00:42:24.810" style="s2">could dare to start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.230" end="00:42:26.970" style="s2">something more complex than the family</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.810" end="00:42:28.530" style="s2">level of organization you know I see</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.970" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">students all the time whose lives are</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.530" end="00:42:32.610" style="s2">they&#39;re a god-awful mess you know and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:33.960" style="s2">they&#39;re out protesting about something</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.610" end="00:42:40.530" style="s2">that&#39;s destroying the world it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.960" end="00:42:43.070" style="s2">well if we put you in charge well you</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.530" end="00:42:44.940" style="s2">have to decide what you&#39;re up to and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.070" end="00:42:47.640" style="s2">you&#39;re either trying to make things</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.940" end="00:42:50.040" style="s2">better or worse that&#39;s it those are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.640" end="00:42:52.440" style="s2">options and if you&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.040" end="00:42:53.430" style="s2">them worse there&#39;s reason that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.440" end="00:42:56.460" style="s2">trying to make them better there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.430" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">reason and so in some sense you decide</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.460" end="00:43:02.510" style="s2">which side you&#39;re on and then then you</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:06.740" style="s2">decide how much you&#39;re on that side and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.510" end="00:43:10.350" style="s2">a huge part of being on that side is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.740" end="00:43:12.390" style="s2">truth it&#39;s the fundamental virtue</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.350" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">without truth you don&#39;t know where you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.390" end="00:43:16.530" style="s2">are you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing you</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know who you are and the only</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.530" end="00:43:20.010" style="s2">reason you think you can get away with</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.450" end="00:43:29.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like clear okay go ahead see what</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.570" end="00:43:32.070" style="s2">happens it&#39;s like the outcome will not</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.700" end="00:43:42.870" style="s2">would so you know it&#39;s a fool&#39;s victory</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.830" end="00:43:45.330" style="s2">first question from the audience do</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.870" end="00:43:47.370" style="s2">people tend to take from plays views</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.330" end="00:43:48.510" style="s2">that reinforce their own position even</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.370" end="00:43:50.070" style="s2">when the play expresses</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.510" end="00:43:52.110" style="s2">country oh that&#39;s a good that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.070" end="00:43:54.660" style="s2">good question art and literature truly</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.110" end="00:43:57.300" style="s2">subversive and in the in you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.660" end="00:43:59.940" style="s2">because first of all if it&#39;s art it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.300" end="00:44:02.730" style="s2">not propaganda because if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.940" end="00:44:04.860" style="s2">propaganda then that&#39;s a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.730" end="00:44:06.840" style="s2">attempt to change the way you think or</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.860" end="00:44:08.220" style="s2">look but if it&#39;s art then what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.840" end="00:44:09.180" style="s2">happening is the artist is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.220" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">figure something out</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.180" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">well he or she is engaged in the act of</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:19.680" style="s2">artistic production and then the art</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:22.470" style="s2">object is the result of that exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.680" end="00:44:23.870" style="s2">attempt and the thing about exploring</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.470" end="00:44:25.830" style="s2">with art is you&#39;re always exploring</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.870" end="00:44:27.690" style="s2">things that you don&#39;t know because</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.830" end="00:44:29.940" style="s2">otherwise why would you be exploring and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.690" end="00:44:32.490" style="s2">so part of the reason that art is</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.940" end="00:44:34.920" style="s2">subversive is because it exists on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.490" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">border between articulated knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.920" end="00:44:39.950" style="s2">the unknown itself like it&#39;s the place</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:42.710" style="s2">where articulated knowledge is born and</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.950" end="00:44:45.720" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to criticize art</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.710" end="00:44:47.610" style="s2">right I mean you could say well one</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.720" end="00:44:50.010" style="s2">painting is better than another but like</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.610" end="00:44:52.980" style="s2">what I mean by that is even nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.010" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">punk rockers like music right music</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.980" end="00:44:57.300" style="s2">seeps in it&#39;s like music helps them</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:44:59.250" style="s2">celebrate life to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.300" end="00:45:01.800" style="s2">nihilistic punk rockers are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.250" end="00:45:03.840" style="s2">doing that and they won&#39;t criticize the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.800" end="00:45:05.640" style="s2">music like maybe they don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.840" end="00:45:07.380" style="s2">lyrics or whatever but you&#39;re just an</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.640" end="00:45:11.550" style="s2">idiot if you criticize music as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.380" end="00:45:13.650" style="s2">phenomenological entity like dance is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.550" end="00:45:15.480" style="s2">the same way these things are in some</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.650" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">sense they&#39;re beyond criticism because</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.480" end="00:45:16.910" style="s2">you actually don&#39;t know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.910" end="00:45:23.220" style="s2">so yeah art is really subversive or</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">transformative you know but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.220" end="00:45:29.190" style="s2">same thing this is a question that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:33.720" style="s2">brings us right up to the present day I</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.190" end="00:45:36.410" style="s2">suppose what should be done in Gaza how</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.720" end="00:45:39.600" style="s2">do we look at that conflict properly I</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.410" end="00:45:40.860" style="s2">don&#39;t have an answer for that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.600" end="00:45:43.470" style="s2">think there&#39;s anything I can do about</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.860" end="00:45:45.780" style="s2">Gaza or alternatively I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.470" end="00:45:50.370" style="s2">everything I can about Gaza by talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.780" end="00:45:52.080" style="s2">to you here today and my conclusion was</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.370" end="00:45:55.170" style="s2">as I mentioned before when I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.080" end="00:45:57.630" style="s2">to figure out what level of analysis was</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.170" end="00:46:00.060" style="s2">appropriate to conceptualize the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.630" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">greatest of moral problems so Gaza</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.060" end="00:46:04.980" style="s2">situation is a good example of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:08.040" style="s2">I always ended up at the individual</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.980" end="00:46:10.829" style="s2">level so I would say if you want to help</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.040" end="00:46:13.530" style="s2">the situation in Gaza be more truthful</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.829" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">with your spouse and you&#39;d think well</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.530" end="00:46:17.400" style="s2">how can that be connected but I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.839" end="00:46:18.780" style="s2">you how it&#39;s connected you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.400" end="00:46:21.990" style="s2">more connected to other people than you</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.780" end="00:46:23.849" style="s2">think so you know we don&#39;t live in</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.990" end="00:46:26.430" style="s2">linear relationships with one another we</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.849" end="00:46:28.440" style="s2">live in networked relationships so each</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.430" end="00:46:30.599" style="s2">of you is connected for example pretty</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.440" end="00:46:32.309" style="s2">directly to about a thousand people over</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.599" end="00:46:34.410" style="s2">the course of your life thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.309" end="00:46:37.380" style="s2">it&#39;s more than that probably but then</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.410" end="00:46:40.230" style="s2">you think well you are connected to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.380" end="00:46:42.450" style="s2">thousand so that&#39;s a million so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.230" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">one person away from a million people</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.450" end="00:46:47.819" style="s2">and then those thousand thousand no a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">thousands and so you&#39;re two people away</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.819" end="00:46:51.960" style="s2">from a billion people and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:53.970" style="s2">thing that&#39;s interesting about a network</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.960" end="00:46:56.760" style="s2">is that it has as many centers as there</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.970" end="00:46:58.500" style="s2">are nodes and one of the this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.760" end="00:47:01.650" style="s2">something Solzhenitsyn made explicit but</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.500" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">one of the implicit presuppositions of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.650" end="00:47:06.839" style="s2">the judeo-christian tradition is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:08.339" style="s2">each soul is a center of the cosmos you</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.839" end="00:47:11.250" style="s2">think what can that be true it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.339" end="00:47:12.930" style="s2">god only knows what&#39;s true what we know</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.250" end="00:47:15.180" style="s2">about consciousness you could put in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.930" end="00:47:17.790" style="s2">thimble we know nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.180" end="00:47:20.040" style="s2">consciousness we haven&#39;t advanced in our</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.790" end="00:47:22.380" style="s2">understanding fact we may have gone</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.040" end="00:47:23.730" style="s2">backwards over the last 400 years like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.380" end="00:47:26.069" style="s2">mean we know nothing about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.730" end="00:47:28.349" style="s2">relationship of the brain to conscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.069" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">awareness or virtually nothing bits and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.349" end="00:47:31.349" style="s2">pieces here and there</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:33.809" style="s2">consciousness is an absolute mystery and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.349" end="00:47:35.670" style="s2">god only knows where it came from or</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.809" end="00:47:37.079" style="s2">what it&#39;s up to I mean we we know some</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.670" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">things about human being we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.079" end="00:47:42.569" style="s2">fundamentally explorers of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:44.819" style="s2">that&#39;s how we&#39;re built we take things</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.569" end="00:47:46.290" style="s2">apart and put them together and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.819" end="00:47:50.369" style="s2">when we communicate the results of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.290" end="00:47:52.200" style="s2">and we find pleasure in that but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.369" end="00:47:53.130" style="s2">underestimate the utility of getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.200" end="00:47:56.910" style="s2">your life together</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.130" end="00:47:58.319" style="s2">I mean besides you can do that besides</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.910" end="00:47:59.490" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to hurt anyone if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.319" end="00:48:02.760" style="s2">do that you&#39;ll just make things better</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.490" end="00:48:04.890" style="s2">plus it&#39;s kind of humble it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.760" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">can sweep underneath your bed you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.890" end="00:48:09.510" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to go out and wave a</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:14.490" style="s2">placard around I&#39;m against poverty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.510" end="00:48:16.980" style="s2">like who&#39;s for poverty you know so</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.490" end="00:48:19.350" style="s2">I think you want to fix the world fix</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.980" end="00:48:20.910" style="s2">your life it&#39;s a lot harder than you</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.350" end="00:48:22.440" style="s2">think right it says in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.910" end="00:48:25.410" style="s2">it&#39;s harder to rule yourself than to</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.440" end="00:48:27.540" style="s2">rule the city but why well it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.410" end="00:48:28.650" style="s2">you&#39;re more complicated than a city it</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.540" end="00:48:30.780" style="s2">also turns out that you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.650" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">important in some sense than a city and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.780" end="00:48:35.340" style="s2">it also turns out to matter what you do</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:37.380" style="s2">with your life not it matters for you</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.340" end="00:48:39.210" style="s2">and it matters for everyone else and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.380" end="00:48:41.369" style="s2">probably matters for the destiny of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.210" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">being I mean that&#39;s what it means in</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.369" end="00:48:45.360" style="s2">some sense to be made in God&#39;s image and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">you know you think well I don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.360" end="00:48:48.660" style="s2">that stuff very seriously it&#39;s like your</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:51.119" style="s2">whole legal system is predicated on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.660" end="00:48:53.550" style="s2">idea so don&#39;t you say and you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.119" end="00:48:55.350" style="s2">it seriously you know you you presume</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.550" end="00:48:57.869" style="s2">that you have intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.350" end="00:49:00.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a presupposition right well what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.869" end="00:49:02.970" style="s2">intrinsic value mean it&#39;s grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.540" end="00:49:04.770" style="s2">something it&#39;s transcendent value and</p>

<p begin="00:49:24.710" end="00:49:31.460" style="s2">so take it</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.710" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">this is back to Michael to Eric Harris</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.460" end="00:49:36.599" style="s2">what parenting or educational practices</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:38.519" style="s2">help to develop such extreme arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.599" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">is displayed by somebody like Eric</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.519" end="00:49:47.009" style="s2">Harris it&#39;s not self-evident that it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">parenting per se that produced Harris</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.009" end="00:49:53.450" style="s2">you know and I would hesitate to lay</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:56.670" style="s2">responsibility at his parents feet</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.450" end="00:49:57.869" style="s2">people make choices and this is a rough</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.670" end="00:49:59.460" style="s2">one day because we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.869" end="00:50:01.259" style="s2">science for that because the science</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.460" end="00:50:03.059" style="s2">says well it&#39;s got to be causal in some</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.259" end="00:50:05.130" style="s2">factor so you look at sociological or</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.059" end="00:50:08.700" style="s2">economic causes and you know there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.130" end="00:50:10.769" style="s2">these deterministic events on the social</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.700" end="00:50:12.630" style="s2">side and on the natural side nature and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.769" end="00:50:17.880" style="s2">nurture that&#39;s all you are is nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:19.579" style="s2">nurture it&#39;s like well maybe not euros</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.880" end="00:50:23.249" style="s2">actually nature nurture and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.579" end="00:50:25.259" style="s2">consciousness and consciousness seems to</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.249" end="00:50:30.599" style="s2">be able to make choices and the choices</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.259" end="00:50:33.299" style="s2">seem to matter so you can come from a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.599" end="00:50:35.069" style="s2">pretty wretched family and a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.299" end="00:50:37.349" style="s2">wretched social circumstance where</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.069" end="00:50:41.989" style="s2">absolutely everything is stacked against</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.349" end="00:50:44.700" style="s2">you and come out pretty damn good</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.989" end="00:50:47.450" style="s2">most people who abuse their children</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.700" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">were abused as children</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.450" end="00:50:53.430" style="s2">causal right well know most people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">were abused as children don&#39;t abuse</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.430" end="00:50:59.489" style="s2">their children the causality only works</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:01.349" style="s2">when you go from the abuse back okay so</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.489" end="00:51:03.619" style="s2">that the pool of abuse people is high</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.349" end="00:51:06.359" style="s2">most of them don&#39;t abuse their children</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.619" end="00:51:08.670" style="s2">but if you look at child abusers small</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.359" end="00:51:10.019" style="s2">pool most of them were abused but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.670" end="00:51:13.109" style="s2">not talking about the whole continuum</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.019" end="00:51:14.910" style="s2">most people who were abused don&#39;t abuse</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.109" end="00:51:17.549" style="s2">and men you know that because if they</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.910" end="00:51:20.460" style="s2">did think about it if they did it would</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.549" end="00:51:22.470" style="s2">spread exponentially and then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.460" end="00:51:24.269" style="s2">would be being raised by seriously</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.470" end="00:51:25.799" style="s2">violent abusive parents and it would</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.269" end="00:51:27.089" style="s2">take no time at all I can take a few</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.799" end="00:51:29.160" style="s2">generations and poof</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.089" end="00:51:31.710" style="s2">everyone would be a violent abuser it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.160" end="00:51:34.619" style="s2">like that doesn&#39;t happen so weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.710" end="00:51:37.319" style="s2">enough the horrors of history don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.619" end="00:51:38.940" style="s2">necessarily accumulate and become</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.319" end="00:51:39.860" style="s2">transferred and I&#39;ve seen this in my own</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.940" end="00:51:41.990" style="s2">practice like I</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.860" end="00:51:44.360" style="s2">one client who she had a pretty nasty</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.990" end="00:51:45.980" style="s2">upbringing her mother pretty much did</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.360" end="00:51:49.510" style="s2">everything she possibly could to make</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.980" end="00:51:55.070" style="s2">sure that she had no real</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.510" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">self-confidence and what she learned</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.070" end="00:51:59.150" style="s2">from that was not to do that to her son</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.960" end="00:52:02.110" style="s2">and she raised an excellent son it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.150" end="00:52:04.610" style="s2">like she had every reason to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.110" end="00:52:06.050" style="s2">perpetuate her misery as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.610" end="00:52:07.670" style="s2">of resentment and she has some</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.050" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">resentment and it&#39;s not surprising but</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.670" end="00:52:12.110" style="s2">she swore man I&#39;m gonna not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:14.300" style="s2">going to do this to my son and she did a</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.110" end="00:52:17.240" style="s2">great job like I know her can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.300" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">well and he&#39;s uh she didn&#39;t over protect</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.240" end="00:52:22.910" style="s2">him that&#39;s pretty good he tells the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:24.230" style="s2">truth he&#39;s he&#39;s on a career you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.910" end="00:52:26.510" style="s2">he&#39;s got his career going</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.230" end="00:52:29.170" style="s2">he&#39;s a straightforward young guy and he</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.510" end="00:52:32.330" style="s2">likes his mom you know so good deal but</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.170" end="00:52:33.650" style="s2">account for that causally the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.330" end="00:52:38.180" style="s2">and this is something Nietzsche observed</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.650" end="00:52:41.240" style="s2">a long time ago any event can produce</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.180" end="00:52:45.490" style="s2">multiple causal pathways well not any</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.240" end="00:52:48.740" style="s2">event but you know any complex event so</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.490" end="00:52:53.800" style="s2">determinism I think the world is too</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.740" end="00:52:53.800" style="s2">complicated to be deterministic so</p>
