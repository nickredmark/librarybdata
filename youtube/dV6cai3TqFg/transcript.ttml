<p begin="00:00:00.230" end="00:00:05.940" style="s2">so after my last comment on that 69</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.840" end="00:00:06.990" style="s2">should have had a different app of</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.940" end="00:00:09.360" style="s2">course that&#39;s where my brain wind</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.990" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">because sometimes it goes there and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.360" end="00:00:14.700" style="s2">think although many of these I actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:15.990" style="s2">think a lot of Internet spaces one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.700" end="00:00:17.250" style="s2">the things that&#39;s my pet peeve and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.990" end="00:00:20.060" style="s2">maybe I need to look into your ears too</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.250" end="00:00:22.109" style="s2">why that is but one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.060" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">don&#39;t like a lot of the stuff that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.109" end="00:00:26.580" style="s2">there is the misogyny and the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">this out there turned all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.580" end="00:00:33.930" style="s2">just unsafe sex the sex turban spaces</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:37.309" style="s2">where men feel it&#39;s their right to send</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">you dick pics and you have it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.309" end="00:00:44.070" style="s2">ends up being almost violent and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:47.010" style="s2">like it but this one people make facts</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">about it one of the things I do like</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.010" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">this isn&#39;t my idea but I do think it</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:00:54.180" style="s2">needs you need to find a way to implant</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:57.270" style="s2">it&#39;s something similar on any site where</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.180" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">you have crowdsourcing its periscope</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:03.570" style="s2">which is a live streaming site if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">don&#39;t know it and I love the technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.570" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">I love that you can live stream and have</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">people comment and I mean like anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">that&#39;s online but whenever you watch a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">woman well the women I&#39;ve watched doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">it there&#39;s always people that comment</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">like take off your shirt like just I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">need appropriate sexual comment and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s very obvious not very</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">obvious more indicated that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:33.689" style="s2">welcome to the person speaking based on</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">how she reacts based on her demeanor and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.689" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">it just if you&#39;re talking about finance</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:41.509" style="s2">clearly not if you are wearing a low-cut</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">top and positioning the camera on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.509" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">may be so he&#39;s so happy and knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">so so when there is an offensive comment</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">so just like in anything if someone says</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s offensive it then pops up in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">bunch of the people watching the screens</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">and that like is this offensive so its</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">crowdsourcing in the policing which I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">love and I think that needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">more I think that Facebook with its</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">banning of breastfeeding</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:10.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like someone tags it for nudity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:12.569" style="s2">and when it could be like okay is this</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.530" end="00:02:12.960" style="s2">the fort what forms of nudity that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.569" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">allowed</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.960" end="00:02:17.250" style="s2">here or if you wanted more of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">algorithm type but still crowdsourcing</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.250" end="00:02:21.630" style="s2">cuz it need to come up and ask you that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">or more of like YouTube where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.630" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">started non-monetary only could have</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:28.050" style="s2">known if they&#39;ve ever monetized sites</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:30.300" style="s2">that they raid um</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.050" end="00:02:31.790" style="s2">channels that they were whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.300" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">listing on his YouTube channel stopped</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.790" end="00:02:39.750" style="s2">an episode on the YouTube we like an an</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:43.170" style="s2">upload once it&#39;s been flagged as like</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.750" end="00:02:44.820" style="s2">mature content and they don&#39;t get they</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">don&#39;t get much money on it cuz there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.820" end="00:02:48.300" style="s2">no advertising and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">things that are mature context that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.300" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be mature content like is this</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">LGBT related and not like if it was an</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:02:58.070" style="s2">LGBT related would it still need to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:03:00.540" style="s2">to be mature content cuz if you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.070" end="00:03:01.950" style="s2">talking about blowjobs in one way and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.540" end="00:03:04.320" style="s2">then talking about blowjobs in the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.950" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">way is if you&#39;re talking about feeling</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.320" end="00:03:09.420" style="s2">safe in your own skin that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">thirteen-year-old should have access to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.420" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">and people creating that content should</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">have just as much means to make the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">money on it as anyone else as people you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:26.580" style="s2">know giving makeup tips or power jitan</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:28.890" style="s2">so I think a crowd-sourced policing Pro</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.580" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">online policing program is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.890" end="00:03:35.210" style="s2">important in in all of these aspects so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:35.210" style="s2">that is Apple number 70</p>
