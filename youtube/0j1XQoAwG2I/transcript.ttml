<p begin="00:00:10.420" end="00:00:12.659" style="s2">Today I will tell you about</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.330" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2"> a different view of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.699" end="00:00:17.470" style="s2"> which is real.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.470" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2"> It is not easy to understand what is real because we do not possess unlimited knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:25.559" style="s2"> so we always have some assumptions about what&#39;s most real,</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.230" end="00:00:28.090" style="s2"> and it is very important</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.090" end="00:00:30.070" style="s2"> what do you consider the most real because</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.070" end="00:00:36.930" style="s2"> make decisions that affect your entire life based on those assumptions, whether you understand it or not,</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.240" end="00:00:39.240" style="s2"> and if your assumptions are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:45.380" style="s2"> or if you don’t complete them, you’ll pay dearly for it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:47.800" style="s2"> I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.160" end="00:00:50.369" style="s2"> the assumptions we use in our culture,</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.250" end="00:00:56.369" style="s2"> although they have allowed us to develop incredibly powerful technology,</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.600" end="00:01:00.599" style="s2"> are also incomplete in ways that have cost us a lot and are extremely dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.930" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2"> From the beginning the age of science</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.500" end="00:01:07.500" style="s2"> we live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.900" end="00:01:09.430" style="s2"> where</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.430" end="00:01:11.260" style="s2"> is lower</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.260" end="00:01:15.599" style="s2"> the layers of reality consider something dead,</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.119" end="00:01:17.140" style="s2"> like</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.140" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2"> earth, like matter,</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.650" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2"> they are objective,</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.040" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2"> external,</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.470" end="00:01:31.739" style="s2"> and whose no element contributes</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:33.189" style="s2"> reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.189" end="00:01:35.219" style="s2"> phenomena such as meaning or purpose.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.040" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2"> It’s all repressed into subjectivity and in a way into illusion,</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.320" end="00:01:42.610" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.610" end="00:01:47.519" style="s2"> it is by no means obvious that this set of assumptions is correct,</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.520" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2"> because we do not own</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.070" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2"> infinite knowledge and there are many things about the structure of being that we do not understand, and the main one is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.500" end="00:02:04.349" style="s2"> consciousness. We cannot explain that at all, and we cannot explain the role it seems to play in transformation</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.350" end="00:02:05.320" style="s2"> potential into reality,</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.320" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2"> and this is a role that physicists recognized almost a hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:11.590" style="s2"> i</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.590" end="00:02:14.500" style="s2"> which is still one of the greatest unknowns in science.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.700" end="00:02:18.180" style="s2"> There are also long ways we can know what is real,</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:21.820" style="s2"> and these other ways have certain advantages, and one of the advantages</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.820" end="00:02:25.140" style="s2"> is what protects us. When you know these other ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.610" end="00:02:30.849" style="s2"> actions within reality, defining reality, protect us from certain types of pathology, and modern people are</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.400" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2"> susceptible to various pathologies arising from assumptions that,</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.739" end="00:02:44.378" style="s2"> which make up their systems they use to define reality and one of these pathologies is one type</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.510" end="00:02:46.510" style="s2"> the nihilistic hopelessness that results from understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.549" end="00:02:50.229" style="s2"> that in the final analysis nothing really has any meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:54.369" style="s2"> because life is hard, it&#39;s a meaning you can&#39;t escape,</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.120" end="00:03:02.079" style="s2"> the compulsion to reject your faith in a positive or sublime meaning can weaken you in moments</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.389" end="00:03:04.389" style="s2"> when you really can&#39;t afford it,</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:10.509" style="s2"> and that opens the way to more important pathologies. These are pathologies of belief and I think we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.389" end="00:03:19.179" style="s2"> saw the most horrific examples of this, hopefully these are the most horrific examples, from the 20th century where people, whose belief systems were destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.180" end="00:03:24.220" style="s2"> at least in part through the competition of religious and scientific views, in large numbers turned</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.530" end="00:03:31.780" style="s2"> mass movements that are in all their aspects a substitute, a more rational substitution in some way,</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.389" end="00:03:37.749" style="s2"> for religious beliefs that no longer seemed sustainable, and the consequence of being interested only in destruction,</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.780" end="00:03:46.299" style="s2"> because twice we came close to complete destruction, the first ‘60s and then the’ 80s, is that they are, even without complete</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:49.959" style="s2"> the destruction of thousands of millions of lives lost as a result</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2"> pathological belief systems in the 20th century.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.979" end="00:03:57.009" style="s2"> Well, if belief systems become pathological,</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.500" end="00:04:05.019" style="s2"> that pathology can pose perhaps the greatest threat to our very existence, even if you are a Darwinist</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.569" end="00:04:10.658" style="s2"> Either way you need to understand that the things that pose the greatest threat to your survival are</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.569" end="00:04:13.569" style="s2"> most real and we have to face them somehow.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.239" end="00:04:16.418" style="s2"> There is another way of looking at things.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:23.140" style="s2"> I will start with the definition of this word, the word ‘phainesthai’ is the root of the word phenomenon.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.800" end="00:04:29.720" style="s2"> Phenomena are phenomena you observe, and ‘phainesthai’ means to illuminate, i</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.980" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2"> phenomenologists who were interested in the things they illuminate assumed that the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.689" end="00:04:39.039" style="s2"> they present themselves to you as the most significant in fact and the most real,</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.039" end="00:04:44.889" style="s2"> and I think you can confidently conclude that this is actually the way the brain is connected because your brain is connected</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.889" end="00:04:52.059" style="s2"> so it reacts to things that have meaning before you create a perception of it as a thing, and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.460" end="00:04:55.689" style="s2"> that the meaning of things is in some ways more real,</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.689" end="00:05:00.099" style="s2"> even more important than looking at things as objects. Well, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.279" end="00:05:02.900" style="s2"> a famous group of philosophers,</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:09.699" style="s2"> psychologist, said that when you approach a cliff you don&#39;t actually see that cliff but a place where you can fall,</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.580" end="00:05:15.669" style="s2"> it is not that you attribute to a cliff as an object the meaning of the place from which you fall -</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.460" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2"> first comes the understanding of where you fall from, and then the abstract understanding that it is a cliff, if at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:29.160" style="s2"> you will realize it will be much later, conceptually later because even babies can recognize cliffs, and historically later.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.740" end="00:05:34.600" style="s2"> Poets have noticed this phenomenon of illumination</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.229" end="00:05:40.299" style="s2"> realities have often associated it with childhood and I think there are good reasons for that. I think so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.089" end="00:05:45.789" style="s2"> that the brain is not so much a braking structure in children before it is fully developed.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.930" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2"> There are neurological reasons for this recognition but also</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.099" end="00:05:56.528" style="s2"> and reasons derived from life experience levels. You can see when you are among the children</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.599" end="00:06:00.609" style="s2"> that they are open to things in a way that adults are not, their eyes widen in amazement,</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.060" end="00:06:07.989" style="s2"> and adults like to be with children for this reason, because although children require a lot of attention and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.870" end="00:06:13.029" style="s2"> in a way they are scary, if you have a connection with a child because it is so powerless,</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.370" end="00:06:18.039" style="s2"> one of the ways you redeem yourself is by opening your eyes,</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.589" end="00:06:20.589" style="s2"> eyes that the experience closed</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.659" end="00:06:27.099" style="s2"> and learned to distance yourself from the things that shine, and when you have children you can look through their eyes again,</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.099" end="00:06:30.069" style="s2"> and to me it&#39;s kind of like worse,</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.069" end="00:06:35.259" style="s2"> they&#39;re like a candle or something that shines brightly and I think it&#39;s partly because we&#39;re not actually shielding ourselves from the fire,</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.259" end="00:06:38.768" style="s2"> we see fire and therefore we cannot look away when it is present.</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.769" end="00:06:43.578" style="s2"> I think the same thing happens when you fall in love with someone,</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.219" end="00:06:51.439" style="s2"> if love is real, because true love gives you hints about a possible future, if you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.439" end="00:06:54.859" style="s2"> Properly set you can take a look at a possible future when you are in love with someone.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.989" end="00:06:58.009" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t happen without effort, but you can take a look</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.009" end="00:07:00.109" style="s2"> and I think it&#39;s because when you fall in love,</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.110" end="00:07:02.110" style="s2"> I think there is probably a biochemical transformation going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.369" end="00:07:09.259" style="s2"> in perceptual structures that otherwise prevent you from seeing people, because you don’t actually see people but shadows.</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.899" end="00:07:11.899" style="s2"> You, you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.019" end="00:07:17.059" style="s2"> the barriers are temporarily removed and what really shines there is irresistible,</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.789" end="00:07:19.789" style="s2"> but stay in that state,</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.189" end="00:07:22.638" style="s2"> Well, it requires a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.489" end="00:07:26.419" style="s2"> moral effort, it’s actually the right view of it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.329" end="00:07:29.329" style="s2"> Wordsworth said of the children:</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.399" end="00:07:36.619" style="s2"> Once upon a time, a stream, a meadow and a grove, the earth and every ordinary sight when clothed in the light of heaven,</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.529" end="00:07:44.689" style="s2"> In their basic freshness and shine, they looked great to me. Who once was no more now;</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:46.499" style="s2"> Everywhere, night or day, he turns,</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.499" end="00:07:49.578" style="s2"> The things I saw now I will not be able to see again.</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.849" end="00:07:51.869" style="s2"> Earth</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.869" end="00:07:54.678" style="s2"> fills his lap with his own pleasures;</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.679" end="00:08:00.679" style="s2"> to the desires which are in her natural benevolence, and, even with a certain Mother&#39;s affection, And without unworthy intent,</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.349" end="00:08:08.509" style="s2"> The simple Stepmother tempts with everything she has to lead her Adoptive, her Tenant Man, to forget the splendors known to him,</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.089" end="00:08:14.958" style="s2"> And that royal palace where it used to come from. (The song was translated by Marko Vesovic and Omer Hadziselimovic)</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.299" end="00:08:20.388" style="s2"> What Wordsworth wants to say is that as you develop into a capable adult, which is exactly it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.119" end="00:08:25.159" style="s2"> the direction in which you should develop, a lot of what you are actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.499" end="00:08:32.688" style="s2"> closes and narrows. You close and narrow towards a certain goal in a certain way and that is necessary because,</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:34.649" style="s2"> how you develop</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.649" end="00:08:40.249" style="s2"> you have to develop towards a certain way of being or you will not develop at all and you can remain a child forever.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.579" end="00:08:44.568" style="s2"> It goes up on its own.</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.329" end="00:08:53.239" style="s2"> So, people are destined to narrow their perception, to sharpen and focus on something small to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.370" end="00:08:55.190" style="s2"> at least I can do that.</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.190" end="00:08:58.630" style="s2"> But the price we pay is that we start replacing our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.630" end="00:08:59.210" style="s2"> with</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.210" end="00:09:07.030" style="s2"> to the unfettered reality of shadows that are just so complex that they allow us to do what we have to and nothing more.</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.610" end="00:09:13.209" style="s2"> And somehow, even though we become more capable, on the other hand we are more blind and to some extent we know how it happens.</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.970" end="00:09:20.170" style="s2"> It starts from the bottom and goes up. This is Magritte&#39;s painting and it has obvious meaning,</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.170" end="00:09:22.170" style="s2"> in a way that we are blind</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.490" end="00:09:28.029" style="s2"> even for what is directly in front of us, blinded by the things we see and think by looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.470" end="00:09:36.100" style="s2"> we let light in but actually let only a small fraction of light in because we are capable</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:40.269" style="s2"> just to think about small parts of everything, whenever we do something specific.</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.400" end="00:09:46.360" style="s2"> A good part of what we do is review things, and a good part of your cortex is inhibitory,</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.810" end="00:09:52.359" style="s2"> and Magritte is trying to approach it with this idea. There&#39;s a businessman, he&#39;s dressed in a suit,</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.360" end="00:09:54.360" style="s2"> you can&#39;t see beyond what is immediate,</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.830" end="00:09:57.730" style="s2"> right in front of his eyes. How does that happen?</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.730" end="00:10:00.430" style="s2"> Well, let&#39;s say you&#39;re a baby. The first thing you learn is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.680" end="00:10:03.070" style="s2"> to build your body from the bottom up, build your own</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.170" end="00:10:08.680" style="s2"> perceptual and action structures from the bottom up. Learn to move your hand. Learn to close your fist.</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.350" end="00:10:15.430" style="s2"> Then learn to do useful things using these abilities. Lift the spoon, you have to do it to feed yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.620" end="00:10:18.909" style="s2"> Learn to move the plate, learn to set the table.</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.910" end="00:10:23.290" style="s2"> It is now starting to be social as well because you can set the table for yourself and for other people.</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.020" end="00:10:30.310" style="s2"> Learn to save a meal. It is a more complex sequence of motor activities and perceptual abilities that is focused.</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.940" end="00:10:36.639" style="s2"> As you continue to evolve the sequence you create becomes more complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.010" end="00:10:42.310" style="s2"> but also more specific. You have to take care of your family which means there are many other things you don’t do.</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.650" end="00:10:44.170" style="s2"> You have to find a good job</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.170" end="00:10:51.159" style="s2"> which almost everyone in their youth perceives as a consideration of limitations, well not everyone but many people think, alas no,</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.160" end="00:10:55.089" style="s2"> I will have to settle down in this role</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.090" end="00:10:56.590" style="s2"> and I don&#39;t want to be just that,</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.590" end="00:10:59.530" style="s2"> but it&#39;s better to have just that role than not to have any,</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.960" end="00:11:04.570" style="s2"> and maybe the way to the other side is through that role and not around it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.670" end="00:11:11.339" style="s2"> You cannot avoid the responsibility of narrowing, growing, and shaping and specializing. Be a good parent.</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.339" end="00:11:13.438" style="s2"> That is what you are sacrificing for the next generation.</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.230" end="00:11:17.009" style="s2"> Be a good partner, same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.769" end="00:11:25.229" style="s2"> Be a good citizen. It is especially easy for young people to be skeptical about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.509" end="00:11:32.579" style="s2"> because old society is always corrupt and archaic and blind and becoming a member of it seems to be a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.249" end="00:11:35.669" style="s2"> you allow yourself to appropriate that same obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.279" end="00:11:37.300" style="s2"> blindness.</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.300" end="00:11:40.889" style="s2"> But it also educates you, shapes every word you say,</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.379" end="00:11:46.379" style="s2"> it’s something you should be thankful for even though it has that outdated, archaic form.</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.050" end="00:11:52.259" style="s2"> It is a necessary part of human responsibility, to become a good citizen, and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.499" end="00:11:56.219" style="s2"> in a way it means sacrificing more of what could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.980" end="00:11:59.129" style="s2"> at least to maintain what already exists.</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.660" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2"> There’s one satirical English song from the late ’80s. &quot;I am the image and opportunity of a modern major general,</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.670" end="00:12:11.199" style="s2"> learned about vegetables, animals and minerals</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.199" end="00:12:18.299" style="s2"> I know English kings and I quote historical battles, from the Marathon to Waterloo in categorical order. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.519" end="00:12:23.249" style="s2"> And satire is, well, he possesses knowledge, he is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.970" end="00:12:26.439" style="s2"> official clerk which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.439" end="00:12:32.069" style="s2"> very hard to work with, but at the same time very limited and categorical and the artist would of course rebel against that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.540" end="00:12:36.839" style="s2"> but it’s better than nothing, and that’s an alternative.</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.069" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2"> Above that, perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:45.388" style="s2"> the one above a good citizen because once a good citizen is not so good if you are a good citizen in Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.389" end="00:12:47.389" style="s2"> or a good citizen in the Soviet Union or in Mao China,</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.889" end="00:12:50.459" style="s2"> you were narrowed down in a certain way, and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.579" end="00:12:54.928" style="s2"> in a necessary way but also in a very pathological way.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.929" end="00:12:59.009" style="s2"> There seems to be something there, though there is acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.379" end="00:13:05.159" style="s2"> that narrow view of the world is necessary, there must be something above that, and I think that is what can restore that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.709" end="00:13:07.709" style="s2"> the feeling you have, the feeling of being true</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.319" end="00:13:14.248" style="s2"> connections with the deepest and most significant realities of life, and that means being a good person.</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.290" end="00:13:16.920" style="s2"> It is above a good citizen. It&#39;s something else.</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.920" end="00:13:18.850" style="s2"> It concerns the development of individuality and I also think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.850" end="00:13:25.320" style="s2"> we are so programmed, we seem to be programmed to lose what we have in order to specialize,</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.320" end="00:13:31.739" style="s2"> and to reopen when we specialize, when those skills become part of us and then we can cope</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.230" end="00:13:37.349" style="s2"> with reality because we are better adapted, more fluid and more flexible. Then we can start opening the door again</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.350" end="00:13:40.530" style="s2"> and I, I believe the nervous system is tuned</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.630" end="00:13:47.520" style="s2"> to help you if you don&#39;t disturb him, if you notice, and you will notice by paying attention to things</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.190" end="00:13:52.650" style="s2"> which appear to you, which illuminate in an interesting way, grab you and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:55.919" style="s2"> what grabs you is where</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.440" end="00:14:00.780" style="s2"> the veil of ambiguity behind which you live does not obscure reality on the other side.</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.780" end="00:14:02.780" style="s2"> It&#39;s as if there&#39;s a hole in the curtain</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.870" style="s2"> through which a light penetrates that attracts you, that will pull you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.870" end="00:14:11.669" style="s2"> and then your interest is grabbed. This is done by your nervous system and not by yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.800" end="00:14:13.800" style="s2"> It is an unconscious force.</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.800" end="00:14:20.789" style="s2"> You might even say that the world itself has turned to you. Phenomenologists haven’t seen it that way, but it’s real</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.790" end="00:14:24.510" style="s2"> phenomenon, it’s not some side thing, and you know that because you can’t live without it.</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.820" end="00:14:28.379" style="s2"> You die, you get maimed, you get cynical, you get nihilistic,</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.380" end="00:14:33.869" style="s2"> or you accept some crazy belief system if you are not connected to some real one</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.990" end="00:14:41.219" style="s2"> with a revitalizing meaning in one’s own life. It’s hard to do that because it doesn’t necessarily bring you to perfection</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.550" end="00:14:47.669" style="s2"> juxtaposition with society because it does not concern society, it does not concern a good citizen, it is something else. That&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.400" end="00:14:50.400" style="s2"> which builds you so that you can become a good citizen.</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.050" end="00:14:56.460" style="s2"> The Egyptians knew this a long time ago. They didn&#39;t really know,</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.700" end="00:15:00.509" style="s2"> they portrayed it in plays and through mythology</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.030" end="00:15:07.109" style="s2"> for they did not have the ability to express these ideas quite clearly, but the Egyptians worshiped the human eye</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.630" end="00:15:13.859" style="s2"> and they worshiped him because they knew that the eye is what pays attention, we are very visual beings and our eyes are automatically</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.050" end="00:15:19.710" style="s2"> attracted to things that appear or shine in front of us and you have to look at them.</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.310" end="00:15:23.310" style="s2"> If you pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.220" end="00:15:26.220" style="s2"> things that illuminate</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.440" end="00:15:29.070" style="s2"> because what you see is reality and not a curtain,</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.589" end="00:15:35.758" style="s2"> you get access to the right information present in the world that is not packaged because it can be wrong,</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.829" end="00:15:36.910" style="s2"> these are real</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.910" end="00:15:40.109" style="s2"> information that stems from existence itself and if you pay attention to them</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.179" end="00:15:43.769" style="s2"> it will help you get closer to your pre-set goals</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.959" end="00:15:49.888" style="s2"> to become a good citizen, who are part of an innate value structure that you have accepted but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.889" end="00:15:51.889" style="s2"> will do something else. It will make you yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.509" end="00:15:58.168" style="s2"> transform the nature of those goals because, as you explore that thing that interests you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.929" end="00:16:05.309" style="s2"> more and more information is being revealed, and then as you absorb that information, so you&#39;re essentially learning,</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.859" end="00:16:12.299" style="s2"> you build yourself into another person, a stronger, better informed person, a more complete person</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.459" end="00:16:17.729" style="s2"> with more integrity and strength, and with a clearer direction and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.799" end="00:16:22.799" style="s2"> you open the curtain and so you live more and more in the real world. As you get closer to a certain goal,</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.799" end="00:16:26.549" style="s2"> even if it is culturally determined, what you learn along the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.369" end="00:16:29.729" style="s2"> it changes you, it changes the nature of your goals.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.029" end="00:16:35.829" style="s2"> Things shine.</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.829" end="00:16:42.058" style="s2"> And for a reason, and you already know that because when you deal with something that interests and preoccupies you,</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.059" end="00:16:44.368" style="s2"> then you are actually alive, then life is worthwhile.</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.439" end="00:16:46.319" style="s2"> So valuable that in those moments</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.319" end="00:16:50.099" style="s2"> you don&#39;t even ask questions, the question leaves you because</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.319" end="00:16:57.209" style="s2"> is the meaning of what you have united with so strongly that it can ward off adversity that you would otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.610" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2"> marked life. Nietzsche said, a person who has a ‘why’ can endure any ‘how’,</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.160" end="00:17:06.029" style="s2"> and it&#39;s very useful to know because you think, well,</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.029" end="00:17:11.339" style="s2"> we are very vulnerable creatures, our lives end in disaster, terrible things happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.339" end="00:17:15.898" style="s2"> and how do we handle it? The answer is, and always has been, that you have to be compliant with</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.329" end="00:17:24.028" style="s2"> something that is above you because that alignment gives you the strength you need to deal with your awful limitations.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.370" end="00:17:29.729" style="s2"> You’ve seen this happen, people know it, everyone knows it. Only our culture is not good at expressing that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.730" end="00:17:34.439" style="s2"> We lost a lot. We have not developed our knowledge of this as much as we have developed</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.840" end="00:17:40.049" style="s2"> knowledge of the objective world and now we pay for it. You see it in weird places, on the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.049" end="00:17:43.559" style="s2"> at the bottom is an old symbol called round chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.200" end="00:17:48.120" style="s2"> Alchemists believed that the round chaos was what contained ...</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.030" end="00:17:55.259" style="s2"> What the world is actually made of, what is most real and they conceptualized it as something like information.</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.750" end="00:18:02.099" style="s2"> They considered it a combination of spirit and matter, and that combination of spirit and matter is information in a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.100" end="00:18:07.469" style="s2"> because in that interaction you take some of the information and build yourself out of it,</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.470" end="00:18:11.550" style="s2"> so it&#39;s a spiritual element, and you take some of the information and build the world out of it,</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.550" end="00:18:15.329" style="s2"> it is a material element, and they thought of reality itself as something that</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.460" end="00:18:21.480" style="s2"> precedes the spiritual and the material, and that reality is what shone on, and was dramatized in the stories,</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.210" end="00:18:27.720" style="s2"> modern stories of transformation. The most interesting place where he appeared are the Harry Potter stories.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.660" end="00:18:33.329" style="s2"> At the heart of the Harry Potter story is a game called metloboy and metloboy</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.330" end="00:18:38.280" style="s2"> win by playing a game that is kind of out of place,</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.460" end="00:18:41.490" style="s2"> win by following,</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.580" end="00:18:48.510" style="s2"> you find this thing that summons you, this golden thing that shines and moves, if you can catch it</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.910" end="00:18:51.359" style="s2"> you won, your whole team won the game.</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.059" end="00:18:58.889" style="s2"> Inside that is the resurrection stone, it’s a diamond, a gem, and it’s an idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.740" end="00:19:03.599" style="s2"> yes, if you follow something that you find interesting,</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.910" end="00:19:08.459" style="s2"> it will lead you through adversity, it will lead you to do hard things</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.460" end="00:19:14.550" style="s2"> but not beyond your abilities because it is so made, and what will happen is, as you collide with the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.070" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2"> chasing what interests you, you will settle,</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.150" end="00:19:22.920" style="s2"> your molecules, structure, internal structure will become non-contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.559" end="00:19:29.879" style="s2"> like the internal structure of a light-reflecting gem and it makes you solid and durable as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.760" end="00:19:34.439" style="s2"> able to cope with the terrible circumstances of existence without becoming corrupt.</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.670" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2"> TS Eliot said something about this,</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:44.699" style="s2"> ‘We’re not going to stop researching, and the end of all our research will be coming to where we started</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2"> most extraordinary</p>
