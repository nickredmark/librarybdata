<p begin="00:00:09.309" end="00:00:24.970" style="s2">so I want to see if I can start to tease</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.860" end="00:00:24.970" style="s2">out what I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.040" end="00:00:40.120" style="s2">he&#39;s calling these walks and what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.200" end="00:00:42.280" style="s2">called thought and thinking and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.120" end="00:00:46.239" style="s2">what&#39;s at stake and essentially what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.280" end="00:00:48.809" style="s2">at stake right in philosophical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.239" end="00:00:48.809" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.100" end="00:01:02.030" style="s2">so one of the things that people often</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.260" end="00:01:04.129" style="s2">will say about Heidegger is they often</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.030" end="00:01:07.130" style="s2">they often talk about first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.129" end="00:01:10.360" style="s2">know almost everyone says Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.130" end="00:01:10.360" style="s2">probably one of the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.509" end="00:01:15.200" style="s2">philosophers ever if not the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.070" end="00:01:20.649" style="s2">difficult philosopher to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.200" end="00:01:20.649" style="s2">to break into these incredibly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.720" end="00:01:31.410" style="s2">to allow him to think your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.410" end="00:01:34.670" style="s2">right yet they all the often in the next</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.410" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">breath will say paradoxically however</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.670" end="00:01:41.610" style="s2">that which Heidegger is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:49.830" style="s2">right on another hand is very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.610" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">simpler and it&#39;s funny I I think I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.830" end="00:01:56.550" style="s2">more I go into what&#39;s opened what</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:58.230" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s opened up for me and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.550" end="00:02:03.330" style="s2">it&#39;s even more than Hydra I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.230" end="00:02:05.820" style="s2">just not opened up for me he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.330" end="00:02:13.070" style="s2">starting to understand what that is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:13.070" style="s2">what&#39;s at stake in genuine thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.570" end="00:02:20.920" style="s2">and what I don&#39;t mean thinking right I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.550" end="00:02:23.530" style="s2">want to really see if I can make the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.920" end="00:02:24.910" style="s2">distinction here because I think like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.530" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">lot of times what we call thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.910" end="00:02:31.600" style="s2">not to thinking that I&#39;m trying to point</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:35.400" style="s2">to right now usually I don&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.600" end="00:02:38.200" style="s2">wiggly things in your head that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.400" end="00:02:39.850" style="s2">constantly telling you to tighten your</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.200" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">rectum until everything gets under</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.850" end="00:02:45.160" style="s2">control thus making your rectum and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:47.770" style="s2">everything else and everybody around you</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.160" end="00:02:49.080" style="s2">kind of numb with a weird forced smile</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.770" end="00:02:53.410" style="s2">on your face</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.080" end="00:02:55.330" style="s2">not that not that in fact that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.410" end="00:02:56.830" style="s2">interesting to think about that but what</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.330" end="00:03:03.100" style="s2">you know what is that if that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.830" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">thinking I think that&#39;s it that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.100" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">that&#39;s a much longer walk but the I</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:14.680" style="s2">think what what that is mostly is the is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:17.230" style="s2">the idling of social practices rolling</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.680" end="00:03:18.820" style="s2">through the culture one of the ways it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.230" end="00:03:23.350" style="s2">rolls through the culture is it rolls</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.820" end="00:03:25.870" style="s2">through people&#39;s minds lost in thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.350" end="00:03:27.880" style="s2">constantly thinking right but it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.870" end="00:03:30.519" style="s2">that&#39;s not what I&#39;m meaning by thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.880" end="00:03:33.489" style="s2">right a lot of that is just representing</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.519" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">kind of regurgitating rolling things</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.489" end="00:03:37.840" style="s2">over and over and over and over in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:39.010" style="s2">mind right now if we kind of look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.840" end="00:03:42.910" style="s2">this and this is where we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.010" end="00:03:45.160" style="s2">get into it now what is the basis upon</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.910" end="00:03:47.530" style="s2">which you are idling what do you what</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.160" end="00:03:50.170" style="s2">exactly are what&#39;s the basis upon what</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.530" end="00:03:51.940" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking and idling you know all</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.170" end="00:03:54.250" style="s2">those Wiggly is going on in your head</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.940" end="00:03:56.980" style="s2">that are telling you to control all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.250" end="00:03:58.660" style="s2">reality and to pretend like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.980" end="00:04:00.630" style="s2">having fun while you&#39;re doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.660" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">and don&#39;t let everyone know that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.630" end="00:04:04.680" style="s2">hate everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:04.680" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.450" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">so I want to kind of get it see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.769" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">start to tease out like a little opening</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:23.830" style="s2">to see if we can like let it flash forth</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:25.570" style="s2">a little bit okay so now if we just look</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.830" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">at the most basic thing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.570" end="00:04:34.330" style="s2">right your simple being here beam there</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:36.340" style="s2">right and so like imagine if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:39.550" style="s2">watching the screen or if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.340" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">watching yourself watch the screen or or</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.550" end="00:04:46.900" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re doing right now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">seeing a world right seeing waves you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.900" end="00:04:52.830" style="s2">hearing sound you&#39;re a voice in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:52.830" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.650" end="00:05:01.699" style="s2">and you&#39;re seeing colors and hearing</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.419" end="00:05:06.039" style="s2">sound and you&#39;re touching tasting</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.699" end="00:05:09.169" style="s2">smelling all of your senses are are</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.039" end="00:05:11.210" style="s2">bringing a perception to you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.169" end="00:05:16.460" style="s2">perceiving both internally and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.210" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">externally right now another part of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.460" end="00:05:21.470" style="s2">perception if you look kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:27.080" style="s2">around is is that you also see that what</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.470" end="00:05:29.330" style="s2">you&#39;re perceiving exists right obviously</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.080" end="00:05:36.139" style="s2">of course because if that wave right</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">there or that water or this plant didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.139" end="00:05:41.180" style="s2">if you couldn&#39;t perceive it it existed</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">right well then that would that would</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.180" end="00:05:46.789" style="s2">just things up right because if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:50.660" style="s2">can&#39;t perceive that that rock exists</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.789" end="00:05:54.710" style="s2">right the sky exists right there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.660" end="00:05:58.669" style="s2">that everything exists it is the rock is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.710" end="00:06:01.460" style="s2">the voices the water is the sky is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.669" end="00:06:04.060" style="s2">thought is including all of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.460" end="00:06:08.260" style="s2">delusions about the rock sky earth water</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.060" end="00:06:08.260" style="s2">all those delusions are</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.720" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">however everything that you can see you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.139" end="00:06:19.800" style="s2">can kind of quarrel up for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:24.150" style="s2">you can correlate to a sense perception</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:28.230" style="s2">right you can sense it but what about</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.150" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">this existence now you perceive that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.230" end="00:06:33.389" style="s2">exists right obviously you perceive it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.419" style="s2">because it does it exists it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.389" end="00:06:44.670" style="s2">there okay so it&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.419" end="00:06:48.480" style="s2">perception but how do you perceive it</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.670" end="00:06:52.710" style="s2">do your senses bring it debate do your</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.480" end="00:06:55.170" style="s2">senses tell you that it exists I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.710" end="00:06:59.730" style="s2">think you can find the rocks existence</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.170" end="00:07:07.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s in in the color of your</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.730" end="00:07:11.060" style="s2">eyeballs or even in the rock so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.860" end="00:07:16.230" style="s2">definitely exist see that everything is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.060" end="00:07:18.480" style="s2">but if we try to bring forward that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.230" end="00:07:23.250" style="s2">which everything that is partakes of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.480" end="00:07:30.210" style="s2">this is itself you&#39;re perceiving it but</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.250" end="00:07:34.170" style="s2">you&#39;re not sensing it think about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.210" end="00:07:37.320" style="s2">in fact the senses are based upon its</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.170" end="00:07:45.540" style="s2">existence right the existence on some</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.320" end="00:07:47.460" style="s2">level you could say is Grant&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.540" end="00:07:49.530" style="s2">to be colored okay anything upon</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.460" end="00:07:52.620" style="s2">anything for you to see here taste touch</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.530" end="00:07:53.160" style="s2">perceive including all of your delusions</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.620" end="00:07:58.730" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.160" end="00:07:58.730" style="s2">right yet</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.250" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">what is what is this is what is this how</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.320" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">do you exactly perceive it if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">sensing it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.830" end="00:08:27.020" style="s2">now on some level I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.289" end="00:08:30.409" style="s2">automatically up to like a like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.020" end="00:08:34.190" style="s2">presupposition that kind of a common</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.409" end="00:08:37.729" style="s2">sense notion you know is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.190" end="00:08:39.529" style="s2">this sense in which well obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.729" end="00:08:43.219" style="s2">exists and I&#39;m just looking at it the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.529" end="00:08:46.060" style="s2">guy look stop bothering me because look</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.219" end="00:08:49.579" style="s2">it just exists therefore I can see it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.060" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">but you can&#39;t see the existence well you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.579" end="00:08:54.500" style="s2">do see the existence but it&#39;s it you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:09:05.149" style="s2">your senses don&#39;t bring you the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.500" end="00:09:10.459" style="s2">existence right what is this existence</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.149" end="00:09:13.029" style="s2">what is this this is we try to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.459" end="00:09:13.029" style="s2">to the foreground</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.110" end="00:09:23.370" style="s2">and you if we look at it like this if</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.540" end="00:09:27.980" style="s2">you want to kind of kind of get a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.370" end="00:09:30.510" style="s2">contrast here imagine that you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.980" end="00:09:35.899" style="s2">Christopher Columbus right and I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.510" end="00:09:40.500" style="s2">the whatever 1500s and I&#39;m looking out</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.899" end="00:09:48.529" style="s2">or I&#39;m an ancient Greek right I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.500" end="00:09:55.380" style="s2">500 BC and I look out I still would see</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.529" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">things existing however would things</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.380" end="00:10:01.560" style="s2">stand out and be intelligible and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:05.459" style="s2">present themselves in the same way it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.560" end="00:10:11.459" style="s2">did for somebody that far not that much</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.459" end="00:10:12.540" style="s2">older another way of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.459" end="00:10:17.029" style="s2">I was thinking about this the other day</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.540" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">of imagine Christopher Columbus actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.029" end="00:10:22.019" style="s2">you know when he&#39;s a kid</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:24.269" style="s2">he stands he stands out on the shore and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.019" end="00:10:25.980" style="s2">he looks at the horizon where he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.269" end="00:10:28.709" style="s2">sail his ship that he doesn&#39;t know yet</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.980" end="00:10:30.149" style="s2">right and this is before that he</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.709" end="00:10:33.209" style="s2">discovers that the earth is actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.149" end="00:10:36.810" style="s2">round you know imagine he&#39;s a little kid</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.209" end="00:10:38.100" style="s2">and he&#39;s looking out at that horizon and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.810" end="00:10:39.510" style="s2">then he goes and lives his whole life</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.100" end="00:10:41.279" style="s2">and he discovers the world around and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.510" end="00:10:43.740" style="s2">he&#39;s like you know I don&#39;t know 80 years</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.279" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">old and he after all that and he stands</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.740" end="00:10:48.630" style="s2">on the same spot looking at the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:53.959" style="s2">view same time of day and he looks at</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.630" end="00:10:53.959" style="s2">that very same horizon what does he see</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.960" end="00:11:12.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the way distance discloses itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.420" end="00:11:16.170" style="s2">differently that is you could say the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.330" end="00:11:20.250" style="s2">history of being starts to get at that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.170" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">it&#39;s what seems self-evident and just</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.250" end="00:11:24.870" style="s2">factual right they just innocently show</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:32.310" style="s2">up and there you are just things existed</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.870" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">and you see them however yes but so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.310" end="00:11:37.860" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:42.200" style="s2">the intelligibility that it shows up as</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.860" end="00:11:49.980" style="s2">anything at all and what grants the ass</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.200" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">is nothing just give it yet it occurs</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.980" end="00:11:54.450" style="s2">just given and just that occurrence I</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:57.470" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we can think of anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.450" end="00:12:00.540" style="s2">closer to ourselves than the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.470" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">intelligibility by virtue of which we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.540" end="00:12:07.500" style="s2">stand on and have everything just occur</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:12.810" style="s2">in its ordinary average everydayness</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.500" end="00:12:18.930" style="s2">boom there you are it&#39;s so close it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.810" end="00:12:21.230" style="s2">given that it hides in its utter uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.930" end="00:12:21.230" style="s2">Ness</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.010" end="00:12:36.810" style="s2">not what I&#39;m talking about thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.610" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">about the basic question of what grants</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.810" end="00:12:45.100" style="s2">the way the world worlds for you what</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:51.660" style="s2">grants it&#39;s hypnocil</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.100" end="00:12:54.490" style="s2">it&#39;s concealment into ordinariness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.660" end="00:12:58.470" style="s2">hiding in plain sight it&#39;s your ability</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.490" end="00:13:09.520" style="s2">to fall from it forget about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.470" end="00:13:13.660" style="s2">all of it thinking real thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.520" end="00:13:17.710" style="s2">simply about you could say trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.660" end="00:13:23.950" style="s2">catch a glimpse of the very being of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.710" end="00:13:27.610" style="s2">being as it withdrawals in other words</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.950" end="00:13:30.370" style="s2">it&#39;s the matter all right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.610" end="00:13:32.860" style="s2">what&#39;s at stake the very intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.370" end="00:13:41.740" style="s2">upon which anything at all shows up for</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.860" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">you as anything yeah so so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.740" end="00:13:46.690" style="s2">thing I just wanted presents about</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.100" style="s2">philosophy right cuz i&#39;m i mean i am not</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.690" end="00:13:53.050" style="s2">an academic by any stretch of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.100" end="00:13:55.330" style="s2">imagination right like but if you let</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.050" end="00:13:57.490" style="s2">these questions if you let the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.330" end="00:14:02.460" style="s2">of being really touch into you if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.490" end="00:14:02.460" style="s2">really if it strikes you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.870" end="00:14:09.300" style="s2">you&#39;ll never be the same and some level</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.140" end="00:14:12.030" style="s2">it&#39;s all you could think about in fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.300" end="00:14:15.840" style="s2">it&#39;s actually more the case that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.030" end="00:14:20.370" style="s2">becomes more and more that that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.840" end="00:14:23.640" style="s2">always already been the case of that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.370" end="00:14:29.910" style="s2">are the thinking of that even in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.640" end="00:14:36.420" style="s2">forgetfulness of it and so what I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.910" end="00:14:43.170" style="s2">I mean by thinking is drawing into and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.420" end="00:14:46.190" style="s2">becoming available to be struck by that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.170" end="00:14:46.190" style="s2">which is most near</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.110" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">to really listen deeply and maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.530" end="00:15:05.670" style="s2">is another we can talk about this at</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:08.670" style="s2">another time but I kind of can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.670" end="00:15:11.720" style="s2">really the difference between thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.670" end="00:15:11.720" style="s2">and listening</p>
