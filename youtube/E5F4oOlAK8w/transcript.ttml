<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.790" style="s2">on itself it&#39;s uh so people are taking</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.190" end="00:00:06.990" style="s2">it seriously that&#39;s good it&#39;s good I say</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.790" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">that but you&#39;re the one who has to deal</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.990" end="00:00:11.880" style="s2">with the pain and the pressure so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:15.900" style="s2">well I&#39;m in a permanent state of being</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.880" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">freaked out so then I woke up this</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:21.109" style="s2">morning with all these ideas that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">wanted to talk to you about all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.109" end="00:00:24.689" style="s2">okay so let me pull up the emails that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:36.809" style="s2">sent you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.689" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">yeah okay so one of the things did you</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.809" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">want to talk for us just to just to get</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">our idea straight or what maybe I can I</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.410" end="00:00:44.610" style="s2">also want to comment on some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:47.340" style="s2">things you wrote go ahead one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.610" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">things one of the difficult things by</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.340" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">the way are you recording this already</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:55.050" style="s2">yeah like you know we say after well</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:57.270" style="s2">then maybe you should then maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.050" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">should speak first because that way when</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">I talk about the the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">questions that I have especially in</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">regards to the cross the cross is really</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:09.210" style="s2">complicated it&#39;s a complicated it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s one of its meant to be to be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.210" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">mystery and so the way it&#39;s presented to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">us it it kind of breaks all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:18.299" style="s2">categories in a way and so or it unites</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.619" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">them together you can rather see it that</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">way and so it&#39;s difficult to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">difficult to talk about the cross</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">because it&#39;s both totally on the inside</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the center of the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:30.180" style="s2">it&#39;s the access of the cosmos it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:32.040" style="s2">those things but it&#39;s also you know at</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.180" end="00:01:33.689" style="s2">the edge of the world because even in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.040" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">the story it&#39;s brought outside as</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.689" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">crucifixion happens outside of the city</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:40.110" style="s2">it happens on the Mount of the skull and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">also there&#39;s a there&#39;s a verse in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">songs that says that the just will never</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">hang on a cross and so I will never hang</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:48.840" style="s2">on a tree it doesn&#39;t say cross but no</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">the just will never hang on a tree and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:53.909" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s an aporia in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">cross which is that Christ is the just</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.909" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">who&#39;s hanging on a tree so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">actually one of the reasons why Jews</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">have never accepted Christ as the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">Messiah because they can&#39;t deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2">absolute like paradox of having you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">the the the perfect man hanging on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:15.300" style="s2">tree and so it&#39;s like how does the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:18.240" style="s2">but but for a Christian it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.300" end="00:02:19.980" style="s2">bringing together that the extremes you</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.240" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">know I talked about that before well I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:23.730" style="s2">think that Christ really isn&#39;t the top</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">of the hierarchy but is really the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.730" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">stretching out of the hierarchy from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">from the top to the bottom yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:34.680" style="s2">okay so so all right so we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:38.750" style="s2">that all right yeah yeah because I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.680" end="00:02:42.900" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.750" end="00:02:45.800" style="s2">way of conceptualizing the potential</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.900" end="00:02:48.270" style="s2">solution to this problem yeah okay so</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.800" end="00:02:50.610" style="s2">Derrida had this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.270" end="00:02:52.290" style="s2">undecidability right there were these</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.610" end="00:02:54.600" style="s2">things that existed on the margins that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.290" end="00:02:58.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t fit into a category system yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.600" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked about that before and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.710" end="00:03:01.590" style="s2">that seems to me to be very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">associated with the idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:04.770" style="s2">developed in maps of meaning of anomaly</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:06.780" style="s2">mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.770" end="00:03:08.970" style="s2">yeah and the anomalous is the monster</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:11.940" style="s2">and the reason the anomalous is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.970" end="00:03:14.070" style="s2">monster is because there&#39;s a very large</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.940" end="00:03:15.720" style="s2">number of things that won&#39;t fit into any</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.070" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">category system doesn&#39;t matter what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.720" end="00:03:20.790" style="s2">category system is there&#39;s the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">inside the category system or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.790" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">category and there&#39;s the things outside</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:27.630" style="s2">and there&#39;s a multiplicity of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:29.550" style="s2">outside yes and so the monster image is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.630" end="00:03:31.410" style="s2">an appropriate image to represent that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.550" end="00:03:33.690" style="s2">because that monster is a chimera that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.410" end="00:03:35.220" style="s2">made up of parts yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.690" end="00:03:37.020" style="s2">okay and you always have to confront</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.220" end="00:03:39.780" style="s2">what stands outside the category system</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.020" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">yeah and it looks to me like we use our</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:46.140" style="s2">predator detection and defense systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">as the first defense against that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.140" end="00:03:51.090" style="s2">first reaction against that yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:52.709" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an archetypal reality that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.090" end="00:03:53.730" style="s2">there are things outside the category</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.709" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">system yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.730" end="00:03:58.410" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually and I think that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">terms of phenomenology I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.410" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe you can actually you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:03.570" style="s2">couldn&#39;t eliminate this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.459" style="s2">evolutionary biology because I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.570" end="00:04:08.280" style="s2">expert in that at all but it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.459" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">there&#39;s both the the predatory aspect</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.280" end="00:04:13.560" style="s2">where it&#39;s where the the the the monster</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">the anomaly is seen as something to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.560" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">defeat but there&#39;s also there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:19.459" style="s2">aspect which is the desiring aspect yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:23.669" style="s2">right right well that&#39;s the dragon with</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.459" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">with the gold yes or or the siren the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:27.540" style="s2">siren no the monster itself like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:32.010" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.540" end="00:04:34.020" style="s2">siren and about the the idea of Lilith</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.010" end="00:04:38.330" style="s2">for example in Jewish mythology this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.020" end="00:04:40.950" style="s2">notion of like that or the or the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.330" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">Incubus you know the idea of the female</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.950" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">demon which lures and brings you out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:49.050" style="s2">yourself and kind of makes you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:51.690" style="s2">waste your seed and in a Christian in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.050" end="00:04:54.420" style="s2">like a religious idea where it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.690" end="00:04:56.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.420" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">outside of the foreign or the which</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.310" end="00:05:01.560" style="s2">elicits a desire to move out towards it</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">I think you kind of talk about that when</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.560" end="00:05:06.450" style="s2">you talk about this notion of the snake</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:10.380" style="s2">that appears let&#39;s say about amongst a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.450" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">group of chimpanzees yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.380" end="00:05:13.860" style="s2">that&#39;s the fascination of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.970" style="s2">and neurobiologically that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.860" end="00:05:19.950" style="s2">with the positive aspect of exploration</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.970" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s yeah so yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.950" end="00:05:23.250" style="s2">paradoxical situation because if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:25.020" style="s2">unknown you want to be afraid of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.250" end="00:05:26.820" style="s2">because it might eat you but because it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.020" end="00:05:29.580" style="s2">contains new information let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.820" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">also want to approach it yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.580" end="00:05:33.870" style="s2">really I think it&#39;s important especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:36.540" style="s2">now in our in like our situation to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.870" end="00:05:38.430" style="s2">understand the desiring aspect could you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.540" end="00:05:40.620" style="s2">because it you can explain a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.430" end="00:05:42.780" style="s2">strange phenomena that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.620" end="00:05:45.390" style="s2">turn around sexuality in terms of of all</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.780" end="00:05:48.330" style="s2">the strange fetishization of sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.390" end="00:05:50.550" style="s2">into into you know sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.330" end="00:05:52.500" style="s2">opposite you know like the weird the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.550" end="00:05:54.630" style="s2">weird scatological fetishes that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.500" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">have in like the strange like it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.630" end="00:05:59.790" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the the outside</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:03.180" style="s2">or the monstrous or the the discarded</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.790" end="00:06:05.160" style="s2">which can also in a certain instance if</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.180" end="00:06:07.710" style="s2">people who let themselves go will pull</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.160" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">them into a desire relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.710" end="00:06:13.200" style="s2">that well one of the things you do find</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:16.590" style="s2">is that sexual release like orgasm is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.200" end="00:06:20.040" style="s2">potentiated by novelty mm-hmm so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.590" end="00:06:21.720" style="s2">a good example of that yeah yeah and if</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.040" end="00:06:24.510" style="s2">you kind of go down that route it can</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.720" end="00:06:26.190" style="s2">lead you into there&#39;s no limit kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.510" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">to where it can lead you and and and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.190" end="00:06:30.480" style="s2">can explain I think it can also explain</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:32.460" style="s2">kind of like now we are in this weird</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.480" end="00:06:34.500" style="s2">paradoxical situation in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.460" end="00:06:38.190" style="s2">society where since the sixties people</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.500" end="00:06:40.230" style="s2">have been telling us you know that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.190" end="00:06:41.400" style="s2">emphasizing that aspect the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.230" end="00:06:43.500" style="s2">novelty</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.400" end="00:06:45.620" style="s2">we&#39;ll increase pleasure let&#39;s say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.500" end="00:06:48.090" style="s2">bring you further into pleasure but then</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.620" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">realizing that if you go down that road</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.090" end="00:06:50.970" style="s2">now we&#39;re kind of realizing you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh now we&#39;re surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.970" end="00:06:55.350" style="s2">sexual perverts and we&#39;re wondering why</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:57.090" style="s2">we&#39;re surrounded by sexual perverts it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.350" end="00:06:59.340" style="s2">like well maybe you led them down that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.090" end="00:07:01.169" style="s2">road and that road doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.340" end="00:07:03.180" style="s2">lead to just sunshine and rainbows like</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.169" end="00:07:05.160" style="s2">it leads to very dark places which</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.180" end="00:07:09.090" style="s2">include a lot of violence and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.160" end="00:07:11.760" style="s2">of an exploration of animosity and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.090" end="00:07:13.740" style="s2">and a mixture of desire and hatred and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.760" end="00:07:15.450" style="s2">all those those very strange things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.740" end="00:07:17.340" style="s2">people kind of let themselves fall into</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.450" end="00:07:20.160" style="s2">yeah well you might say that that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.340" end="00:07:20.940" style="s2">some sense the story of fucose life yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.160" end="00:07:22.200" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.940" end="00:07:24.389" style="s2">I mean yeah we&#39;ve talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.200" end="00:07:26.460" style="s2">before that if if you look at foo codes</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.389" end="00:07:28.620" style="s2">if you look at fucose life he&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.460" end="00:07:31.860" style="s2">like a microcosm of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.620" end="00:07:34.410" style="s2">today in terms of his he&#39;s like radical</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.860" end="00:07:36.389" style="s2">exploration of power and sexuality but</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.410" end="00:07:37.950" style="s2">also like the idea of the constant</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.389" end="00:07:41.580" style="s2">stranger and the constant anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.950" end="00:07:44.220" style="s2">anonymity of sexual encounters I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.580" end="00:07:45.720" style="s2">that for sure I see him really as a as</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.220" end="00:07:49.560" style="s2">someone to look at in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.720" end="00:07:51.600" style="s2">understanding you know the the tone of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.560" end="00:07:53.430" style="s2">what&#39;s happening today yeah yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.600" end="00:07:55.710" style="s2">seems to me to be the case and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.430" end="00:07:59.580" style="s2">interesting too because Foucault Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.710" end="00:08:01.530" style="s2">didn&#39;t care for each other no and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.580" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">know Foucault basically regarded Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.530" end="00:08:09.060" style="s2">as a trickster as a word e-excuse me as</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:11.340" style="s2">a wordy trickster and yeah but they</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.060" end="00:08:13.229" style="s2">there are their ideas fall into</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.340" end="00:08:15.570" style="s2">alignment with regards to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.229" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">the excluded as far as I can tell yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.570" end="00:08:19.860" style="s2">well the thing that the difference I</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:22.770" style="s2">would say with the III find getting that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.860" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">more useful in terms of you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.770" end="00:08:26.580" style="s2">talked about this in my different talks</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:28.380" style="s2">about this notion that what&#39;s upside</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.580" end="00:08:30.270" style="s2">down can be turned back on its head hair</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.380" end="00:08:33.270" style="s2">back on its feet and I think that data</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.270" end="00:08:35.640" style="s2">is more useful to to play that game</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.270" end="00:08:37.979" style="s2">where you can use him and some of his</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.640" end="00:08:40.919" style="s2">categories to include them in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.979" end="00:08:44.099" style="s2">frame let&#39;s say so that his ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.919" end="00:08:46.890" style="s2">included in a more complete vision of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.099" end="00:08:49.770" style="s2">reality because he has like he really</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.890" end="00:08:51.720" style="s2">shows the real his way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.770" end="00:08:53.850" style="s2">really shows the real deigned the real</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:55.170" style="s2">problem of post-modernism like that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.850" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">know you talk about that off</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.170" end="00:08:59.100" style="s2">like how is it that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.540" style="s2">contradiction for example his philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.100" end="00:09:03.329" style="s2">has been described as like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.540" end="00:09:05.610" style="s2">philosophy of hesitation you know and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.329" end="00:09:07.320" style="s2">that makes total sense because you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.610" end="00:09:09.930" style="s2">when you&#39;re faced he has this notion</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.320" end="00:09:12.199" style="s2">that you&#39;re faced you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.930" end="00:09:14.820" style="s2">and in this slipping and sliding</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.199" end="00:09:17.579" style="s2">analysis of the world where all the all</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.820" end="00:09:20.010" style="s2">you know reality is multiplies itself is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.579" end="00:09:21.570" style="s2">deferred you know that that things</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.010" end="00:09:23.250" style="s2">always point towards the future so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.570" end="00:09:25.260" style="s2">never know exactly what something is</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.250" end="00:09:27.750" style="s2">because it keeps changing and it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.260" end="00:09:30.029" style="s2">it keeps slipping into something else</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.750" end="00:09:32.639" style="s2">right and so that actually leads to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.029" end="00:09:34.649" style="s2">which is true things yes exactly and but</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.639" end="00:09:36.180" style="s2">that actually leads to this this this</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.649" end="00:09:37.980" style="s2">hesitation and if you&#39;ve ever seen an</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.180" end="00:09:40.470" style="s2">interview with the ADA you&#39;ll see it in</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.980" end="00:09:42.690" style="s2">his in his demeanor he&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.470" end="00:09:44.699" style="s2">hesitating he&#39;s hesitating to speak</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.690" end="00:09:47.399" style="s2">because he&#39;s always kind of like he</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.699" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know he realized that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.399" end="00:09:51.420" style="s2">know the total implications of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">about to say all the time so he&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.420" end="00:09:56.250" style="s2">like he&#39;s he&#39;s like he&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.279" end="00:09:58.620" style="s2">cautious and cautious and cautious and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.250" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">so it seems like that&#39;s actually what</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.620" end="00:10:04.380" style="s2">should be normally derived out of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">the kind of postmodern idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.380" end="00:10:09.779" style="s2">meaning cannot be contained</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:12.329" style="s2">whereas Foucault he really he really</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.779" end="00:10:14.670" style="s2">used the kind of inverted idea of truth</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.329" end="00:10:17.010" style="s2">that you have the truth of the marginal</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.670" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">where you can use marginality as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.010" end="00:10:23.880" style="s2">weapon to destroy the let&#39;s say the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:25.529" style="s2">current order you you think okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.880" end="00:10:27.449" style="s2">think that&#39;s more attributable to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.529" end="00:10:29.730" style="s2">Foucault than to Derrida I think so well</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.449" end="00:10:31.230" style="s2">did he that does it too but what he does</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.730" end="00:10:34.440" style="s2">it&#39;s weird because he&#39;ll use the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.230" end="00:10:36.600" style="s2">marginal to kind of deconstruct the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.440" end="00:10:38.550" style="s2">center let&#39;s say but then he&#39;ll also</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.600" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">kind of in a st. in the same way he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.550" end="00:10:43.620" style="s2">also say he&#39;ll also heal like reverse it</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:45.240" style="s2">and then annihilate his reversal so he</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.620" end="00:10:46.949" style="s2">end up really in this slippery slope</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.240" end="00:10:50.579" style="s2">where you don&#39;t even know where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.949" end="00:10:53.069" style="s2">standing and and so in my opinion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.579" end="00:10:55.740" style="s2">useful because it helps you to see the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.069" end="00:10:58.139" style="s2">the actually kind of in the end it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.740" end="00:11:00.149" style="s2">points back towards logos it points back</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.139" end="00:11:01.319" style="s2">towards logos in the sense that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.149" end="00:11:03.300" style="s2">like you like we talked about you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.319" end="00:11:05.399" style="s2">live in a world like that okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.300" end="00:11:07.470" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.399" end="00:11:09.590" style="s2">develop today yeah so okay so the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.470" end="00:11:11.450" style="s2">thing that I thought of today is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.590" end="00:11:13.670" style="s2">okay so we have this issue of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.450" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">undecidability from Derrida&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.670" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t fit in the category yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:19.490" style="s2">okay now and we know that if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:20.900" style="s2">category there&#39;s way more outside the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.490" end="00:11:22.070" style="s2">category than there is inside the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.900" end="00:11:24.470" style="s2">category because otherwise if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.070" end="00:11:27.320" style="s2">category isn&#39;t very useful right right</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.470" end="00:11:29.870" style="s2">and so Derrida talks about that as and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.320" end="00:11:32.360" style="s2">think Foucault to at least alludes to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.870" end="00:11:34.040" style="s2">is that that they kind of make the case</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.360" end="00:11:36.740" style="s2">that the purpose of the category system</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.040" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">is to exclude and then they make a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.740" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">political case out of that as well and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:43.400" style="s2">the thing is is the purpose of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">category is to exclude it&#39;s to exclude</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.400" end="00:11:48.650" style="s2">an infinite multitude yeah because you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:50.570" style="s2">can&#39;t deal with an infinite multitude</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.650" end="00:11:52.130" style="s2">and so you have to simplify the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.570" end="00:11:54.290" style="s2">you have to categorize the world in</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.130" end="00:11:56.330" style="s2">order to act on it yeah so then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.290" end="00:11:59.270" style="s2">ultimate question has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.330" end="00:12:01.340" style="s2">like by what principle do you or what</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.270" end="00:12:03.710" style="s2">principle guides your categorization of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.340" end="00:12:05.450" style="s2">the world and that seems to me to point</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.710" end="00:12:07.190" style="s2">back to the logos in exactly the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.450" end="00:12:09.470" style="s2">that you just described because then I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.190" end="00:12:11.480" style="s2">would say the logos is the divine</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.470" end="00:12:13.310" style="s2">principle of categorization something</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.480" end="00:12:15.500" style="s2">like that oh there are two there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.310" end="00:12:19.430" style="s2">actually two ways to do it there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.500" end="00:12:20.990" style="s2">I think that I talked about it talked</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.430" end="00:12:24.470" style="s2">about talked about this in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.990" end="00:12:26.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s either there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.470" end="00:12:29.270" style="s2">possibilities there&#39;s either the logos</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.420" end="00:12:31.700" style="s2">there&#39;s either absolute dissemination</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.270" end="00:12:32.960" style="s2">which is this kind of the the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.700" end="00:12:35.450" style="s2">that something will just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.960" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">dissolve it dissolves into uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.450" end="00:12:39.710" style="s2">and and it&#39;s important to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.760" end="00:12:41.690" style="s2">result of that the result of that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.710" end="00:12:43.550" style="s2">that it&#39;ll just stay in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.690" end="00:12:45.050" style="s2">shaky uncertainty the result of that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.550" end="00:12:47.270" style="s2">that something else from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.050" end="00:12:49.430" style="s2">which has solidity is going to ran</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.270" end="00:12:51.890" style="s2">through it and I think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.430" end="00:12:53.840" style="s2">that did he didn&#39;t account for you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.890" end="00:12:54.110" style="s2">for example I don&#39;t think they accounted</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.840" end="00:12:56.360" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.110" end="00:12:58.280" style="s2">for Islam for example it&#39;s like he</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.360" end="00:13:00.860" style="s2">thought well if we&#39;re all if we all if</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.280" end="00:13:03.980" style="s2">we&#39;re all kind of in the slippery slide</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.860" end="00:13:06.020" style="s2">a situation without firm identities then</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.980" end="00:13:07.580" style="s2">we have no reason to fight right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.020" end="00:13:09.560" style="s2">kind of like yeah right that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.580" end="00:13:10.460" style="s2">positive infinite number of reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.560" end="00:13:12.770" style="s2">fight yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.460" end="00:13:14.990" style="s2">exactly maybe we have an infinite number</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.770" end="00:13:17.030" style="s2">at the fight but he didn&#39;t see like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.990" end="00:13:19.370" style="s2">something on the outside which has</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.030" end="00:13:21.740" style="s2">strength will this then just come right</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.370" end="00:13:22.920" style="s2">through that in terrible actually I am</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.740" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">absolutely well I</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.920" end="00:13:29.000" style="s2">he thought he he was probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:31.649" style="s2">Eurocentric in his outlook yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.000" end="00:13:35.060" style="s2">hilarious it is it&#39;s really hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.649" end="00:13:36.779" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really hilarious okay so</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.060" end="00:13:38.820" style="s2">alright so we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.779" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">undecidability alright sort thing about</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.820" end="00:13:42.149" style="s2">undecidability that we need to mention</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:44.220" style="s2">which makes it more complicated is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.149" end="00:13:46.500" style="s2">undecidability also has to do with time</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.220" end="00:13:48.269" style="s2">and so it has to do and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.500" end="00:13:50.579" style="s2">something actually that that you have in</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.269" end="00:13:53.190" style="s2">common I think with data which you might</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.579" end="00:13:55.800" style="s2">read funny to say but the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.190" end="00:13:57.449" style="s2">that something let&#39;s say you talked</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.800" end="00:14:00.180" style="s2">about that in example you said like when</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.449" end="00:14:02.250" style="s2">when when Ford created the car yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.180" end="00:14:04.829" style="s2">she didn&#39;t know what it was because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.250" end="00:14:07.500" style="s2">that that the the the that&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.829" end="00:14:09.720" style="s2">totality of what the car represents is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.500" end="00:14:11.910" style="s2">is is manifesting itself in time</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.720" end="00:14:14.070" style="s2">manifesting itself in like urban</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.910" end="00:14:16.199" style="s2">landscape in the way we understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.070" end="00:14:18.269" style="s2">economy and in a way it&#39;s always the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.199" end="00:14:20.899" style="s2">like the ramifications were so big that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.269" end="00:14:22.980" style="s2">you could never know what a car is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.899" end="00:14:25.709" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s called that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.980" end="00:14:30.329" style="s2">Deena talks about in terms of of the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.709" end="00:14:33.510" style="s2">deferral of meaning in time so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.329" end="00:14:35.550" style="s2">that you of difference in terms of um</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.510" end="00:14:37.230" style="s2">you know like like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.550" end="00:14:39.350" style="s2">categories in that they&#39;re defined by</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.230" end="00:14:41.160" style="s2">their opposites and by their their outer</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.350" end="00:14:42.390" style="s2">categories but then there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.160" end="00:14:44.850" style="s2">idea of time that makes it more</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.390" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">complicated to yeah well what that means</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.850" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">is that what if they is depends to some</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:50.760" style="s2">degree on the spatial and temporal</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:53.850" style="s2">context within which you&#39;re interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.760" end="00:14:56.010" style="s2">it yeah you could see that way yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.850" end="00:14:57.990" style="s2">I had a dream about that at one point I</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.010" end="00:15:01.019" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a digression I</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.990" end="00:15:03.089" style="s2">don&#39;t care I&#39;ll tell you anyways so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.019" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">dreamt this is such a strange dream I</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.089" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">dreamt that there was this ball floating</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:13.170" style="s2">above the Atlantic Ocean and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:14.819" style="s2">zoom in long about you know six feet</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.170" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">above the surface just cruising along</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.819" end="00:15:21.329" style="s2">and it was so powerful that it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:23.639" style="s2">accompanied by four hurricanes one in</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.329" end="00:15:26.279" style="s2">each quadrant surrounding the ball it</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.639" end="00:15:27.569" style="s2">was a little ball away and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.279" end="00:15:29.610" style="s2">first part of the dream the second part</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.569" end="00:15:31.500" style="s2">of the dream was a like a view of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.610" end="00:15:32.940" style="s2">satellites and a bunch of scientists who</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.500" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">were monitoring the hell out of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.940" end="00:15:36.649" style="s2">thing trying to figure out what it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:38.869" style="s2">the sir</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.649" end="00:15:40.850" style="s2">scene was this thing was trapped in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.869" end="00:15:42.920" style="s2">room it was like in a Victorian Museum</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.850" end="00:15:45.139" style="s2">case you know a wood case with glass and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.920" end="00:15:47.869" style="s2">it was sitting up there like suspended</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.139" end="00:15:50.029" style="s2">in midair inside the case this a ball</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.869" end="00:15:55.309" style="s2">the same ball yeah this so they captured</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.029" end="00:15:57.139" style="s2">it and so then it was in the room the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.309" end="00:15:58.699" style="s2">room had no doors or windows and in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.139" end="00:16:02.660" style="s2">room there was the President of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.699" end="00:16:05.420" style="s2">United States and Stephen Hawking and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.660" end="00:16:07.369" style="s2">that and then the room was made out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.420" end="00:16:08.839" style="s2">titanium dioxide I remember that from</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.369" end="00:16:11.209" style="s2">the dream which turns out to be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.839" end="00:16:13.790" style="s2">stuff that this the hull of the Starship</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.209" end="00:16:15.829" style="s2">Enterprise is made out of and something</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.790" end="00:16:17.660" style="s2">like that nothing like that yeah yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.829" end="00:16:19.819" style="s2">was something like that and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.660" end="00:16:22.069" style="s2">was that this intensely powerful thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.819" end="00:16:24.019" style="s2">had been put inside a category system</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.069" end="00:16:26.029" style="s2">right so it was inside a museum display</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.019" end="00:16:28.699" style="s2">case and then there was the president</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.029" end="00:16:30.860" style="s2">there a sort of representation of social</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.699" end="00:16:33.019" style="s2">order and Stephen Hawking he was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.860" end="00:16:35.269" style="s2">representation of disembodied intellect</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.019" end="00:16:37.399" style="s2">uh-huh and then there was the room</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.269" end="00:16:39.499" style="s2">itself which had impenetrable walls they</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.399" end="00:16:42.439" style="s2">were like six feet thick so we it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.499" end="00:16:44.149" style="s2">like we got this thing and then then I</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.439" end="00:16:45.339" style="s2">was watching it it turned into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.149" end="00:16:48.110" style="s2">chrysalis</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.339" end="00:16:50.209" style="s2">so obviously which is something that can</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.110" end="00:16:54.110" style="s2">transform right exactly and then it</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.209" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">turned into a meerschaum pipe it took me</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.110" end="00:17:00.079" style="s2">about a year to figure that out it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:02.420" style="s2">an allusion to that famous painting by</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.079" end="00:17:03.499" style="s2">Magritte right yeah this is not a pipe</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.420" end="00:17:05.329" style="s2">this is not a pipe you know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.499" end="00:17:07.010" style="s2">Foucault FC like quite a bit yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.329" end="00:17:09.380" style="s2">yeah and then it shot out of the room</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.010" end="00:17:11.120" style="s2">like there was nothing there interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.380" end="00:17:13.370" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great dream Wow it was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.120" end="00:17:15.260" style="s2">great dream man and so and it does</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.370" end="00:17:17.270" style="s2">allude to this idea that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.260" end="00:17:19.069" style="s2">capture the thing in permanently in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.270" end="00:17:23.059" style="s2">category system because it shifts and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.069" end="00:17:25.189" style="s2">turns yeah yeah so okay so so fine so</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.059" end="00:17:28.399" style="s2">we&#39;re on board with that all right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.189" end="00:17:30.590" style="s2">now the category has to exclude because</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.399" end="00:17:32.090" style="s2">reality is so complex that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.590" end="00:17:34.700" style="s2">categorize it because otherwise you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.090" end="00:17:36.260" style="s2">swamped yes good metaphor for it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.700" end="00:17:38.750" style="s2">and I said something that the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.260" end="00:17:40.929" style="s2">is that I didn&#39;t totally see the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.750" end="00:17:46.220" style="s2">extent to which that could be all right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.929" end="00:17:47.750" style="s2">right absolutely I think he put I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.220" end="00:17:50.380" style="s2">he thought that order was a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.750" end="00:17:53.800" style="s2">solid than it was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.380" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">so so or than it is so then I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.800" end="00:18:00.760" style="s2">thinking okay so now in with identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:05.020" style="s2">politics you have the politics of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.760" end="00:18:07.030" style="s2">excluded alright so so then you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.020" end="00:18:09.280" style="s2">people excluded because of race or</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.030" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">because of gender or because of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.280" end="00:18:12.790" style="s2">identity or whatever and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:14.680" style="s2">problems we&#39;ve seen with that is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.790" end="00:18:16.810" style="s2">the number of excluded keep multiplying</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.680" end="00:18:19.510" style="s2">that&#39;s why you get that extension of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.810" end="00:18:21.310" style="s2">letters in the LGBTQ acronym right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.510" end="00:18:23.050" style="s2">there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.310" end="00:18:24.940" style="s2">that and the reason for that is there is</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.050" end="00:18:27.010" style="s2">no limit to the number or excluded</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.940" end="00:18:28.780" style="s2">because it&#39;s the cake the category of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.010" end="00:18:30.310" style="s2">excluded is the category of all things</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.780" end="00:18:32.020" style="s2">that don&#39;t fit in the category system</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.310" end="00:18:34.570" style="s2">and that&#39;s an infinite set right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.020" end="00:18:36.040" style="s2">okay so but then I woke up this morning</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.570" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">and I thought well we could do we could</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.040" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">calculate that mathematically so because</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.770" style="s2">because of I was thinking about the rise</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:46.510" style="s2">of intersectionality and then because</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.770" end="00:18:48.070" style="s2">the rise of intersectionality is</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.510" end="00:18:50.260" style="s2">actually the reoccurrence of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.070" end="00:18:53.050" style="s2">individual within the collective ideas</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.260" end="00:18:55.180" style="s2">of postmodern neo Marxism because you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.050" end="00:18:57.340" style="s2">might say well I&#39;m excluded cuz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.180" end="00:18:59.260" style="s2">black or I&#39;m excluded because I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.340" end="00:19:01.870" style="s2">woman and then someone puts up their</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.260" end="00:19:05.050" style="s2">hand and says well those two categories</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.870" end="00:19:06.910" style="s2">don&#39;t include black woman they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.050" end="00:19:08.680" style="s2">include the intersection of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.910" end="00:19:11.770" style="s2">two categories and that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.680" end="00:19:15.430" style="s2">reason that black and woman is more</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.770" end="00:19:17.500" style="s2">important than black woman okay so then</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.430" end="00:19:19.960" style="s2">I thought all right so that&#39;s fine so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.500" end="00:19:22.500" style="s2">the problem is is that you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.960" end="00:19:24.730" style="s2">smaller and smaller numbers of people as</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.500" end="00:19:27.510" style="s2">exemplars of the categories that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.730" end="00:19:29.950" style="s2">excluded and then so then I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.510" end="00:19:32.470" style="s2">how many categories do you need to add</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.950" end="00:19:35.100" style="s2">in an intersectional analysis before</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.470" end="00:19:37.210" style="s2">you&#39;re actually down to one in a billion</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.100" end="00:19:38.980" style="s2">because I&#39;m led to you you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.210" end="00:19:42.010" style="s2">fractionated down to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.980" end="00:19:44.230" style="s2">right so now it&#39;s kind of screwy</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.010" end="00:19:46.990" style="s2">mathematically because it depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.230" end="00:19:49.630" style="s2">gradations of your category system right</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.990" end="00:19:52.360" style="s2">I mean I could call you old or young</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.630" end="00:19:54.660" style="s2">that&#39;d be binary right but I could say</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.360" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">no no you&#39;re on a scale from 0 to 100</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.660" end="00:20:00.940" style="s2">mm-hmm so that would that would be that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:02.860" style="s2">would give you a point 0 1 probability</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.940" end="00:20:04.420" style="s2">of there&#39;d be a hundred groups that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.860" end="00:20:06.460" style="s2">could belong to in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.420" end="00:20:08.440" style="s2">so I thought well let&#39;s just use a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.460" end="00:20:10.690" style="s2">hundred as an example because it could</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.440" end="00:20:12.490" style="s2">be - or it could be ten thousand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.690" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">arbitrary because we could say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.490" end="00:20:18.010" style="s2">well I&#39;m 41 and and there&#39;s advantages</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:19.780" style="s2">and disadvantages that go along with</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.010" end="00:20:22.300" style="s2">that but someone else could say well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.780" end="00:20:23.890" style="s2">41 in six months and there&#39;s a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.300" end="00:20:25.450" style="s2">different set of advantages and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.890" end="00:20:27.970" style="s2">disadvantages that go along with that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.450" end="00:20:30.390" style="s2">then so anyways if you have six</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.970" end="00:20:33.730" style="s2">categories with a probability of 0.1</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.390" end="00:20:36.010" style="s2">then you&#39;re one in a billion so you just</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.730" end="00:20:38.140" style="s2">need six dimensions of intersectionality</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.010" end="00:20:39.640" style="s2">before you&#39;ve fractionated the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.140" end="00:20:43.960" style="s2">population down to the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.640" end="00:20:46.270" style="s2">individual yeah so so that that means</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.960" end="00:20:49.030" style="s2">the individual comes sneaking back into</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.270" end="00:20:51.130" style="s2">the collective ideas of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.030" end="00:20:53.800" style="s2">once you hit six intersectional</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.130" end="00:20:56.410" style="s2">categories as long as that was I thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.800" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">that was really well it&#39;s ridiculously</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.410" end="00:21:03.220" style="s2">amusing so I said this will do the trick</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:06.010" style="s2">so if you&#39;re multiracial woman who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.220" end="00:21:09.190" style="s2">bisexual 27 years old</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.010" end="00:21:11.590" style="s2">smart 30th percentile for attractiveness</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.190" end="00:21:14.800" style="s2">10th percentile for familial wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.590" end="00:21:17.020" style="s2">80th percentile for education there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.800" end="00:21:26.380" style="s2">there is the you&#39;re the only one in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.020" end="00:21:28.600" style="s2">world like that so okay so then I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.380" end="00:21:29.680" style="s2">thinking okay so now then I was also</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.600" end="00:21:33.190" style="s2">thinking about this from a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.680" end="00:21:34.870" style="s2">perspective so the reason you assign if</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.190" end="00:21:38.050" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do an experiment on two</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.870" end="00:21:40.150" style="s2">groups you know you you do something to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.050" end="00:21:42.250" style="s2">one group and not to the other group but</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.150" end="00:21:44.260" style="s2">to make the control group proper you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.250" end="00:21:47.550" style="s2">have to assign randomly to each group</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:49.810" style="s2">and the reason you do random assignment</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.550" end="00:21:53.080" style="s2">infinite number of variables you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.810" end="00:21:55.270" style="s2">control for and so you assign randomly</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.080" end="00:21:57.070" style="s2">so that infinity cancels it cancels</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.270" end="00:21:59.940" style="s2">itself out and the only difference</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.070" end="00:22:03.490" style="s2">you&#39;re left with is the experimental</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.940" end="00:22:05.410" style="s2">condition uh-huh and then but scientists</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.490" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">sometimes try to get around that like we</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.410" end="00:22:10.600" style="s2">used to study people who were sons of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:12.250" style="s2">alcoholics and multi-and they had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.600" end="00:22:14.380" style="s2">multi-generational family history of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.250" end="00:22:16.030" style="s2">alcoholism and then we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.380" end="00:22:17.920" style="s2">figure out what might distinguish them</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.030" end="00:22:20.380" style="s2">from a normal person let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.920" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">so we try to get a control group to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.380" end="00:22:23.800" style="s2">contrast them with so we bring them into</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:26.110" style="s2">the lab say and give them alcohol and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.800" end="00:22:27.340" style="s2">give the control group alcohol but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.110" end="00:22:30.850" style="s2">problem was we didn&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.340" end="00:22:32.560" style="s2">control for like because alcoholism goes</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.850" end="00:22:34.890" style="s2">along with antisocial personality</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.560" end="00:22:38.500" style="s2">disorder so do you control for that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.890" end="00:22:41.530" style="s2">uh-huh um do you control for education</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.500" end="00:22:44.680" style="s2">do you control for IQ do you control for</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.530" end="00:22:46.000" style="s2">socio-economic status like the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.680" end="00:22:47.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t know because you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.000" end="00:22:50.410" style="s2">how those are associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.560" end="00:22:52.270" style="s2">alcoholism you can&#39;t know and so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.410" end="00:22:53.920" style="s2">guess and then you do an analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.270" end="00:22:55.750" style="s2">covariance but the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.920" end="00:22:57.460" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what to covary which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.750" end="00:22:59.980" style="s2">why you need random assign a shinto</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.460" end="00:23:02.560" style="s2">groups it&#39;s the only way of solving that</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.980" end="00:23:04.750" style="s2">problem uh-huh okay so the same problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.560" end="00:23:06.610" style="s2">of undecidability in some sense pops up</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.750" end="00:23:08.110" style="s2">very very frequently in clinical</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.610" end="00:23:09.340" style="s2">research right yeah the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.110" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">happens if you&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.340" end="00:23:14.260" style="s2">schizophrenia you need a control group</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:16.330" style="s2">well how about siblings the siblings who</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.260" end="00:23:17.590" style="s2">don&#39;t have schizophrenia uh-huh well</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.330" end="00:23:20.500" style="s2">yeah except they have a different</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.590" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">genotype you know it&#39;s an it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.500" end="00:23:23.500" style="s2">impossible problem to solve</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.200" style="s2">fundamentally which is why you need</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.500" end="00:23:27.730" style="s2">random assign a shinto groups because</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.200" end="00:23:29.740" style="s2">you can&#39;t control for all the variables</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.730" end="00:23:32.980" style="s2">you can&#39;t know in advance what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.740" end="00:23:35.260" style="s2">relevant uh-huh all right so then I had</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.980" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">this so I thought that was very funny</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.260" end="00:23:38.820" style="s2">that the idea of individuality comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.140" style="s2">back and I never did right with</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.820" end="00:23:43.660" style="s2">intersectionality yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.140" end="00:23:45.400" style="s2">you just push intersectionality to six</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.660" end="00:23:47.770" style="s2">dimensions and bang you&#39;re down to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.400" end="00:23:49.360" style="s2">individual huh all right so then I had</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.770" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">this little vision so I&#39;m gonna tell you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.360" end="00:23:55.060" style="s2">the vision okay all right all right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:59.050" style="s2">imagine a pyramid like imagine a plane</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.060" end="00:24:02.680" style="s2">first like at a place in a place a land</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.050" end="00:24:04.840" style="s2">but flat and then imagine a pyramid yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.680" end="00:24:08.710" style="s2">and then around the pyramid some</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.840" end="00:24:10.600" style="s2">distance from it is a wall okay so think</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.710" end="00:24:13.390" style="s2">about that just as the basic schema of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.600" end="00:24:16.180" style="s2">walled city yeah okay now the pyramid is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.390" end="00:24:17.830" style="s2">the group that&#39;s in there let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.180" end="00:24:21.040" style="s2">the value structure that that group</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.830" end="00:24:23.500" style="s2">Orient&#39;s itself by okay now outside that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.040" end="00:24:26.680" style="s2">wall there&#39;s a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.500" end="00:24:28.390" style="s2">other pyramids and that&#39;s basically the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.680" end="00:24:30.040" style="s2">postmodern world I would say that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.390" end="00:24:33.030" style="s2">of the world that Derrida described and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.040" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">Foucault set reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.030" end="00:24:39.070" style="s2">hmm III don&#39;t yeah I mean could continue</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.360" end="00:24:43.000" style="s2">her example I think okay that I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.070" end="00:24:46.870" style="s2">that for sure that Dida would say would</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.000" end="00:24:49.030" style="s2">say something like we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.870" end="00:24:51.400" style="s2">problem of the contain even the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.030" end="00:24:54.760" style="s2">contained space you know the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.400" end="00:24:56.620" style="s2">wall and the pyramid like he would he</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.760" end="00:24:58.330" style="s2">would have he would have a problem you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.620" end="00:25:00.700" style="s2">would have a problem with that structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.330" end="00:25:03.310" style="s2">itself like for him that would be that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.700" end="00:25:04.600" style="s2">would be it wouldn&#39;t be a solid</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.310" end="00:25:06.490" style="s2">structure right no it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.600" end="00:25:07.000" style="s2">flow with Tanya right that&#39;s okay we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.490" end="00:25:08.740" style="s2">get to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.000" end="00:25:10.840" style="s2">that&#39;s okay fine it&#39;s no problem let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:12.460" style="s2">say that is the problem right okay so</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.840" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">you added another dimension to it the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.460" end="00:25:16.120" style="s2">problem is there&#39;s an inside in a wall</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">and an outside that&#39;s problem number one</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.120" end="00:25:20.860" style="s2">the outside excludes we could call that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:24.040" style="s2">problem number two problem number three</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.860" end="00:25:26.350" style="s2">is that the center will not hold right</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.040" end="00:25:27.910" style="s2">right and that&#39;s the same problem as far</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.350" end="00:25:30.820" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned as the serpent in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.910" end="00:25:33.820" style="s2">Garden of Eden yeah okay okay good good</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.820" end="00:25:36.730" style="s2">so so let&#39;s say that really is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.820" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">problem I mean fundamentally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.730" end="00:25:40.600" style="s2">usually if you go back to the Garden of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:45.570" style="s2">Eden you find the problem somehow okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.600" end="00:25:47.950" style="s2">okay so now now imagine that outside the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.570" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">outside the wall all those pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.950" end="00:25:52.420" style="s2">fragment and they fragment down to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:54.160" style="s2">level of individual people so they</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.420" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">decompose to the level of individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.160" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">people yeah because that&#39;s how much</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:00.340" style="s2">variability there actually is right</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.410" style="s2">because those groups were artificial</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.340" end="00:26:04.110" style="s2">constructions right and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.410" end="00:26:07.150" style="s2">fragment them down to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.110" end="00:26:08.680" style="s2">okay so now the question is you want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.150" end="00:26:10.720" style="s2">let some of those people into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.680" end="00:26:13.270" style="s2">enclosed okay now next part of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.720" end="00:26:14.350" style="s2">vision the pyramid grows across on top</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.270" end="00:26:17.560" style="s2">of it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.350" end="00:26:19.420" style="s2">now it&#39;s a church and it&#39;s the center</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.560" end="00:26:22.120" style="s2">and the cross represents whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.420" end="00:26:25.860" style="s2">ordering principle of that Center is</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.120" end="00:26:28.180" style="s2">uh-huh okay so then I would say and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.860" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna add to this because you did</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.180" end="00:26:32.440" style="s2">at the beginning of the talk already the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">cross is the center point of the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.440" end="00:26:38.770" style="s2">it&#39;s the axis of the world so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">world tree it&#39;s also the the place of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.770" end="00:26:43.900" style="s2">suffering and it&#39;s the place of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:45.340" style="s2">suffering accepted voluntarily and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.900" end="00:26:48.190" style="s2">transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.340" end="00:26:51.550" style="s2">huh it&#39;s all of those things yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.190" end="00:26:53.740" style="s2">and so that that cross is also a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.550" end="00:26:58.060" style="s2">of the hero and the hero is the person</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.740" end="00:26:59.920" style="s2">who confronts chaos and gain something</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.060" end="00:27:02.410" style="s2">of value from it so that&#39;s voluntary and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.920" end="00:27:05.650" style="s2">the hero is also the person who recasts</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.410" end="00:27:08.290" style="s2">the archaic structure of the structure</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.650" end="00:27:11.410" style="s2">when it&#39;s necessary uh-huh right and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.290" end="00:27:14.890" style="s2">you see those hero themes developed</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.410" end="00:27:17.110" style="s2">quite regularly across any reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.890" end="00:27:17.680" style="s2">historical span of time so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.110" end="00:27:20.740" style="s2">Redeemer</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.680" end="00:27:22.750" style="s2">that&#39;s the messiah right it&#39;s that makes</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.740" end="00:27:25.180" style="s2">order out of chaos and then huh takes</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.750" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">order when it&#39;s too rigid</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.180" end="00:27:29.410" style="s2">yeah and breaks it apart and recast yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:31.240" style="s2">yeah you see that in the story of King</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.410" end="00:27:34.360" style="s2">David you see that actually really well</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.240" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">like very very well he he breaks like he</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.360" end="00:27:39.700" style="s2">acts as a fool and as a as someone who</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:42.760" style="s2">is actually a kind of thief trickster</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.700" end="00:27:45.430" style="s2">figure while the tyrant is in power and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.760" end="00:27:48.370" style="s2">then when that tyrant fall then he comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.430" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">in and creates a new centralized order</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.370" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">by bringing the ark to Jerusalem so he</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:54.910" style="s2">has that whole arc in his story okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:56.530" style="s2">good version okay okay good I&#39;ll keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.910" end="00:27:59.800" style="s2">that in mind for when I get to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.530" end="00:28:03.030" style="s2">story in my biblical lectures all right</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.800" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">so now you have to open the door on on</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.030" end="00:28:11.410" style="s2">on the wall and the question is who do</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:14.110" style="s2">you let in so here&#39;s the idea okay so</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.410" end="00:28:15.820" style="s2">you need to have a center and the center</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.110" end="00:28:17.530" style="s2">has to hold because things are too</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.820" end="00:28:21.250" style="s2">complex without a center and a category</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.530" end="00:28:23.380" style="s2">system and then the question is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.250" end="00:28:25.540" style="s2">say that your category system has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.380" end="00:28:27.720" style="s2">exist in accordance with the process</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.540" end="00:28:30.700" style="s2">that creates it and revitalizes it</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.720" end="00:28:32.110" style="s2">because otherwise it can&#39;t maintain its</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.700" end="00:28:35.800" style="s2">to build on across time it degenerates</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.110" end="00:28:38.710" style="s2">into chaos or it rigidify zin to too</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.800" end="00:28:41.830" style="s2">much order right okay so the only people</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.710" end="00:28:45.730" style="s2">that you let into this the inside the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.830" end="00:28:47.800" style="s2">wall are those who agree to live by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.730" end="00:28:49.810" style="s2">rules ethic and the ethic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.800" end="00:28:52.870" style="s2">symbolized by the cross yeah that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.810" end="00:28:54.340" style="s2">things that&#39;s the willingness to abide</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.870" end="00:28:56.770" style="s2">by a certain level of social</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.340" end="00:28:58.990" style="s2">organization but it&#39;s more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.770" end="00:29:01.720" style="s2">it&#39;s also the ability to transcend that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.990" end="00:29:03.370" style="s2">and to participate in the process but by</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.720" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">which chaos is confronted and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.370" end="00:29:07.929" style="s2">voluntarily voluntarily confronted and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:12.970" style="s2">reordered and also to participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.929" end="00:29:16.059" style="s2">process by which order is broken when</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.970" end="00:29:17.830" style="s2">it&#39;s too rigid and brought back that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.059" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">the death and resurrection essentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.830" end="00:29:21.720" style="s2">yeah so those are the only people that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">you can let inside the structure without</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.720" end="00:29:27.790" style="s2">pose without them posing a fatal threat</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:30.630" style="s2">to the structure itself and then if the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.790" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">walls fall then the infinite multitudes</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.630" end="00:29:36.520" style="s2">stream in and we&#39;re done no I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:38.260" style="s2">say it ceases to exist it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.520" end="00:29:40.360" style="s2">just cease to exist that&#39;s all you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.260" end="00:29:42.280" style="s2">that that&#39;s all that&#39;s all it is right</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.360" end="00:29:45.850" style="s2">well you&#39;d also say that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.280" end="00:29:48.160" style="s2">the problem that&#39;s being fought about in</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.850" end="00:29:50.710" style="s2">some sense with regards to the border</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.160" end="00:29:53.290" style="s2">issue in Europe yeah do we have a right</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.710" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">to have a border right and then I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.290" end="00:29:58.059" style="s2">thinking today about a store like just</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:30:01.059" style="s2">take your typical grocery store and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.059" end="00:30:03.670" style="s2">say well it&#39;s a it&#39;s a category system</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.059" end="00:30:07.000" style="s2">only those with money are allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.670" end="00:30:08.860" style="s2">bring food out of this place right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.000" end="00:30:12.210" style="s2">you might say well that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.860" end="00:30:16.030" style="s2">terrible imposition of capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.210" end="00:30:17.650" style="s2">patriarchy on and an unfair imposition</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.030" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">of capitalist patriarchy so you throw</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.650" end="00:30:20.920" style="s2">the doors open and you say everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:23.170" style="s2">come and take what they want</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.920" end="00:30:24.910" style="s2">yeah and that works really well until</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.170" end="00:30:27.250" style="s2">the store is empty and then that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.910" end="00:30:29.250" style="s2">end of that yeah because if everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.250" end="00:30:32.679" style="s2">do anything they want whenever they want</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.250" end="00:30:33.460" style="s2">then not then it&#39;s complete and utter</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.679" end="00:30:35.320" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.460" end="00:30:37.390" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s nobody and then what happens</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.320" end="00:30:39.280" style="s2">is what happens you know because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.390" end="00:30:42.220" style="s2">lived in a place that is absolute and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.280" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">utter chaos and and cast doesn&#39;t cannot</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.220" end="00:30:47.770" style="s2">sustain itself so usually what happens</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:50.470" style="s2">is the rise of a warlord or tyrant the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.770" end="00:30:54.400" style="s2">rise of someone who will by sheer force</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.470" end="00:30:56.679" style="s2">by sheer physical force impose their</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.400" end="00:30:58.809" style="s2">will on others because the others will</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.679" end="00:31:00.790" style="s2">be will have nothing to unite them and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.809" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not true that you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.790" end="00:31:03.910" style="s2">a lot of you know you you meet</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">anarchists you know and people who think</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.910" end="00:31:07.300" style="s2">that that there is such a thing as like</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:09.280" style="s2">you know there&#39;s just kind of free</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.300" end="00:31:10.929" style="s2">anarchy where everybody is equal and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.280" end="00:31:11.980" style="s2">everybody you know can do whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.929" end="00:31:14.350" style="s2">want that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.980" end="00:31:16.779" style="s2">cuz in that Anarchy comes a tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.350" end="00:31:18.940" style="s2">inevitably right there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.779" end="00:31:21.549" style="s2">stopping it right into anarchy comes a</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.940" end="00:31:23.710" style="s2">tyrant yeah absolutely absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.549" end="00:31:25.260" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.710" end="00:31:28.029" style="s2">problem with that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.260" end="00:31:31.480" style="s2">fundamental organizing principle the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.029" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">tyrant is tyranny yeah pure QR power</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.480" end="00:31:36.450" style="s2">pure power and pure also personality</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:40.299" style="s2">cult like that it&#39;s that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.450" end="00:31:43.179" style="s2">person instead of being an ideal unto</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.299" end="00:31:46.120" style="s2">which we we serve you know or our mythic</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.179" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2">figure or or a divine figure it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.120" end="00:31:51.190" style="s2">a guy you know it becomes becomes Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:53.529" style="s2">or it becomes you know it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.190" end="00:31:55.710" style="s2">Napoleon or it becomes solid or become</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.529" end="00:31:57.970" style="s2">whatever like it&#39;s the it&#39;s that person</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.710" end="00:32:00.340" style="s2">everything is embodied in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.970" end="00:32:03.010" style="s2">personality like I always say like I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.340" end="00:32:07.659" style="s2">always have this image of of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.010" end="00:32:10.809" style="s2">functional system is is the person who</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.659" end="00:32:12.730" style="s2">in some manner is able to to at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.809" end="00:32:15.010" style="s2">symbolically step down from their power</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.730" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">right they always say that that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.010" end="00:32:19.720" style="s2">George Washington what made him so great</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.679" end="00:32:22.360" style="s2">is that he he stopped being president</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.720" end="00:32:23.980" style="s2">right created the impetus for the system</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.360" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">to work and in the same in the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.980" end="00:32:28.809" style="s2">Empire like Augustus you know people</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:31.450" style="s2">will will say that he didn&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.809" end="00:32:34.409" style="s2">it but when Augustus became Emperor he</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.450" end="00:32:38.260" style="s2">stepped into the city as a citizen and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.409" end="00:32:40.450" style="s2">he gave away all his power and by giving</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.260" end="00:32:42.700" style="s2">away all his power in a strange way he</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.450" end="00:32:44.740" style="s2">actually became the most powerful person</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.700" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">in Rome but his power was not a legal</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.740" end="00:32:50.500" style="s2">power it was like it was like there was</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:53.080" style="s2">something about his capacity to not be</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.500" end="00:32:55.179" style="s2">the tyrant which which would stabilize</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.080" end="00:32:57.549" style="s2">the Empire and made him very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.179" end="00:33:00.130" style="s2">but in a in a strain in a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.549" end="00:33:02.190" style="s2">strange ways different right so so like</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.130" end="00:33:06.070" style="s2">a legitimate ruler has to be bound by</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.190" end="00:33:08.049" style="s2">proper sovereign Authority exact not if</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.070" end="00:33:10.210" style="s2">he gave himself to the to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.049" end="00:33:12.460" style="s2">Senate and said I&#39;m at your service and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.210" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">so it made him very powerful but he also</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.460" end="00:33:16.389" style="s2">kind of bound his power through in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:18.610" style="s2">Senate right right well you see that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.389" end="00:33:21.639" style="s2">emerging as early as Mesopotamia where</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.610" end="00:33:25.480" style="s2">Marduk or where the Emperor had to act</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.639" end="00:33:25.810" style="s2">out his his embodiment of Marduk in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.480" end="00:33:29.020" style="s2">new you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.810" end="00:33:30.730" style="s2">festival and Marduk was the God hero who</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.020" end="00:33:32.680" style="s2">went out and confronted the dragon of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.730" end="00:33:36.010" style="s2">chaos and made the world and so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.680" end="00:33:38.290" style="s2">reason that the Emperor had it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.010" end="00:33:40.030" style="s2">sovereignty legitimacy the reason they</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.290" end="00:33:41.740" style="s2">have never had legitimacy is because he</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.030" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">was acting out an archetypal pattern</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.740" end="00:33:46.210" style="s2">that transcended his own personality</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:47.800" style="s2">then the question is well what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.210" end="00:33:51.610" style="s2">archetypal pattern in the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.800" end="00:33:53.860" style="s2">is that&#39;s the hero who recasts that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.610" end="00:33:57.100" style="s2">tyrannical state and who confronts chaos</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.860" end="00:33:59.560" style="s2">so the structure that the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.100" end="00:34:03.510" style="s2">problem of how you maintain a structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.560" end="00:34:06.340" style="s2">in the in the flow of time is that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.510" end="00:34:08.230" style="s2">make the structure itself subordinate to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.340" end="00:34:09.940" style="s2">the principle by which the sir the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.230" end="00:34:13.530" style="s2">structure is generated and then and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.940" end="00:34:15.730" style="s2">means that the the sovereign needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.530" end="00:34:17.140" style="s2">responsible to the word essentially</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.730" end="00:34:18.910" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s how I would think about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.140" end="00:34:21.070" style="s2">from a judeo-christian perspective now</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.910" end="00:34:22.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s above everything yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.070" end="00:34:25.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that does the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.180" end="00:34:27.130" style="s2">categorization initially that&#39;s when God</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.600" end="00:34:29.020" style="s2">creates the world because of the word</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.130" end="00:34:32.170" style="s2">and when Adam names the animals and all</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.020" end="00:34:34.780" style="s2">of that and then so but also maintains</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.170" end="00:34:38.410" style="s2">that across time because it does slip</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.780" end="00:34:40.900" style="s2">and slide yeah so you know it did wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.410" end="00:34:43.300" style="s2">really see we&#39;ve been talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.900" end="00:34:45.820" style="s2">post post-modernism right and about a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.300" end="00:34:47.290" style="s2">logo centrism and we&#39;ve been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.820" end="00:34:49.630" style="s2">laughing about that too because of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.290" end="00:34:54.730" style="s2">because of its reference to Derrida&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.630" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">fellow go centrism but it&#39;s funny too</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.730" end="00:34:59.590" style="s2">you know because if you look at hindu</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:01.950" style="s2">representations of the center they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.590" end="00:35:04.390" style="s2">not fellow go centric the fellows is</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.950" end="00:35:07.180" style="s2">embodied in its the Lingam and the yoni</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.390" end="00:35:10.120" style="s2">now the phallus is conjoined with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.180" end="00:35:12.370" style="s2">yoni it&#39;s a it&#39;s a masculine female</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.120" end="00:35:15.610" style="s2">duality that&#39;s at the center it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.370" end="00:35:18.100" style="s2">just the masculine right and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.610" end="00:35:20.680" style="s2">that that Center is necessarily fel logo</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.100" end="00:35:24.310" style="s2">centric is is also wrong right but it</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.680" end="00:35:26.290" style="s2">you know the thing is that okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.310" end="00:35:30.100" style="s2">gonna get explicit I guess but but it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.290" end="00:35:33.310" style="s2">his follow go centric you know that even</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.100" end="00:35:36.760" style="s2">if you imagine the the phallus inside</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.310" end="00:35:38.430" style="s2">the inside the the woman the woman the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.760" end="00:35:41.880" style="s2">the phallus is the center and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.430" end="00:35:44.069" style="s2">woman envelops the the centre-right the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.880" end="00:35:45.960" style="s2">phallic center you know but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.069" end="00:35:47.849" style="s2">that what I&#39;ve been trying to get to and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.960" end="00:35:49.079" style="s2">I think what we&#39;ve all been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.849" end="00:35:52.260" style="s2">get to what you&#39;ve been trying to get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.079" end="00:35:56.430" style="s2">to is is to be able to speak of logo</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.260" end="00:35:59.130" style="s2">centrism as in the proper manner that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.430" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">to understand that to say logo scent</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.130" end="00:36:06.170" style="s2">logo centrist means that we also</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:09.780" style="s2">understand like the the power of the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.170" end="00:36:11.819" style="s2">out the power of the frame let&#39;s say so</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.780" end="00:36:13.770" style="s2">the image eyes I have of the logo</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.819" end="00:36:16.230" style="s2">centrism is really there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.770" end="00:36:18.599" style="s2">image of the mother of God of Mary with</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.230" end="00:36:21.300" style="s2">our hands up like this and in her Center</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.599" end="00:36:24.059" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s there&#39;s a circle and</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.300" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">out of her Cudi&#39;s coming the Christ</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.059" end="00:36:28.619" style="s2">child and inside that that that circle</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:30.690" style="s2">you see the stars as if it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.619" end="00:36:33.510" style="s2">entire cosmos right which is the frame</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.690" end="00:36:36.750" style="s2">for the logos to manifest itself in and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.510" end="00:36:39.740" style="s2">so yeah yeah that in those open virgins</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.750" end="00:36:42.930" style="s2">to that 14th century where Mary is</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.740" end="00:36:44.700" style="s2">holding a globe I think generally</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.930" end="00:36:46.920" style="s2">speaking and then she opens up and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.700" end="00:36:49.559" style="s2">inside you have God the Father and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.920" end="00:36:52.589" style="s2">holding Christ on the cross and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.559" end="00:36:54.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a similar sort of similar</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.589" end="00:36:57.059" style="s2">sort of notion right and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.630" end="00:36:59.609" style="s2">if we understand it that way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.059" end="00:37:01.500" style="s2">like an implicit in the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.609" end="00:37:05.790" style="s2">law of logos centrism there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.500" end="00:37:08.190" style="s2">implicit kind of secret mention of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.790" end="00:37:11.400" style="s2">power of the feminine in that very term</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.190" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">if we understand it fully as the the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.400" end="00:37:17.630" style="s2">need for the this kind of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:20.339" style="s2">chaotic outside or the chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.630" end="00:37:22.619" style="s2">potentiality which frames the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.339" end="00:37:24.119" style="s2">manifestation of the logos and and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.619" end="00:37:26.609" style="s2">understand that those two things need</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.119" end="00:37:29.069" style="s2">each other like the you know the logos</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.609" end="00:37:31.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t manifest himself without a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.069" end="00:37:32.910" style="s2">question right there has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.230" end="00:37:35.430" style="s2">Christian for there to be an answer and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.910" end="00:37:38.010" style="s2">the question is a frame for the answer</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.430" end="00:37:39.569" style="s2">it&#39;s like definitely okay that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.010" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">important that&#39;s like super important</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.569" end="00:37:45.329" style="s2">and it shows how powerful the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:46.859" style="s2">is because it actually acts as the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.329" end="00:37:49.319" style="s2">category they&#39;ll I could say the frame</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.859" end="00:37:52.050" style="s2">in which the answer is given okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.319" end="00:37:56.910" style="s2">so so let&#39;s let&#39;s develop that for a min</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.050" end="00:37:58.620" style="s2">so um let me let me see that had made me</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.910" end="00:38:01.410" style="s2">think of something look I also wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.620" end="00:38:03.270" style="s2">tell to talk to you about oh yes so okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.410" end="00:38:04.740" style="s2">so you said the frame is determined by</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.270" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">the question that&#39;s answered</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.740" end="00:38:12.240" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s asked yes good good perfect</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:13.650" style="s2">so so this is where I&#39;ve been butting</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.240" end="00:38:15.750" style="s2">heads with Sam Harris and where you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.650" end="00:38:18.660" style="s2">butted heads with Weinstein in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.750" end="00:38:21.390" style="s2">Vancouver right okay so because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.660" end="00:38:25.380" style="s2">question is okay so you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.390" end="00:38:27.300" style="s2">category system now Harris basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.380" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">claims that you can derive the category</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.300" end="00:38:32.490" style="s2">system from the from the fact yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:33.930" style="s2">but the objection to that is there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.490" end="00:38:36.270" style="s2">infinite number of facts and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.930" end="00:38:39.330" style="s2">tell you what to do with them yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.270" end="00:38:41.300" style="s2">so I would say instead that you derive</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.330" end="00:38:45.180" style="s2">the category system from your aims</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.300" end="00:38:48.750" style="s2">because categories are there to to help</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.180" end="00:38:50.850" style="s2">you fulfill your your goals that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.750" end="00:38:52.020" style="s2">that&#39;s how category systems work</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.850" end="00:38:54.030" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why I think of them as</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.020" end="00:38:57.810" style="s2">pragmatic yeah okay so now the question</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.030" end="00:39:00.060" style="s2">is given that your your category system</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.810" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">includes and excludes and defines the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.060" end="00:39:05.070" style="s2">world what should be the aim of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:06.660" style="s2">category system and so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.070" end="00:39:08.580" style="s2">what the Sermon on the Mount talks about</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.660" end="00:39:10.770" style="s2">because it basically says well you</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.580" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">should aim at the highest possible good</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.770" end="00:39:15.270" style="s2">you should aim at union with God</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:17.940" style="s2">whatever that might mean that you aim at</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.270" end="00:39:20.040" style="s2">the highest possible good with fully</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.940" end="00:39:21.720" style="s2">right fully right down to the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.040" end="00:39:25.350" style="s2">your soul if you can manage it so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.720" end="00:39:26.670" style="s2">you&#39;re not broken and bent up and twist</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.350" end="00:39:28.710" style="s2">it in a bunch of different sub</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.670" end="00:39:31.380" style="s2">personalities so you try to unify</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.710" end="00:39:33.050" style="s2">yourself as a force for the highest good</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.380" end="00:39:36.450" style="s2">and you do that in large part by</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.050" end="00:39:38.490" style="s2">deciding that being is worthwhile right</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.450" end="00:39:40.380" style="s2">so you pledge allegiance to to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.490" end="00:39:42.990" style="s2">concept of being so you&#39;re not you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.380" end="00:39:46.020" style="s2">like Cain now and then you speak truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.990" end="00:39:48.150" style="s2">in the service of that being and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.020" end="00:39:50.580" style="s2">that from that your category system</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.150" end="00:39:52.950" style="s2">flows and so that&#39;s another reason that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.580" end="00:39:55.590" style="s2">pyramid with the Cross is the center of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.950" end="00:39:57.420" style="s2">the category system yeah because then</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.590" end="00:39:59.490" style="s2">you get a category system that includes</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.420" end="00:40:01.830" style="s2">what it should include if the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.490" end="00:40:03.570" style="s2">the establishment of the kingdom of God</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.830" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">let&#39;s say yeah which is the highest of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.570" end="00:40:07.970" style="s2">possible goals and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:09.619" style="s2">excludes what it should exclude yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.970" end="00:40:12.309" style="s2">of the things to that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.619" end="00:40:15.170" style="s2">differentiates that&#39;s a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.309" end="00:40:18.470" style="s2">ontology or like a Chrisman a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.170" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">cosmology is that we have this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.470" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">there is an intimate relationship also</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:26.089" style="s2">between let&#39;s say the highest and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:28.910" style="s2">lowest there&#39;s a there&#39;s something which</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.089" end="00:40:32.089" style="s2">which unites them together completely so</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.910" end="00:40:34.190" style="s2">that so that so that even beyond let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.089" end="00:40:37.069" style="s2">say there&#39;s this capacity to move</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.190" end="00:40:40.970" style="s2">outside how can I say this - to unite</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.069" end="00:40:43.009" style="s2">things together and so there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.970" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say like you know for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.009" end="00:40:47.960" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea like the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:49.099" style="s2">normal of a Christian family let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.960" end="00:40:50.630" style="s2">that you know the father is the head of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.099" end="00:40:52.190" style="s2">the household you know like this idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.630" end="00:40:53.690" style="s2">that people hate today</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.190" end="00:40:56.839" style="s2">but there&#39;s this really the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.690" end="00:41:03.619" style="s2">the head or that nor the the king or the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.839" end="00:41:06.589" style="s2">chief exists for the for the the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.619" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">of those that are glow that are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.589" end="00:41:12.410" style="s2">lowest right that&#39;s continually insisted</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:14.089" style="s2">upon in the Old Testament yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.410" end="00:41:16.009" style="s2">the prophets always come up and say to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.089" end="00:41:17.720" style="s2">the king you&#39;re not attending</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.009" end="00:41:19.789" style="s2">sufficiently to the widows and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.720" end="00:41:22.309" style="s2">orphans yeah and that means that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.789" end="00:41:24.349" style="s2">become corrupt yeah so in a way you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.309" end="00:41:27.019" style="s2">kind of see the hierarchy moving up in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.349" end="00:41:29.119" style="s2">the sense of things looking up towards</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.019" end="00:41:31.460" style="s2">you know into the hierarchy but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.119" end="00:41:33.710" style="s2">there&#39;s also a really important man in</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.460" end="00:41:35.210" style="s2">which the hierarchy moves down and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.710" end="00:41:37.309" style="s2">the idea is that the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.210" end="00:41:39.230" style="s2">hierarchy exists for the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.309" end="00:41:40.849" style="s2">hierarchy it&#39;s like and so that so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.230" end="00:41:42.910" style="s2">top of the hierarchy and us in a really</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.849" end="00:41:46.489" style="s2">important way as a sack is a sacrificial</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.910" end="00:41:48.589" style="s2">existence and so the highest thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.489" end="00:41:50.839" style="s2">is there the highest road is the one</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.589" end="00:41:53.390" style="s2">that sacrifices itself for those that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.839" end="00:41:54.710" style="s2">are yeah think about that you can think</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.390" end="00:41:56.450" style="s2">about that practically as the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.710" end="00:42:00.049" style="s2">willingness of a father to care for an</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.450" end="00:42:02.809" style="s2">infant yeah right now so because the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.049" end="00:42:05.630" style="s2">infants obviously the and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.809" end="00:42:07.700" style="s2">infant also has that potential which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.630" end="00:42:11.180" style="s2">why the infant is made sacred as well in</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.700" end="00:42:13.069" style="s2">that in that symbolic realm so the high</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.180" end="00:42:14.630" style="s2">is deserving the lowest the lowest is</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.069" end="00:42:16.849" style="s2">the infant let&#39;s say because it&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.630" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">helpless but the infant is also the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.849" end="00:42:20.570" style="s2">future of the hierarchy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:22.700" style="s2">and so the I mean I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.570" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">really in a we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.700" end="00:42:28.340" style="s2">before slightly is that the the notion</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:30.320" style="s2">that the Christian hero you know is</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.340" end="00:42:33.560" style="s2">slightly is actually slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.320" end="00:42:35.480" style="s2">from the pagan hero for example so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.560" end="00:42:38.810" style="s2">night let&#39;s say in Western Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.480" end="00:42:41.780" style="s2">the night would be the the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.810" end="00:42:45.230" style="s2">image of the Christian hero which is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.780" end="00:42:49.910" style="s2">notion of an aristocrat a warrior you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.230" end="00:42:53.320" style="s2">know a soldier whose purpose is not to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.910" end="00:42:56.030" style="s2">it is not only to gain honor on himself</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.320" end="00:42:58.070" style="s2">but in a way he gains honor on himself</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.030" end="00:43:00.740" style="s2">by sacrificing himself</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.070" end="00:43:03.080" style="s2">for those who can&#39;t do it and so he his</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.740" end="00:43:04.820" style="s2">honor is based on the fact that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.080" end="00:43:07.850" style="s2">willing to fight for the for the widow</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.820" end="00:43:08.990" style="s2">for the orphan for those that that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.850" end="00:43:11.510" style="s2">have the strength to fight for</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.990" end="00:43:13.550" style="s2">themselves and so obviously in reality</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.510" end="00:43:16.100" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t always play out I mean but</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.550" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">but the ideal is there the ideal is real</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.100" end="00:43:21.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s the basis of all our all</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:24.530" style="s2">our hero movies all our hero stories</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.620" end="00:43:26.450" style="s2">always had this idea of the here is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.530" end="00:43:28.490" style="s2">person who&#39;s willing to use their</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.450" end="00:43:30.470" style="s2">strength and their power to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.490" end="00:43:32.330" style="s2">defense&#39;s weak yeah to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.470" end="00:43:33.800" style="s2">themselves for the for the weak</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.330" end="00:43:36.260" style="s2">which is very different from the pagan</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.800" end="00:43:38.420" style="s2">hero like a you know a killer his</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.260" end="00:43:45.260" style="s2">weakness weakness was contemptible under</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.420" end="00:43:48.020" style="s2">those circumstances is sitting in his</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.260" end="00:43:51.140" style="s2">tent and he&#39;s moping and whining because</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.020" end="00:43:53.690" style="s2">we&#39;ve taken away his sex slave and he</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.140" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">won&#39;t go back to fight until it affects</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.690" end="00:43:58.010" style="s2">him personally you know but he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:00.200" style="s2">actually not he doesn&#39;t care that much</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.010" end="00:44:02.360" style="s2">about helping you know the Greeks and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.200" end="00:44:04.520" style="s2">their cause he&#39;s really doing that doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.360" end="00:44:06.530" style="s2">things for his own honor and so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.520" end="00:44:08.810" style="s2">perfectly heroic and sitting in his tent</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.530" end="00:44:10.940" style="s2">and moping and not going back into into</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.810" end="00:44:12.950" style="s2">battle you know because his honor has</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.940" end="00:44:16.430" style="s2">been attained whereas in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.950" end="00:44:19.850" style="s2">you know in stories like like if you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.430" end="00:44:21.950" style="s2">Sir Gawain and uh you you read um the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.850" end="00:44:24.860" style="s2">the the the night and a cart for example</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.950" end="00:44:28.820" style="s2">that idea of Lancelot who is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.860" end="00:44:31.310" style="s2">be seen as a criminal as a you know as</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.820" end="00:44:32.680" style="s2">the worst kind of person in order to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.310" end="00:44:34.850" style="s2">save the help</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.680" end="00:44:36.710" style="s2">damsel-in-distress you know he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.850" end="00:44:38.840" style="s2">willing to sacrifice all his honor in</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.710" end="00:44:40.550" style="s2">order to help that that person who is in</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.840" end="00:44:48.740" style="s2">danger so it&#39;s a really it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.550" end="00:44:52.250" style="s2">different way of seeing the world okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.740" end="00:44:54.020" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know what to say after the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.250" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">whole thing but it&#39;s a the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.020" end="00:45:00.410" style="s2">cross absolutely I&#39;m not I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:02.210" style="s2">suggesting at all that that was not</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.410" end="00:45:04.250" style="s2">relevant to what we&#39;ve been discussing</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.210" end="00:45:06.590" style="s2">it&#39;s dead relevant I really like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.250" end="00:45:09.080" style="s2">idea I know we&#39;ve talked about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.590" end="00:45:11.780" style="s2">that you know I&#39;ve been conceptualizing</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.080" end="00:45:14.300" style="s2">Christ as the not as the apex of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.780" end="00:45:15.860" style="s2">hierarchy symbolically speaking but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.300" end="00:45:18.110" style="s2">apex to such a degree that it actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.860" end="00:45:22.910" style="s2">detaches itself from the hierarchy sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.110" end="00:45:25.870" style="s2">of like Horus the bird the the Osprey or</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.910" end="00:45:28.070" style="s2">the what the hell is he a falcon in</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.870" end="00:45:29.720" style="s2">Egyptian symbolism right he&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.070" end="00:45:32.750" style="s2">that flies above everything that can see</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.720" end="00:45:36.200" style="s2">or the Egyptian I and your correction</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.750" end="00:45:38.030" style="s2">was that it&#39;s not exact once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.200" end="00:45:40.280" style="s2">detached in some sense you&#39;re not at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.030" end="00:45:42.050" style="s2">top anymore you&#39;re everywhere right</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.280" end="00:45:43.640" style="s2">spread throughout the entire structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.050" end="00:45:45.620" style="s2">which yeah which is a very good way of</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.640" end="00:45:48.620" style="s2">looking at it right the story of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.620" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">is in historian in his symbolism you see</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.620" end="00:45:52.370" style="s2">that he&#39;s at the top of the dome let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:54.470" style="s2">say in the church where he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.370" end="00:45:56.690" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re saying this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.470" end="00:45:59.030" style="s2">did this kind of detached top of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.690" end="00:46:02.180" style="s2">hierarchy but then he also stretches all</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.030" end="00:46:04.730" style="s2">the way down into death into Hades into</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.180" end="00:46:07.190" style="s2">de chaos and the cross is the other side</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.730" end="00:46:10.370" style="s2">where you know he is he&#39;s outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.190" end="00:46:12.380" style="s2">city being being killed by by his</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.370" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">friends by the you know he&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.380" end="00:46:16.310" style="s2">outcast he&#39;s all of those things and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:18.320" style="s2">he he unites the two extremes of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.310" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">hierarchy together and fills the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.320" end="00:46:22.700" style="s2">hierarchy with with well a neat little</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:23.840" style="s2">idea that he transcends death again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.700" end="00:46:26.180" style="s2">just gonna take this from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.840" end="00:46:28.190" style="s2">psychological perspective because the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.180" end="00:46:31.100" style="s2">theological waters are getting too deep</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.190" end="00:46:33.350" style="s2">for me here well they are because I</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.100" end="00:46:35.090" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that exactly I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.350" end="00:46:36.980" style="s2">trying to work it out but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.090" end="00:46:39.080" style="s2">understand it well enough yet but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.980" end="00:46:41.450" style="s2">idea that Christ descends into hell and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.080" end="00:46:43.220" style="s2">rescues people from hell and death that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.450" end="00:46:45.300" style="s2">can be read quite straightforwardly</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.220" end="00:46:50.610" style="s2">psychologically because the car</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.300" end="00:46:52.500" style="s2">acquaints of not of erecting a category</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.610" end="00:46:54.660" style="s2">structure that isn&#39;t predicated on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.500" end="00:46:57.510" style="s2">hero is that everyone will be in hell</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.660" end="00:46:59.130" style="s2">and die mm-hmm so I mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.510" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">happened in the Soviet Union as far as</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.130" end="00:47:02.970" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned and so those health</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:04.950" style="s2">stories are real enough as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.970" end="00:47:07.410" style="s2">concerned but that doesn&#39;t speak to</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.950" end="00:47:09.060" style="s2">their potential transcendent reality now</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.410" end="00:47:10.860" style="s2">as a whole different issue I mean here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.060" end="00:47:13.260" style="s2">something else that&#39;s been that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.860" end="00:47:15.690" style="s2">bugging me and I&#39;m just starting to</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.260" end="00:47:17.400" style="s2">think this through you don&#39;t I do think</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.690" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s an idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.400" end="00:47:20.700" style="s2">you&#39;re in the right place at the right</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:22.770" style="s2">time that everything comes together and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.700" end="00:47:27.810" style="s2">loads up you know and I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.770" end="00:47:30.840" style="s2">you know how the story like the story of</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.810" end="00:47:33.060" style="s2">Christ is told in many many ways like</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.840" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">from the cosmic to the microcosmic right</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.060" end="00:47:37.260" style="s2">so and one of the macrocosmic stories is</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:39.420" style="s2">the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.260" end="00:47:41.340" style="s2">astrological speculations and Christ</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.420" end="00:47:43.290" style="s2">himself and so there are 12</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.340" end="00:47:45.570" style="s2">constellations like there are 12</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.290" end="00:47:47.700" style="s2">disciples and huh the Sun is Christ</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.570" end="00:47:49.620" style="s2">essentially yeah and that story really</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.700" end="00:47:51.420" style="s2">works it even Maps onto the calendar</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.620" end="00:47:53.370" style="s2">properly right and so then you think</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.420" end="00:47:54.900" style="s2">well that&#39;s because people have one</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.370" end="00:47:57.630" style="s2">interpretation of that is that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.900" end="00:48:01.140" style="s2">people have retold the story at each</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.630" end="00:48:03.300" style="s2">level of analysis but another possible</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.140" end="00:48:05.670" style="s2">reason for that is that it&#39;s synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.300" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">in some sense and then it is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.670" end="00:48:10.620" style="s2">that everything comes together around</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.840" style="s2">that central axis in a in a in a real</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.620" end="00:48:14.940" style="s2">way yeah and that the story can&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.840" end="00:48:16.650" style="s2">but be represented at multiple levels of</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.940" end="00:48:18.600" style="s2">reality simultaneously because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.650" end="00:48:20.700" style="s2">what the story is that&#39;s then that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.600" end="00:48:22.560" style="s2">mean it&#39;s like that&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.700" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">about the whole the whole thing is about</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.560" end="00:48:27.650" style="s2">this this this lining up of everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:31.710" style="s2">you know like of everything yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.650" end="00:48:33.300" style="s2">yes okay it&#39;s hard to see that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.710" end="00:48:34.890" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to see the fullness of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.300" end="00:48:36.990" style="s2">when you look at it it always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.890" end="00:48:38.610" style="s2">jars you because it&#39;s so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.990" end="00:48:41.010" style="s2">story of Christ I always tell people</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.610" end="00:48:42.810" style="s2">like if you pay attention to it it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.010" end="00:48:46.590" style="s2">constantly be knocking you down because</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.810" end="00:48:47.640" style="s2">it it seems even at a first glance</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.590" end="00:48:49.590" style="s2">sometimes it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.640" end="00:48:52.050" style="s2">contradictory because Christ is all</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.590" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">these things like you know he&#39;s he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.050" end="00:48:56.820" style="s2">teacher he&#39;s the king he&#39;s the shepherd</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:58.510" style="s2">you know he&#39;s the outcast he&#39;s the he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.820" end="00:49:00.340" style="s2">he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.510" end="00:49:02.290" style="s2">technician you know he&#39;s the artist he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.340" end="00:49:04.330" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like how is it that a story</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.290" end="00:49:06.100" style="s2">Canon company and the more you look in</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.330" end="00:49:08.050" style="s2">the story the way he&#39;s a fisherman you</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.100" end="00:49:10.420" style="s2">know he&#39;s into all these things how did</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.050" end="00:49:12.490" style="s2">all these things can fit in one story</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.420" end="00:49:13.960" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to glance over because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.490" end="00:49:15.550" style="s2">short you read a gospel you kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.960" end="00:49:17.170" style="s2">through it but then if you really look</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.550" end="00:49:19.150" style="s2">at all the the aspects and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.170" end="00:49:21.400" style="s2">understand the traditional categories</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.150" end="00:49:26.170" style="s2">let&#39;s say that in a normal world the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.400" end="00:49:27.850" style="s2">let&#39;s say the the Shepherd and the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.170" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">agriculturalists usually are not the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.850" end="00:49:32.500" style="s2">same person but in Christ they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:35.740" style="s2">same person he&#39;s able but he&#39;s slower as</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.500" end="00:49:37.840" style="s2">he fish exact he&#39;s but he&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.740" end="00:49:39.430" style="s2">fisherman yeah and he&#39;s so he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.840" end="00:49:41.620" style="s2">stumbling stone but he&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.430" end="00:49:42.760" style="s2">capstone so he stretch it like a we talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.620" end="00:49:45.190" style="s2">about this idea of stretching out the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.760" end="00:49:47.380" style="s2">entire hierarchy so he&#39;s he&#39;s like he</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.190" end="00:49:48.450" style="s2">he&#39;s that&#39;s he&#39;s the stone that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.380" end="00:49:51.100" style="s2">fit</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.450" end="00:49:53.860" style="s2">so here&#39;s yeah right exactly that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.100" end="00:49:55.780" style="s2">builder rejected yeah okay so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.860" end="00:49:57.940" style="s2">things I&#39;ve I&#39;ve come to understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.780" end="00:49:59.650" style="s2">about tyrannies is that if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.940" end="00:50:02.320" style="s2">terror terror analytical person at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.650" end="00:50:05.530" style="s2">top the tyranny isn&#39;t just at the top</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.320" end="00:50:09.220" style="s2">the tyranny is mirrored like the entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.530" end="00:50:11.500" style="s2">hierarchy right it&#39;s like like a what</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.220" end="00:50:13.750" style="s2">are those 3d holographs it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.500" end="00:50:16.810" style="s2">are hologram it&#39;s like a hologram every</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.750" end="00:50:19.270" style="s2">part is a reflection of the whole and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.810" end="00:50:20.770" style="s2">I wonder if that&#39;s analogous if you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.270" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">a pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.770" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">say with the principle of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:27.190" style="s2">hero at the top then what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:30.130" style="s2">that&#39;s reflected at every single level</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.190" end="00:50:32.320" style="s2">of the of the hierarchy yes like it</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.130" end="00:50:32.740" style="s2">would be with the tyranny right yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.320" end="00:50:36.270" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.740" end="00:50:39.250" style="s2">except that yeah except that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.270" end="00:50:42.060" style="s2">yeah the tyranny is will be just that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.250" end="00:50:45.070" style="s2">that kind of up down like that top-down</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.060" end="00:50:47.230" style="s2">you know light that shines down and kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.070" end="00:50:48.580" style="s2">of puts everything in place and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.230" end="00:50:51.550" style="s2">when it reaches the things that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.580" end="00:50:53.830" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that it can&#39;t absorb it&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.550" end="00:50:55.240" style="s2">it&#39;ll completely cut them off you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.830" end="00:50:57.190" style="s2">like it&#39;ll kill them it&#39;ll burn them off</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.240" end="00:50:59.350" style="s2">you know it&#39;ll just destroy them whereas</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.190" end="00:51:03.640" style="s2">there&#39;s something about Christianity or</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.350" end="00:51:06.280" style="s2">like a traditional hierarchy which is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.640" end="00:51:09.190" style="s2">stretching out in so so you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.280" end="00:51:12.069" style="s2">imagine right let&#39;s say in terms of all</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.190" end="00:51:15.279" style="s2">of Christianity it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.069" end="00:51:21.699" style="s2">I think there really there is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.279" end="00:51:23.469" style="s2">like a place let&#39;s say for it&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.699" end="00:51:25.089" style="s2">in in the world there&#39;s a plate until</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.469" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">the Last Judgement let&#39;s say until the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.089" end="00:51:28.779" style="s2">Last Judgement there&#39;s a place for that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:31.359" style="s2">buffer to be there and to be slowly</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.779" end="00:51:33.039" style="s2">assimilated right and so so it&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.359" end="00:51:35.619" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t totally shut itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.039" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">off there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.619" end="00:51:39.670" style="s2">there&#39;s room there&#39;s a gate you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:41.469" style="s2">like you said and there&#39;s always people</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.670" end="00:51:43.509" style="s2">that can come through the gate and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.469" end="00:51:47.199" style="s2">are always kind of entering and slowly</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.509" end="00:51:49.150" style="s2">being signified assimilated but not just</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.199" end="00:51:50.979" style="s2">assimilated but also transforming it yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.150" end="00:51:52.930" style="s2">what it&#39;s going to be into what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.979" end="00:51:54.579" style="s2">going to become but it&#39;s a but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.930" end="00:51:56.829" style="s2">it&#39;s not a radical process it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.579" end="00:51:58.420" style="s2">this organic transformation let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.829" end="00:52:00.369" style="s2">well that&#39;s a huge part of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.420" end="00:52:03.759" style="s2">arguing about right now in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.369" end="00:52:06.369" style="s2">which is how is it that you handle the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.759" end="00:52:08.709" style="s2">integration let&#39;s say and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.369" end="00:52:11.199" style="s2">isn&#39;t no integration no because what</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.709" end="00:52:12.759" style="s2">that does is rigidify the structure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.199" end="00:52:14.949" style="s2">because if you if you close it off</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.759" end="00:52:17.650" style="s2">completely you also rigidify it inside</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.949" end="00:52:20.170" style="s2">yeah and so what that means is the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.650" end="00:52:22.449" style="s2">is gonna break forth inside so cuz you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.170" end="00:52:23.769" style="s2">can&#39;t get rid of the chaos now now you</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.449" end="00:52:26.410" style="s2">know one of the things we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.769" end="00:52:28.779" style="s2">so it&#39;s out for example with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.410" end="00:52:30.999" style="s2">gay marriage so now there&#39;s the excluded</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.779" end="00:52:32.789" style="s2">are included and then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.999" end="00:52:35.890" style="s2">well what what is then the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.789" end="00:52:38.249" style="s2">responsibility of the included and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.890" end="00:52:40.839" style="s2">responsibility of the included is to not</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.249" end="00:52:43.329" style="s2">break the structure of the system that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.839" end="00:52:44.829" style="s2">included them yeah you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.329" end="00:52:46.959" style="s2">really that&#39;s a really good way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.829" end="00:52:48.279" style="s2">seeing that because that&#39;s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.959" end="00:52:51.489" style="s2">actually probably the best way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.279" end="00:52:53.469" style="s2">understanding understanding it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.489" end="00:52:55.779" style="s2">of how it works itself out in real life</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.469" end="00:52:58.479" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know if you come in if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.779" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">come in as you know an assimilated</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.479" end="00:53:03.940" style="s2">margin you know as as a margin wants to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:05.589" style="s2">participate in in a country or in an</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.940" end="00:53:08.229" style="s2">identity or in a group or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.589" end="00:53:10.959" style="s2">like in a club like your responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.229" end="00:53:13.690" style="s2">is like you said is to not break what</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.959" end="00:53:15.999" style="s2">makes that something thank you you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.690" end="00:53:18.339" style="s2">if you want to if you want to be you</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.999" end="00:53:21.279" style="s2">know if you want to join a I know a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.339" end="00:53:22.509" style="s2">baseball group and you in a baseball</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.279" end="00:53:24.610" style="s2">team and you come into the team and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.509" end="00:53:26.260" style="s2">you&#39;re the newbie on the team and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.610" end="00:53:29.080" style="s2">and you all of a sudden expect everybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.260" end="00:53:31.450" style="s2">to to play basket to play basketball</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.080" end="00:53:32.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like well then why like what would</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.450" end="00:53:35.260" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t you know you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.980" end="00:53:37.360" style="s2">destroy the class I can&#39;t destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.260" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">club itself exactly no do you think</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.360" end="00:53:41.170" style="s2">that&#39;s a victorious simple way yes well</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:42.940" style="s2">we talked about that a little bit with</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.170" end="00:53:44.830" style="s2">the abrahamic stories if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.940" end="00:53:46.750" style="s2">correctly because there was the problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.830" end="00:53:51.730" style="s2">in the Abrahamic stories of how to deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.750" end="00:53:53.260" style="s2">with the marginal and so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.730" end="00:53:55.270" style="s2">unfortunately I can&#39;t recreate that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.260" end="00:53:58.570" style="s2">on-the-fly husband Pat like you it had</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.270" end="00:54:00.040" style="s2">to do with hospitality behavior yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.570" end="00:54:02.830" style="s2">right so the rule is I show you</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.040" end="00:54:04.810" style="s2">hospitality but that&#39;s my rule my</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.830" end="00:54:07.330" style="s2">obligation but your obligation is not to</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.810" end="00:54:10.060" style="s2">do not to make passes at my wife and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.330" end="00:54:12.490" style="s2">disrupt my household yeah right and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.060" end="00:54:15.220" style="s2">and then a relationship builds with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.490" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">stranger and then and then slowly the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.220" end="00:54:21.160" style="s2">stranger you know it becomes a friend</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:22.720" style="s2">you know and maybe you then maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.160" end="00:54:24.580" style="s2">stranger marries your daughter at some</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.720" end="00:54:26.860" style="s2">point right it&#39;s like you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.580" end="00:54:29.350" style="s2">that there&#39;s like the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.860" end="00:54:31.600" style="s2">creating a relationship which which will</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.350" end="00:54:34.300" style="s2">integrate the two identities together</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.600" end="00:54:37.300" style="s2">but it&#39;s a gradual process and one which</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.300" end="00:54:38.620" style="s2">has to be done you know with mutual</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.300" end="00:54:40.570" style="s2">respect and yeah that&#39;s right well you</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.620" end="00:54:42.130" style="s2">know the proper spirit well I would I</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.570" end="00:54:44.080" style="s2">would say that would be the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.130" end="00:54:47.470" style="s2">the logos because the logos is also the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.080" end="00:54:49.720" style="s2">thing that goes outside boundaries like</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.470" end="00:54:51.940" style="s2">so let&#39;s say you have person from Group</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.720" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">A here in person from Group B here and</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.940" end="00:54:55.780" style="s2">then they decided to communicate both of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:59.080" style="s2">them have to go outside their group and</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.780" end="00:55:01.090" style="s2">meet in in the junction between the two</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.080" end="00:55:03.550" style="s2">groups is a different place and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.090" end="00:55:05.800" style="s2">have to make peace but they make peace</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.550" end="00:55:07.870" style="s2">there under the guise of themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.800" end="00:55:09.580" style="s2">individuals exploratory individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.870" end="00:55:12.940" style="s2">then maybe the groups can integrate as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.580" end="00:55:14.890" style="s2">consequence of that right and they then</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.940" end="00:55:16.690" style="s2">knowing apart and without fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.890" end="00:55:19.140" style="s2">something appears like something will</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.690" end="00:55:21.580" style="s2">manifest itself as whatever is is</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.140" end="00:55:23.530" style="s2">holding you know the two groups together</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.580" end="00:55:26.560" style="s2">the two families are the two people and</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.530" end="00:55:27.730" style="s2">so that logos will with the coming</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.560" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">together let&#39;s say let&#39;s say two</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.730" end="00:55:32.020" style="s2">families is a good example you have two</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:34.120" style="s2">families you know and then they then</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.020" end="00:55:37.540" style="s2">people in the two families intermarry</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.120" end="00:55:38.380" style="s2">and so there&#39;s something that unites</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.540" end="00:55:40.479" style="s2">them too</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.380" end="00:55:43.269" style="s2">you know and and it&#39;s the in the coming</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.479" end="00:55:46.660" style="s2">together that that logos will appear and</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.269" end="00:55:49.390" style="s2">will hold hold the relationships in that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.660" end="00:55:52.569" style="s2">lace that marriage is a recreation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.390" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">that masculine feminine you yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.569" end="00:55:56.739" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s associated sometimes with</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:58.779" style="s2">the androgyny of Christ and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.739" end="00:56:00.940" style="s2">with there&#39;s an old idea and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.779" end="00:56:04.900" style="s2">remember where it comes from that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.940" end="00:56:07.779" style="s2">Adam before Eve was not for Didache</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.900" end="00:56:10.420" style="s2">right yeah more androgynous and draw</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.779" end="00:56:12.880" style="s2">hydrogenous right and that Christ as the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.420" end="00:56:15.579" style="s2">second Adam recreates that a draw and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.880" end="00:56:17.579" style="s2">drogyny in the proper manner yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.579" end="00:56:20.650" style="s2">think so I think I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.579" end="00:56:21.999" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s some use find it in</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.650" end="00:56:23.709" style="s2">some of the church fathers where they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.999" end="00:56:26.349" style="s2">say things like just to help you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.709" end="00:56:30.009" style="s2">understand and understand it they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.349" end="00:56:34.839" style="s2">things that like that God separated Adam</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.009" end="00:56:38.289" style="s2">and Eve Adam into two in view of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.839" end="00:56:41.289" style="s2">fall right in the sense that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.289" end="00:56:44.920" style="s2">the fall but it was the idea that it had</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.289" end="00:56:46.509" style="s2">to it has to do with the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.920" end="00:56:49.180" style="s2">living outside the garden let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.509" end="00:56:51.309" style="s2">and and and having then to come back</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.180" end="00:56:53.589" style="s2">together and that coming back together</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.309" end="00:56:57.209" style="s2">in in terms of sexual union and in terms</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.589" end="00:56:59.349" style="s2">of procreation then is becomes a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.209" end="00:57:01.329" style="s2">microcosm of what was in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.349" end="00:57:03.190" style="s2">let&#39;s say right and so and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.329" end="00:57:04.869" style="s2">also you know like you know Adam I</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.190" end="00:57:07.589" style="s2">wonder if that&#39;s actually I wonder to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.869" end="00:57:10.420" style="s2">what degree that&#39;s actually let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.589" end="00:57:12.190" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say neurophysiological II true</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.420" end="00:57:14.170" style="s2">but I&#39;m gonna say something like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.190" end="00:57:15.940" style="s2">because it seems to me and I made</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.170" end="00:57:18.309" style="s2">allegiance to this when we did that talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.940" end="00:57:19.449" style="s2">about logos men people maybe thought</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.309" end="00:57:22.359" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t the most appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.449" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">thing to say but sexual Union produces</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.359" end="00:57:28.449" style="s2">this this brief union in paradise yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:31.150" style="s2">think if that&#39;s the that&#39;s the highest</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.449" end="00:57:33.459" style="s2">that&#39;s the highest point of sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.150" end="00:57:36.579" style="s2">and that&#39;s why sexuality is used as an</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.459" end="00:57:38.920" style="s2">image for the union of the soul with God</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.579" end="00:57:40.809" style="s2">and it&#39;s used as an image of the union</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.920" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">of the church with Christ because the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.809" end="00:57:45.910" style="s2">idea that the unit that the union of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.839" end="00:57:48.099" style="s2">masculine and the feminine is a glimpse</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.910" end="00:57:49.779" style="s2">of eternity it&#39;s a glimpse of paradise</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.099" end="00:57:52.130" style="s2">well and I I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.779" end="00:57:53.660" style="s2">idea yeah I can t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.130" end="00:57:55.460" style="s2">that&#39;s our can it actually happens yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.660" end="00:57:58.700" style="s2">yeah I think that it actually happens</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.460" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">yeah I think so yeah and that&#39;s why also</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.700" end="00:58:04.100" style="s2">I think that in in Christianity the idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:06.080" style="s2">of taking that lightly right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.100" end="00:58:08.510" style="s2">dangerous the idea of uniting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.080" end="00:58:10.850" style="s2">with with all kinds of people he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.510" end="00:58:12.680" style="s2">dangerous because you when you unite</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.850" end="00:58:16.610" style="s2">yourself with someone you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.680" end="00:58:19.100" style="s2">creating a very powerful spiritual unity</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.610" end="00:58:21.800" style="s2">you know and then if you kind of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.100" end="00:58:24.710" style="s2">that and yet shallow then you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.800" end="00:58:26.540" style="s2">your heart yeah you&#39;re devaluing it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.710" end="00:58:28.880" style="s2">and it also to rip you apart because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.540" end="00:58:30.920" style="s2">leave a part of yourself with that other</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.880" end="00:58:32.510" style="s2">person and you leave a part of it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.920" end="00:58:34.460" style="s2">you leave you&#39;re kind of still attached</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.510" end="00:58:36.140" style="s2">to someone and you&#39;re leaving a part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.460" end="00:58:38.930" style="s2">your soul whatever with that person and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.140" end="00:58:40.700" style="s2">they ripped apart so you had what makes</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.930" end="00:58:43.220" style="s2">your sin that you might say it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.700" end="00:58:45.890" style="s2">cynical yeah which I would say I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.220" end="00:58:48.230" style="s2">that sleeping with a hundred women would</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.890" end="00:58:49.990" style="s2">leave you cynical for sure I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.230" end="00:58:53.690" style="s2">how it wouldn&#39;t I don&#39;t see how it went</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.990" end="00:58:55.220" style="s2">you would yes yes yeah well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.690" end="00:58:56.510" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the question no I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.220" end="00:58:59.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.510" end="00:59:03.890" style="s2">that yeah so we would at least leave you</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.240" end="00:59:06.020" style="s2">in a position of you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.890" end="00:59:07.610" style="s2">person who only eats caviar let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.020" end="00:59:09.830" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t understand how precious</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.610" end="00:59:11.540" style="s2">things are you know and to not</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.830" end="00:59:13.970" style="s2">understand how precious things are as to</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.540" end="00:59:16.370" style="s2">devalue them right if you if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.970" end="00:59:18.200" style="s2">well if that&#39;s the highest thing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.370" end="00:59:20.540" style="s2">you&#39;re devaluing then you end up like</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.200" end="00:59:22.220" style="s2">Cain with Abel like he kills Abel his</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.540" end="00:59:24.500" style="s2">highest ideal and then he says the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.220" end="00:59:26.390" style="s2">punishment is more than he can bear so</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.500" end="00:59:29.120" style="s2">if you take what actually is the highest</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.390" end="00:59:33.800" style="s2">value and devalue it then you&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.120" end="00:59:36.140" style="s2">without hope yeah yeah yeah no I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.800" end="00:59:37.550" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s why I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.140" end="00:59:40.370" style="s2">know but it&#39;s like the people that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.550" end="00:59:43.220" style="s2">known in my life who who who who sleep</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.370" end="00:59:46.970" style="s2">around a lot they tend to to have a kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.220" end="00:59:49.970" style="s2">of nihilistic tendency let&#39;s say a blase</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.970" end="00:59:53.120" style="s2">tendency like to not how well things can</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.970" end="00:59:55.550" style="s2">be discarded yeah yeah and and that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.120" end="00:59:58.370" style="s2">that and that moment of Union let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.550" end="01:00:01.010" style="s2">is also pretty much devalued to just</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.370" end="01:00:03.500" style="s2">brief pleasure yeah that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.010" end="01:00:05.150" style="s2">that it&#39;s conceptualized you know when</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.500" end="01:00:05.690" style="s2">it is the case to that if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.150" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.690" end="01:00:11.720" style="s2">miscue &#39;ti in teenagers it&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:13.220" style="s2">with antisocial behavior hmm yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.720" end="01:00:16.040" style="s2">strong predictor or strong correlative</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.220" end="01:00:17.930" style="s2">antisocial behavior interesting yeah now</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.040" end="01:00:20.390" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s a causal</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.930" end="01:00:22.190" style="s2">relationship there but I am saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.390" end="01:00:27.050" style="s2">part of the same constellation right</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.190" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">that&#39;s quite clear hmm so yeah all right</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.050" end="01:00:32.720" style="s2">well that&#39;s probably enough of that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:34.460" style="s2">yeah okay okay well that was good man I</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.720" end="01:00:35.990" style="s2">I was thinking about these things when I</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.460" end="01:00:39.070" style="s2">woke up this morning you know like for</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.990" end="01:00:43.130" style="s2">about an hour I mean they were just</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.070" end="01:00:45.410" style="s2">flash like crazy yeah you&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.130" end="01:00:47.660" style="s2">excited look on you I can I can tend to</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.410" end="01:00:49.970" style="s2">discern it now yeah well it&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.660" end="01:00:54.020" style="s2">you know it&#39;s too much this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.970" end="01:00:55.220" style="s2">thing really is just so it&#39;s like Christ</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.020" end="01:00:57.320" style="s2">I&#39;d like to get up in the morning and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.220" end="01:01:01.580" style="s2">think about raking the backyard or</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.320" end="01:01:03.950" style="s2">something like that yeah so oh well that</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.580" end="01:01:05.480" style="s2">was really good Jonathan you think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.950" end="01:01:07.220" style="s2">you think that way no you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.480" end="01:01:12.380" style="s2">good like you think that we got to what</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.220" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">we wanted we have ya know if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.380" end="01:01:16.040" style="s2">want like think about it I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:17.120" style="s2">because we had a whole bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.040" end="01:01:20.690" style="s2">that we said we wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.120" end="01:01:22.850" style="s2">yeah I mean maybe we could we could make</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.690" end="01:01:24.830" style="s2">it like whatever every two months or</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.850" end="01:01:27.290" style="s2">every month or something well I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.830" end="01:01:28.700" style="s2">that I&#39;ll have the way my mind is</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.290" end="01:01:32.060" style="s2">working right now I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.700" end="01:01:34.100" style="s2">have some ideas that you you&#39;ll be the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.060" end="01:01:36.200" style="s2">right person to talk to about so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.100" end="01:01:38.150" style="s2">well like I said I&#39;m here&#39;s see you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.200" end="01:01:42.500" style="s2">one of these weird intersectional people</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.150" end="01:01:44.750" style="s2">a you&#39;re a Greek Orthodox wrote French</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.500" end="01:01:47.180" style="s2">Canadian icon Carla knows a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.750" end="01:01:49.220" style="s2">post-modernism it&#39;s like I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.180" end="01:01:54.050" style="s2">probably exactly one of you in the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.220" end="01:01:55.790" style="s2">fitty sure I&#39;m sure that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.050" end="01:01:58.460" style="s2">that is why like I&#39;ve always been a</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.790" end="01:02:01.550" style="s2">marginal person that&#39;s why I understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.460" end="01:02:03.440" style="s2">it so well but I think that the key the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.550" end="01:02:06.620" style="s2">key to my situation right now is that I</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.440" end="01:02:09.620" style="s2">I kind of saw it but now I also see how</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.620" end="01:02:12.140" style="s2">it can serve the the center let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.620" end="01:02:14.060" style="s2">and so that&#39;s my job in life I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.140" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much I think what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.060" end="01:02:17.660" style="s2">supposed to be right well that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:19.160" style="s2">way of ending because the postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.660" end="01:02:20.570" style="s2">claim the postmodern er</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.160" end="01:02:23.090" style="s2">his claim is that the center should</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.570" end="01:02:24.980" style="s2">serve the margin now but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.090" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2">counterclaim is the margin should serve</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.980" end="01:02:29.630" style="s2">the center now and both those claims are</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:31.670" style="s2">right yeah and that&#39;s also related with</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.630" end="01:02:34.100" style="s2">that idea that you already described of</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.670" end="01:02:37.520" style="s2">of the image of Christ as the perfect</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.100" end="01:02:39.230" style="s2">man saturating the entire hierarchy yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.520" end="01:02:40.610" style="s2">no I agree and the first would be the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.230" end="01:02:41.870" style="s2">last and the last will be the first</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.610" end="01:02:43.580" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that in</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.870" end="01:02:45.500" style="s2">Christianity which is absolutely true</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.580" end="01:02:47.930" style="s2">that there that there&#39;s even something</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.500" end="01:02:49.790" style="s2">at there&#39;s even something weird that</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.930" end="01:02:52.070" style="s2">happens at the end or at the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.790" end="01:02:54.440" style="s2">where there&#39;s a mere reflection between</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.070" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">the bottom and the top where like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.440" end="01:02:58.280" style="s2">lowest thing would be the fool for</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:03:00.410" style="s2">example and the highest thing would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.280" end="01:03:03.620" style="s2">the the holy fool and so there is this</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.410" end="01:03:04.940" style="s2">strange completion that happens in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.620" end="01:03:06.560" style="s2">in the whole thing but it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.940" end="01:03:08.300" style="s2">very it becomes very mystical at that</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.560" end="01:03:11.000" style="s2">point it&#39;s hard to describe in in</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.300" end="01:03:13.310" style="s2">straight categories but well I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.000" end="01:03:15.350" style="s2">Marlowe&#39;s kind of an example of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.310" end="01:03:17.030" style="s2">well I&#39;m asking myself been asking</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.350" end="01:03:19.100" style="s2">myself that for months you know I did</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.030" end="01:03:22.730" style="s2">that interview with with dr. Rachel</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.100" end="01:03:23.840" style="s2">Fulton Browne about Yad Milo yeah and by</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.730" end="01:03:27.950" style="s2">the way she really like would like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.840" end="01:03:29.870" style="s2">talk to you anyways so that the thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.950" end="01:03:31.430" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering about him is that in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.870" end="01:03:34.010" style="s2">in the holy fool usually there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.430" end="01:03:35.960" style="s2">of self-depreciation and so st. Francis</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.010" end="01:03:38.150" style="s2">you know he would go out into the public</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.960" end="01:03:41.090" style="s2">space and strip naked you know and he</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.150" end="01:03:43.250" style="s2">would he would pass for for a beggar and</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.090" end="01:03:45.260" style="s2">all those things and so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.250" end="01:03:48.650" style="s2">that might be a requirement for the Holy</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.260" end="01:03:50.810" style="s2">fool is is that the the the humor is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.650" end="01:03:52.640" style="s2">only against the people around them but</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.810" end="01:03:54.980" style="s2">also it turns back on themselves</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.640" end="01:03:57.920" style="s2">constantly and so that&#39;s what makes them</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.980" end="01:03:59.720" style="s2">the holy fool is that is that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.920" end="01:04:01.760" style="s2">criticize them because as as much as</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.720" end="01:04:03.740" style="s2">they&#39;re criticizing the rulers they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.760" end="01:04:06.380" style="s2">the structure of the order it turns back</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.740" end="01:04:08.630" style="s2">on them and then they act as the lowest</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.380" end="01:04:11.030" style="s2">of the low so there&#39;s that&#39;s what is is</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.630" end="01:04:12.710" style="s2">is able to hold them to to hold them in</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.030" end="01:04:15.800" style="s2">that high place so something to think</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.710" end="01:04:18.620" style="s2">about okay all right all right well I&#39;m</p>
