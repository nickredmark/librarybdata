<p begin="00:02:22.250" end="00:02:25.850" style="s2">intimate because smaller number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.020" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">people so anyway yeah take a look at it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.850" end="00:02:29.300" style="s2">yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:32.140" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna start as we did last time</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.300" end="00:02:35.330" style="s2">by picking up just a couple of comments</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.140" end="00:02:40.550" style="s2">questions that we got last time that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.330" end="00:02:41.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to so for them first question</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.550" end="00:02:45.620" style="s2">from last time</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.780" end="00:02:48.709" style="s2">not from episode 27 but from episode 26</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.620" end="00:02:50.120" style="s2">hi guys my girlfriend says that trans</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.709" end="00:02:52.580" style="s2">rights activists make the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.120" end="00:02:54.739" style="s2">between gender what you choose and sex</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.580" end="00:02:55.850" style="s2">how you are born she seems to think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.739" end="00:02:59.090" style="s2">you are misinformed</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.850" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">any thoughts so many thoughts yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.090" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">number one question is the girlfriend a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.790" end="00:03:06.320" style="s2">keeper right that really dictates which</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:08.060" style="s2">strategy you use in response to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.320" end="00:03:10.070" style="s2">question I don&#39;t think it needs to know</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.060" end="00:03:11.989" style="s2">okay now I think you might as well just</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.070" end="00:03:13.340" style="s2">go full truth on this one either way</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.989" end="00:03:13.730" style="s2">actually you&#39;ll find out if she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.340" end="00:03:17.890" style="s2">keeper</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.730" end="00:03:24.110" style="s2">yes consider it some sort of a test yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.890" end="00:03:25.790" style="s2">yes so gender which is what we call in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.110" end="00:03:28.220" style="s2">humans what we would call sex role in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.790" end="00:03:30.680" style="s2">other species is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.220" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">behavioral manifestation of your sex so</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.680" end="00:03:35.420" style="s2">yes there is a distinction but they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:38.209" style="s2">tightly linked and so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.420" end="00:03:40.100" style="s2">evolutionary and where you draw the line</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.209" end="00:03:43.510" style="s2">between what is quote unquote biological</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.100" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">and what is quite a quote social is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.510" end="00:03:49.010" style="s2">somewhat up to you although we tend not</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:52.459" style="s2">to talk in those terms because the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.010" end="00:03:54.470" style="s2">is it&#39;s all evolutionary so the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.459" end="00:03:56.540" style="s2">that gender fellows from sex sex is</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.470" end="00:03:58.430" style="s2">binary gender isn&#39;t gender is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.540" end="00:04:00.680" style="s2">manifestation of your sex traditional</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.430" end="00:04:03.739" style="s2">gender roles we&#39;re much closer to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.680" end="00:04:06.820" style="s2">bimodal to to binary than they are now</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.739" end="00:04:08.930" style="s2">at this point your sex does not decide</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.820" end="00:04:10.579" style="s2">nearly as many things about what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.930" end="00:04:13.570" style="s2">options you have in the universe are as</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.579" end="00:04:16.310" style="s2">they did even even 50 years ago frankly</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.570" end="00:04:18.739" style="s2">but the idea that gender is simply a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.310" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">choice that is independent of what your</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.739" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">sex is or independent of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">process is wrong and I would say one</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:27.470" style="s2">more thing which is that not only is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:30.020" style="s2">that true but trans rights activists as</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.470" end="00:04:33.380" style="s2">compared to actual trans people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.020" end="00:04:36.140" style="s2">mostly not in our experience on board</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.380" end="00:04:37.760" style="s2">with the tra ideology also pull a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.140" end="00:04:39.500" style="s2">mountain Bailey and the so they say this</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.760" end="00:04:43.250" style="s2">as if it&#39;s an argument which it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.500" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">but even if it even if it were they will</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.250" end="00:04:48.710" style="s2">also then say actually even sex isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:50.510" style="s2">real so they have two arguments both of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.710" end="00:04:53.150" style="s2">which are wrong one of which is more</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.510" end="00:04:54.920" style="s2">patently wrong than the other but even</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.150" end="00:04:57.140" style="s2">the sort of the weaker form of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.920" end="00:05:01.610" style="s2">argument which is that gender is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.140" end="00:05:05.930" style="s2">choice and sex is biological isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.610" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">right so the tag line that I use is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.930" end="00:05:11.750" style="s2">gender is the software of sex and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:14.030" style="s2">that does suggest is the gender is more</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.750" end="00:05:17.210" style="s2">flexible it&#39;s varied it varies more</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.030" end="00:05:19.430" style="s2">between cultures it is not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.210" end="00:05:21.380" style="s2">plastic but the thing that was in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.430" end="00:05:25.660" style="s2">middle of Heather&#39;s excellent rant there</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.380" end="00:05:28.850" style="s2">was that just the fact that something is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.660" end="00:05:31.790" style="s2">cultural rather than genetic does not</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.850" end="00:05:33.200" style="s2">mean that it isn&#39;t evolutionary both of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.790" end="00:05:34.850" style="s2">these things are evolutionary they</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.200" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">travel separately through time so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.850" end="00:05:41.540" style="s2">have this dual inheritance pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:43.760" style="s2">gender is not perfectly free now can we</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.540" end="00:05:46.580" style="s2">free it if we want to at this moment in</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.760" end="00:05:49.250" style="s2">history we can but the idea that because</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.580" end="00:05:52.520" style="s2">it is not encoded genetically that it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.250" end="00:05:53.540" style="s2">somehow free from the logical rules of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.520" end="00:05:55.550" style="s2">the universe is just nuts</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.540" end="00:05:58.340" style="s2">yeah which is not an attack in anybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.550" end="00:06:01.130" style="s2">and and you know evergreen being what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.340" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">was we had numerous strands students</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.130" end="00:06:04.820" style="s2">many more than we would likely have had</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:07.040" style="s2">were we to teach somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.820" end="00:06:11.600" style="s2">we had very strong relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.040" end="00:06:14.600" style="s2">them I you traveled abroad with trans</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:16.310" style="s2">students so anyway it&#39;s I think the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.600" end="00:06:19.160" style="s2">thing is Heather makes this distinction</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.310" end="00:06:24.110" style="s2">between trans people and trans rights</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.160" end="00:06:25.729" style="s2">activists and I can&#39;t say what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.110" end="00:06:28.370" style="s2">overlap is but I can say there are great</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.729" end="00:06:30.229" style="s2">many people in the trans rights activist</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.370" end="00:06:33.530" style="s2">movement who don&#39;t sound anything like</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.229" end="00:06:35.510" style="s2">the trans people who we knew were</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.530" end="00:06:38.300" style="s2">wonderful I think without exception</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.510" end="00:06:40.640" style="s2">that&#39;s right and I guess we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.300" end="00:06:41.930" style="s2">actually said a fair bit about this I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.640" end="00:06:44.390" style="s2">think I think there&#39;s a rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.930" end="00:06:46.070" style="s2">video of me talking about this and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.390" end="00:06:47.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t a few places and it will can we</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.070" end="00:06:50.210" style="s2">will continue to talk about this for</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.750" end="00:06:52.849" style="s2">sure but one more thing that I will say</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.210" end="00:06:56.390" style="s2">that I have said before is that if I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.849" end="00:06:59.750" style="s2">were coming of age right now as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.390" end="00:07:01.630" style="s2">tomboy that I was people would probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.750" end="00:07:04.669" style="s2">be telling me that I was trans and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.630" end="00:07:07.370" style="s2">that&#39;s simply it&#39;s offensive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.669" end="00:07:08.990" style="s2">regressive it&#39;s disgusting not that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.370" end="00:07:12.260" style="s2">being trans is disgusting but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.990" end="00:07:14.630" style="s2">that I as a girl who didn&#39;t didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.260" end="00:07:17.000" style="s2">stereotypical gender norms who far</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.630" end="00:07:19.700" style="s2">preferred dirt to dresses and climbing</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.000" end="00:07:23.510" style="s2">trees to playing with dolls was somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.700" end="00:07:25.490" style="s2">therefore revealing my inner inner truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.510" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">as a boy no I never wanted to be a boy I</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.490" end="00:07:30.770" style="s2">liked playing with boys but it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:34.640" style="s2">have anything to do with feeling like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.770" end="00:07:36.860" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a girl nope just just abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.640" end="00:07:38.870" style="s2">many other additional gender norms so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.860" end="00:07:41.690" style="s2">that was something that was true in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.870" end="00:07:44.060" style="s2">70s and 80s which is now less true which</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.690" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">means that this is also the ideology</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.060" end="00:07:47.870" style="s2">anyway is regressive it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:50.030" style="s2">regressive it&#39;s actually sexist and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.870" end="00:07:52.280" style="s2">would say misogynistic yeah and actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.030" end="00:07:54.410" style="s2">you know you were the first person that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.280" end="00:07:56.090" style="s2">I heard make this argument I&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.410" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">heard several other people make it</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.090" end="00:08:01.750" style="s2">including Katy Hertzog and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:04.430" style="s2">forgetting as a list of three or four</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.750" end="00:08:06.169" style="s2">amazing women who have now said</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.430" end="00:08:10.340" style="s2">something along these lines JK Rowling</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.169" end="00:08:12.140" style="s2">actually said this and so what are we</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.340" end="00:08:14.630" style="s2">doing that we&#39;re tinkering with</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.140" end="00:08:17.960" style="s2">something that makes amazing women I</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.630" end="00:08:21.710" style="s2">mean it just it&#39;s a it&#39;s a crazy thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.960" end="00:08:25.310" style="s2">to be messing with and you know it is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.710" end="00:08:27.050" style="s2">is misogynistic and anyway it&#39;s gotta</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.310" end="00:08:32.180" style="s2">stop yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.050" end="00:08:33.529" style="s2">all right so I&#39;m this is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.180" end="00:08:35.450" style="s2">self-serving maybe but I&#39;m reading this</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.529" end="00:08:36.979" style="s2">comment from last time this is not only</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.450" end="00:08:39.019" style="s2">the most important podcast but quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.979" end="00:08:40.760" style="s2">possibly in all of modern history but</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.019" end="00:08:42.260" style="s2">it&#39;s also the most prescient so that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.760" end="00:08:43.789" style="s2">the word I liked here particularly</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.260" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">awareness of these issues is of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.789" end="00:08:47.240" style="s2">utmost impressing importance I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a little extreme I would say most</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.240" end="00:08:53.510" style="s2">important podcast in the last 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:56.180" style="s2">oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.510" end="00:08:58.970" style="s2">next penultimate question from last time</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.180" end="00:09:00.920" style="s2">what subject or subjects in k-12 school</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.970" end="00:09:03.740" style="s2">were you least interested or proficient</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.920" end="00:09:05.570" style="s2">in and then interestingly Jim not</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.740" end="00:09:07.160" style="s2">included and I actually don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.570" end="00:09:10.850" style="s2">your relationship Jim was but I love Jim</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.160" end="00:09:14.029" style="s2">well I mean so far we had Jim in LA in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.850" end="00:09:16.910" style="s2">the 70s and 80s wasn&#39;t I seem like some</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.029" end="00:09:20.839" style="s2">aspects of it like I remember climbing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.910" end="00:09:23.269" style="s2">rope ceiling test yeah and then I</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.839" end="00:09:25.370" style="s2">remember we had a dumb racetrack where</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.269" end="00:09:32.450" style="s2">nobody had corrected for the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.370" end="00:09:34.730" style="s2">the outer the outer path was longer kids</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.450" end="00:09:37.160" style="s2">corrected for it because we knew but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.730" end="00:09:39.079" style="s2">whoever painted those damn life no they</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.160" end="00:09:42.529" style="s2">just drew it like as a radiant oh my</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.079" end="00:09:45.320" style="s2">goodness yeah it was it was almost like</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.529" end="00:09:47.450" style="s2">you know scenery automatically filled in</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.320" end="00:09:49.940" style="s2">by some sort of algorithm that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.450" end="00:09:51.110" style="s2">particularly well programmed but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.940" end="00:09:53.720" style="s2">learned from that certain thing okay but</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.110" end="00:09:55.700" style="s2">putting aside from Jim we had such</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.720" end="00:09:58.279" style="s2">totally different experiences in school</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.700" end="00:09:59.899" style="s2">and this again we could speak for hours</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.279" end="00:10:01.880" style="s2">and hours about this and maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.899" end="00:10:06.190" style="s2">devote an episode at some point later to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.880" end="00:10:08.630" style="s2">just what school was each of us but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.190" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">mean I it&#39;s gonna be hard for me to come</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.630" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">up with something because you know even</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.010" end="00:10:14.329" style="s2">the stuff that was good was such a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:18.430" style="s2">terrible failure in my case but I do</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.329" end="00:10:18.430" style="s2">remember you clearly learned nothing</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.880" end="00:10:30.140" style="s2">I&#39;ll show them right no the the I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.100" end="00:10:34.790" style="s2">remember learning the state capitals and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.140" end="00:10:37.310" style="s2">I remember thinking that I had never</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.790" end="00:10:40.070" style="s2">heard of half of these cities and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.310" end="00:10:40.490" style="s2">wasn&#39;t sure at what point it was going</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.070" end="00:10:42.890" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.490" end="00:10:44.209" style="s2">important that I had heard of them and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.890" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">just sort of felt like this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.209" end="00:10:48.380" style="s2">is on autopilot right yes state capitals</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:50.420" style="s2">mattered a hundred years ago right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.380" end="00:10:53.060" style="s2">yet you know so we were also of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.420" end="00:10:54.589" style="s2">forced to work learn the states which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.060" end="00:10:56.300" style="s2">relevant like if you&#39;re if you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.589" end="00:10:58.279" style="s2">United States and frankly better</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.300" end="00:10:59.420" style="s2">geography instead of being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.279" end="00:11:01.670" style="s2">learn the state capitals</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.420" end="00:11:02.899" style="s2">yeah being being forced to learn the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.670" end="00:11:05.300" style="s2">countries in Africa which you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.899" end="00:11:07.160" style="s2">granted changes faster than the state</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.300" end="00:11:09.560" style="s2">capitals but you know actual good</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.160" end="00:11:12.470" style="s2">geography would be super valuable right</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.560" end="00:11:14.300" style="s2">on the other hand you know I I granted</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.470" end="00:11:16.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not that easy it would take maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.300" end="00:11:18.440" style="s2">you know an hour but they couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.250" end="00:11:21.470" style="s2">run us through like boundary layers</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.440" end="00:11:23.390" style="s2">right or reversion to the mean or</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.470" end="00:11:26.180" style="s2">something really useful content the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.390" end="00:11:29.029" style="s2">third grade yes the earlier the better</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.180" end="00:11:30.830" style="s2">you just wouldn&#39;t use that language</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.029" end="00:11:32.540" style="s2">necessarily no we certainly did with our</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.830" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">children when they were in third grade</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.540" end="00:11:38.060" style="s2">but you don&#39;t you do it empirically you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:42.589" style="s2">do it right yeah no but I mean I will</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.060" end="00:11:46.310" style="s2">say there&#39;s there&#39;s a again a ton to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.589" end="00:11:48.950" style="s2">said here but I I loved school and I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.310" end="00:11:51.860" style="s2">good at school and I specifically loved</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.950" end="00:11:56.180" style="s2">English and arts and science and math</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.860" end="00:12:00.050" style="s2">and the subjects that I couldn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.180" end="00:12:03.740" style="s2">get into were foreign languages I took</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.050" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">French for no good reason and I just</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.740" end="00:12:08.270" style="s2">made no sense to me learning it in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:09.890" style="s2">framework and I don&#39;t have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.270" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">skill for learning foreign languages</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.890" end="00:12:13.459" style="s2">anyway I now see having now lived in</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.589" style="s2">french-speaking Madagascar and having</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.459" end="00:12:18.140" style="s2">lived in Spanish speaking Latin America</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.589" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">I come it&#39;s it&#39;s not great but also</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.140" end="00:12:24.200" style="s2">history like I had so few history</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:26.390" style="s2">teachers that made it come alive that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.200" end="00:12:28.430" style="s2">weren&#39;t doing that sort of that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.390" end="00:12:30.740" style="s2">learned the state capitals version of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.430" end="00:12:32.300" style="s2">history here&#39;s a litany of dates and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.740" end="00:12:34.670" style="s2">events without context without</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.300" end="00:12:36.410" style="s2">explanation without analysis that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.670" end="00:12:38.829" style="s2">couldn&#39;t fathom why you would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.410" end="00:12:42.290" style="s2">interested in it that it really was only</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.829" end="00:12:44.420" style="s2">through you know autodidactic history</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.290" end="00:12:46.730" style="s2">but learning it on my own that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.420" end="00:12:48.529" style="s2">came to really grasp but the big</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.730" end="00:12:49.760" style="s2">exception there being actually that at</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.529" end="00:12:51.830" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.760" end="00:12:54.380" style="s2">at the high school where we met</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.830" end="00:12:57.320" style="s2">ultimately there was a great book a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.380" end="00:12:58.970" style="s2">great books program which really did the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.320" end="00:13:01.670" style="s2">sort of interface of literature and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.970" end="00:13:04.070" style="s2">history and so in that I did room and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.670" end="00:13:06.050" style="s2">read I read Marx and I read Mao and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.070" end="00:13:10.040" style="s2">read Lenin and Hobbes and Locke and</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.040" end="00:13:15.500" style="s2">and I don&#39;t remember most of it but I</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.520" end="00:13:17.060" style="s2">still have the books and that that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.500" end="00:13:19.850" style="s2">the way to learn the history and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.060" end="00:13:22.310" style="s2">philosophy of our country and of others</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.870" end="00:13:30.470" style="s2">dumb tract so I was in the okay books</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.820" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">program which wasn&#39;t nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.470" end="00:13:34.520" style="s2">interesting yeah you got Jack and Jill</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:35.930" style="s2">climbing the hill oh man yeah I pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.520" end="00:13:37.580" style="s2">much figured out what was going on with</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.930" end="00:13:38.300" style="s2">Jack and Jill but I you know I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.580" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">get Hobbes</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.300" end="00:13:43.550" style="s2">remembered all of it every bit yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:46.940" style="s2">no really school for me was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.550" end="00:13:49.640" style="s2">like a Milgram experiment trainer you</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.940" end="00:13:52.310" style="s2">know which I passed every day from</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.640" end="00:13:54.110" style="s2">second grade on I was not putting up</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.310" end="00:13:56.680" style="s2">with that experimenters bullshit but no</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.110" end="00:13:59.530" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get a lot from the content yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.680" end="00:14:01.580" style="s2">okay final question from a last time</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.530" end="00:14:05.450" style="s2">where do you guys get your news these</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.580" end="00:14:07.250" style="s2">days yeah you have to source it on your</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.450" end="00:14:09.230" style="s2">own because every source seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.250" end="00:14:11.720" style="s2">compromised if you tune into any sources</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.230" end="00:14:13.370" style="s2">if it&#39;s good it&#39;s not good because</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.720" end="00:14:15.110" style="s2">you&#39;ll get the bullshit that comes</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.370" end="00:14:17.240" style="s2">through that same channel yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.110" end="00:14:20.440" style="s2">would say there are some places that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.240" end="00:14:22.580" style="s2">look you know I definitely look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.440" end="00:14:25.190" style="s2">rising which actually I will be on</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.580" end="00:14:27.710" style="s2">tomorrow so rising is pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.190" end="00:14:29.830" style="s2">the hill it&#39;s on the hill TV for me if</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.710" end="00:14:35.710" style="s2">you surprising to me until yesterday on</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.830" end="00:14:38.330" style="s2">the hill yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s quite good I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.710" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">definitely use reddit I there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.330" end="00:14:42.440" style="s2">certain subreddits that I go to and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:44.120" style="s2">there are people who post things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:46.010" style="s2">are useful and that will often point me</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.120" end="00:14:47.780" style="s2">to you know when the Atlantic is saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.010" end="00:14:49.640" style="s2">I will find myself reading stuff there</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.780" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">when it&#39;s insane I don&#39;t necessarily go</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.640" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">I mean I still stone Matt Taibbi has</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:58.430" style="s2">been on fire he has been absolutely on</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:14:59.610" style="s2">fire so Matt if you&#39;re out there keep it</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.380" end="00:15:10.080" style="s2">I&#39;m more wary of some of them than</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:13.620" style="s2">others but the Atlantic and Harper&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.080" end="00:15:17.070" style="s2">two that I am mostly still appreciative</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.620" end="00:15:19.769" style="s2">of the kind of long form journalism that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.070" end="00:15:21.720" style="s2">they do I had to give up on other Jones</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.140" end="00:15:35.310" style="s2">know left-leaning enough that you that</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.310" end="00:15:43.529" style="s2">particular lens spectator yeah sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.260" end="00:15:45.750" style="s2">the Federalists sometimes not so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.529" end="00:15:49.140" style="s2">the other thing is nobody has really</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.750" end="00:15:52.140" style="s2">described the method but through Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.140" end="00:15:55.140" style="s2">and other things using people you trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.140" end="00:15:56.220" style="s2">to help filter the garbage so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.140" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing the stuff that actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.220" end="00:16:04.860" style="s2">has content is a very useful process yep</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:07.230" style="s2">okay first question from the livestream</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.860" end="00:16:09.540" style="s2">that just ended it seems that occupies</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.230" end="00:16:11.250" style="s2">focus on economic inequality was closest</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.540" end="00:16:12.180" style="s2">we&#39;ve been to striking at a real enemy</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.250" end="00:16:14.370" style="s2">agreed</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.180" end="00:16:16.529" style="s2">has shift to the more superficial or</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.370" end="00:16:18.089" style="s2">divisive concerns after Occupy but an</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.529" end="00:16:20.459" style="s2">engineered strategy to move discourse</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.089" end="00:16:22.850" style="s2">away from economic realities was</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.459" end="00:16:26.250" style="s2">occupying threat to the status quo I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.850" end="00:16:28.380" style="s2">would say it was a threat to the status</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.250" end="00:16:31.649" style="s2">quo and and had one significant</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.380" end="00:16:33.660" style="s2">accomplishment it lodged the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.649" end="00:16:35.850" style="s2">99 percent which is not a precisely</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.660" end="00:16:39.510" style="s2">right idea but it&#39;s an accurate enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.850" end="00:16:40.829" style="s2">idea so to me the 99 percent if you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.510" end="00:16:42.690" style="s2">just get people to look at it and say</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.829" end="00:16:44.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a 1 percent and there&#39;s a 99</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.690" end="00:16:46.529" style="s2">percent and somehow policy is serving</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.339" end="00:16:48.930" style="s2">the 1 percent to the extent that that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.529" end="00:16:51.329" style="s2">accurate it raises a question how the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.930" end="00:16:53.490" style="s2">hell are you gonna get a democracy to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.329" end="00:16:55.350" style="s2">make policy in favor of one percent and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.490" end="00:16:59.100" style="s2">against 99 percent it would seem like</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.350" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">every single election there would be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.100" end="00:17:05.069" style="s2">campaign to have policy that served the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:07.500" style="s2">people enacted cynically or not right</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.069" end="00:17:09.179" style="s2">that would be a hugely popular program</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.500" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">so how is it that you keep that from</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.179" end="00:17:13.200" style="s2">breaking out in a democracy if you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:15.000" style="s2">figure out that that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.200" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">now you know what&#39;s going on and now you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.000" end="00:17:20.010" style="s2">know why we have a move that has decided</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:23.160" style="s2">that all of the inequities in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:26.730" style="s2">universe are due to racism that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.160" end="00:17:29.070" style="s2">seen or detected with a any tool of any</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.730" end="00:17:31.260" style="s2">kind but it&#39;s there and I can&#39;t be cured</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.070" end="00:17:33.510" style="s2">but it must be right that&#39;s how we got</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.260" end="00:17:35.490" style="s2">there right we&#39;re doing this instead of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.510" end="00:17:37.410" style="s2">addressing the obvious glaring problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.490" end="00:17:39.630" style="s2">that argue that occupy was initially</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.410" end="00:17:43.170" style="s2">targeted at which frankly the initial</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.630" end="00:17:45.060" style="s2">Tea Party was also targeted at so both</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.170" end="00:17:48.150" style="s2">of those movements got co-opted and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.060" end="00:17:50.370" style="s2">became silly or worse in the end and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.150" end="00:17:52.050" style="s2">we&#39;re now seeing occupy 2.0 fused with</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.370" end="00:17:55.650" style="s2">black lives matter that&#39;s now explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.050" end="00:17:56.850" style="s2">true we are seeing occupy revived inside</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.650" end="00:17:59.850" style="s2">of this movement oh I didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.850" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">that&#39;s it was it yeah where did I just</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.850" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">see it there&#39;s a Occupy protests in New</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:07.530" style="s2">York and I&#39;ve forgotten what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:09.930" style="s2">they&#39;re oh yes it&#39;s an Occupy something</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.530" end="00:18:12.680" style="s2">or other that is demanding a 1 billion</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.930" end="00:18:15.270" style="s2">dollar reduction in the police budget</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.680" end="00:18:16.950" style="s2">something like that so anyway yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.270" end="00:18:19.410" style="s2">a New York City police budget yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.950" end="00:18:19.830" style="s2">that&#39;ll help what could possibly go</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.410" end="00:18:22.410" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.830" end="00:18:25.020" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine um so anyway yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.410" end="00:18:27.300" style="s2">it was a threat it was defanged</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.020" end="00:18:29.700" style="s2">the idea didn&#39;t go away though you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.300" end="00:18:31.950" style="s2">the 99% is not invoked very often</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.700" end="00:18:35.310" style="s2">anymore but it definitely penetrated the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.950" end="00:18:38.460" style="s2">public mind it did yeah and now I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.310" end="00:18:40.410" style="s2">say take a look at the hidden tribes</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.460" end="00:18:43.920" style="s2">report the hidden tribes report</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.410" end="00:18:46.830" style="s2">describes an 86% in the middle of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.920" end="00:18:48.210" style="s2">who have more or less shared values but</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.830" end="00:18:50.280" style="s2">are very tired because we were being</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.210" end="00:18:52.260" style="s2">pushed around by fringe ideologies on</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.280" end="00:18:54.180" style="s2">both the far left and far right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.260" end="00:18:54.630" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of I saw somebody invoke it</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.180" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.630" end="00:19:00.630" style="s2">so that is Mayor said Jonathan Hertzog</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">but anyway the idea was we are the 86%</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.630" end="00:19:06.210" style="s2">which i think is great yeah that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:08.730" style="s2">great it&#39;s a little it took my brain a</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.210" end="00:19:11.550" style="s2">moment to switch that 86% is not within</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.730" end="00:19:13.380" style="s2">same reference to the 1% right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.550" end="00:19:15.330" style="s2">a it&#39;s a totally different metric well</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.380" end="00:19:17.210" style="s2">it was the innovation of whoever made</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.330" end="00:19:22.440" style="s2">this tweet if it was Jonathan or not but</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.210" end="00:19:24.900" style="s2">but somehow just as somehow the 1% is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.440" end="00:19:26.650" style="s2">making policy and the 99% can&#39;t figure</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.900" end="00:19:29.170" style="s2">out how to get policy made on its be</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.650" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">the 40% appears to have captured at</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.740" style="s2">RNC as well the 86 percent in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.270" end="00:19:37.180" style="s2">is not getting its needs taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.740" end="00:19:41.740" style="s2">because the two fringes are pushing</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.180" end="00:19:45.340" style="s2">around the the policy so anyway it is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.740" end="00:19:49.300" style="s2">similar glaring defect in our system</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.340" end="00:19:52.180" style="s2">that needs to be addressed yep okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.300" end="00:19:54.460" style="s2">unity 2020 is the plan</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.180" end="00:19:56.200" style="s2">unity 2020 is the plan to be awarded</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.460" end="00:19:58.150" style="s2">enough electoral college votes in order</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.200" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">to put the decision to the house if this</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.150" end="00:20:01.809" style="s2">isn&#39;t the plan please elaborate on your</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:03.640" style="s2">specific path forward which states show</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.809" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">the most promise for a dark horse what</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.640" end="00:20:09.700" style="s2">about Kasich yang my crowd seeing it cry</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:12.640" style="s2">such yes it&#39;s catchy um so let me</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.700" end="00:20:15.960" style="s2">address these in sequence one we thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.640" end="00:20:19.690" style="s2">our biggest obstacle was ballot access</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.960" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">it turns out there are at least four</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.690" end="00:20:24.670" style="s2">paths to ballot access that would not</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:28.540" style="s2">require this to be thrown to the house</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.670" end="00:20:30.490" style="s2">so all I will say is it does not make</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.540" end="00:20:32.220" style="s2">sense for us to discuss the details of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.490" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">that plan yet that actually we will</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.220" end="00:20:36.370" style="s2">remove some of the potential by</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">discussing them ahead of time in other</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.370" end="00:20:41.500" style="s2">words people who are not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:44.200" style="s2">seeing us restore power to the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.500" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">will take up arms against it and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.200" end="00:20:47.830" style="s2">more they know the worse off we are but</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:49.720" style="s2">what I would say is stay tuned you will</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:20:51.850" style="s2">very quickly discover what those routes</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.720" end="00:20:53.260" style="s2">are and we can talk about which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.850" end="00:20:55.210" style="s2">most likely and it may be that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.260" end="00:20:56.620" style="s2">hybrid strategy but there are ways to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.210" end="00:20:59.740" style="s2">it we were actually pleasantly surprised</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.620" end="00:21:04.150" style="s2">when we looked into this matter and as</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.740" end="00:21:06.220" style="s2">far as Kasich yang which states show the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.150" end="00:21:07.660" style="s2">most promise and what about quesadilla</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.220" end="00:21:09.610" style="s2">well it&#39;s not a which states we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.660" end="00:21:10.390" style="s2">talking about all 50 states and this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.610" end="00:21:12.280" style="s2">plausible</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.390" end="00:21:13.990" style="s2">we you know we tried to talk ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.280" end="00:21:15.340" style="s2">out of this because if it wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.990" end="00:21:17.020" style="s2">possible we didn&#39;t want to put our necks</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.340" end="00:21:18.700" style="s2">out but we ended up talking ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.020" end="00:21:19.960" style="s2">into the fact that this is possible you</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.700" end="00:21:23.500" style="s2">know what you can do to make it more</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.960" end="00:21:25.570" style="s2">possible sign up add to our numbers it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.500" end="00:21:27.550" style="s2">costs you nothing it takes no time and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.570" end="00:21:29.740" style="s2">if you do it then people who are looking</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.550" end="00:21:31.750" style="s2">at us thinking that&#39;s a really cool plan</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.740" end="00:21:33.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s never gonna work those people</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.750" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">will start to come over and what you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.160" end="00:21:36.580" style="s2">get is positive feedback and positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:38.390" style="s2">feedback as you know is the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.580" end="00:21:41.420" style="s2">powerful force in the universe so</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.390" end="00:21:42.410" style="s2">let&#39;s get there all right the last</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.420" end="00:21:45.250" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.410" end="00:21:49.100" style="s2">Kasich yang you know we have a list of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.250" end="00:21:51.620" style="s2">people who if either yang or McRaven are</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.100" end="00:21:52.700" style="s2">not available for this or are unwilling</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.620" end="00:21:53.960" style="s2">and frankly I don&#39;t think either of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.700" end="00:21:56.210" style="s2">would be unwilling but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.960" end="00:21:58.910" style="s2">question about can they and if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.210" end="00:22:00.410" style="s2">can&#39;t then we have a list of people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.910" end="00:22:03.080" style="s2">could slot in either place you will</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.410" end="00:22:05.420" style="s2">notice in our document the articles of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.080" end="00:22:07.340" style="s2">unity we do not mention any candidates</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.420" end="00:22:09.650" style="s2">because the important thing is the plan</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.340" end="00:22:11.270" style="s2">and there are great many people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.650" end="00:22:12.590" style="s2">could inhabit either of these spots and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.270" end="00:22:13.160" style="s2">would do an excellent job because of</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.160" end="00:22:18.560" style="s2">the key to any administration is going</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.890" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">to be who it&#39;s listening to right who is</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.850" end="00:22:34.850" style="s2">every topic so it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.590" end="00:22:36.290" style="s2">question of who they bring in and how</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.850" end="00:22:38.330" style="s2">they make decisions and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.290" end="00:22:39.530" style="s2">patriotic and they&#39;re courageous and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.330" end="00:22:43.240" style="s2">they&#39;re capable and they bring in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.530" end="00:22:46.430" style="s2">right people why are we on a better path</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.240" end="00:22:48.890" style="s2">next question is depression an</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.430" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">evolutionary adaptation if so then</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.890" end="00:22:55.250" style="s2">what&#39;s the benefit the cost incurred</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:58.610" style="s2">seems extremely high mm-hmm you want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.250" end="00:23:00.260" style="s2">go over so I would say first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.610" end="00:23:02.030" style="s2">the person to go to on this is Randy</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.260" end="00:23:03.560" style="s2">Nesi who actually is a friend of ours</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.030" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">from when we were in graduate school I</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.560" end="00:23:07.220" style="s2">took several did you ever take anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:10.090" style="s2">from Randy it was in seminars with him</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.220" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">but no classes so anyway he he is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.090" end="00:23:17.210" style="s2">important force in in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">medicine in Darwinian medicine he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.210" end="00:23:22.610" style="s2">a co-wrote one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:25.790" style="s2">books why we get sick with George</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.610" end="00:23:27.410" style="s2">Williams who is now deceased but in any</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.790" end="00:23:29.000" style="s2">case they kicked off Williams who was</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.410" end="00:23:30.620" style="s2">one of the most important evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.000" end="00:23:32.570" style="s2">thinkers of the 20th century 20th</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.620" end="00:23:35.530" style="s2">century absolutely and also was a friend</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.570" end="00:23:39.050" style="s2">of ours he was quite quite old but</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.530" end="00:23:42.530" style="s2">anyway he is now gone so Nessie&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.050" end="00:23:44.360" style="s2">I hope I don&#39;t butcher this Randy I</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.530" end="00:23:47.810" style="s2">would say Nessie&#39;s point with which I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.360" end="00:23:50.930" style="s2">would agree is that there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.810" end="00:23:52.730" style="s2">evolutionary content in too</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.930" end="00:23:56.540" style="s2">in other words it&#39;s not a total failure</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.730" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">of the system it is a feature of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.540" end="00:24:02.420" style="s2">system that is adaptive that we see</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:05.480" style="s2">emerging in very harmful ways that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.420" end="00:24:07.190" style="s2">modernity has taken circuits that do</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.480" end="00:24:09.790" style="s2">something useful and it has unleashed</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.190" end="00:24:13.940" style="s2">them in ways that are harmful and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.790" end="00:24:16.720" style="s2">like that but I would just say and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.940" end="00:24:21.680" style="s2">fine a little piece you know is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.720" end="00:24:24.020" style="s2">paralysis an evolutionary adaptation yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.680" end="00:24:25.820" style="s2">it is when you&#39;re asleep it keeps you</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.020" end="00:24:27.650" style="s2">from hurting yourself right do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:28.820" style="s2">sometimes see people paralyzed when</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.650" end="00:24:30.980" style="s2">they&#39;re awake we do</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.820" end="00:24:32.990" style="s2">why would paralysis exist that seems</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.980" end="00:24:34.250" style="s2">like a terrible thing well it is if it</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.990" end="00:24:35.660" style="s2">happens to you at the wrong moment and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.250" end="00:24:36.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a very important thing if it</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.660" end="00:24:39.080" style="s2">happens to you at the right moment and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.770" end="00:24:41.060" style="s2">so the suggestion yes the depression</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.080" end="00:24:43.130" style="s2">will be very much like this so and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.060" end="00:24:45.620" style="s2">does it there&#39;s a nuance here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.130" end="00:24:47.510" style="s2">really important that the argument is</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.620" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">not the category isn&#39;t real depression</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.510" end="00:24:52.930" style="s2">isn&#39;t real or paralysis isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:56.510" style="s2">but that the other contextual factors</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.930" end="00:24:58.070" style="s2">that exist at the same time change the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.510" end="00:25:01.250" style="s2">answer to whether or not it&#39;s adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.070" end="00:25:03.260" style="s2">right so saying sometimes yes sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.250" end="00:25:04.940" style="s2">no does not mean that we are calling</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.260" end="00:25:06.650" style="s2">into question the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.940" end="00:25:09.020" style="s2">category and that I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.650" end="00:25:11.330" style="s2">actually a key point that many people</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.020" end="00:25:15.100" style="s2">who haven&#39;t thought evolutionarily a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.330" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">may not into it we miss yep and I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.100" end="00:25:19.220" style="s2">the risk of confusing people I would say</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:21.260" style="s2">that the same thing will turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.220" end="00:25:23.780" style="s2">true for suicide itself which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.260" end="00:25:26.540" style="s2">obviously a downstream con consequence</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.780" end="00:25:29.300" style="s2">of depression but that historically it</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.540" end="00:25:33.680" style="s2">was a very different object and that in</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.300" end="00:25:36.530" style="s2">modern times we frequently see very</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.680" end="00:25:39.650" style="s2">tragic meaningless suicides as a result</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.530" end="00:25:41.420" style="s2">of noisy data person can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.650" end="00:25:42.860" style="s2">where they are and what it means and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.420" end="00:25:44.690" style="s2">know I think we all feel that all the</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.690" end="00:25:49.310" style="s2">people to to resort to suicide is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.270" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">not too surprising it&#39;s also addressable</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.310" end="00:25:55.180" style="s2">if you think about what that implies so</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:55.180" style="s2">maybe we should do that too</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.290" end="00:26:01.040" style="s2">next question I&#39;m a lesbian and was told</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:02.750" style="s2">by several very masculine trans women</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.040" end="00:26:05.630" style="s2">that I need to quote get over my vagina</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.750" end="00:26:07.490" style="s2">fetish this seems eerily similar to</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.930" end="00:26:19.100" style="s2">should concern you it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.020" end="00:26:21.530" style="s2">simply wrong and we all know what a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.100" end="00:26:24.380" style="s2">lesbian is and that&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.530" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">this is why the I think this this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.380" end="00:26:29.450" style="s2">part of the evidence of the conflation</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:33.590" style="s2">of gender with sex this is and actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.450" end="00:26:38.210" style="s2">you know so I have I know a person I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.590" end="00:26:40.490" style="s2">gonna anonymize her somewhat who is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.210" end="00:26:43.100" style="s2">lesbian and it was in a relationship for</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.490" end="00:26:50.210" style="s2">many years and her partner transitioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.100" end="00:26:54.410" style="s2">and became unrecognizable to her and she</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.210" end="00:26:56.870" style="s2">broke up with the partner now</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.410" end="00:26:59.930" style="s2">identifying as a male and is now with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.870" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">new partner and the thing that my friend</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:11.540" style="s2">was not only did my previous partner</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.900" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">change in personality at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.540" end="00:27:17.150" style="s2">she was transitioning but I also</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:20.420" style="s2">realized that the changes physically</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.150" end="00:27:22.130" style="s2">were unappealing to me and I&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.420" end="00:27:23.900" style="s2">understand something that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.130" end="00:27:25.250" style="s2">have allowed myself to think before</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.900" end="00:27:27.230" style="s2">which is that I this friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.250" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">actually really prefer very feminine</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.230" end="00:27:32.680" style="s2">women you know that I that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:35.680" style="s2">just the the phenotype that I like and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.680" end="00:27:38.420" style="s2">I&#39;m being made to think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.680" end="00:27:40.220" style="s2">bigotry and the fact is like I&#39;ve chose</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.420" end="00:27:41.000" style="s2">this this woman I&#39;m with now this love</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.220" end="00:27:44.090" style="s2">of my life</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.000" end="00:27:45.590" style="s2">is a very slight feminine woman and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.090" end="00:27:47.150" style="s2">you had asked me 20 years ago I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.590" end="00:27:50.180" style="s2">this woman is a total badass you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.150" end="00:27:51.800" style="s2">she&#39;s very she&#39;s butch but she&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.180" end="00:27:53.150" style="s2">know she&#39;s very physically at Devon it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.800" end="00:27:55.700" style="s2">probably a tomboy yourself and all of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.150" end="00:27:56.840" style="s2">this and she&#39;s saying I&#39;m just I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.700" end="00:27:59.090" style="s2">not gonna be ashamed of this anymore</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.840" end="00:28:00.440" style="s2">like this is like this I&#39;m in love with</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.090" end="00:28:02.330" style="s2">this woman and it turns out that this</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.440" end="00:28:05.630" style="s2">woman happens to have the body type etc</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.330" end="00:28:06.980" style="s2">that I am also attracted to and guess</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.630" end="00:28:08.040" style="s2">what that&#39;s part of what being a lesbian</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.980" end="00:28:11.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.040" end="00:28:13.230" style="s2">being attracted to women not natal men</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.880" end="00:28:14.700" style="s2">who have declared that they&#39;re women no</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.230" end="00:28:16.440" style="s2">matter how much other things they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.700" end="00:28:18.090" style="s2">undergone and not to say that some</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.440" end="00:28:20.760" style="s2">people who are lesbians wouldn&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.090" end="00:28:23.010" style="s2">but the whole thing is ludicrous the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.760" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">whole thing is complete false this falls</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.010" end="00:28:27.690" style="s2">in Douglas Murray&#39;s category of things</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:34.020" style="s2">we knew until yesterday that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.690" end="00:28:36.360" style="s2">good it&#39;s a how the fuck is it that some</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.020" end="00:28:38.970" style="s2">man is telling a woman that he needs to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.360" end="00:28:41.880" style="s2">get over her vagina fetish is not sexual</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.970" end="00:28:44.550" style="s2">harassment or worse yes how is that not</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.880" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">obvious how is this not obvious I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.550" end="00:28:49.710" style="s2">basically I can&#39;t imagine if I was on</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:53.070" style="s2">the jury and she flat-out hit this</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.710" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">person I think he&#39;d asked for it if yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.070" end="00:28:57.720" style="s2">if the person writing the question had</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:29:02.310" style="s2">flat-out hit this very masculine trans</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.720" end="00:29:03.510" style="s2">woman directed to them and probably have</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.310" end="00:29:07.670" style="s2">sex with them in order to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.510" end="00:29:10.860" style="s2">your lack of transphobia until yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.670" end="00:29:13.260" style="s2">Douglas Murray&#39;s schema we knew that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.860" end="00:29:14.460" style="s2">this was insane yeah we knew right and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.260" end="00:29:21.810" style="s2">think the correct response might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.460" end="00:29:26.300" style="s2">something like good go back to arguments</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.810" end="00:29:27.480" style="s2">cool because that isn&#39;t one oh yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.300" end="00:29:30.030" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.480" end="00:29:32.070" style="s2">next question thank you to for all you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.030" end="00:29:35.460" style="s2">do here thanks also to your son yes ak</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.070" end="00:29:37.620" style="s2">yeah can you help me understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.460" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">attributes of a Maoist Revolution are</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.620" end="00:29:41.790" style="s2">I&#39;m having trouble wrapping my head</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:45.050" style="s2">around the concept whoo that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.790" end="00:29:47.670" style="s2">question well I mean let&#39;s first of all</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.050" end="00:29:50.730" style="s2">we will be attacked for saying that this</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.670" end="00:29:53.700" style="s2">is a Marxist revolution even though</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.730" end="00:29:55.380" style="s2">leaders of BLM have said into a camera</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.700" end="00:29:57.240" style="s2">that they are trained Marxist trained</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.380" end="00:29:58.740" style="s2">Marxists and that&#39;s what they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.240" end="00:30:00.630" style="s2">but nonetheless that we will still be</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.740" end="00:30:01.620" style="s2">wrong asserting that they are even</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.630" end="00:30:03.510" style="s2">though they have asserted that they are</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.620" end="00:30:05.640" style="s2">and many of their talking points are the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.510" end="00:30:07.350" style="s2">same ones as other people who have</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.640" end="00:30:09.300" style="s2">identified their movements as Marxist of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.350" end="00:30:11.250" style="s2">using things like looking to dismantle</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.300" end="00:30:13.080" style="s2">the nuclear family yeah right but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.250" end="00:30:14.820" style="s2">would say I mean and then sorry but that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.080" end="00:30:18.300" style="s2">like the dismantling of a nuclear family</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.820" end="00:30:20.850" style="s2">is actually straight out of Marx you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.300" end="00:30:21.870" style="s2">know he finds I think I think Marx and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.850" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">Engels in</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.870" end="00:30:26.970" style="s2">the Communist Manifesto specifically say</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.150" end="00:30:28.980" style="s2">that the you know that you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.970" end="00:30:31.909" style="s2">after the nuclear family as though sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.980" end="00:30:35.100" style="s2">of the center of the bourgeois thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.909" end="00:30:37.620" style="s2">before you can actually but as it sees</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.100" end="00:30:40.230" style="s2">the means of economic power etc etc said</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.620" end="00:30:43.080" style="s2">I don&#39;t have it here but yeah but think</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.230" end="00:30:45.539" style="s2">about this right this has everything to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.080" end="00:30:47.549" style="s2">do with cults breaking your connection</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.539" end="00:30:49.289" style="s2">to your friends and your family in order</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.549" end="00:30:50.940" style="s2">to invade your mind yeah because they</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.289" end="00:30:53.159" style="s2">need to deny you the reality check and</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.940" end="00:30:55.740" style="s2">so going after the nuclear family is</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.159" end="00:30:58.529" style="s2">multifaceted here there is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.740" end="00:31:01.110" style="s2">with the nuclear family in black America</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.529" end="00:31:03.090" style="s2">as I have argued it very plainly where</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.110" end="00:31:05.580" style="s2">does it come from it comes from a sex</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.090" end="00:31:08.190" style="s2">ratio difference where a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.580" end="00:31:10.470" style="s2">men are taken out of the mating pool and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.190" end="00:31:12.929" style="s2">what that does is it undercuts the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.470" end="00:31:14.760" style="s2">bargaining position of women mating and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.929" end="00:31:17.100" style="s2">dating in the black community this is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.760" end="00:31:18.840" style="s2">perfectly predictable demographic fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.100" end="00:31:21.929" style="s2">that has nothing to do with being black</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.840" end="00:31:24.360" style="s2">so that thing then causes men not to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.929" end="00:31:26.309" style="s2">stick around why because men who have</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.360" end="00:31:28.919" style="s2">lots of sexual options are harder to pin</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.309" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">down you know you can ask any woman with</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.919" end="00:31:34.010" style="s2">common sense if that&#39;s true and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:37.740" style="s2">will tell you that it is so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.010" end="00:31:39.960" style="s2">predictable catastrophe but rather than</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.740" end="00:31:41.340" style="s2">address the causes of the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.960" end="00:31:44.220" style="s2">they want to tear up everybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.340" end="00:31:45.659" style="s2">family which is insane right the nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.220" end="00:31:47.010" style="s2">family is very important it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.659" end="00:31:49.620" style="s2">important for many reasons including</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:51.809" style="s2">your nuclear family will provide you a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.620" end="00:31:54.500" style="s2">reality check when people tell you crazy</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.809" end="00:32:00.590" style="s2">stuff and insist that you say it too so</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.500" end="00:32:02.279" style="s2">it is it is in deep need of resistance</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.590" end="00:32:04.289" style="s2">there was some other part of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.279" end="00:32:05.190" style="s2">question what was it yeah well it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.289" end="00:32:08.340" style="s2">are the attributes of a Maoist</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.190" end="00:32:11.669" style="s2">revolution oh the horizontal nests right</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.340" end="00:32:13.049" style="s2">okay the fact yeah this thing comes at</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.669" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">all of that you know it comes at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.049" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">people close to it in the form of those</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">they know and then insists that they you</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">know it also uses the youth to spread</p>

<p begin="00:32:50.840" end="00:32:55.100" style="s2">something like share your blessings</p>

<p begin="00:32:56.390" end="00:33:02.810" style="s2">guilty that would be more effective that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:04.040" style="s2">suggests though that the people who are</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.600" end="00:33:27.830" style="s2">about right just like you know real</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.520" end="00:33:30.020" style="s2">apology is so valuable and real</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.830" end="00:33:32.390" style="s2">gratitude is so valuable because they</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.020" end="00:33:37.370" style="s2">are inherently honest you know it also</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.390" end="00:33:40.010" style="s2">strikes me that there is a verification</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.410" end="00:33:48.200" style="s2">in the sense that if you are if you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.690" end="00:33:51.320" style="s2">focused on what is wrong then you may</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.200" end="00:33:52.940" style="s2">view the world through very dark lenses</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.320" end="00:33:56.420" style="s2">and you may have the sense this thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.940" end="00:33:58.310" style="s2">has got to go right if you instead look</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.420" end="00:34:00.170" style="s2">at what&#39;s going right then you would</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.310" end="00:34:02.540" style="s2">understand that you can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.170" end="00:34:04.160" style="s2">afford to tear up Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.540" end="00:34:06.500" style="s2">because if you do you&#39;ll be way worse</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.160" end="00:34:08.270" style="s2">off which does not mean that you should</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.500" end="00:34:10.340" style="s2">not be demanding a fix for what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.270" end="00:34:11.510" style="s2">but it means that up ending the part</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.340" end="00:34:13.390" style="s2">that works because you&#39;re not noticing</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.510" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">it where you&#39;re discounting it is just</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:20.810" style="s2">to say and it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to make the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.350" end="00:34:22.730" style="s2">suggestion and the era of kovat but i</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.810" end="00:34:24.590" style="s2">used to say and i and i lived this both</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.730" end="00:34:26.270" style="s2">through what i and we did but also</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.590" end="00:34:29.570" style="s2">through running all those study abroad</p>

<p begin="00:34:32.360" end="00:34:39.380" style="s2">think is wrong with the US and our case</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.460" end="00:34:47.690" style="s2">for longer and then come back and see</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.580" end="00:34:48.140" style="s2">what functions here that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.690" end="00:34:50.930" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.140" end="00:34:53.000" style="s2">elsewhere and you know better the more</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.930" end="00:34:54.830" style="s2">of those other data points you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.000" end="00:34:56.450" style="s2">and yes it&#39;s your life and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.830" end="00:34:59.500" style="s2">doing it scientifically therefore it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.450" end="00:35:02.150" style="s2">series of anecdotes but there is I</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.500" end="00:35:04.340" style="s2">remember few other moments with as much</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.150" end="00:35:06.680" style="s2">clarity as coming back to the US after</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.340" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">the first of our long first just</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.680" end="00:35:12.740" style="s2">adventures and then field seasons and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:14.600" style="s2">just being thrilled for instance at</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.740" end="00:35:17.210" style="s2">knowing that there was going to be water</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.600" end="00:35:19.880" style="s2">that came out of the tap and the roads</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.210" end="00:35:22.070" style="s2">were going to be paved and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.880" end="00:35:26.180" style="s2">electricity was going to stay on yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.070" end="00:35:28.010" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a tragic irony of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.180" end="00:35:29.600" style="s2">situation that really the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.010" end="00:35:31.370" style="s2">missing thing is something against which</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.600" end="00:35:33.290" style="s2">to calibrate right how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.370" end="00:35:35.120" style="s2">whether civil Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.290" end="00:35:38.030" style="s2">really sucks until you&#39;ve seen an</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.120" end="00:35:40.490" style="s2">alternative and you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.030" end="00:35:42.590" style="s2">indirectly figure it out by how the rest</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.490" end="00:35:45.260" style="s2">of the world views us it&#39;s not that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.590" end="00:35:47.210" style="s2">don&#39;t they don&#39;t get the proper data</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.260" end="00:35:49.160" style="s2">about how dumb we can be and how broken</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.210" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">things can be but they also get the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.160" end="00:35:53.300" style="s2">of how much works which you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:55.850" style="s2">just promise there is how much promise</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.300" end="00:35:59.120" style="s2">and yeah so again none of this is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.850" end="00:36:03.160" style="s2">defense of what&#39;s wrong but right but</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.120" end="00:36:05.990" style="s2">yes the amount that functions is</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.160" end="00:36:07.820" style="s2">astronomical and rebuilding it from</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.990" end="00:36:10.310" style="s2">scratch for no reason because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.820" end="00:36:11.600" style="s2">discounted its value is is insane it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.310" end="00:36:13.190" style="s2">not yours to destroy because other</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.600" end="00:36:17.840" style="s2">people are depending on it and some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.190" end="00:36:19.490" style="s2">them know it massive thank you to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.840" end="00:36:23.710" style="s2">both and to the people not on screen</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.490" end="00:36:25.580" style="s2">that&#39;s use Eck damocat and yes the cats</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.710" end="00:36:27.170" style="s2">I&#39;m worried that with the high</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.580" end="00:36:28.790" style="s2">unemployment going around we might see</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.170" end="00:36:31.130" style="s2">things deteriorate even further rather</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.790" end="00:36:32.780" style="s2">than stabilized how do we encourage and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.130" end="00:36:34.670" style="s2">guide unemployed people during this time</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.780" end="00:36:37.820" style="s2">I understand their plight but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.670" end="00:36:41.720" style="s2">sure how to be part of the solution um</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.820" end="00:36:44.210" style="s2">they need to hope people I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.720" end="00:36:46.760" style="s2">know how to emphasize this I think the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.210" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">major difference between what I and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.760" end="00:36:53.000" style="s2">think you see going on and most people</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">who align with us in terms of values the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.000" end="00:37:00.110" style="s2">primary distinction is the timeframe</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:04.040" style="s2">right we do not have long to fix this</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.110" end="00:37:05.930" style="s2">problem we have a history of inferring</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.040" end="00:37:07.850" style="s2">how long processes take that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.930" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">misleading us it&#39;s leading us to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.850" end="00:37:13.130" style="s2">that we have a great deal more time than</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:16.610" style="s2">we actually do but we also have a quick</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.130" end="00:37:19.430" style="s2">opportunity right we are four months out</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.610" end="00:37:21.050" style="s2">from an election that could change</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.430" end="00:37:23.450" style="s2">things for the better</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.050" end="00:37:24.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a sprint that is not a long</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.450" end="00:37:28.370" style="s2">period of time you can hold your breath</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.860" end="00:37:30.080" style="s2">that long so the point is people need</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.370" end="00:37:31.400" style="s2">hope if they understand that there is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.080" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">light at the end of the tunnel that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.400" end="00:37:36.200" style="s2">something is coming that might work they</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:37.850" style="s2">will be in a very different place than</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:39.260" style="s2">if their sense is this is our life until</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.850" end="00:37:40.610" style="s2">we do something about it and what are we</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.260" end="00:37:42.470" style="s2">being told is the only thing to do about</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.610" end="00:37:43.880" style="s2">it tear it up all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.470" end="00:37:45.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;re gonna do until they</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.880" end="00:37:48.740" style="s2">have some reason to hope that things are</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.410" end="00:37:51.470" style="s2">going to get better and frankly I am</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.740" end="00:37:53.870" style="s2">very troubled by what happened to hope</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.470" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">under Obama that the abuse of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.870" end="00:37:57.890" style="s2">concept of Hope the fact that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:00.830" style="s2">invoke it without feeling derivative</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.890" end="00:38:03.110" style="s2">that is a danger to us because hope is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.830" end="00:38:05.360" style="s2">fundamentally important thing to keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.110" end="00:38:08.060" style="s2">people on track and focused on what</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.360" end="00:38:09.650" style="s2">matters and when they lose hope they</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.060" end="00:38:13.280" style="s2">behave like people without hope which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.650" end="00:38:14.540" style="s2">to say destructively and they make no</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:17.330" style="s2">attempt to preserve that which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.540" end="00:38:22.820" style="s2">important so hope I think is the answer</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.250" end="00:40:18.360" style="s2">think so yeah and using the using the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:19.260" style="s2">hashtags without don&#39;t use the hashtags</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.360" end="00:40:21.840" style="s2">and throw fire bombs</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.260" end="00:40:24.510" style="s2">oh but use the hashtags for careful</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.840" end="00:40:27.320" style="s2">critique that people who also appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.510" end="00:40:29.910" style="s2">careful critique start making it trend</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.320" end="00:40:32.010" style="s2">such that people who don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.910" end="00:40:34.290" style="s2">about the critique may search on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.010" end="00:40:37.230" style="s2">hashtag and see it and just a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.290" end="00:40:38.790" style="s2">seed is planted yeah well anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.230" end="00:40:40.320" style="s2">goes to that hashtag who&#39;s not paying</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.790" end="00:40:42.750" style="s2">attention who thinks yeah black lives</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.320" end="00:40:44.460" style="s2">matter hell yeah right yeah well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.750" end="00:40:48.270" style="s2">gonna find this at the top at least for</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.460" end="00:40:51.110" style="s2">the moment and so my point is that is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.270" end="00:40:52.500" style="s2">foray into enemy territory and it is not</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.110" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">vindictive</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.500" end="00:40:56.490" style="s2">I think it&#39;s generous it says yes black</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:40:58.500" style="s2">lives matter if that slogan actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.490" end="00:41:00.450" style="s2">implied that black lives are undervalued</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.500" end="00:41:02.130" style="s2">and we must do something about it then</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.450" end="00:41:04.340" style="s2">many of us including me would be on</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.130" end="00:41:06.900" style="s2">board at the head of the the charge but</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.340" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">but in the current situation I can&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.900" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">anyway forays into enemy territory</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">figuring out how you can do it in such a</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.360" style="s2">way that it&#39;s careful enough that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:16.620" style="s2">canceled resistant it&#39;s a learned art</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.360" end="00:41:18.690" style="s2">but one worth learning and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.620" end="00:41:23.640" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the coin of the realm for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.690" end="00:41:25.830" style="s2">moment yep as intellectuals and parents</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.640" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">of assumedly typical albeit patriotic</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.830" end="00:41:29.910" style="s2">highly capable courageous teenagers what</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">is your advice for practical and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.910" end="00:41:33.930" style="s2">effective steps that k-12 schools can</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:39.420" style="s2">take to semi safely open in the autumn</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.930" end="00:41:43.500" style="s2">mmm hashtag unity 2020 yeah well we know</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.420" end="00:41:46.080" style="s2">how to make it safer we know more time</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.500" end="00:41:49.050" style="s2">outside greater spacing between people</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.080" end="00:41:51.240" style="s2">open windows and I would say open you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.050" end="00:41:57.320" style="s2">know the windows open doors increase air</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.240" end="00:42:00.090" style="s2">flow yep increase air flow like fans but</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.320" end="00:42:02.580" style="s2">increased air flow with outside air yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.090" end="00:42:07.620" style="s2">increasing air flow with entirely inside</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.580" end="00:42:10.680" style="s2">air does not seem to reduce infections</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.620" end="00:42:12.840" style="s2">much if at all and in fact those who are</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.680" end="00:42:14.550" style="s2">in the line of the air flow are more</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.840" end="00:42:16.050" style="s2">likely to get sick well I think it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.550" end="00:42:18.030" style="s2">depends how much you scrambled the air</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.050" end="00:42:19.860" style="s2">but yes given a haphazard scheme it</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.030" end="00:42:22.770" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t work but at least in</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.860" end="00:42:25.970" style="s2">the autumn air from outside pumped in at</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.770" end="00:42:28.050" style="s2">a high rate spacing between people I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.970" end="00:42:29.700" style="s2">mean it&#39;s just tough if you live in</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.050" end="00:42:31.050" style="s2">Minneapolis you know what are you gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.700" end="00:42:33.420" style="s2">do in January you&#39;re not gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.050" end="00:42:37.110" style="s2">doors open well does anybody live in</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.420" end="00:42:40.080" style="s2">Minneapolis in January I&#39;m sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.110" end="00:42:42.150" style="s2">apologize we lived in southeast Michigan</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.080" end="00:42:44.190" style="s2">for 30 years well we were tropical</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.150" end="00:42:45.810" style="s2">biologists it was the obvious choice I</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.190" end="00:42:48.120" style="s2">made a point of going to Madagascar for</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.810" end="00:42:50.910" style="s2">most of those northern winters yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.120" end="00:42:52.980" style="s2">not most some so the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.910" end="00:42:54.630" style="s2">there are technologies that we could</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.980" end="00:42:57.960" style="s2">bootstrap that would help this right</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.630" end="00:42:59.250" style="s2">like here I&#39;ll dump one into the public</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.960" end="00:43:01.070" style="s2">domain because I&#39;m not very well going</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.250" end="00:43:04.830" style="s2">to patent it at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.070" end="00:43:06.870" style="s2">well how about lights that pump out UV</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.830" end="00:43:12.900" style="s2">spectrum stuff when nobody&#39;s in the room</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.870" end="00:43:14.760" style="s2">yes yes how are that yep and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.900" end="00:43:17.670" style="s2">the thing that many of us said but which</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.760" end="00:43:19.230" style="s2">you know Oregon as of July 1st everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.670" end="00:43:20.610" style="s2">was required unless they&#39;re in a private</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.230" end="00:43:23.640" style="s2">space if they&#39;re inside to be wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.610" end="00:43:25.080" style="s2">mask and we&#39;ve talked a lot about masks</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.640" end="00:43:27.900" style="s2">we started off our very first episode on</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.080" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">March 24th talking about masks I hate</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.900" end="00:43:33.300" style="s2">them I hate wearing them but I wear them</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:35.910" style="s2">because even if it weren&#39;t mandated it</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.300" end="00:43:37.350" style="s2">is it is the best most effective route</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.910" end="00:43:39.840" style="s2">now I don&#39;t know about second graders</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.350" end="00:43:43.380" style="s2">you know for most in most places kids</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.840" end="00:43:45.690" style="s2">under 12 are exempted but they would</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.380" end="00:43:47.640" style="s2">love this mask they would you give yeah</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.020" end="00:43:55.260" style="s2">something out</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.360" end="00:43:56.670" style="s2">you don&#39;t think if you gave them a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.260" end="00:43:57.900" style="s2">bandana they&#39;d figure something out yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.670" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">I think they would you think they might</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.900" end="00:44:05.400" style="s2">yeah okay if leaders fear losing their</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:07.710" style="s2">jobs why don&#39;t use a tactic from their</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.400" end="00:44:09.480" style="s2">playbook and adopt the strength in</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.710" end="00:44:13.020" style="s2">numbers move you can&#39;t target what is</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.020" end="00:44:18.450" style="s2">how to implement solutions please</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.340" end="00:44:21.240" style="s2">contact cool I would say I wonder what</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.450" end="00:44:23.580" style="s2">happens if and how can this not be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.240" end="00:44:27.300" style="s2">thing that we have seen you know if one</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.580" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">workplace had just by accident it had</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.300" end="00:44:32.310" style="s2">more courageous people by a significant</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:34.440" style="s2">degree who managed to find each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.310" end="00:44:36.510" style="s2">and talk about this without outing</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.440" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">themselves too early and then mounted</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.510" end="00:44:41.370" style="s2">some kind of useful careful resistance</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:43.770" style="s2">you would have a workplace in which the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.370" end="00:44:47.400" style="s2">opposite thing had unfolded right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.770" end="00:44:49.350" style="s2">that would become a model yep so it must</p>

<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:37.900" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.420" end="00:45:39.400" style="s2">yeah next question why are some humans</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.900" end="00:45:40.839" style="s2">more energetic than others</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.400" end="00:45:42.760" style="s2">assuming caloric intake is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.839" end="00:45:43.780" style="s2">similar across the board what explains</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.760" end="00:45:45.250" style="s2">that some people seem to have such</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.780" end="00:45:49.150" style="s2">differing amounts of energy than others</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.250" end="00:45:51.460" style="s2">is it all just perception I would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.150" end="00:45:53.230" style="s2">it&#39;s development on perception yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.460" end="00:45:55.630" style="s2">development you know the there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.230" end="00:45:58.030" style="s2">certain things that rarely get mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.630" end="00:46:00.280" style="s2">that haunt every discussion in which</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.030" end="00:46:02.260" style="s2">they&#39;re absent one of them has to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.280" end="00:46:04.210" style="s2">with development we often talk about</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.260" end="00:46:05.859" style="s2">what people are like but we don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.210" end="00:46:08.440" style="s2">about the process that makes them that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.859" end="00:46:09.910" style="s2">way we certainly don&#39;t include it in</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.440" end="00:46:15.569" style="s2">evolutionary discussion that&#39;s nearly</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.910" end="00:46:18.220" style="s2">often enough and so I think the one that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.569" end="00:46:20.910" style="s2">educationally I found was absent from</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.220" end="00:46:23.230" style="s2">almost every discussion was one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.910" end="00:46:26.680" style="s2">motivational structures that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.230" end="00:46:29.260" style="s2">what is it that you find that causes a</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.680" end="00:46:30.700" style="s2">reward to be released internally that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.260" end="00:46:32.260" style="s2">has everything to say about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.700" end="00:46:33.460" style="s2">gonna be able to get yourself to do and</p>

<p begin="00:46:33.460" end="00:46:38.770" style="s2">to do so we are all hobbled by a</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:40.089" style="s2">motivational structure built for an</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.770" end="00:46:41.589" style="s2">environment in which we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.089" end="00:46:43.000" style="s2">enough food which almost all</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.589" end="00:46:44.410" style="s2">environments have not enough food for</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.000" end="00:46:46.599" style="s2">the creatures that live in them for</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.410" end="00:46:48.430" style="s2">automatic reasons any population that</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.599" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">has too much tends to grow until it</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.430" end="00:46:56.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have too much so what that means</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:59.079" style="s2">is that our physiology and our</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.220" end="00:47:02.349" style="s2">neurobiology are wired around getting us</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.079" end="00:47:04.270" style="s2">not to spend energy right because</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.349" end="00:47:06.130" style="s2">spending energy is an energy you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.270" end="00:47:09.789" style="s2">replace by finding more food if you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.130" end="00:47:12.339" style="s2">preserve it so this causes people who do</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.789" end="00:47:15.380" style="s2">not have a developmental experience that</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.339" end="00:47:18.349" style="s2">that gets them to value what half</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.380" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">when you are energetic tend to default</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.349" end="00:47:23.000" style="s2">to being sedentary which is very</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:25.099" style="s2">dangerous we have too much food most of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.000" end="00:47:28.490" style="s2">us and so what that means is we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.099" end="00:47:30.140" style="s2">better off to burn more but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.490" end="00:47:34.460" style="s2">hard to convince your physiology of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.140" end="00:47:39.019" style="s2">when it has what&#39;s probably billions of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.460" end="00:47:41.779" style="s2">years of nearly unbroken privation so</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.019" end="00:47:43.069" style="s2">this is a it&#39;s a it&#39;s something we trip</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.069" end="00:47:47.630" style="s2">novel which is of course the subject</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.869" end="00:47:49.099" style="s2">primarily of our upcoming book what</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.630" end="00:47:52.069" style="s2">happens to creatures that find himself</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.099" end="00:47:53.539" style="s2">in a novel environment like us I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.069" end="00:47:56.390" style="s2">would add one thing at the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.539" end="00:48:00.289" style="s2">level which is hormonal so in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.390" end="00:48:03.859" style="s2">with the focus here on development let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.289" end="00:48:07.549" style="s2">skip from this more sort of poly</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.859" end="00:48:08.990" style="s2">hormonal expletive energy because</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.549" end="00:48:10.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of factors that go into</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.990" end="00:48:13.910" style="s2">that but certainly it is hormonal II</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.279" end="00:48:15.829" style="s2">mediated one of the reasons that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.910" end="00:48:19.190" style="s2">know going back over into the trans</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.829" end="00:48:20.930" style="s2">discussion one of the reasons that many</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.190" end="00:48:23.450" style="s2">of us object to the idea that you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.930" end="00:48:26.450" style="s2">simply transition from being a man into</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.450" end="00:48:29.690" style="s2">being a woman full-stop is that hormones</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.450" end="00:48:31.069" style="s2">aren&#39;t just on-off switches that toggle</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.690" end="00:48:32.420" style="s2">on and then you&#39;re experiencing the</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.069" end="00:48:34.130" style="s2">effects of estrogen to progesterone or</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.420" end="00:48:36.230" style="s2">testosterone or other androgens and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.130" end="00:48:38.359" style="s2">toggle off those are the so called</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.230" end="00:48:40.130" style="s2">activational effects which are in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.359" end="00:48:41.450" style="s2">moment but there are also organizational</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.130" end="00:48:43.160" style="s2">effects and you know this is a rubric</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.450" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">that is used by many endocrinologist not</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.160" end="00:48:49.279" style="s2">by all and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:51.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a schema for how hormones work but</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.279" end="00:48:55.099" style="s2">organizational effects are those effects</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.559" end="00:48:58.099" style="s2">that basically organize or create the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.099" end="00:49:01.940" style="s2">background anatomy and physiology on</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.099" end="00:49:04.009" style="s2">which later developmental anatomical</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.940" end="00:49:06.579" style="s2">physiological in technological effects</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.009" end="00:49:09.859" style="s2">can happen and so if you go through</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.579" end="00:49:13.099" style="s2">puberty for instance as a boy and become</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.859" end="00:49:16.369" style="s2">a man and then decide that you are going</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.099" end="00:49:19.279" style="s2">to switch into in you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.369" end="00:49:22.309" style="s2">transition the fact is that your body</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.279" end="00:49:23.630" style="s2">was organized hormonal E by testosterone</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.309" end="00:49:25.160" style="s2">on the other hand urgence and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.630" end="00:49:26.539" style="s2">ever undo those effects and so it will</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.160" end="00:49:27.980" style="s2">never be fair for instance for you to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.539" end="00:49:31.609" style="s2">try to compete against women</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.980" end="00:49:36.109" style="s2">so there are similar but with many more</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.609" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">hormonal inputs explanations for things</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.109" end="00:49:41.570" style="s2">like diet and energy that how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:43.400" style="s2">you have your early childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.570" end="00:49:46.670" style="s2">especially puberty adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.400" end="00:49:48.650" style="s2">transitions with regard to the hormonal</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.670" end="00:49:51.140" style="s2">inputs how much exercise you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.650" end="00:49:53.810" style="s2">what kinds of foods you&#39;re eating you</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.140" end="00:49:56.030" style="s2">can&#39;t simply change all of that and as</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.810" end="00:49:57.560" style="s2">an as an adult and erase all of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.030" end="00:49:59.570" style="s2">effects from when you were a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.560" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">those won&#39;t totally disappear there were</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.570" end="00:50:02.980" style="s2">organizational effects that your you are</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:06.440" style="s2">now going to live with forever mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.980" end="00:50:08.540" style="s2">yeah absolutely which is the the death</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.440" end="00:50:12.710" style="s2">knell to the argument that people should</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.540" end="00:50:14.359" style="s2">be allowed to transition very young or</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.710" end="00:50:15.920" style="s2">just have their puberty stopped until</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.359" end="00:50:17.750" style="s2">they know right because you can always</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.920" end="00:50:19.910" style="s2">do it and the answer is you can&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.750" end="00:50:21.830" style="s2">undo it yeah this is a permanent affect</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.910" end="00:50:23.780" style="s2">you know not as severe as a surgical</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.830" end="00:50:28.100" style="s2">modification in some ways but every bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.780" end="00:50:29.720" style="s2">is physiological yeah thanks question</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.100" end="00:50:31.790" style="s2">you have argued that blacks deserves</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.720" end="00:50:33.020" style="s2">something due to their origin story why</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.790" end="00:50:34.790" style="s2">should they not be viewed as any other</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.020" end="00:50:36.320" style="s2">individual born into adversity for any</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.790" end="00:50:40.190" style="s2">number of reasons does it matter what</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.320" end="00:50:42.790" style="s2">group they belong to yeah but this</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.190" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">sounds almost like an argument about</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.790" end="00:50:48.140" style="s2">reparations it&#39;s not like deserve like</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:50.390" style="s2">compensation it&#39;s like dessert let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.140" end="00:50:52.070" style="s2">just be clear you have not argued for</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.390" end="00:50:55.250" style="s2">reparations I have argued that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.070" end="00:50:57.050" style="s2">reparations are justified by the history</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.250" end="00:50:58.760" style="s2">but that they are such a terrible remedy</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.050" end="00:51:00.350" style="s2">that we would be stupid to institute it</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.760" end="00:51:02.540" style="s2">and that there are remedies that would</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.350" end="00:51:04.790" style="s2">work to do the job much better and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.540" end="00:51:06.560" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t head us into very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.790" end="00:51:08.630" style="s2">waters from which we probably would not</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.560" end="00:51:11.180" style="s2">recover and just asterisk Coleman Hughes</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.630" end="00:51:13.310" style="s2">writes extraordinarily well on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.180" end="00:51:16.340" style="s2">question of reparations and why he</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.310" end="00:51:17.780" style="s2">thinks it&#39;s not a good idea yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.340" end="00:51:19.340" style="s2">frankly a lot of people who&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.780" end="00:51:21.590" style="s2">very carefully about it including a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.340" end="00:51:24.260" style="s2">great many black scholars recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.590" end="00:51:27.109" style="s2">it&#39;s just not a good remedy um but</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.260" end="00:51:29.930" style="s2">anyway the point is deserve you know why</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.109" end="00:51:32.990" style="s2">do you deserve to have a healthy</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.390" end="00:52:02.420" style="s2">obligation to fix it and what I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.609" end="00:52:05.390" style="s2">before is that Native Americans American</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.390" end="00:52:09.109" style="s2">special case it&#39;s not the same situation</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:11.450" style="s2">as populations that came from elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.109" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">in the world which did face racism but</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.450" end="00:52:16.069" style="s2">we&#39;re able to overcome it these two</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.599" end="00:52:17.540" style="s2">populations have a special set of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.069" end="00:52:20.630" style="s2">obstacles that come from the origin</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.540" end="00:52:23.809" style="s2">stories and they mean those special</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.630" end="00:52:26.420" style="s2">obstacles require a meaningful remedy</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.809" end="00:52:29.030" style="s2">which we haven&#39;t yet fully hit upon but</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.420" end="00:52:30.470" style="s2">I think it&#39;s readily doable I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.030" end="00:52:34.910" style="s2">imagine why we wouldn&#39;t and it is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.470" end="00:52:37.400" style="s2">decent thing so let&#39;s do it okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.910" end="00:52:39.980" style="s2">gonna switch to the questions that have</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.400" end="00:52:42.200" style="s2">come in this hour and go through as many</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.980" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">as possible in the order in which they</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.200" end="00:52:46.609" style="s2">came in Brett in your recent</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">conversation with Eric you said the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.609" end="00:52:50.270" style="s2">unity plan quote is the best plan we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:53.869" style="s2">got short term now the deepest plan we</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.270" end="00:52:54.829" style="s2">have dot then you were cut off how can</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.869" end="00:53:01.400" style="s2">you finish that thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.829" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">Mike apparently not yeah okay what I</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.400" end="00:53:06.200" style="s2">would say I think what I&#39;m was getting</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:10.450" style="s2">at in that statement and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.200" end="00:53:13.880" style="s2">been days so who&#39;s to say but years and</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.450" end="00:53:17.359" style="s2">years in 2020 time yeah but what I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.880" end="00:53:20.450" style="s2">I was getting at is this we are talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.359" end="00:53:24.049" style="s2">at this level about how to take a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.450" end="00:53:26.599" style="s2">broken electoral system and hack our way</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.049" end="00:53:28.190" style="s2">into it to be able to do enough useful</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.599" end="00:53:28.849" style="s2">that things start moving in the right</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.190" end="00:53:30.680" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.849" end="00:53:34.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the reason for the Unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.680" end="00:53:37.220" style="s2">plan longer-term the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.460" end="00:53:40.549" style="s2">what do you do having gained access how</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.220" end="00:53:42.230" style="s2">can we make civilization more liberating</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.549" end="00:53:45.349" style="s2">at the same time that we make it safer</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.230" end="00:53:48.200" style="s2">right that&#39;s a readily doable thing we</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.349" end="00:53:51.440" style="s2">we are what a systems theorist would say</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.200" end="00:53:53.660" style="s2">we are stuck on a local optimum there</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.440" end="00:53:54.840" style="s2">are higher places we could go that would</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.660" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">accomplish more of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.840" end="00:53:58.650" style="s2">values that we all share but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:00.660" style="s2">get there by virtue of the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.650" end="00:54:04.590" style="s2">the system that keeps us on these little</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.660" end="00:54:07.890" style="s2">low Peaks so how you address that is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.590" end="00:54:09.960" style="s2">deeper question we have to storm the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.890" end="00:54:10.980" style="s2">cockpit but once we&#39;re in the cockpit</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.960" end="00:54:12.300" style="s2">then there&#39;s a question about well</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.980" end="00:54:16.110" style="s2">actually where do we really want to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.300" end="00:54:19.170" style="s2">and I think you know I&#39;m itching to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.110" end="00:54:20.850" style="s2">that conversation because I know that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.170" end="00:54:22.860" style="s2">can do better on almost every front that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.850" end="00:54:24.870" style="s2">people would want us to do better that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.860" end="00:54:27.360" style="s2">all decent people would agree would be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.870" end="00:54:30.510" style="s2">positive change and how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.360" end="00:54:32.370" style="s2">involves compiling people with the right</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.510" end="00:54:34.440" style="s2">sorts of insight and having discussions</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.370" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">about what will work and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.440" end="00:54:38.550" style="s2">you&#39;re hearing this thinking oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:40.050" style="s2">he&#39;s a liberal he&#39;s gonna do some</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.550" end="00:54:42.210" style="s2">do-gooder thing and it&#39;s gonna create</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.050" end="00:54:44.100" style="s2">damage well now the whole point is look</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.210" end="00:54:46.110" style="s2">liberals tend to miss the unintended</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.100" end="00:54:48.450" style="s2">consequences of positive change so how</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.110" end="00:54:50.730" style="s2">can you hedge out that risk so you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.450" end="00:54:51.920" style="s2">move in a direction discover whether it</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.730" end="00:54:55.110" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.920" end="00:54:56.970" style="s2">abort the progress in that direction if</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.110" end="00:54:57.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not working these are all readily</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.970" end="00:54:59.040" style="s2">doable</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.480" end="00:55:01.530" style="s2">and we&#39;ve lost track of it because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.040" end="00:55:08.330" style="s2">seen nothing but predatory governance</p>

<p begin="00:56:28.110" end="00:56:31.950" style="s2">the best tools are there in the masters</p>

<p begin="00:58:37.979" end="00:58:42.179" style="s2">Horse has been trained in secret and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.259" end="00:58:43.019" style="s2">therefore no one knows how to bet on it</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.179" end="00:58:44.009" style="s2">because they don&#39;t know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.019" end="00:58:47.009" style="s2">capable of</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.009" end="00:58:48.599" style="s2">so that dark is not a reference to its</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.009" end="00:58:50.909" style="s2">color well it is dark just by</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.599" end="00:58:52.739" style="s2">happenstance but but it&#39;s a metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.909" end="00:58:56.059" style="s2">meaning of its darkness is more</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.739" end="00:58:58.949" style="s2">important in the story yes right so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.059" end="00:59:01.799" style="s2">point that I&#39;m making is that that very</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.949" end="00:59:04.949" style="s2">metaphor suggests that there are tools</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.799" end="00:59:07.199" style="s2">beyond the common ones right and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.949" end="00:59:09.809" style="s2">those tools every so often emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.199" end="00:59:11.849" style="s2">they change things so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.809" end="00:59:13.319" style="s2">Fosbury flop for example changed</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.849" end="00:59:14.729" style="s2">high-jumping I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.319" end="00:59:16.409" style="s2">high-jumping is particularly important</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.729" end="00:59:19.649" style="s2">but the point is something enters and</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.409" end="00:59:23.339" style="s2">everything changes and you know same</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.649" end="00:59:26.189" style="s2">could be said for black people in many</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.339" end="00:59:28.589" style="s2">sports including baseball as Matt Taibbi</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.189" end="00:59:31.319" style="s2">was discussing in his takedown of white</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.589" end="00:59:33.029" style="s2">fragility anyway there&#39;s lots to be said</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.319" end="00:59:34.619" style="s2">for that which we do not know because</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.029" end="00:59:36.659" style="s2">our vision is limited to that which we</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.619" end="00:59:39.209" style="s2">expect yes absolutely there are tools</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.659" end="00:59:41.159" style="s2">beyond what the master has and yes those</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.209" end="00:59:42.839" style="s2">might be even more useful but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.159" end="00:59:46.859" style="s2">neglect the tools in your shed because</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.839" end="00:59:48.809" style="s2">they&#39;re awfully good I&#39;ve heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.859" end="00:59:51.029" style="s2">that memes must be subservient to jeans</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.809" end="00:59:53.009" style="s2">but also that we must rebel against no</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.029" end="00:59:55.079" style="s2">jeans wouldn&#39;t rebelling against our</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.009" end="00:59:57.539" style="s2">jeans be a set of memes help me</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.079" end="00:59:59.279" style="s2">reconcile the contradiction well no I</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.539" end="01:00:01.679" style="s2">think your question reveals that you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.279" end="01:00:05.159" style="s2">the problem it&#39;s not a simple one we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.679" end="01:00:08.069" style="s2">wired such that our cultural nature is</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.159" end="01:00:10.589" style="s2">subservient to our genetic nature but if</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.069" end="01:00:12.809" style="s2">you can hear this podcast you can also</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.589" end="01:00:14.609" style="s2">hear me say if you knew what your genes</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.809" end="01:00:17.999" style="s2">were willing to do in the service of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.609" end="01:00:19.679" style="s2">spreading them you&#39;d throw up right no</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.999" end="01:00:21.119" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely despicable some of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.679" end="01:00:22.600" style="s2">they want now some of what they want you</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.119" end="01:00:26.050" style="s2">to do is absolutely beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.600" end="01:00:28.150" style="s2">right but to choose that part of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.050" end="01:00:30.070" style="s2">your genes want you to do that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.150" end="01:00:32.500" style="s2">honorable and decent and fits who you</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.070" end="01:00:35.770" style="s2">claim to be and to reject that part that</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.500" end="01:00:38.020" style="s2">is despicable and destructive and not</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.770" end="01:00:41.950" style="s2">who you want to be that&#39;s the sweet spot</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.020" end="01:00:43.690" style="s2">so you&#39;re already in rebellion right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.950" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">the question is not can your vow of</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.690" end="01:00:47.590" style="s2">course you can repeal the question is</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:50.350" style="s2">can you rebel without providing an</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.590" end="01:00:51.730" style="s2">advantage to those who don&#39;t rebel those</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.350" end="01:00:53.830" style="s2">who will do everything their genes want</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.730" end="01:00:55.930" style="s2">them to do that&#39;s the deep question I</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.830" end="01:00:57.790" style="s2">don&#39;t think anybody knows for sure what</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.930" end="01:01:00.160" style="s2">the answer to that question is I can</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.790" end="01:01:02.140" style="s2">tell you that I don&#39;t know of any reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.160" end="01:01:04.390" style="s2">that that is impossible but I do not</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.140" end="01:01:06.430" style="s2">think it is a simple process we have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.390" end="01:01:08.260" style="s2">figure out how it is that we rebel</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.430" end="01:01:10.300" style="s2">against the portion of what our genes</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.260" end="01:01:12.520" style="s2">want us to do that does not fit our</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.300" end="01:01:15.040" style="s2">understanding of ourselves without</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.520" end="01:01:18.550" style="s2">providing advantage to those who refuse</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.040" end="01:01:21.160" style="s2">to join us in that process and as far as</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.550" end="01:01:26.590" style="s2">I see either we figure that out or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.160" end="01:01:28.930" style="s2">cooked courageous capable Patriots if</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.590" end="01:01:30.730" style="s2">not McRaven yang you too would fit the</p>

<p begin="01:01:42.310" end="01:01:46.570" style="s2">you&#39;re a little bit farther left than I</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.570" end="01:01:49.660" style="s2">am yeah thanks here&#39;s the thing first of</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.570" end="01:01:52.360" style="s2">all a you me ticket doesn&#39;t fit one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.660" end="01:01:54.610" style="s2">the features of the plan right why I</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.360" end="01:01:56.770" style="s2">said who&#39;s gonna be on the left oh I see</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.610" end="01:01:58.570" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not a plausible Republican no</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.770" end="01:02:00.790" style="s2">you are not no you are not a plausible</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.570" end="01:02:03.280" style="s2">Republican I&#39;m not plausible democrat</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.800" end="01:02:11.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for this plan yep yeah Hale</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.860" end="01:02:13.600" style="s2">professors no now professor Weinstein</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.350" end="01:02:15.100" style="s2">don&#39;t hate the player hate the game we</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.600" end="01:02:17.080" style="s2">should focus on structural change to</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.100" end="01:02:19.510" style="s2">maximize opportunity for everyone in my</p>

<p begin="01:02:19.510" end="01:02:23.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know either but I mean I agree</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.340" end="01:02:24.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s all about the structure of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.050" end="01:02:27.070" style="s2">game you want people to behave well</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.400" end="01:02:28.930" style="s2">build a game in which behaving well puts</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.070" end="01:02:32.790" style="s2">you ahead I mean that&#39;s the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.930" end="01:02:35.380" style="s2">so elsewhere let&#39;s see in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.790" end="01:02:37.720" style="s2">4th frontier talk that I gave I</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.380" end="01:02:39.550" style="s2">described the following principle you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.720" end="01:02:41.410" style="s2">got two kinds of systems right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.550" end="01:02:43.360" style="s2">one side of this divide or the other on</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.410" end="01:02:45.400" style="s2">one side of the divide you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.360" end="01:02:49.120" style="s2">system where the costs of keeping</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.400" end="01:02:50.620" style="s2">civilization running belong to the good</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.120" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">people these are systems in which</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.620" end="01:02:54.940" style="s2">personal responsibility dictates what</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.480" end="01:02:57.160" style="s2">gets done those systems evolve towards</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.940" end="01:02:59.950" style="s2">ruthlessness whereas if you make a</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.160" end="01:03:02.230" style="s2">system in which the cost of keeping</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.950" end="01:03:04.600" style="s2">civilization running go to the assholes</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.230" end="01:03:06.310" style="s2">they evolve towards benevolence decency</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.600" end="01:03:08.380" style="s2">wonderfulness beauty all the things that</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.310" end="01:03:10.060" style="s2">you would want so really the only big</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.380" end="01:03:12.730" style="s2">question is which side of that divide is</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.060" end="01:03:15.940" style="s2">your system on if it&#39;s on the wrong side</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.730" end="01:03:17.770" style="s2">can you move it and the farther you move</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.940" end="01:03:19.960" style="s2">it in that direction the faster it moves</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.770" end="01:03:21.580" style="s2">in the direction you want it to go so</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.960" end="01:03:23.800" style="s2">you can adjust the speed just by</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.580" end="01:03:26.080" style="s2">figuring out okay to what degree do the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.800" end="01:03:27.520" style="s2">costs belong to the assholes if the cost</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.080" end="01:03:28.750" style="s2">belong entirely to the assholes you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.520" end="01:03:31.090" style="s2">move very quickly in the right direction</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.750" end="01:03:34.000" style="s2">if they 50% belong to the assholes</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.090" end="01:03:35.710" style="s2">you&#39;ll move half as fast so anyway this</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.000" end="01:03:37.990" style="s2">isn&#39;t that tough once you reduce it to</p>

<p begin="01:04:08.320" end="01:04:13.270" style="s2">your unity 2020 plan what is this plan</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.720" end="01:04:15.850" style="s2">yeah there are two things that mitigate</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.270" end="01:04:17.770" style="s2">the spoiler effect one is the left right</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.850" end="01:04:20.020" style="s2">part of this and by the way I need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.770" end="01:04:22.810" style="s2">come back to the fact some people some</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.020" end="01:04:24.700" style="s2">small fraction of people are thrown by</p>

<p begin="01:04:41.650" end="01:04:45.420" style="s2">centers and before and it got</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.559" end="01:04:47.729" style="s2">it struck me as strange and it struck a</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.420" end="01:04:49.709" style="s2">few other people who commented as strays</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.729" end="01:04:51.959" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with centrism and I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.709" end="01:04:53.609" style="s2">back to your point I don&#39;t remember who</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.959" end="01:04:56.189" style="s2">you said it was but said you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.609" end="01:04:58.559" style="s2">there&#39;s 84 percent of us who aren&#39;t at</p>

<p begin="01:05:00.719" end="01:05:03.930" style="s2">drops okay since 86 percent of us who</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.579" end="01:05:06.869" style="s2">aren&#39;t at one of these extremes that</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.930" end="01:05:09.809" style="s2">seem to be driving policy and</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.869" end="01:05:13.559" style="s2">conversation at the at the national and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.809" end="01:05:17.009" style="s2">international level now 86 percent is</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.559" end="01:05:19.979" style="s2">there for the center oh so you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.009" end="01:05:21.569" style="s2">you&#39;re not you&#39;re not left out of that</p>

<p begin="01:05:21.569" end="01:05:27.779" style="s2">86 percent well no I think my left ISM</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.039" end="01:05:30.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense to people because</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.779" end="01:05:32.849" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand what it is so I am</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.380" end="01:05:35.160" style="s2">describing myself as a radical because I</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.849" end="01:05:36.809" style="s2">believe only radical change will save us</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.160" end="01:05:38.189" style="s2">that we are in a bad I&#39;m a radical in</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.809" end="01:05:39.719" style="s2">the same way that somebody who wants to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.189" end="01:05:42.150" style="s2">storm the cockpit of a plane in which</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.719" end="01:05:43.410" style="s2">the pilot has just died is a radical</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.150" end="01:05:44.609" style="s2">therefore radical action you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.410" end="01:05:45.989" style="s2">allowed a storm the cockpit well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.609" end="01:05:49.410" style="s2">gonna fucking die if we don&#39;t do it so</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.989" end="01:05:51.299" style="s2">I&#39;m a radical right but I&#39;ve also said I</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.410" end="01:05:52.829" style="s2">want to live in a civilization that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.299" end="01:05:55.049" style="s2">good I can afford to be a conservative</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.829" end="01:05:56.699" style="s2">right because I want that civilization</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.049" end="01:05:58.349" style="s2">that&#39;s so good that I wanted to stay I</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.699" end="01:06:00.839" style="s2">want to be against change because change</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.349" end="01:06:03.989" style="s2">is very likely to be going to make it</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.839" end="01:06:07.559" style="s2">worse so and there are many features of</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.989" end="01:06:10.140" style="s2">our society that you do feel as do I are</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.559" end="01:06:12.809" style="s2">very good and should not be changed or</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.140" end="01:06:14.910" style="s2">dismantled absolutely in fact a huge</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.809" end="01:06:17.459" style="s2">fraction so the reactionary thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.910" end="01:06:18.839" style="s2">across the board burn it all down wait</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.459" end="01:06:20.849" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing if you went through my</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.839" end="01:06:23.219" style="s2">belief system I&#39;m sure some of its wrong</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.849" end="01:06:25.859" style="s2">but if you went through it you&#39;d find a</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.219" end="01:06:27.630" style="s2">weird grab bag of places where I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.859" end="01:06:29.549" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s go we&#39;ve got to change that</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.630" end="01:06:30.959" style="s2">and you know that thing better stick</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.549" end="01:06:33.029" style="s2">even though most of the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.959" end="01:06:34.170" style="s2">in theory on my side of this debate</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.029" end="01:06:37.229" style="s2">would disagree</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.170" end="01:06:39.239" style="s2">so you&#39;ll find an eclectic mix of things</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.229" end="01:06:41.579" style="s2">based on independently arrived at</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.239" end="01:06:44.279" style="s2">conclusions about what causes the thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.579" end="01:06:46.619" style="s2">to work which is the definition of not</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.279" end="01:06:48.900" style="s2">being an ideologue yes it&#39;s also you</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.619" end="01:06:50.640" style="s2">have you have you and I as well and your</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.900" end="01:06:53.939" style="s2">brother and many other people have</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.640" end="01:06:57.030" style="s2">generated our our thoughts and our</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.939" end="01:06:59.190" style="s2">positions based as much as possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.030" end="01:07:01.260" style="s2">deriving them from first principles in</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.190" end="01:07:04.320" style="s2">each of the cases as opposed to adopting</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.260" end="01:07:06.119" style="s2">a slate an entire platform from the dams</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.320" end="01:07:08.790" style="s2">the Republicans and the libertarians the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.119" end="01:07:10.590" style="s2">greens or whoever it is right it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.790" end="01:07:12.030" style="s2">them issue by issue and saying what is</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.590" end="01:07:14.520" style="s2">it that I actually think about this as</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.030" end="01:07:15.720" style="s2">opposed to oh my friends think these</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.520" end="01:07:17.490" style="s2">other three things that I agree with</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.720" end="01:07:19.020" style="s2">maybe I should just agree with them on</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.490" end="01:07:21.150" style="s2">all the rest yeah it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.020" end="01:07:24.090" style="s2">definition of liberalism right this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.150" end="01:07:27.000" style="s2">what liberal mindedness he is so back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.090" end="01:07:28.830" style="s2">the question about the spoiler effect by</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.000" end="01:07:32.970" style="s2">taking somebody from the center left and</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.830" end="01:07:33.869" style="s2">the center right we do not spoil for</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.970" end="01:07:36.690" style="s2">either party</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.869" end="01:07:38.580" style="s2">so the typical spoiler derives from that</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.690" end="01:07:40.710" style="s2">party to which it is closest and</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.580" end="01:07:43.260" style="s2">therefore awards power to the party that</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.710" end="01:07:44.099" style="s2">is farther away in this case splitting</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.260" end="01:07:47.040" style="s2">both tickets</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.099" end="01:07:49.619" style="s2">it harms both parties which is good</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.040" end="01:07:52.080" style="s2">because the parties suck okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.619" end="01:07:55.140" style="s2">one way the other way is that built into</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.080" end="01:07:57.150" style="s2">the plan is a mechanism whereby if the</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.140" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">ticket is not viable as the election</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.150" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">approaches we pull the plug on it all</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:03.180" style="s2">right so the point is we can revert to</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:04.800" style="s2">that prior state you don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.180" end="01:08:06.000" style="s2">about signing on because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.800" end="01:08:07.800" style="s2">going to be responsible for some</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.000" end="01:08:09.270" style="s2">horrible outcome either this thing is</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.800" end="01:08:09.570" style="s2">capable of going the distance or it</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.270" end="01:08:11.490" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.570" end="01:08:13.369" style="s2">so one thing that occurs to me maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.490" end="01:08:15.810" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the place to raise it but</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.369" end="01:08:19.890" style="s2">it&#39;s harder to do that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.810" end="01:08:21.660" style="s2">in the era of mail-in voting that when</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.890" end="01:08:24.060" style="s2">everyone is voting actually on the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.660" end="01:08:26.069" style="s2">day you can actually watch things and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.060" end="01:08:28.049" style="s2">pull the plug last minute for instance</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.069" end="01:08:29.310" style="s2">and you can&#39;t do that as much like I</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.049" end="01:08:31.529" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what the mailing but</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.310" end="01:08:33.989" style="s2">voting for the national election will</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.529" end="01:08:36.600" style="s2">look like in terms of the time span but</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.989" end="01:08:38.100" style="s2">I know for the the primaries here in</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.600" end="01:08:41.339" style="s2">Oregon we had like three or four weeks</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.100" end="01:08:43.290" style="s2">yeah and so that that obviously in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.339" end="01:08:45.420" style="s2">month before a national election in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.290" end="01:08:46.950" style="s2">US so many things change October</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.420" end="01:08:48.779" style="s2">Surprise is a standard piece of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.950" end="01:08:50.279" style="s2">puzzle right this is why we have not</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.779" end="01:08:51.719" style="s2">been specific about the mechanism is</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.279" end="01:08:53.339" style="s2">that we don&#39;t know the full detail of</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.719" end="01:08:54.839" style="s2">the world we&#39;re living in and so that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.339" end="01:08:56.279" style="s2">can&#39;t build the failsafe with precision</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.839" end="01:08:57.810" style="s2">yet but we are very committed to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.279" end="01:08:59.870" style="s2">failsafe we understand this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.810" end="01:09:02.130" style="s2">the top two concerns of people who are</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.870" end="01:09:04.609" style="s2">interested in the plan but skeptical of</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.130" end="01:09:07.710" style="s2">it and so anyway it&#39;s top of mind and</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.609" end="01:09:10.230" style="s2">stay tuned and have I mentioned that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.710" end="01:09:10.880" style="s2">should follow our accounts and send us</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.230" end="01:09:12.799" style="s2">your email</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.880" end="01:09:14.870" style="s2">that would be really helpful it would</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.799" end="01:09:18.469" style="s2">help us show that we have the momentum</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.870" end="01:09:18.969" style="s2">and momentum is the name of the game all</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.469" end="01:09:21.350" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.969" end="01:09:23.540" style="s2">hey Bretton Heather can the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.350" end="01:09:26.719" style="s2">podcast be classified as an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.540" end="01:09:28.009" style="s2">stable attractor also I am from</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.719" end="01:09:29.810" style="s2">America&#39;s little brother Canada woods</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.009" end="01:09:32.150" style="s2">signing up for the unity 2020 movement</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.810" end="01:09:34.130" style="s2">helped the cause in any way yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.150" end="01:09:35.569" style="s2">absolutely okay so first question list</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.130" end="01:09:37.730" style="s2">that was an easy answer to the second</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.569" end="01:09:42.650" style="s2">one can it be classified as an</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.730" end="01:09:43.969" style="s2">evolutionarily stable attractor I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.650" end="01:09:48.350" style="s2">know it depends we fuck it up I guess</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.969" end="01:09:49.880" style="s2">but the I think I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.350" end="01:09:55.790" style="s2">know how to I don&#39;t have to do this one</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.880" end="01:09:58.310" style="s2">yes it&#39;s it&#39;s joke ish but yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.790" end="01:10:00.830" style="s2">little tough I mean I would say so far</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.310" end="01:10:03.350" style="s2">seems good evolutionarily stable implies</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.830" end="01:10:05.060" style="s2">cannot be displaced by any competing</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.350" end="01:10:07.639" style="s2">podcast and while I would like to think</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.060" end="01:10:10.780" style="s2">that is the case we do not know what</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.639" end="01:10:14.739" style="s2">other strategies may be out there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.780" end="01:10:17.150" style="s2">so yeah I don&#39;t know did that work Frank</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.739" end="01:10:19.670" style="s2">so this is I just checked the previous</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.600" end="01:10:36.409" style="s2">question I never remember the names of</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.710" end="01:10:39.020" style="s2">any of them but I will say that one book</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.409" end="01:10:40.550" style="s2">this is not gonna seem in keeping it all</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.020" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s the it&#39;s one of the books that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.550" end="01:10:45.320" style="s2">occurred to me and because no one will</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.320" end="01:10:47.750" style="s2">be expecting it here maybe it will be it</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.320" end="01:10:49.639" style="s2">will impress people to go look at it</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.750" end="01:10:52.489" style="s2">that I have recently dipped back into</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.639" end="01:10:54.980" style="s2">it&#39;s a book I read in full many years</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.489" end="01:10:56.960" style="s2">ago actually it&#39;s it&#39;s a twofer here the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.980" end="01:10:58.820" style="s2">book that I read that everyone will be</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.960" end="01:11:00.679" style="s2">familiar with is and in the art of</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.820" end="01:11:03.380" style="s2">motorcycle maintenance by per-say</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.679" end="01:11:07.250" style="s2">grobart for sake I think which just has</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.380" end="01:11:09.080" style="s2">some gems of you know philosophical and</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.250" end="01:11:10.550" style="s2">scientific thought running throughout</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.080" end="01:11:13.219" style="s2">but of course it&#39;s very very thick and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.550" end="01:11:14.540" style="s2">then there&#39;s sort of a latter-day update</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.219" end="01:11:16.909" style="s2">if you will to that I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.540" end="01:11:19.310" style="s2">author calls it that but Michael</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.909" end="01:11:21.500" style="s2">Crawford I believe is his name wrote</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.310" end="01:11:22.909" style="s2">he&#39;s written two terrific books the one</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.500" end="01:11:24.280" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of his shop craft as</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.909" end="01:11:27.250" style="s2">Soulcraft</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.280" end="01:11:32.170" style="s2">which speaks to this point that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.250" end="01:11:34.600" style="s2">made many times as I view the not just</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.170" end="01:11:36.130" style="s2">the virtue but the value in doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.600" end="01:11:38.230" style="s2">physical work with real physical</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.130" end="01:11:40.210" style="s2">outcomes as a way to train your mind to</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.230" end="01:11:42.010" style="s2">be better at problem-solving so shop</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.210" end="01:11:43.480" style="s2">craft as Soulcraft by Michael Crawford</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.010" end="01:11:46.150" style="s2">is one of the books that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.480" end="01:11:48.220" style="s2">about at the moment yeah I have a good</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.150" end="01:11:51.460" style="s2">answer to this I am not reading anything</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.220" end="01:11:58.870" style="s2">I would recommend I would say probably</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.460" end="01:12:02.739" style="s2">there is value in things like watching</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.870" end="01:12:05.290" style="s2">the movie Brazil reading 1984 an animal</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.739" end="01:12:06.970" style="s2">farm brave new world none of these</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.290" end="01:12:09.460" style="s2">things are right on the money</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.970" end="01:12:10.930" style="s2">but a lot of them will reveal that we</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.460" end="01:12:12.580" style="s2">have seen elements of this in many</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.930" end="01:12:13.930" style="s2">different combinations before and people</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.580" end="01:12:18.520" style="s2">have spotted it and they&#39;ve figured out</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.930" end="01:12:20.739" style="s2">how to describe it and you know above</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.520" end="01:12:22.960" style="s2">all else you need to be able to keep</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.739" end="01:12:24.340" style="s2">your thinking straight in an era where</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.960" end="01:12:25.870" style="s2">people are telling you a lot of false</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.340" end="01:12:27.310" style="s2">things and insisting that they are so</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.870" end="01:12:31.330" style="s2">true that no one could possibly disagree</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.310" end="01:12:33.280" style="s2">and having an awareness a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.330" end="01:12:36.610" style="s2">awareness that that is a common pattern</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.280" end="01:12:38.980" style="s2">and that it is dangerous and that</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.610" end="01:12:41.250" style="s2">basically one is entitled not to take</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.980" end="01:12:43.480" style="s2">that stuff in deeply when it comes</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.250" end="01:12:45.520" style="s2">probably worthwhile so I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.480" end="01:12:46.930" style="s2">useful a suggestion but something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.520" end="01:12:48.130" style="s2">probably if you&#39;re looking for something</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.930" end="01:12:53.050" style="s2">to do it&#39;s probably a good good</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.130" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">investment yeah do you think a heroic</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.050" end="01:12:56.830" style="s2">dose of psilocybin might leave Trump</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:12:58.300" style="s2">with some appreciable amount of human</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.830" end="01:13:01.750" style="s2">empathy something that has been</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.300" end="01:13:05.460" style="s2">noticeably lacking thus far I love the</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.750" end="01:13:08.170" style="s2">term heroic dose it was like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.460" end="01:13:09.760" style="s2">totally with a lot of peanut butter or</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.170" end="01:13:12.580" style="s2">something else so he doesn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.760" end="01:13:16.210" style="s2">he&#39;s eaten yeah it&#39;s hard to sneak in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.580" end="01:13:17.770" style="s2">heroic dose of silicide I cannot I I can</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.210" end="01:13:23.020" style="s2">neither confirm nor deny that this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.770" end="01:13:23.560" style="s2">part of the unity 2020 plan so I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.020" end="01:13:24.940" style="s2">leave it at that</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.560" end="01:13:28.739" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna cancel us right</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.940" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">that&#39;s it and that&#39;s it okay that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.739" end="01:13:32.830" style="s2">according to the Neanderthal genome</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:34.450" style="s2">project ninety-nine point seven percent</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.830" end="01:13:37.120" style="s2">of human in the a turtle DNA is</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.450" end="01:13:39.400" style="s2">identical a current in nature</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.120" end="01:13:42.580" style="s2">Asians and Europeans nature the magazine</p>

<p begin="01:13:42.580" end="01:13:48.550" style="s2">and Europeans inherited 1.5 22.1% Niren</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.370" end="01:13:56.100" style="s2">tell DNA how do we square these facts oh</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.550" end="01:14:01.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s this question so the</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.100" end="01:14:03.220" style="s2">thumb wait go ahead I usually think</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.660" end="01:14:06.040" style="s2">about this and then have sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.220" end="01:14:07.030" style="s2">twelve minute or so description on board</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.040" end="01:14:10.870" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t thought about this in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.030" end="01:14:16.420" style="s2">while but similarly we&#39;re 98 percent</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.870" end="01:14:19.570" style="s2">similar to chimps but but it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.420" end="01:14:21.490" style="s2">that our son zach is 50% related to each</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.570" end="01:14:22.930" style="s2">of us all right so those are both true</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.490" end="01:14:24.610" style="s2">numbers and that tells you that those</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.930" end="01:14:28.240" style="s2">aren&#39;t the same percentages yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.610" end="01:14:30.730" style="s2">so human and Neanderthal DNA is in fact</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.240" end="01:14:32.680" style="s2">very very very closely aligned but</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.730" end="01:14:33.820" style="s2">within that I&#39;m just accepting your</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.680" end="01:14:36.220" style="s2">numbers here that you&#39;ve written out at</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.820" end="01:14:38.050" style="s2">that point 3 percent the distinguishes</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.220" end="01:14:40.540" style="s2">human from the ANATEL DNA I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.050" end="01:14:42.640" style="s2">if these are actually based on whole</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.540" end="01:14:44.560" style="s2">genomes or if they&#39;re just do an exon so</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.640" end="01:14:50.020" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s a whole there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.560" end="01:14:52.720" style="s2">whole load of reasons to suspect these</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.020" end="01:14:54.250" style="s2">numbers because modern genetic analysis</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.720" end="01:14:56.500" style="s2">and genomic analysis is not nearly as</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.250" end="01:15:00.910" style="s2">good and as the people doing it would</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.500" end="01:15:03.700" style="s2">have you believe but assuming that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.910" end="01:15:06.790" style="s2">number is close to right that still</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.700" end="01:15:08.650" style="s2">lives 0.3% that is clearly and patently</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.790" end="01:15:09.610" style="s2">different in the parts of the genome</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.650" end="01:15:11.980" style="s2">anyway that we&#39;re looking at between</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.610" end="01:15:14.740" style="s2">humans and Neanderthals and you can then</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.980" end="01:15:17.350" style="s2">look at that part and and look at</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.740" end="01:15:19.000" style="s2">whether or not and I remembered it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.350" end="01:15:24.330" style="s2">Europeans I didn&#39;t know Asians but the</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.000" end="01:15:27.340" style="s2">Europeans clearly have some of the DNA</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.330" end="01:15:30.250" style="s2">from Neanderthals that is not otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.340" end="01:15:33.570" style="s2">shared between humans and Neanderthals</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.250" end="01:15:36.430" style="s2">whereas for instance Africans don&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.570" end="01:15:37.900" style="s2">you&#39;re basically looking that my guess</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.430" end="01:15:41.350" style="s2">is that just looking at these two</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.900" end="01:15:43.120" style="s2">percentages that 1.5 22.1% that</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.350" end="01:15:45.040" style="s2">Europeans have inherited of near tall</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.120" end="01:15:47.980" style="s2">DNA is one point five to two point one</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.040" end="01:15:49.290" style="s2">percent of the part of the genome that</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.980" end="01:15:52.290" style="s2">is not share</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.290" end="01:15:56.190" style="s2">between humans Neanderthals yep I have</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.290" end="01:15:57.780" style="s2">very little to add other than at the end</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.190" end="01:15:59.400" style="s2">of the process of this genetic exchange</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.780" end="01:16:00.960" style="s2">who also have selection which is going</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.400" end="01:16:04.950" style="s2">to adjust what you see in other winter</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.960" end="01:16:06.690" style="s2">selections so you could have had genes</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.950" end="01:16:08.190" style="s2">move that then went extinct because in</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.690" end="01:16:10.560" style="s2">the place that they moved to that they</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.190" end="01:16:11.880" style="s2">were disfavored so anyway which is part</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.560" end="01:16:13.140" style="s2">of why these are it&#39;s these are</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.880" end="01:16:18.390" style="s2">estimates at best</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.140" end="01:16:21.360" style="s2">yep okay we&#39;re an hour and 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.390" end="01:16:23.100" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do four more questions okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.360" end="01:16:25.260" style="s2">okay but two of them are just comments I</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.100" end="01:16:26.910" style="s2">am looking forward to your talk with</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.260" end="01:16:28.620" style="s2">David Sloan Wilson I am emailing your</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.910" end="01:16:29.820" style="s2">mod with a link to a paper that explores</p>

<p begin="01:16:34.350" end="01:16:39.540" style="s2">my kind of thing okay we don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.050" end="01:16:41.550" style="s2">about 4th July in the UK do it okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.540" end="01:16:42.720" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it okay but we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.550" end="01:16:46.110" style="s2">you care about it you don&#39;t need to hear</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.720" end="01:16:48.900" style="s2">about the 4th of July I have to tell you</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.110" end="01:16:58.350" style="s2">resistance is useless and you will be</p>

<p begin="01:16:58.350" end="01:17:01.830" style="s2">the I&#39;m gonna be slightly out of order</p>

<p begin="01:17:01.830" end="01:17:05.310" style="s2">isn&#39;t a great place to end</p>

<p begin="01:17:48.780" end="01:17:54.360" style="s2">read it just as it is first in culture /</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.060" end="01:17:56.730" style="s2">consciousness consciousness progressive</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.360" end="01:17:58.860" style="s2">is suited for tackling novelty so this</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.730" end="01:18:02.640" style="s2">is like a synopsis of our argument with</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.860" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">regard to the the dueling dichotomy</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.640" end="01:18:07.560" style="s2">between culture and consciousness in</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.400" end="01:18:10.260" style="s2">Heights righteous mind progressive</p>

<p begin="01:18:10.260" end="01:18:20.160" style="s2">foundation is care and harm optimized</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.770" end="01:18:22.260" style="s2">for novelty Wow we may go to one more</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.160" end="01:18:23.940" style="s2">question after this because I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.260" end="01:18:27.630" style="s2">in a good position I would have to go</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.940" end="01:18:30.330" style="s2">review what Hyde had said I do think but</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.630" end="01:18:32.370" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna yeah I&#39;d have to review the</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.330" end="01:18:33.650" style="s2">righteous mind both read it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.370" end="01:18:40.950" style="s2">been a while</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.650" end="01:18:43.890" style="s2">this idea that progressives are more</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.950" end="01:18:46.950" style="s2">likely to invoke issues of harm to</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.890" end="01:18:49.820" style="s2">others and caring for others than people</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.950" end="01:18:53.790" style="s2">on the right side of the aisle are is</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.820" end="01:18:58.770" style="s2">pretty robust finding from psychology I</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.790" end="01:19:00.780" style="s2">think and I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.770" end="01:19:04.860" style="s2">particular particularly an overlap here</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.780" end="01:19:06.750" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think actually that this the</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.860" end="01:19:07.800" style="s2">model that we have presented have</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.750" end="01:19:09.060" style="s2">written about and presented in our</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.800" end="01:19:10.830" style="s2">Princeton talk and and such about</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.060" end="01:19:14.550" style="s2">culture versus consciousness culture</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.830" end="01:19:16.860" style="s2">being about maintaining extant values</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.550" end="01:19:18.720" style="s2">that have been important in the past and</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.860" end="01:19:20.730" style="s2">may continue to be important but not in</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.720" end="01:19:22.800" style="s2">times of great change and consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.730" end="01:19:24.990" style="s2">being what you invoke and need during</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.800" end="01:19:29.220" style="s2">times of change and when when you need</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.990" end="01:19:31.860" style="s2">creativity that is about that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.220" end="01:19:37.610" style="s2">sort of population level strategies that</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.860" end="01:19:39.690" style="s2">can exist in in minds as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.610" end="01:19:41.670" style="s2">progressive people who identify as</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.690" end="01:19:44.460" style="s2">progressive sort of regardless of</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.670" end="01:19:48.540" style="s2">whether or not things actually need to</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.460" end="01:19:50.690" style="s2">change or not tend to have more focus on</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.540" end="01:19:53.180" style="s2">caring for others and harm</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.690" end="01:19:55.490" style="s2">to others and I may be the distinction</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.180" end="01:19:56.990" style="s2">here is exactly this that the the thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.490" end="01:19:59.300" style="s2">that you&#39;ve just said and that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.990" end="01:20:01.520" style="s2">said many times before that you are</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.300" end="01:20:02.900" style="s2">progressive and I believe this too but</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.520" end="01:20:05.060" style="s2">you you have been the first person to</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.900" end="01:20:06.530" style="s2">say it you were progressive who</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.060" end="01:20:07.550" style="s2">desperately wants to live in a world in</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.530" end="01:20:09.770" style="s2">which you could call yourself a</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.550" end="01:20:14.870" style="s2">conservative that that points to</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.770" end="01:20:16.250" style="s2">actually the pot the ideological problem</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.870" end="01:20:17.540" style="s2">with saying I&#39;m just I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.250" end="01:20:18.890" style="s2">progressive or I&#39;m just a conservative</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.540" end="01:20:20.720" style="s2">yeah right and so this culture</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.890" end="01:20:22.460" style="s2">consciousness model is specifically an</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.720" end="01:20:24.530" style="s2">evolutionary model because it identifies</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.460" end="01:20:26.960" style="s2">the fact that conditions change and as</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.530" end="01:20:28.640" style="s2">conditions change so must strategies if</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.960" end="01:20:29.930" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be effective well you</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.640" end="01:20:31.130" style="s2">can get it you can get there two</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.930" end="01:20:33.200" style="s2">different ways yeah you can either</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.130" end="01:20:35.450" style="s2">default to listening to the people who</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.200" end="01:20:37.610" style="s2">are on the side of the spectrum that</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.450" end="01:20:39.530" style="s2">matches the area you&#39;re in but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.610" end="01:20:41.270" style="s2">hugely wasteful yeah right the better</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.530" end="01:20:42.890" style="s2">way is for people to recognize what era</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.270" end="01:20:44.920" style="s2">they&#39;re in and to move from whether they</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.890" end="01:20:49.040" style="s2">are trying to conserve the structure or</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.920" end="01:20:51.320" style="s2">or upend it based on whether or not it</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.040" end="01:20:54.130" style="s2">is working or it&#39;s come to a dead end</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.320" end="01:20:54.130" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.950" end="01:20:58.840" style="s2">let&#39;s say let&#39;s find one more question a</p>
