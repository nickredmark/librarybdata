<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:17.199" style="s2">the end of the republic if the other guy</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">gets in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.199" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">and they both think the other side is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">going to steal it they&#39;re set up</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">to actually think that there isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">stolen so what happens when the election</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s not held as valid and it&#39;s held</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">as existential and we have these</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">mounting tensions</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">already that were there with kovid</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">because of lockdown lockdown means more</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">news cycle to take all the stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">then also it means radically increasing</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">and we so when we saw the violence start</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">with george floyd</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">violence was actually bound to start</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">from some trigger</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">when you study kind of the societal</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.240" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">and so when you start having massive</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.319" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">unemployment that&#39;s a very unstable</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">situation for the overall system and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">it&#39;s going to express itself somehow</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">and no one really has the ability to</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">well nor are the nor is the reporting</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">oriented to try to process it in an</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">adequate way which is actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">hard thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">there&#39;s much higher incentive to control</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">and so for the most part people have</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">kind of traded epistemology for</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">maybe neither do i have any evidence</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">that would at least support or refute it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">do other people interpret that evidence</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">differently go across the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">then look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">alternate hypotheses nobody does that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:10.479" style="s2">right like very very few people</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">use formal epistemic process so what</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">is paying attention to what feels true</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">which largely has to do with what people</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">me kind of seem to think and which team</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">let&#39;s just take a historical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">humans have been here for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.319" style="s2">but the thing that we call civilization</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">which was much larger than tribal</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.319" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">scale starting to organize early egypt</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">or sumeria or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:42.639" style="s2">since the beginning of that larger scale</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.639" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">a tiny percentage of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:49.199" style="s2">ever lived lived in something like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">republic or democracy</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.199" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">they almost all lived in a feudalism or</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">monarchy or some kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">of much more top-down autocratic system</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">which is actually quite easy to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">understand because the proposition of a</p>

<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">governance is actually a wild</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">which is that a huge number of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">who don&#39;t know each other who want</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">different things can sublimate their</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">it&#39;s understandable that&#39;s a hard thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">right this is why corporations aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">run that way corporations are</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">and so the few times throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.440" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">that a republic or a democracy emerged</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:29.199" style="s2">they&#39;re actually really kind of worth</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">studying and i&#39;m going to simplify here</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.199" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a fair simplification they emerged</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">following a period of a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">enlightenment for that culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">and the cultural enlightenments always</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">had at least a couple things in common</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">so if we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">kind of early greek democracies the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">athenian democracy of course we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">criticize that there&#39;s a lot that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">perfect about it but it was a movement</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">more participatory governance it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">the kind of greek enlightenment that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">both had a very high value on classical</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">education for everyone let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">everybody learn history let&#39;s have them</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">all learn philosophy let&#39;s have them all</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">formal logic and rhetoric and the arts</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">and these types of things</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">so that everyone can have a sense of how</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">plus the good and the beautiful right</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">like all of in integrated sense of those</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">understand what types of systems worked</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">and didn&#39;t work in the past because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:21.519" style="s2">more kind of knowledge of history</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">so if everyone can basically sense base</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">on their own well which has to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">trained right like</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">there&#39;s actually training involved in</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">that and then there was also the value</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">of the socratic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">and in the socratic dialogue everybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">is being trained to be able to take</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">every perspective i can argue this side</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">then i can move around and argue this</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">if people are being trained in that kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">dialectical process that means i&#39;m being</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">and actually be able to argue them even</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">better which is steel manning</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">right well if you have a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">who can all understand reality on their</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">and they can have high quality</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">conversations and take each other&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">go into tribalism and otherness and make</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">that leads to being able to make</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">we factor all of them and try to come up</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">that is good for all of them right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t even have a process in</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">somebody&#39;s focused on something they</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">come up with a proposition to benefit</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">that they don&#39;t even think about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">fact that that proposition harms other</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">things because they&#39;re focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">subset of values they&#39;re focused on</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:16.399" style="s2">which is why almost no proposition gets</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">a hundred percent or zero percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">vote it&#39;s like fifty percent because</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">the people who are focused on what it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">benefits really want it and the people</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">that inherently and unavoidably</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">polarizes the population against each</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">because i see the thing that you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">desperately trying to make happen</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">is actively harming the thing that i</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">so i have to hold you as an enemy right</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">but it was because of a dumb proposition</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">it was because of a proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t even try to get hey</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t necessarily need that economic</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">thing to go through or that tax policy</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">or that oil policy you need your kids to</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">be able to have an opportunity for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">real job and to be able to own a house</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">someday like</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">not be in in economic servitude forever</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">well if i hold just what is the value</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">without the strategy that&#39;s attached to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">it that contextualizes it having it</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">happen that way i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">that&#39;s fair i economic servitude&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:07.120" style="s2">problem and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:08.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t hold that that thing can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">through i hold that we don&#39;t want an</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">in this area you&#39;re like i actually like</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">forests</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.959" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">not extincting species would be cool i</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">just i&#39;m willing to do it if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">only way my kids aren&#39;t in servitude</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">if we start by taking the what are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">values that everyone holds and say</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">is there a proposition that does a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:27.519" style="s2">better job of meeting these and can we</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">use some collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.519" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">for collective design well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:33.519" style="s2">that&#39;s so obvious once you say it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not in our democratic process at</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">but it also requires people that can</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">have a good quality conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">seek to hear what other people&#39;s values</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">and would want to seek not just the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">immediacy of war which then of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:48.560" style="s2">you never just win forever right you win</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">and the thing that won the other side</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.560" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">reverse engineers makes better and comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">and so then you just get an arms race</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">and an escalation of narrative warfare</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">info warfare memetic warfare tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:03.680" style="s2">physical kinetic warfare all of those</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.680" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">you know when we say that most people</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">throughout the history of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">haven&#39;t lived in democracies and that or</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:12.079" style="s2">republics and that when those have</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">occurred they&#39;ve occurred following</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.079" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">periods of cultural enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">they also then haven&#39;t lasted very long</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">right historically</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">they&#39;ve lasted 300 years at most most of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">and of course every empire breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">no empire lasts forever which is one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">the kind of key insights is that right</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">now we have a fully globalized system</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s in the process of breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">where all of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">systems did break down but they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">localized and so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">the consequence of this is different in</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">but the democracies break down much</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">faster than</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">many of the dynasties and other types of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">top-down systems because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">easier for a small number of people to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:48.399" style="s2">coordinate with each other than a large</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">right you think about it it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">like if somebody is a bodybuilder it</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">if somebody works very hard to fight a</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">a washington or franklin would say those</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">generations pass and four do</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">the idea of a monarchy or of a</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t motivate us to do the very</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.199" end="00:16:06.959" style="s2">and there&#39;s stuff on tv right and</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">so there is a lack of generational</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">knowledge transfer of the real critical</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">that someone fought hard to form a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:23.199" style="s2">system so the basis of what it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">make that system ends up breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.199" end="00:16:28.320" style="s2">and we can see we are at a place where</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">this this is not a system of foreign by</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.320" end="00:16:31.360" style="s2">the people the people</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.360" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">over a person that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t really have much to say in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">people were even there or what they do</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">propositionally or anything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">and so what i would say is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">u.s is at about 250 years</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:48.800" style="s2">since it was founded they don&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">past 300 years this one has had</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.800" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">more pressure to break down on it</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">because since world war</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">ii in the bretton woods world it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">the center of a global order so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">who&#39;s wanted to change the global order</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">has had a maximum incentive</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">to try to influence dc in various</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">directions and it&#39;s not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">to flow money into the dc structure</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">internationally</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">towards whatever your personal interests</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">are it&#39;s not that hard for a foreign</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.600" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">to be able it&#39;s so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">economic capture within the country it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">also international this is not just for</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">the u.s this is everywhere the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">just happens to be a kind of central</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">example right now but it&#39;s not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">have money go from a sovereign wealth</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">and so when both the left and right</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">feel like the nation is on the brink of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">existential collapse they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">the integrity of the thing actually is</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">so this this one will not continue</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">to have the to actually be a republic</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">and be able to help influence the rest</p>

<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">just won&#39;t it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">in kind of a decay process the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">is whether it decays into</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.559" style="s2">uh just less and less function and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:29.919" style="s2">irrelevance or whether it decays and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.559" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">reboots</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.919" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">and if we reboot an actual kind of</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s a u.s question but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">a global question</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">and in order to do that a cultural</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.840" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">not in doubling down on our own bias but</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">in the capacity to make sense of things</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">the ocean or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">well the information commons is what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">the what is the space of information out</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">about what is true that informs our</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">make choices and we can see that just</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">a smokestack billowing pollution into</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">the air</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">most of what is being put into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">information commons is pollution right</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of noise and not true stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">or stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">partially true with spin to advance some</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:36.799" style="s2">agentic interests</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">because most interests when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">communicating are communicating to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">people to believe something that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">useful for them</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">and particularly the more powerful they</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">are they use that asymmetric power</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">to both maintain and increase their</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">power we can see that since covid like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">the market&#39;s crashed and then they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">bounced back up but employment hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.240" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">correspondingly gone bad a cup real</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">production in the underlying market and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">real wealth of the people relative to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">their purchasing power hasn&#39;t gone up</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">a few billionaires wealth has you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">radically gone up so we see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">both radical power asymmetry represented</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">in finance</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">um and the decoupling of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">you know economy in the market</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">so the information commons is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here and in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">ways i would say the information commons</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">more important than the other ones to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">pay attention to because it&#39;s the basis</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">of why</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">any of us would make the choices we</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.240" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">would that would determine how we affect</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">the air or the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">or war or anything else and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">so i would say the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">information commons is</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">requisite and that is both like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">quality of public education</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">and the quality of media news</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">and you can see in all the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">founding documents for this country</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">those were both considered prerequisites</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">for the ongoing protection of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">republic</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">that there would be very high quality</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">public education where everyone learned</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">the civics necessary to really</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:05.280" style="s2">participate</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">and a independent high quality fourth</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">estate so people could know what was</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">going on currently so they could</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:11.760" style="s2">participate</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">meaningfully and effectively and we know</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.760" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">institutions decay for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">reasons and we&#39;ve seen radical decay in</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">the fourth estate and in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">public education and in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">government writ large as a result</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s also important to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">democracies and republics require high</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">quality information even markets do</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">if you read ann rand</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">and other kind of laissez-faire market</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">ideology it talks about the need for</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">accurate and symmetrical information for</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">the rational actors to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">good choices in the market right</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.559" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">the idea that a rational actor can see</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">all of the information and make a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">choice and as a result the best products</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">and services at the best price</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">are what get up regulated well if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">if i can&#39;t see all the things because</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">there&#39;s way too many of them</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">and so then the algorithms that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">determine what i see end up</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">affecting my choice and if i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">actually a rational actor doing really</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">good sense making</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">that has the info to compare what a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">better product or service is</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">whoever does better marketing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">emotionally compels me ends up winning</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">rather than better product and service</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">so the system starts to incent</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">extraction</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">over real production value so all of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">large systems of coordination whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">they&#39;re more state-like systems or</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">market-like systems require accurate and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">symmetrical information for people to</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">so if we if we think about how have</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">humans ever thought about coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">at scale</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of models that different</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">social scientists have put together i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">one there but there&#39;s different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">thinking about so we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">attach too hard but you&#39;ll kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">the gist</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">there are market type mechanisms for</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">large-scale coordination</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">there are government or state-like</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">mechanisms and there are culture-like</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">mechanisms and we can kind of define all</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:23:58.799" style="s2">those differently but market type</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">mechanisms mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.799" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">um some kind of distributed bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">type system where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">agreement happens point-to-point not as</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">a systemic agreement across the whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">space and the topology is emergent</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">and whether it is a formal religious</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">organization or a state or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">commons agreement</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">then you have the government type</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">mechanisms that have some top-down</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">collective agreement type structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">those are kind of different</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">architectures</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">but then you have like culture and by</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">culture here because that word means</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">different things in different places i</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">mean what are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">collective values that people hold</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">and the collective worldview and ways of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">making sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">that would determine say in a government</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">what laws should be made right because</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:50.880" style="s2">law is really a codification of an</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">ethical system</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.880" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">ethics is then not part of the market or</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">part of the state formally but</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">is supposed to be guiding and binding</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">them and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">we can think of that as kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">culture and so if you think about those</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">three and how they&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">interact</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">in the idea of like our current system a</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">liberal democracy of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">roughly is that most of the innovation</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">will happen and most of the exchange of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">goods and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:21.279" style="s2">services and the kind of flow of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:24.159" style="s2">resource and resource allocation</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">but the reason that we have a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">democracy that has a state</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.679" style="s2">as opposed to just a pure market and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">many people will talk about this reason</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.679" end="00:25:36.159" style="s2">differently but like</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">the kind of foundational reason that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:39.679" style="s2">argued for</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">is that markets will have a market for</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.679" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">human trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">or for organ harvesting or for organized</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">crime or</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">maybe to cut all the wood in an area</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">down and there&#39;s no state park left or</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">whatever it is so</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">there can be perverse incentives in</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">markets that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:55.760" style="s2">good in the short term but really bad in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">the long term or good for some people</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.760" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">bad for others and so we say okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">there are some things market does</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">innovation and production well but it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:02.480" style="s2">also does</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">extraction and kind of pathological</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.480" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">stuff so we want to bind</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">the predatory aspects of market well how</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:09.279" style="s2">do we do that well we&#39;ll make a state</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">and we&#39;ll give it this thing called rule</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.279" end="00:26:12.960" style="s2">of law and then we&#39;ll give it this thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">called monopoly of violence which is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">police force internally</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">that can so we make a national</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">forest right so we&#39;re not going to cut</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">down the trees here we can cut down the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">trees here but not here</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">and then if someone goes and is cutting</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">the trees down there the cops are going</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">to show up and if those guys have guns</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">the cops have bigger guns a monopoly of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">violence because without enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">law doesn&#39;t really mean anything right</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just kind of a suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">and then incentive is still going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">the thing that runs it so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">system that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">supposedly rather than based on</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">incentive can bind predatory incentive</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">so the purpose of the state primarily is</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">to check the predatory aspects of market</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">where people would have an incentive</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">to do something that we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">collectively want to agree is not a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">but then the people are supposed to bind</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">and check the state</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:58.159" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea of governance up for and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">by the people is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.159" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">how do we ensure that the people that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">the market interests where the money and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">the power is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">don&#39;t just uh capture</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.400" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">the regulatory interests and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">change this thing in my benefit</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">and your swiss bank account will get</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:18.399" style="s2">well the only way to ensure that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:18.960" style="s2">don&#39;t get regulatory capture is if</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.960" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">enough transparency in government and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:24.000" style="s2">the people are educated enough and</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">rule of law rather than other things</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">think about how far the citizens here or</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">pretty much anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">are from being able to understand the</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:43.279" style="s2">involved in a way that would kind of</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.279" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">so of course then what happens is you do</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">get regulatory capture</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">because as the people aren&#39;t checking</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">a problem fully understood is half</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">solved</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.919" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">but that also means a problem not fully</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">understood is pretty much unsolvable</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">and so we typically have very</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">superficial understandings of problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">the generator and the etiology of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">well enough and what they&#39;re connected</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">to and we try to jump straight to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:39.600" style="s2">solutions and so the solutions are</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.600" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">gibberish or actually bad um and then in</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">gender counter responses for</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">understandable reasons</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">so um to try to understand the problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">of the breakdown and sense making a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">little more so we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">adequate solutions</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">one of the biggest things and this has</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">been talked about on rebel wisdom before</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">i believe you&#39;ve had tristan harris on</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">who talked about this very centrally is</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">the movement from</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">news being largely broadcast media</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">uh mediated to decentralized media</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">mediated which was the internet and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">not just the internet but</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">um the large internet information</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.480" end="00:31:21.919" style="s2">curation platforms</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">facebook in particular but also youtube</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.919" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">and various other ones</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">it&#39;s important to understand why this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">such a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">is all of our global institutions</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">evolved in the context of broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">media right from the printing press</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">through the telegram to the radio to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">tv it was still</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">a small number of groups being able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">some narrative on what&#39;s true and be</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">able to broadcast it and everybody get</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">that now of course that means it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">susceptible to very centralized control</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">and capture</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">but at least when everybody was watching</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">cnn they at least all</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">saw the same base reality they could</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">agree or disagree maybe they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">informed or misinformed but there was at</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">least some basis of</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">what they&#39;re being exposed to because</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">right now people are really</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">riled up over issues that they have no</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">on the ground knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">right like they they weren&#39;t on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">ground where the shooting was they</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">weren&#39;t in beirut they aren&#39;t in north</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">korea they</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">so their sense of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">is mediated through the media right</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">through what&#39;s coming through this kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">of 2d</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">screen and so there was in broadcast at</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">least a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">shared base information about the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">beyond my own experience my own direct</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">as soon as we started to get to and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">know the internet there was this very</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">libertarian beautiful idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">that it would democratize broadcast so</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">rather than a few billionaires being</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">able to control broadcast you could go</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">to youtube and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">everybody could broadcast and so it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">would democratize the ability to share</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">and then if it was true that we had kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">market of rational actors who would</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.600" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">parse the information and up regulate</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">the signal of the best stuff wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">that be awesome</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">of course nearly the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">thing happened because</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">so much broadcast gets put up that i</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">google something and i get a billion</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">search results for anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">well i can never read through a billion</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:09.360" style="s2">search results to be a rational actor</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">and make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.360" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">that entire space nor can i do the deep</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">parsing on any one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">so then of the billion search results</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">which ones do i actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">see that became one of the big problems</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">was how do we curate the content to show</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">people the stuff that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">want to see well now that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">become a big problem so you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">something like facebook for instance</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">having a tremendous amount of ability to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">harvest very particular information</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">about me that is unique to me not just</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">even a demographic</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">whereas the broadcast news on a tv</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:41.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t have that i could tell if i</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">turned it on or turned it off and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.600" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">was about it but i wasn&#39;t interacting</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:45.279" style="s2">with it in a way that could give me a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.399" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.279" end="00:33:49.840" style="s2">could give them a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">personalized micro targeting information</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.840" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">but now i&#39;m on facebook and what i like</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:56.159" style="s2">and what i share and what i comment on</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:57.519" style="s2">what my mouse hovers over the analytics</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.159" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">of all of that or such</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.519" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">that after i&#39;ve done about 300 likes</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">facebook can predict what i will like</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">better than my spouse</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">and after i&#39;ve gone further it actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">has a psychographic profile on me that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">is asymmetric to anything that any human</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">cia agent or whatever could have ever</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">had previously</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">and that was co-occurring with i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">carrying my cell phone around all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">time that is both tracking stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">i&#39;m doing and using notifications to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">give me a continuous feed so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">radical</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">increase in the amount of input into my</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">mind space and the amount of data being</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">harvested about me across platforms</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">to be able to micro target of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">billion</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">things which ones i should see now it</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">happens to be that we think of facebook</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">or youtube or whatever as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">but it is actually a corporate interest</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">that has agency</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">that is not just a tool and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">so those corporations make money by</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">selling advertising selling information</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">and they sell more advertising by</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">maximizing my engagement</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">and maximizing my time on site well i</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">don&#39;t want to spend that much time</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">scrolling facebook because i have</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">to do so if i stay in my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">prefrontal rational cortex</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">i will check it real quickly and then go</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">because i have stuff to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">but i&#39;ll spend more time if i get</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">limbicly hijacked if i get into social</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">fomo of like am i going to miss out on</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">what&#39;s happening or if i get outraged or</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">scared or whatever it is so</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m also not going to spend as much</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">time on stuff that is totally foreign to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.040" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">me as stuff that i already know is</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">so what happens is the ai that is paying</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">attention to what i engage with the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">that is curating all of the information</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">on facebook or the internet to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">me is curating what is stickiest and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">what is stickiest is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">very much like foods that are addictive</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">are usually bad for you salad&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">addictive french fries are much more</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">addictive</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">information that is maximally sticky is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">usually actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">because it is appealing to dopaminergic</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">hijacks</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">so what it curates for is a combination</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">of bias</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">and limbic hijack which is outrage</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">group identity and certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">so now what we have is a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:10.839" style="s2">because there&#39;s so much stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">so much total stuff online the curation</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.839" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">platforms</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s important to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">the ais that are doing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:19.520" style="s2">are radically more powerful than the ai</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">that several years ago beat kasparov at</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">chess</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">like a much more powerful game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:27.760" style="s2">ai than that that is controlling</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">the information feed of what i believe</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.760" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">to try to maximize stickiness and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">don&#39;t even realize i&#39;m playing that game</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">right so this is an asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">information warfare</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">that is un like the asymmetry that ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">could exist in the past this is so many</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">orders of magnitude more asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">and so i might have someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">who is in oakland who they look on their</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">facebook feed and they just see</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">cops killing black people like their</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">whole facebook feed is this and people</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:01.440" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">are recognizing and outraged by it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">then kind of what looks like clan and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">nazi members and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">because that actually maximizes their</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">time on site and their sharing an</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">engagement that maximizes other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">time on site</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">and i might have somebody in texas trump</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">supporting and all they see</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">is people wrongly attacking cops and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">black on black violence</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">and black on white violence and both of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">these people are getting vicariously</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">traumatized</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">by what they&#39;re seeing to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">they&#39;re having trauma reactions and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">feel like</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:31.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a war zone and they have to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">arms and go out into the street</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.920" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">and neither of them are getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">statistical representation of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:41.040" style="s2">space right and i can scroll for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:42.720" style="s2">and i just keep seeing more of it so it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.040" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s everything but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">even seeing point zero zero one percent</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">of the total</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">so everybody&#39;s getting increased</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">certainty outrage trauma</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">and wider apart from each other right</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">this is actually really important where</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">those two people</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">i might be able to scroll through both</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">of their news feeds for 10 hours and not</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">find a single piece of news in common</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">so the opposite of everybody seeing cnn</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:11.440" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">it seems certain that the all the people</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.440" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">that i know</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">think like me and all the people that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">seem like they&#39;re making sense think</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">like me</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">and the only version of the other i get</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">is a pejorative straw man or villainized</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">well of course that tool by itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">will break democracy break republics</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:31.920" style="s2">break the social fabric of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:33.280" style="s2">it is like when we talk about ai risk</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.920" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">we&#39;re already dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.280" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">ai risk that is destroying the fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">civilization and driving all these other</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">issues as second and third order effects</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s a critical thing to understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">that&#39;s not the only thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">current but that&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">the emergence of the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">everyone being able to broadcast where</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:49.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no quality control in the news</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">before there could be bad stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">there was at least some accountability</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">of who it was right it was cnn or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">bbc</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">so if they got something really wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">there was at least some ftc or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">that had quality control now no quality</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">but radical amplification type</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">uh radical information about everyone to</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.320" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">that because of globalization and the</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">the issues that we&#39;re facing are more</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.520" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">complex and more abstract than the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:37.599" style="s2">issues we evolved to be able to face</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:40.079" style="s2">so tribes didn&#39;t have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.599" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.079" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">positive feedback effects on</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">huge and they&#39;re they&#39;re hyper objects</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">which means an object i can see with my</p>

<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:00.960" style="s2">but snow melt here is very different</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">than the abstract concept of climate</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:11.359" style="s2">see nuclear risk writ large right</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.800" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">i can&#39;t see the information ecology writ</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.359" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">large so i can understand it but we kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:15.520" style="s2">of didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">evolve to do that well so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.520" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">train ourselves to do it well or we</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">we won&#39;t so we have a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:21.839" style="s2">all the biggest problems are hyper</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">objects</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.839" end="00:40:24.880" style="s2">they&#39;re very complex and they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing right so the issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">are authentically more complex</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">the information ecology is oriented to</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">military you turn the enemy against</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s not that hard to turn the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">enemy against itself when you already</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">have an environment that is polarizing</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">and doing that thing all you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">is just support the stuff the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">believes</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">to believe it even more just radicalize</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.240" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">because that turning the enemy against</p>

<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not us versus china</p>

<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:52.560" style="s2">beginning of it and that was like from</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">an evolutionary perspective that&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">and as a result we said oh we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">ever have wars again between these major</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">powers so how do we do that well</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">it also happens to be that the tech that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:08.920" style="s2">gave us the bomb gave us the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">for globalization so let&#39;s make a</p>

<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s never profitable to go to war</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s more profitable to be in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">trade and exchange with each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:21.040" style="s2">well a lot of ways that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">right and we haven&#39;t had another</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.040" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">world war since then so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">made sense but of course what that also</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">does is it means that you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">a globalized rather than a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">localized systems so</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">failures anywhere can start cascading to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">failures everywhere so the system as a</p>

<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">fragile and we saw this with kovid</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">could become increasing social unrest</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">everywhere could become breakdowns in</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">could become decoupling financial</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">markets and economies everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like whoa that&#39;s a very</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">where failures anywhere can cascade and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be failures in places</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">so the cascade potential is just very</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">if you look at the agreements that were</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:06.319" style="s2">to mediate peace most of them have</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">the first thing we should be thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">how do we understand the problems well</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">enough to come up with good solutions</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">how do we make those good make sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">those good solutions don&#39;t cause other</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">so that we don&#39;t cause problems and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">that other people who notice they cause</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">problems don&#39;t resist the thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">trying to do so how do we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">good solutions to the problem and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">larger context of things that matter</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">and how do we make sure that enough of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">the world is</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:57.119" style="s2">in conversation of the right type and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">understanding in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">that there&#39;s support for that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">should be the background of whether i</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">care about social justice or the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">environment or wealth inequality i</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">should care about this as the basis</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:08.800" style="s2">for the possibility of effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:10.559" style="s2">towards it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.800" end="00:49:12.319" style="s2">so then we have to say given these</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.559" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">things that are messing up</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">sense-making what would it take to start</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">to correct them</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:25.280" style="s2">so what is the right relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">topic of free speech</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">in general and specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">considering</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">how deep the information ecology issues</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">are to our capacity to address anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.720" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to be able to give</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">something like an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">answer but i will add complexity to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:49.119" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">in the way we think about it here a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.119" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">little bit so</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to say free speech</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">free speech no censorship because</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">whoever has the censoring capacity then</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">ends up just controlling</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">everything we don&#39;t trust anyone that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">much so free speech and let people</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.440" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">and we can see why historically and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">in in the left right dialectic that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">healthy which we don&#39;t have and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">thing that&#39;s called left and right today</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">don&#39;t actually mean anything right in</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:21.680" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">in the u.s in the counterculture</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.680" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">movement in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">the left was more for kind of radical</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">speech</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">and free speech and the right had more</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">desire to control certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">they thought were communist or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">now it&#39;s almost the exact opposite the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">left has things that it wants to control</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">they consider hate speech the right is</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">more for free speech</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">so what we even mean by left and right</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">are pretty broken but let&#39;s try and take</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:46.559" style="s2">it to some foundational concepts</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">of there are things like</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.559" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">rights and responsibilities or</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">traditionalism and progressivism</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.800" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">that are both important valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">should be in dialectic meaning should be</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:58.319" style="s2">in some tension and in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.240" style="s2">the right answer involves the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.319" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">consideration of their relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">not one of the sides but as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">move from dialectic between them to</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">warfare between them</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">you stop seeking synthesis and you start</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">seeking</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">more um double down versions of a</p>

<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">right so in the kind of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">progressive</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">thing this is actually an important</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:23.599" style="s2">thing to understand we should be</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">traditionalists</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.599" end="00:51:27.119" style="s2">traditionalists means that there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">of an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.119" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">that the systems that worked for a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:34.720" style="s2">probably did for some good reasons they</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.720" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">even though the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">traditionalists are not thinking of it</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">in evolutionary terms all the time</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:44.400" style="s2">if there hadn&#39;t been some effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:46.480" style="s2">and wisdom in it it would have failed</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.400" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">and in a world where most of the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.480" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">systems did fail so why did some make it</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">and we might be mistakenly thinking we</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">understand the systems better than we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">and why they worked and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">seek to change them when we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">changing something that really worked</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">for a long time for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">so let&#39;s kind of go back to the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">that worked or let&#39;s at least make sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">we protect the things that worked for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the traditional intuition</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">simplified version of it the progressive</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">intuition is</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:15.200" style="s2">we&#39;re facing new problems that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:16.079" style="s2">never faced before and the old solutions</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.200" end="00:52:17.839" style="s2">either were</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:19.200" style="s2">inadequate as they were there were some</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.839" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">people that did well and some that did</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.200" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">really bad under it</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">and or even if they were adequate</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not adequate to the changing</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">landscape so we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">progress and evolution and adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">well of course those are both right</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">right like of course we want to uh pay</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">attention to the things that worked</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:38.480" style="s2">and make sure we understand them very</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">well before changing them and most the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">time we understand them less well than</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:45.760" style="s2">than we think and</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">in a new environment where there&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.760" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">issues we might need to assess these</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:50.240" style="s2">things quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">differently and be able to add and be</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.240" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">able to amend the situation</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">so we want a healthy dialectic right</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:59.359" style="s2">between uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:52:59.359" style="s2">traditionalism and progressivism</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">so with regard to free speech here</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">orientation that says hey founding</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">fathers constitution</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">total free speech well in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t facebook right there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.640" end="00:53:18.000" style="s2">uh twitter youtube any of those types of</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.000" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">uh if if i&#39;m in the 17th century</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">the 18th century and i um</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">use my free speech to its maximum in</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">that environment where i&#39;m shouting</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">in a town square maybe a few hundred</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">people hear what i have to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:37.359" style="s2">and then they can actually talk with me</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:38.720" style="s2">we can engage and we have more shared</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.359" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">experience of base reality because we</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">live in a similar area and have seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.000" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">now if i share something where most of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.319" end="00:53:48.079" style="s2">the people seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">don&#39;t have the same shared experience</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.079" end="00:53:51.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t live in the same area maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:53.280" style="s2">say that i have privileged info i saw</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.440" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">this or whatever it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.280" end="00:53:57.599" style="s2">and this can get amplified to be seen by</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">millions or billions of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.599" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">that&#39;s such a different situation so the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:03.520" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">some people tristan talks about this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.520" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">that freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">should not automatically equal freedom</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">of reach but it&#39;s not just freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">reach it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">an algorithmic orientation to take the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">things that hijack people the most and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">up regulate those things</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t see long complex thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">pieces trending anywhere near as much as</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">we see</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:26.960" style="s2">emotionally charged short salacious</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:29.200" style="s2">vehement things trending</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">and to understand any of these things</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.200" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">well they&#39;re complex enough that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:33.520" style="s2">need to be long and complex and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">boring we</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.520" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">like but cognitively we are not eating</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">salads and healthy things cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:44.160" style="s2">we&#39;re just eating french fries</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:45.599" style="s2">right oriented to the maximum kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:49.520" style="s2">dopaminergic hit</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.599" end="00:54:50.559" style="s2">so is the answer that everyone should</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.520" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">just share everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.559" end="00:54:55.839" style="s2">in an environment that doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">allow them to broadcast but will amplify</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:54:59.119" style="s2">well so now we can say should the issue</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">be freedom of speech or the regular</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">regulation of those platforms now we</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">start to get to the right level of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">granularity where we&#39;re realizing you</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:07.760" style="s2">can&#39;t think of freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">independent of the media environment in</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.760" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">which the things are being upregulated</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">so then we say well should we actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:16.559" style="s2">regulate freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:17.599" style="s2">we&#39;ve always thought that it was okay to</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.559" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">have something like an</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">ftc or an sec that says you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">allowed to lie about your finances</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">in this public filing or in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">marketing so we were okay with</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">regulation online</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">but then as we trust the government less</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">the question is who is adjudicating what</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">is a lie</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.200" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">and so in a situation right now where</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:38.880" style="s2">nobody really trusts at least half of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">the government</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.880" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">or the other kinds of institutions</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">nobody would trust</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:45.760" style="s2">who&#39;s going to say what fake news is</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">because the left says the rights news is</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.760" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">fake and the right says the left&#39;s news</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">is fake and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:51.119" style="s2">says that the institutions that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">other guy follows are are the corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.119" end="00:55:53.839" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:56.880" style="s2">so then the question of well who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.839" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">adjudicate what is true</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.880" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">well that becomes the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">force in the world and then all the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">powerful forces have maximum incentive</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:04.559" style="s2">to become that and to capture it using</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:07.599" style="s2">all of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.559" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">um covert influence and whatever tools</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.599" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">that they could possibly have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">so the the ins the easy sensor answers</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.000" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">and the easy just keep total free speech</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:18.559" style="s2">within this context answers are both</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:19.839" style="s2">silly</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.559" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">right the issue is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">complex in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">adjudicate we need</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">to trust the adjudication process well</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">that&#39;s again like a state regulating a</p>

<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">we can be able to see where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:21.520" style="s2">signal and noise and we can start to</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:23.520" style="s2">synthesize the signal across the space</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">right that is a movement towards</p>

<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you never take a position</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:09.920" style="s2">it means that you take a position</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">that is trying not to just continue</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.920" end="01:02:13.039" style="s2">warfare but trying to elevate the whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">space which requires me understanding</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.039" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">the whole space better</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">i would say that one of the ways to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.000" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">that is you know i don&#39;t have social</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">media apps on my phone i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:25.839" style="s2">just a dumb idea i don&#39;t think any</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:26.720" style="s2">anyone should say yeah i can take the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.839" end="01:02:30.720" style="s2">most addictive</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:33.039" style="s2">drugs regularly and not get addicted um</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.720" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">so i don&#39;t have them there i do have</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.039" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">them on my computer</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">i&#39;m cognizant around limiting my time</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">and engagement but i&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:41.760" style="s2">curated it where i know what it is i</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">know that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.760" end="01:02:47.920" style="s2">a just a benign tool i know it is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:48.960" style="s2">ai empowered agent seeking to affect my</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.920" end="01:02:52.640" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.960" end="01:02:53.520" style="s2">and so how do i uh relate to that better</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.640" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.520" end="01:02:58.720" style="s2">i intentionally went and followed</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">i took all the major positions extreme</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.720" end="01:03:03.039" style="s2">left moderate left ex</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">moderate right extreme right conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.039" end="01:03:06.319" style="s2">the chinese views the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">russian views et cetera and i followed</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.319" end="01:03:09.440" style="s2">all of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">right followed all those news sources</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.440" end="01:03:12.799" style="s2">followed the thought leaders in them</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:14.799" style="s2">and made sure that i had a pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.799" end="01:03:16.240" style="s2">distribution so facebook&#39;s algorithm is</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.799" end="01:03:17.920" style="s2">very confused by me right</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.240" end="01:03:19.599" style="s2">and the other kinds of algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.920" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">because i wanted to see that i was</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.599" end="01:03:25.200" style="s2">not getting an echo chamber when i</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.960" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">use facebook i mostly don&#39;t state things</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.200" end="01:03:27.599" style="s2">i put out questions</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:31.119" style="s2">one of the reasons that i put out</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.599" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">questions is because the people that</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.119" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">i also friended people who have almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">every view and so many people in this</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">environment have said if you believe</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:38.880" style="s2">such and such unfriend me or i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">unfriending you</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.880" end="01:03:42.720" style="s2">so they&#39;re doubling down on their tiny</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">little tribalist group think right</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.720" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">because the other people are such</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">dumb terrible bad people i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:48.000" style="s2">want to be friends with you and see your</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.000" end="01:03:51.760" style="s2">this is not how you influence the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.760" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve intentionally friended</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">people across the space and followed</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:03:57.440" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:03:59.280" style="s2">so they also see my stuff so the comment</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.440" end="01:04:00.960" style="s2">thread will not be a filter bubble it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.280" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">be some extreme right and some extreme</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.960" end="01:04:03.599" style="s2">left and some various kinds of views</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:05.039" style="s2">someone could say well how dare you</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.599" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">amplify such and such because</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.039" end="01:04:08.559" style="s2">if you don&#39;t understand what swaths of</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.359" end="01:04:10.160" style="s2">humanity is thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.559" end="01:04:12.160" style="s2">your ability to influence humanity is</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.160" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">very poor your ability to even</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.160" end="01:04:16.480" style="s2">understand it is very poor</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">so then i ask the question so as to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.480" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">hopefully break filter bubbles</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:21.520" style="s2">if someone reads the comment thread and</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">is exposed to things that they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.520" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">exposed to on their own news feed</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:30.880" style="s2">to at least maybe inspire some people to</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:32.319" style="s2">look at something else no unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.880" end="01:04:34.079" style="s2">almost everyone who comments even if</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.319" end="01:04:35.680" style="s2">they hold different views share such</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.079" end="01:04:37.680" style="s2">poor quality comments because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.680" end="01:04:40.160" style="s2">just they&#39;re triggered and oriented</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.680" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">to do some kind of limbic hijacked thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.160" end="01:04:43.119" style="s2">that they don&#39;t even make a constructive</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:44.079" style="s2">enough argument that it&#39;s all that</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.119" end="01:04:45.520" style="s2">compelling</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.079" end="01:04:47.680" style="s2">this one of the things you&#39;ll notice is</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.520" end="01:04:49.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.680" end="01:04:51.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not compelled by stuff because we</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:53.039" style="s2">did formal epistemology and</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.280" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">propositional logic on it</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.039" end="01:04:56.240" style="s2">we&#39;re compelled because it feels truthy</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.240" end="01:05:01.119" style="s2">um or feels consequential and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">like if you&#39;ll notice that the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.119" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">that feels so obviously true to you</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:05.760" style="s2">feels obviously true to people who</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:07.440" style="s2">already believe what you believe and</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.760" end="01:05:08.640" style="s2">feels obviously not true to the other</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.440" end="01:05:10.559" style="s2">people when you put it out they</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.640" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">instantly see it as propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.559" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">gibberish right and so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:15.839" style="s2">communicating</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">that&#39;s just doubling down on groupthink</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.839" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">and tribalism</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:21.520" style="s2">and so but it&#39;s interesting to see why</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:21.520" style="s2">is it that</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.680" end="01:05:25.839" style="s2">and good to certain people and feels</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:28.240" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.839" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">stupid and evil to other people why does</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">it feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:32.240" style="s2">that different way well if i pay</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:33.520" style="s2">attention to the media environment that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.240" end="01:05:36.480" style="s2">they&#39;re taking in</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.520" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">feels true is largely resonant with what</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.480" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">they&#39;ve taken in so far</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">right like that&#39;s a big part of it so um</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">one of the things that i do on an issue</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:49.359" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:52.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say i want to make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.359" end="01:05:53.599" style="s2">police violence in the u.s or i want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.240" end="01:05:55.520" style="s2">make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.599" end="01:05:57.760" style="s2">the beirut blast or the india china</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.520" end="01:05:59.680" style="s2">border or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.760" end="01:06:01.119" style="s2">as far as narratives go there&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.680" end="01:06:03.280" style="s2">narrative there&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.119" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">there&#39;s usually not even two narratives</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.280" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">there might be five</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">or seven or eleven different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">narrative clusters there might be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:10.559" style="s2">hundred</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:12.400" style="s2">versions but they fall within general</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.559" end="01:06:13.920" style="s2">clusters</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.400" end="01:06:15.520" style="s2">and so what i&#39;ll usually try to do is do</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.920" end="01:06:17.359" style="s2">a landscape of what the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.520" end="01:06:20.640" style="s2">clusters are first</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.359" end="01:06:21.520" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll try to steal man each</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.640" end="01:06:24.559" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.520" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">like what is the strongest version of</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.559" end="01:06:27.440" style="s2">arguing that thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:28.480" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been able to see so look for</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.440" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">the best thinkers that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.480" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">representative of those narratives</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:35.039" style="s2">that&#39;s helpful for me to both see the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:36.319" style="s2">signal that they got because that</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.039" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">the collective intelligence of those</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.319" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">people doesn&#39;t have no signal</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:41.280" style="s2">it also helps me understand why they</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:43.039" style="s2">think what they think which also helps</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.280" end="01:06:46.160" style="s2">me understand how to maybe communicate</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.039" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">and relate but that doesn&#39;t mean that i</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.160" end="01:06:50.240" style="s2">agree with all of it it means that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:51.920" style="s2">seeking to understand it right</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.240" end="01:06:53.760" style="s2">so then the next thing i want to do is</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.920" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">after i&#39;ve done that which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.760" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">interpersonal intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">seeking to understand the narrative then</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:00.480" style="s2">i want to do a kind of empirical or</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:02.160" style="s2">objective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.480" end="01:07:03.680" style="s2">and break the narrative into individual</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.160" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">propositions</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.680" end="01:07:06.960" style="s2">and typically even framed in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">question are assumptions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.960" end="01:07:10.240" style="s2">presuppositions that are actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:11.200" style="s2">propositions so use propositional logic</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.240" end="01:07:12.640" style="s2">and break it into individual</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.200" end="01:07:14.400" style="s2">propositions and i say</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.640" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">what evidence have they put forward to</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.400" end="01:07:18.400" style="s2">support each of these propositions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.079" end="01:07:21.520" style="s2">typically it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.400" end="01:07:23.599" style="s2">i&#39;ll break a complex narrative into like</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.520" end="01:07:25.200" style="s2">50 propositions and there&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.599" end="01:07:27.039" style="s2">evidence for like four of them</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.200" end="01:07:28.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s usually like maybe strong</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.039" end="01:07:30.400" style="s2">evidence for two and kind of weak for</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.640" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">four and then a bunch of just</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.400" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">emotional leaps logical leaps so then</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:35.839" style="s2">i&#39;ll say what</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:37.280" style="s2">additional evidence can i get that will</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.839" end="01:07:41.599" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.280" end="01:07:43.599" style="s2">verify or falsify or at least support or</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.599" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">decrease the likelihood for any of these</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.599" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">and where are there ones that i can</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.799" end="01:07:47.520" style="s2">neither verify nor falsify and should</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">just sit as</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.520" end="01:07:52.720" style="s2">this is just a filler someone put in but</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">i have no basis for certainty whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.720" end="01:07:55.440" style="s2">i have to be comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:07:56.799" style="s2">uncertainty to be able to make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.440" end="01:07:58.160" style="s2">it or i will try to jump to false</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:00.160" style="s2">certainties</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.160" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">then i have to not only seek to verify</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.160" end="01:08:03.920" style="s2">and falsify each of those parts</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:05.520" style="s2">because most likely there&#39;s a few true</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.920" end="01:08:06.319" style="s2">parts a few nonsense parts and a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.520" end="01:08:08.319" style="s2">of filler</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.319" end="01:08:09.839" style="s2">right and that&#39;s true across the whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.319" end="01:08:11.039" style="s2">narrative space so then i also have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.839" end="01:08:12.160" style="s2">seek to do this across the other</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.039" end="01:08:15.440" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.160" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">so this is important because</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.440" end="01:08:22.319" style="s2">most people are jumping to what is true</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">very much not through a epistemic or</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.319" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">logical process even if they think</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.000" end="01:08:27.600" style="s2">it is what they if they really break it</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.159" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">down propositionally they&#39;ll find that</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.600" end="01:08:30.319" style="s2">they had a</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.560" end="01:08:32.159" style="s2">logical process of this seems true and</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.319" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">this seems true therefore and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.159" end="01:08:36.719" style="s2">has like eight</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">logical leaps in it um</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.719" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">so basically these are a few steps that</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:43.279" style="s2">i would encourage</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:43.600" style="s2">for people on their own to be dubious of</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.279" end="01:08:46.880" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.600" end="01:08:49.120" style="s2">own certainty and</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.880" end="01:08:51.080" style="s2">outrage to seek to understand the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.120" end="01:08:53.040" style="s2">narrative landscape better to seek</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.080" end="01:08:56.880" style="s2">empiricism better to</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.040" end="01:08:59.040" style="s2">try to be able to not reject or</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.880" end="01:09:00.799" style="s2">take entire narratives but be able to</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.040" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">look for partial truths</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.799" end="01:09:04.000" style="s2">to be able to try to aggregate signal</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.640" end="01:09:05.520" style="s2">across the space</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.000" end="01:09:07.679" style="s2">to be way more comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.520" end="01:09:08.400" style="s2">uncertainty and that&#39;s uncomfortable in</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.679" end="01:09:10.080" style="s2">a way to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.400" end="01:09:11.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t understand the world i live in</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.080" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">even in the most consequential areas i</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.839" end="01:09:15.520" style="s2">just don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.359" end="01:09:16.799" style="s2">at least that i actually feel safer</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.520" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">because i know that i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.799" end="01:09:19.520" style="s2">confirmation bias making me understand</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">it wrongly</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.520" end="01:09:22.640" style="s2">i at least have a chance to increase my</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.640" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">when i say i don&#39;t know because the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:28.000" style="s2">moment i think that i falsely know</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">now i&#39;m not even going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.000" end="01:09:33.679" style="s2">learn well right</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">so these are some examples of things and</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.679" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:41.520" style="s2">in addition to reading across the space</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.799" end="01:09:44.400" style="s2">actually seek the more</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.520" end="01:09:46.960" style="s2">um well-grounded and complex views as</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:50.560" style="s2">opposed to the more trending ones</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.960" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">uh i want to find the thinkers that seem</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.560" end="01:09:54.239" style="s2">most earnest</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.000" end="01:09:55.920" style="s2">and most well kind of educated and</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">thoughtful across the space and then i</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.920" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">want to see where people who have deep</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:00.960" style="s2">expertise and earnestness</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:03.600" style="s2">disagree and then i want to explore the</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.960" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">basis of the disagreement</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.600" end="01:10:08.880" style="s2">so just a few basic principles and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:10.960" style="s2">talked about this you&#39;ve had other</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.880" end="01:10:12.480" style="s2">whole videos on sense making practices</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.960" end="01:10:13.920" style="s2">but these are a few basic things</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.480" end="01:10:15.520" style="s2">the reason why i feel compelled to say</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.920" end="01:10:16.560" style="s2">this is because we were getting into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.520" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">project we&#39;re going to do and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.560" end="01:10:20.159" style="s2">project we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">working on by no means can do everything</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.159" end="01:10:24.239" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.360" end="01:10:27.679" style="s2">up yet so i want the first thing to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.239" end="01:10:27.679" style="s2">empowering people to work on on their</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.840" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">so the thing that we&#39;re doing is trying</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:37.120" style="s2">to do something like</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.040" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">a better version of the fourth estate a</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.120" end="01:10:41.040" style="s2">better version of news that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.280" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">relevant to the actual information</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.040" end="01:10:44.960" style="s2">landscape of the current moment</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:47.120" style="s2">and the critical aspects of education</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.960" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">that people didn&#39;t get that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.120" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">most helpful for them to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:51.679" style="s2">understand uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:53.840" style="s2">and sense make the world better on their</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.679" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">own and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:58.640" style="s2">we didn&#39;t actually start off thinking</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:11:00.640" style="s2">that we&#39;d be doing something like</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.640" end="01:11:02.159" style="s2">news or media we started out thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.640" end="01:11:03.840" style="s2">that we were doing something like</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.159" end="01:11:05.280" style="s2">the kind of intelligence and research</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.840" end="01:11:08.000" style="s2">work to be able to understand the</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.280" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2">escalation pathways to catastrophic risk</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.000" end="01:11:11.280" style="s2">so we were working on getting a much</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">better sense of</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.280" end="01:11:14.960" style="s2">supply chain fragilities and food</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:16.960" style="s2">security issues and</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.960" end="01:11:18.000" style="s2">uh the escalation pathways to different</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.960" end="01:11:19.520" style="s2">kinds of war and</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.000" end="01:11:20.800" style="s2">and that that&#39;s not just at a</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.520" end="01:11:22.320" style="s2">theoretical level but having to get a</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.800" end="01:11:23.440" style="s2">lot of detailed info about what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.320" end="01:11:25.520" style="s2">going on on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.440" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">to know where the actual escalation</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">pathways and those types of things are</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.840" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2">as we were and that was to inform</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:33.120" style="s2">strategic</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.600" end="01:11:35.679" style="s2">kinds of interventions that could really</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.120" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">help address it</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.679" end="01:11:37.840" style="s2">to be able to address it you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">talk to people who are in</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.840" end="01:11:40.800" style="s2">decision-making positions</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.360" end="01:11:42.080" style="s2">and share information with them to</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.800" end="01:11:43.280" style="s2">hopefully try to influence them in</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.080" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">different ways and so we had the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.280" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">opportunity to do that and speak to</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">people in</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:51.360" style="s2">in high level public and private</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:52.560" style="s2">influence positions and prepare</p>

<p begin="01:11:52.560" end="01:11:57.440" style="s2">and the information we&#39;re preparing the</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.159" end="01:12:00.239" style="s2">kind of briefings of those type</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.440" end="01:12:01.120" style="s2">take a tremendous amount of very skilled</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.239" end="01:12:04.080" style="s2">people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.120" end="01:12:05.360" style="s2">time to create actionable intel for</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.080" end="01:12:06.880" style="s2">someone who can make choices that are</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.360" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">quite consequential</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.880" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">and we were able to see that we could</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:13.600" style="s2">actually provide pretty novel insights</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:16.640" style="s2">in a number of areas because</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.600" end="01:12:17.199" style="s2">we weren&#39;t looking at the global issues</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.640" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.199" end="01:12:20.400" style="s2">um specialized siloed ways where a lot</p>

<p begin="01:12:20.400" end="01:12:26.400" style="s2">you know the issues are more complex</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:27.520" style="s2">than the institutional structures were</p>

<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:35.840" style="s2">kind of military groups looking at these</p>

<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">at cyber risks and but we see a world</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.360" end="01:12:42.800" style="s2">where something can start in one area</p>

<p begin="01:12:42.800" end="01:12:47.280" style="s2">and so looking at the interconnection of</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.400" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">them is actually critical to understand</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.280" end="01:12:51.199" style="s2">the world well so we were looking at</p>

<p begin="01:13:09.440" end="01:13:13.600" style="s2">this is actually what news should be</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.520" end="01:13:16.159" style="s2">like high-level</p>

<p begin="01:13:16.159" end="01:13:23.040" style="s2">should be national security or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.159" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">but um the idea of a decision maker</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.040" end="01:13:27.199" style="s2">who gets a lot of information processing</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:27.760" style="s2">is a fundamentally anti-democratic idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.199" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">right a</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.760" end="01:13:31.920" style="s2">democratic idea would be everyone can</p>

<p begin="01:13:31.920" end="01:13:36.159" style="s2">hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.560" end="01:13:40.320" style="s2">is actually more involved in the</p>

<p begin="01:13:43.679" end="01:13:48.719" style="s2">is the information processing not the</p>

<p begin="01:13:48.719" end="01:13:51.840" style="s2">a lot of people will share this idea</p>

<p begin="01:13:51.840" end="01:13:55.760" style="s2">i can pull up my smartphone and have</p>

<p begin="01:13:55.760" end="01:14:00.239" style="s2">the president had 20 years ago and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.080" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve democratized information access</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.239" end="01:14:03.920" style="s2">this is kind of a gibberish story</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.840" end="01:14:05.679" style="s2">because even though in one way it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:07.040" style="s2">i can&#39;t read the billion search results</p>

<p begin="01:14:10.880" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s not access to information it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:15:01.520" end="01:15:04.719" style="s2">and the same is true when it comes to</p>

<p begin="01:15:24.800" end="01:15:28.480" style="s2">and so we started thinking well can we</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.679" end="01:15:31.679" style="s2">can we make</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.480" end="01:15:33.760" style="s2">things like this as the news and</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.679" end="01:15:35.520" style="s2">at the same time one of the risks that</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.760" end="01:15:37.199" style="s2">we were seeing that was driving all of</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.520" end="01:15:38.480" style="s2">the other catastrophic risks the fastest</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.199" end="01:15:41.040" style="s2">was the news landscape</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.480" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">and i don&#39;t just mean the few large news</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.040" end="01:15:43.840" style="s2">channels i mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:45.360" style="s2">the media landscape that is the facebook</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.840" end="01:15:47.600" style="s2">issues we were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.360" end="01:15:48.560" style="s2">and you know all the youtube</p>

<p begin="01:15:48.560" end="01:15:53.199" style="s2">algorithms plus the nature of the news</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.239" end="01:15:55.199" style="s2">and all like that and we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.199" end="01:15:58.400" style="s2">you know people being willing to go up</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.199" end="01:15:58.400" style="s2">in arms over</p>

<p begin="01:16:20.159" end="01:16:23.679" style="s2">bottom of the stack is economic warfare</p>

<p begin="01:16:26.560" end="01:16:29.920" style="s2">at the end of the day if it has to is</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.840" end="01:16:32.239" style="s2">kinetic warfare guns and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.920" end="01:16:33.760" style="s2">but the front of it where the fastest</p>

<p begin="01:16:33.760" end="01:16:37.920" style="s2">is the narrative in info warfare that is</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:54.640" style="s2">polarization and radicalization just</p>

<p begin="01:17:52.080" end="01:17:55.600" style="s2">that will almost certainly not be</p>

<p begin="01:17:55.600" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">people really respond to and what gets</p>

<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:02.960" style="s2">has a few different kinds of information</p>

<p begin="01:18:02.960" end="01:18:06.480" style="s2">one is something that is like news</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.679" end="01:18:09.520" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.480" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">addressing critical current events and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.520" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">you know if you look at big news</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.880" end="01:18:14.960" style="s2">organizations they&#39;re huge organizations</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:16.640" style="s2">right like it&#39;s a lot of resource to try</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.960" end="01:18:18.480" style="s2">to do that you know you&#39;ve worked at bbc</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.640" end="01:18:20.800" style="s2">and big organizations</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.480" end="01:18:20.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.159" end="01:18:26.239" style="s2">and so if you for most people they would</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:29.520" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.239" end="01:18:31.120" style="s2">be best supported by having very good</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.520" end="01:18:32.320" style="s2">local news because they could if they</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.120" end="01:18:33.440" style="s2">could actually make better sense of</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.320" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2">their local world they would</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.440" end="01:18:37.280" style="s2">have more agency to do stuff about it</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.600" end="01:18:39.520" style="s2">but local news across everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.280" end="01:18:41.520" style="s2">is just an unbelievably tremendous job</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.520" end="01:18:44.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.520" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">tremendously large job and being able to</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.000" end="01:18:47.520" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.840" end="01:18:49.040" style="s2">news that is kind of eurocentric and</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.520" end="01:18:50.400" style="s2">asian-centric and whatever and across</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.040" end="01:18:52.640" style="s2">all the sectors is a lot so</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.400" end="01:18:54.239" style="s2">though rather than pick like one domain</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.640" end="01:18:56.480" style="s2">that we&#39;re starting in we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.239" end="01:18:56.480" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.719" end="01:19:03.679" style="s2">uh the most consequential things across</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.679" end="01:19:06.640" style="s2">areas from a global perspective</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.679" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">with a somewhat u.s centric audience we</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.640" end="01:19:10.000" style="s2">have to pick somewhere to start</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:11.679" style="s2">so what that means is domestic politics</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.000" end="01:19:14.080" style="s2">and geopolitics and economies and</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.679" end="01:19:16.239" style="s2">markets culture technology environment</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.080" end="01:19:17.920" style="s2">uh military all of those things where</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.239" end="01:19:20.840" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at what are the things</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.920" end="01:19:22.000" style="s2">that we believe are tier one</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.840" end="01:19:24.000" style="s2">consequential</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.000" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">in terms of how much they can change the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.000" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">overall</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.640" end="01:19:30.800" style="s2">nature of life in the world you know in</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.960" end="01:19:35.280" style="s2">the coming years and decades</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.800" end="01:19:36.080" style="s2">and being able to present that in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.280" end="01:19:39.040" style="s2">form of</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.080" end="01:19:40.159" style="s2">what looked like briefings across you</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.040" end="01:19:42.560" style="s2">know this week</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.159" end="01:19:44.000" style="s2">in the the happenings that happened that</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.560" end="01:19:46.800" style="s2">are of top consequence</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:47.840" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have and you know where we</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.800" end="01:19:50.159" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.840" end="01:19:51.600" style="s2">on the ground report networks that are</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.159" end="01:19:52.800" style="s2">anywhere near as robust as we want we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.600" end="01:19:54.400" style="s2">working on building those out but</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.800" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">largely we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.400" end="01:19:57.840" style="s2">groups that are reporting on it and</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.960" end="01:19:59.840" style="s2">being able to</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.840" end="01:20:01.760" style="s2">look across the whole space and be able</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.840" end="01:20:03.600" style="s2">to say factoring</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.760" end="01:20:05.120" style="s2">left and right and different countries</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.600" end="01:20:06.080" style="s2">perspectives and do that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.120" end="01:20:08.000" style="s2">synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.080" end="01:20:09.840" style="s2">what is the clearest thing that we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:11.840" style="s2">say with confidence</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.840" end="01:20:13.760" style="s2">and so we&#39;re looking at things that are</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.840" end="01:20:14.080" style="s2">maximally consequential and what we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.760" end="01:20:15.760" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.080" end="01:20:17.600" style="s2">with confidence that actually is</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.760" end="01:20:18.400" style="s2">calibrated from a kind of formal process</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.600" end="01:20:20.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.400" end="01:20:22.719" style="s2">is trans ideology trans narrative rather</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.880" end="01:20:24.960" style="s2">than supporting a particular political</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.719" end="01:20:26.560" style="s2">agenda or economic agenda</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.960" end="01:20:28.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s designed to be a second</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.560" end="01:20:29.679" style="s2">simplicity meaning a lot of complexity</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.320" end="01:20:30.480" style="s2">of research goes into it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.679" end="01:20:32.400" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.480" end="01:20:33.760" style="s2">as simple to understand as possible so</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.400" end="01:20:35.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a low barrier of entry of</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.760" end="01:20:36.639" style="s2">starting to get something that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.120" end="01:20:39.679" style="s2">have narrative spin or</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.639" end="01:20:40.960" style="s2">info manipulation in it now if someone</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.679" end="01:20:42.400" style="s2">wants to go deeper and someone could</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.960" end="01:20:45.199" style="s2">easily ask well why would i trust that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.400" end="01:20:46.560" style="s2">as opposed to anything else</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.199" end="01:20:47.840" style="s2">we would say you&#39;re not trusting us</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.560" end="01:20:49.360" style="s2">because we&#39;re a particular authority</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.840" end="01:20:51.040" style="s2">we&#39;re hoping that you trust your own</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.360" end="01:20:52.400" style="s2">sense making progressively better and</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.040" end="01:20:54.159" style="s2">we&#39;re showing you in detail</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.400" end="01:20:54.639" style="s2">transparently how we do our sense making</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.159" end="01:20:56.159" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.639" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">how we currently have it structured is</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.159" end="01:21:00.400" style="s2">that someone can see that briefing</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:02.080" style="s2">and then one of the there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.400" end="01:21:03.760" style="s2">places they can go to go deeper one of</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.080" end="01:21:05.840" style="s2">them is a under the hood feature</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.760" end="01:21:07.920" style="s2">where they can see the epistemic process</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.840" end="01:21:09.520" style="s2">the sense making process we used to come</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.920" end="01:21:10.400" style="s2">up with that so what things did we read</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.520" end="01:21:12.239" style="s2">and look at</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.400" end="01:21:14.400" style="s2">what data sets did we include what data</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.239" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">sets did we say we had low confidence in</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.400" end="01:21:17.760" style="s2">and decided to throw out or</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:19.920" style="s2">put a discount rate on and what</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.760" end="01:21:21.520" style="s2">epistemic frames did we use</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:23.440" style="s2">and so if someone wants to see that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.520" end="01:21:25.120" style="s2">can so now this is them also learning</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.440" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">how are we making sense of the world so</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.120" end="01:21:28.639" style="s2">they can both give us feedback on hey i</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:30.239" style="s2">think you miss weighted this data set or</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.639" end="01:21:33.120" style="s2">there&#39;s this other data center frame</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.239" end="01:21:34.400" style="s2">awesome but they can also be learning i</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.120" end="01:21:35.679" style="s2">guess i could have done that i could</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.400" end="01:21:37.120" style="s2">have looked at all of those sources i</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.679" end="01:21:38.560" style="s2">could have applied these frames i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.120" end="01:21:39.199" style="s2">even know some of those frames now that</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.560" end="01:21:41.120" style="s2">i know them</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.199" end="01:21:42.800" style="s2">so they&#39;re increasing in their own sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.120" end="01:21:46.719" style="s2">making capacity by seeing</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.800" end="01:21:49.520" style="s2">how we&#39;re doing it of course we also</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.719" end="01:21:51.199" style="s2">uh want to show retrospectives of where</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.520" end="01:21:52.719" style="s2">we made forecasts or said</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.199" end="01:21:54.400" style="s2">what was going on where we later found</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.719" end="01:21:55.840" style="s2">out that we were wrong or right or we</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.400" end="01:21:57.280" style="s2">get to show here&#39;s where we were wrong</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.840" end="01:21:58.880" style="s2">here&#39;s where we were right</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.280" end="01:22:00.960" style="s2">where we were wrong how are we updating</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.880" end="01:22:03.520" style="s2">our models so really good transparency</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.960" end="01:22:05.120" style="s2">and earnestness in that whole process</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.520" end="01:22:06.800" style="s2">also so you can do the kind of under the</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.120" end="01:22:07.120" style="s2">hood thing you can also do the meta news</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.800" end="01:22:09.360" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.120" end="01:22:11.520" style="s2">the meta news is okay so here&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.360" end="01:22:12.880" style="s2">were able to find out about this topic</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:14.320" style="s2">but that sounds different than what you</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.880" end="01:22:16.480" style="s2">read in the new york times or the</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.320" end="01:22:18.000" style="s2">atlantic or breitbart or mother jones or</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.480" end="01:22:19.120" style="s2">rt or whatever other place you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.000" end="01:22:21.199" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.120" end="01:22:22.480" style="s2">why what do they say why do they say</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.199" end="01:22:23.760" style="s2">that why did we come up with something</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.480" end="01:22:25.120" style="s2">different what is our assessment of what</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.760" end="01:22:27.120" style="s2">they came up with</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.120" end="01:22:28.960" style="s2">so this is actually and of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.120" end="01:22:31.040" style="s2">not going to be able to do that for all</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.960" end="01:22:33.120" style="s2">news sources right we we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.040" end="01:22:34.400" style="s2">looked at about 1500 new sources in our</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.120" end="01:22:36.080" style="s2">curation process we kind of have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.400" end="01:22:38.000" style="s2">collapse those to ones that cluster</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.080" end="01:22:39.120" style="s2">in a similar type of narrative and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.000" end="01:22:40.639" style="s2">pick you know some of the better</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.120" end="01:22:42.880" style="s2">exemplars of those</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.639" end="01:22:44.159" style="s2">and say okay so here&#39;s the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.880" end="01:22:45.679" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.159" end="01:22:47.760" style="s2">we&#39;ll go ahead and steel man that</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.679" end="01:22:49.280" style="s2">narrative landscape and then we will</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.760" end="01:22:51.120" style="s2">break it down</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.280" end="01:22:53.520" style="s2">into individual propositions and say</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.120" end="01:22:56.080" style="s2">what can we verify what can we falsify</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.520" end="01:22:58.080" style="s2">so we are helping people to understand</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.080" end="01:23:00.239" style="s2">the world through more of the lenses</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.080" end="01:23:01.920" style="s2">understand why people other people think</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.239" end="01:23:02.639" style="s2">what they think even have a clear sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.920" end="01:23:05.199" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.639" end="01:23:06.000" style="s2">then also understand how to empirically</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.199" end="01:23:08.480" style="s2">validate</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.000" end="01:23:10.560" style="s2">these things then we also show the</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.480" end="01:23:12.560" style="s2">narrative and info weapons so we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.560" end="01:23:14.639" style="s2">okay so in this piece here</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.560" end="01:23:16.000" style="s2">here&#39;s the original piece of science</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.639" end="01:23:16.560" style="s2">that they were quoting or the original</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.000" end="01:23:18.400" style="s2">video</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.560" end="01:23:19.920" style="s2">or that they were referencing but then</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.400" end="01:23:22.159" style="s2">here&#39;s the way they framed it this is</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.920" end="01:23:24.320" style="s2">lakehoff framing this is a kind of spin</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.159" end="01:23:26.320" style="s2">now that same thing is has spin on it</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.320" end="01:23:28.080" style="s2">over here that&#39;s of a different type so</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.320" end="01:23:29.520" style="s2">let&#39;s explain the concept of lakehoff</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.080" end="01:23:32.080" style="s2">framing and spin</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.520" end="01:23:34.639" style="s2">and or russell conjugation or those</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.080" end="01:23:37.040" style="s2">kinds of narrative weapons and say</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.639" end="01:23:38.400" style="s2">look for these everywhere right and this</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.040" end="01:23:39.679" style="s2">isn&#39;t the left saying the right</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.400" end="01:23:41.280" style="s2">snooze is fake or the right saying the</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.679" end="01:23:43.280" style="s2">left news is fake this is saying</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.280" end="01:23:46.239" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s playing the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.280" end="01:23:47.520" style="s2">game is subject to some of the same</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.239" end="01:23:49.040" style="s2">pressures</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.520" end="01:23:50.880" style="s2">and these are some of the tools that get</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.040" end="01:23:53.280" style="s2">used so look for them</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.880" end="01:23:54.080" style="s2">and also there&#39;s some signal in all of</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.280" end="01:23:56.320" style="s2">these places</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.080" end="01:23:57.440" style="s2">so we&#39;re not coming out as the this is</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.320" end="01:23:59.280" style="s2">fake news but</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.440" end="01:24:01.360" style="s2">there is some signal let&#39;s try to verify</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.280" end="01:24:03.280" style="s2">it and there is some distortion</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.360" end="01:24:04.960" style="s2">so the goal in the meta news is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.280" end="01:24:06.000" style="s2">someone doesn&#39;t hear what we say and say</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.960" end="01:24:07.440" style="s2">okay well that&#39;s just one other</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.000" end="01:24:08.719" style="s2">narrative with lots of narratives they</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.440" end="01:24:10.080" style="s2">actually get to see all the narratives</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.719" end="01:24:10.880" style="s2">and they get to see how we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:12.400" style="s2">sense of them</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.880" end="01:24:14.320" style="s2">and they get to also apply their own</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.400" end="01:24:17.199" style="s2">capacity to make sense of them</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.320" end="01:24:19.280" style="s2">and we make explicit the narrative and</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.199" end="01:24:21.440" style="s2">info weapons</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.280" end="01:24:22.880" style="s2">so that people can recognize them more</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.440" end="01:24:26.719" style="s2">on their own</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.880" end="01:24:28.320" style="s2">and by also by reifying the true parts</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.719" end="01:24:30.080" style="s2">and being able to say where something is</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.320" end="01:24:32.239" style="s2">either clearly falsifiable or we just</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.080" end="01:24:35.520" style="s2">can neither verify nor falsify it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.239" end="01:24:36.960" style="s2">conjecture or spin we hopefully help</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.520" end="01:24:40.080" style="s2">people neither just</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.960" end="01:24:42.719" style="s2">accept nor reject any standard narrative</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.080" end="01:24:44.930" style="s2">but be able to take a more rigorous and</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.719" end="01:24:48.480" style="s2">nuanced view across all of them</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.930" end="01:24:50.719" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.480" end="01:24:52.239" style="s2">then of course there&#39;s places where to</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.719" end="01:24:55.040" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.239" end="01:24:57.199" style="s2">there&#39;s education that people need for</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.040" end="01:24:59.600" style="s2">frames right like they need some history</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.199" end="01:25:01.040" style="s2">around this india china border conflict</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.600" end="01:25:02.320" style="s2">or they need to understand certain</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.040" end="01:25:04.480" style="s2">things around</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:06.239" style="s2">why the high altitude place where the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.480" end="01:25:07.920" style="s2">watershed is and missile defense and</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.239" end="01:25:08.400" style="s2">whatever would be the strategic targets</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.920" end="01:25:12.320" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.400" end="01:25:15.199" style="s2">or um so we&#39;ll also do either</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.320" end="01:25:15.600" style="s2">curate if there&#39;s a perfect educational</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.199" end="01:25:17.520" style="s2">piece</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.600" end="01:25:19.520" style="s2">that really does a very good job or a</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.520" end="01:25:20.000" style="s2">few we&#39;ll curate those but we&#39;ll also</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.520" end="01:25:22.719" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.000" end="01:25:24.239" style="s2">pieces that provide the critical aspects</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.719" end="01:25:25.280" style="s2">of education that peop most people</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.239" end="01:25:27.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.280" end="01:25:29.760" style="s2">and where we also try to do kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.040" end="01:25:31.040" style="s2">pareto optimization on this so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.760" end="01:25:32.320" style="s2">say we&#39;re talking here about the</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.040" end="01:25:33.600" style="s2">facebook issues and there&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.320" end="01:25:35.040" style="s2">trending in the news around what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:25:35.040" end="01:25:37.679" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.920" end="01:25:39.120" style="s2">so if someone&#39;s read marshall mcluhan</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.679" end="01:25:40.400" style="s2">they&#39;re going to understand things about</p>

<p begin="01:25:40.400" end="01:25:42.639" style="s2">going to have but not everybody&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.520" end="01:25:43.840" style="s2">to go read mcluhan</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.639" end="01:25:45.760" style="s2">and we want to be able to reference</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.840" end="01:25:47.120" style="s2">mcluhan for media theory but also lake</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.760" end="01:25:49.040" style="s2">off for media theory</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.120" end="01:25:50.320" style="s2">and then gerard for conflict theory and</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.040" end="01:25:52.880" style="s2">other types of conflict theory and</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.320" end="01:25:54.159" style="s2">poetry for institutional decay but also</p>

<p begin="01:25:54.159" end="01:25:56.560" style="s2">institutional decay there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.600" end="01:25:58.480" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.560" end="01:26:00.239" style="s2">where those epistemic frames give you</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.480" end="01:26:01.280" style="s2">the ability to understand stuff better</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.239" end="01:26:02.239" style="s2">but people aren&#39;t going to go read all</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.280" end="01:26:04.560" style="s2">those books so</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.239" end="01:26:06.000" style="s2">can we take the critical model that</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.560" end="01:26:06.639" style="s2">gives a lot of help in that book and</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.000" end="01:26:09.520" style="s2">make a</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.639" end="01:26:10.400" style="s2">three or ten page essay that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.520" end="01:26:13.520" style="s2">gives the</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.400" end="01:26:15.600" style="s2">most epistemic reifying power</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.520" end="01:26:16.560" style="s2">in the easiest information compression</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.600" end="01:26:16.960" style="s2">and say if you want to read the whole</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.560" end="01:26:18.800" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.960" end="01:26:20.880" style="s2">please do otherwise here&#39;s at least some</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.800" end="01:26:22.719" style="s2">basic stuff similar with the history</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.880" end="01:26:25.760" style="s2">pieces and the context pieces</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.719" end="01:26:29.199" style="s2">so this is hoping to be able to give it</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.760" end="01:26:30.560" style="s2">easy low barrier of entry overview of</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.199" end="01:26:33.760" style="s2">critical things</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.560" end="01:26:36.480" style="s2">with progressively deeper capacities to</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.760" end="01:26:38.000" style="s2">learn sense making and epistemology and</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.480" end="01:26:39.600" style="s2">the kinds of background necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.000" end="01:26:42.719" style="s2">understand the world better</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.600" end="01:26:44.480" style="s2">now this is in a way this is like a big</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.719" end="01:26:46.239" style="s2">project and ambitious and another way</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.480" end="01:26:47.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just trying to do broadcast news</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.239" end="01:26:51.040" style="s2">and education right</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.600" end="01:26:51.840" style="s2">right um which is almost going back to</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.040" end="01:26:55.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.840" end="01:26:56.560" style="s2">uh so the decentralized aspect because</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.040" end="01:26:58.320" style="s2">it&#39;s centralized right</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.560" end="01:27:00.639" style="s2">the wikipedia thing is hard to control</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.320" end="01:27:02.560" style="s2">but you can control for a smaller team</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.639" end="01:27:04.639" style="s2">of people that have really quality</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.560" end="01:27:07.520" style="s2">epistemics and</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.639" end="01:27:09.120" style="s2">knowledge process and we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.520" end="01:27:10.239" style="s2">bring together a really exceptional team</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.120" end="01:27:12.320" style="s2">and are continuing to</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.239" end="01:27:14.800" style="s2">look for and grow that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.320" end="01:27:18.239" style="s2">hard to find people who can do this</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.800" end="01:27:18.639" style="s2">because like to do the core sense making</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.239" end="01:27:21.920" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.639" end="01:27:25.120" style="s2">we need people who are</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.920" end="01:27:26.880" style="s2">capable of doing two things well one</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.120" end="01:27:29.120" style="s2">is trans narrative right that they are</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.880" end="01:27:30.400" style="s2">not so emotionally captured by a</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.120" end="01:27:32.239" style="s2">particular narrative that they can</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.400" end="01:27:36.159" style="s2">actually do a really good job of</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.239" end="01:27:38.639" style="s2">steel manning all of the narratives and</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.159" end="01:27:40.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of a intersubjective</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.639" end="01:27:42.320" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.400" end="01:27:44.159" style="s2">and then on the objective side we need</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.320" end="01:27:46.880" style="s2">people who can do empiricism well</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.159" end="01:27:47.440" style="s2">across in an interdisciplinary way</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.880" end="01:27:50.400" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.440" end="01:27:52.639" style="s2">multiple disciplines because if i want</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.400" end="01:27:55.280" style="s2">to understand almost any of these issues</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.639" end="01:27:56.480" style="s2">the lens of finance is critical but not</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.280" end="01:27:58.960" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.480" end="01:28:00.239" style="s2">the lens of culture is critical but not</p>

<p begin="01:28:00.239" end="01:28:04.560" style="s2">of um narrative warfare or politics or</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.760" end="01:28:07.600" style="s2">whatever so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.560" end="01:28:08.880" style="s2">quite a lot of environmental psychology</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.600" end="01:28:10.960" style="s2">or infrastructure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.880" end="01:28:12.480" style="s2">a lot of different specialty domains</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.960" end="01:28:14.159" style="s2">that need to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.480" end="01:28:16.000" style="s2">factored so there&#39;s a lot of narratives</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.159" end="01:28:18.080" style="s2">and a lot of epistemologies</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.000" end="01:28:19.760" style="s2">so we&#39;re looking for people internally</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.080" end="01:28:22.239" style="s2">who can do</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.760" end="01:28:23.840" style="s2">uh interdisciplinary and trans-narrative</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.239" end="01:28:25.840" style="s2">thinking so then of course people who</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.840" end="01:28:27.040" style="s2">are specialists or do hold a particular</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.840" end="01:28:28.639" style="s2">ideology can give</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.040" end="01:28:30.560" style="s2">input but we can take the input across</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.639" end="01:28:34.239" style="s2">those spaces and try to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.560" end="01:28:36.000" style="s2">analysis and then synthesis on it</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.239" end="01:28:37.280" style="s2">the decentralized sense making is</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.000" end="01:28:41.280" style="s2">something that we want to</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.280" end="01:28:45.280" style="s2">experiment with we&#39;re actually um</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.280" end="01:28:47.440" style="s2">yeah looking at being able to uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.280" end="01:28:48.960" style="s2">crowdsource different projects and be</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.440" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">able to help up regulate some of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.960" end="01:28:51.920" style="s2">right ones and</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.400" end="01:28:53.920" style="s2">you know even where you have articles</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.920" end="01:28:56.000" style="s2">that have forums</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.920" end="01:28:57.520" style="s2">can we experiment with architectures in</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.000" end="01:28:59.040" style="s2">the forum that incent</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.520" end="01:29:00.480" style="s2">both higher quality sentence making and</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.040" end="01:29:02.480" style="s2">higher quality conversation where those</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.480" end="01:29:05.920" style="s2">are the things that get up regulated</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.480" end="01:29:07.360" style="s2">um i think we can and we have a number</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.920" end="01:29:08.960" style="s2">of kind of ideas on how to make</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.360" end="01:29:10.560" style="s2">architectures that really incent that</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.960" end="01:29:13.280" style="s2">social architectures built in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.560" end="01:29:16.800" style="s2">digital space</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.280" end="01:29:18.480" style="s2">and so the hope here is that let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.800" end="01:29:20.239" style="s2">that it&#39;s a small percentage of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.480" end="01:29:22.639" style="s2">total audience</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.239" end="01:29:25.120" style="s2">that spends a lot of time and that</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.639" end="01:29:28.159" style="s2">really has the high epistemic drive and</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.120" end="01:29:29.840" style="s2">capacity to sense make very well</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.159" end="01:29:31.920" style="s2">well even if it&#39;s a small percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.840" end="01:29:33.679" style="s2">the total audience</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.920" end="01:29:35.360" style="s2">some of those people are in everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.679" end="01:29:37.040" style="s2">friend group almost everybody&#39;s friend</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.360" end="01:29:38.080" style="s2">group almost every major facebook group</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.040" end="01:29:39.840" style="s2">or social network</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.080" end="01:29:42.000" style="s2">if those people have really good data</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.840" end="01:29:44.239" style="s2">sources much better epistemology things</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.000" end="01:29:46.239" style="s2">that are addressing well</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.239" end="01:29:48.239" style="s2">all of the sides of various things and</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.239" end="01:29:49.679" style="s2">they&#39;re learning how to do dialectic and</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.239" end="01:29:51.120" style="s2">steel manning well they can start to</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.679" end="01:29:52.960" style="s2">influence the spaces they&#39;re in to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.120" end="01:29:54.800" style="s2">able to do better sense making</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.960" end="01:29:56.239" style="s2">often times the people who have best</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.800" end="01:29:57.760" style="s2">sense making are also employed by the</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.239" end="01:29:59.520" style="s2">people who are in top institutional</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.760" end="01:30:00.480" style="s2">positions of power as strategists and</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.520" end="01:30:04.480" style="s2">analysts or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.480" end="01:30:04.480" style="s2">to be able to influence those things so</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.760" end="01:30:09.679" style="s2">basically the information commons is not</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.719" end="01:30:11.520" style="s2">being stewarded</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.679" end="01:30:13.520" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do something to start</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.520" end="01:30:15.520" style="s2">stewarding the information commons</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.520" end="01:30:16.800" style="s2">and to make that a strange attractor of</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.520" end="01:30:19.040" style="s2">more things that will start to do that</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.800" end="01:30:21.199" style="s2">that&#39;s why this is a non-profit project</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.040" end="01:30:22.320" style="s2">is we&#39;re not willing to ever put ads on</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.199" end="01:30:23.760" style="s2">we&#39;re not willing to put it behind a</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.320" end="01:30:25.520" style="s2">paywall that makes it not accessible to</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.760" end="01:30:26.560" style="s2">everyone to really democratize the</p>

<p begin="01:30:26.560" end="01:30:30.239" style="s2">that quality of information processing</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.239" end="01:30:32.159" style="s2">has to be freely available to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.239" end="01:30:33.600" style="s2">we also aren&#39;t willing to take any prof</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.159" end="01:30:35.120" style="s2">non-profit funds that have any strings</p>

<p begin="01:30:35.120" end="01:30:38.880" style="s2">so it has to be people that actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.639" end="01:30:40.800" style="s2">believe that increasing</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.880" end="01:30:42.480" style="s2">decentralized collective intelligence is</p>

<p begin="01:30:45.360" end="01:30:48.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know what we&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.880" end="01:30:50.560" style="s2">right now is people who</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.560" end="01:30:51.840" style="s2">either like if there are people who</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.560" end="01:30:52.960" style="s2">would want to put capital into that</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.840" end="01:30:54.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a timely need</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.960" end="01:30:56.000" style="s2">if there are people who have really</p>
