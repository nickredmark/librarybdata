<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">just to start us</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">off would you like to kind of give us</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">some context for your for your</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:24.879" style="s2">sure um i i presently work a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">young in-depth psychology um in in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.879" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">personal work</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">um i work one-on-one with clients and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">teach classes and workshops kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">based around</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">shadow work and dreams mythology</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">archetype symbolism kind of diving into</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">these deeper levels of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">and to me kind of exploring the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.920" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">archetype is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">important for us to understand these</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">aspects of our psychology that we may</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:52.239" style="s2">not be as present to or what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">in the inner and outer world so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.239" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">coming from that place</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">both kind of tapping into the psychic</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">dynamic the spiritual dynamic the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:01.439" style="s2">cultural dynamic and trying to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">all of those together</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">um so you&#39;ll see me speak about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">through my client work also on my</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">and yeah a little bit about what i do</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">wonderful so just to start us off</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">what what really comes forth for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">when you were thinking about what to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">bring for</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">philosopher queens what were the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">archetypes that like came to your mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">and could you tell us a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">about that sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">um i really wanted to launch off today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">conversation by talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">archetype of the matriarch</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">um and i think that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">sort of collectively</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">we sense is rising in um both</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">inside of individuals but also in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">collective sphere</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">this is when we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">matriarch we&#39;re tapping into</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">the feminine principled leadership</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">responsibility wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">coming from not just in inherently women</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">but from a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">feminine disposition in our own minds so</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">that that archetype of the matriarch can</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">be tapped into no matter who the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">is um and that feminine principle is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">really about</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">enduring and containing it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">holding um</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">patience sort of this gestating um that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">emotional depth connection that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t maybe jump as much to like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">logos principle of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">rationale and logic but i think the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">matriarch actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">stands very interestingly in both realms</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">of kind of mixing that that more eros</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">relational principle with the logos</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">principle because she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">she has to be so tapped into how others</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">are communicating and what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">thinking to be able to be in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">leadership place that she kind of weaves</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">between those different places in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">really sort of beautiful harmonious way</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:53.039" style="s2">so the matriarch was something that i</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">was hoping we could really dive into</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">because partially i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">uh the philosopher queen the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">of the philosopher queen is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">a powerful matriarch figure um and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">something that i think you&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">cultivating in this space</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">yeah definitely and i think you know for</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">the in the first session</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">i i talked about how i had an acid trip</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">and um i had this like singularity</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">moment where i was like becoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">my my mother and um i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">uh moving from i guess the maiden and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">archetype that you would</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">you would talk about um in a youngin</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">sense but moving from being like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">young woman</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">into the matriarchal figure especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">where there&#39;s different ideas of what</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">the what the feminine path is</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">like there&#39;s a sense of female</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">leadership as a as you would go into</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">politics or into career but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">actually becoming a mother and those two</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">paths in a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">contemporary uh sense are almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:06:59.599" style="s2">divergent</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">you know to do one is almost to not be</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.599" end="00:07:03.520" style="s2">able to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">the other and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.520" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">um tension that i personally feel in</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">terms of rising into this</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">this this archetype of the matriarch and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:14.639" style="s2">i guess i&#39;m kind of wondering about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">that transition period</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:18.880" style="s2">right like moving from the maiden to to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">the matriarch how do we rise</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.880" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">into being these like queenly figures</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">and what is what is maybe the jungian or</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">kind of psychological transformation</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">of that yeah i think the first thing i</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">want to sort of call attention to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">is the point you&#39;re making about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">like the modern woman having to choose</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">working and um kind of supporting in</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">in say like the business or outer realm</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">sometimes seems um</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t support also being a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">mother or being</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">in the home as an example and i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:52.879" style="s2">some of the most powerful matriarchs we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">think about it on this</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.879" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">long scale of time and development of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">of the human race is that the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">powerful matriarchs were</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">ones who juggled both of those um roles</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">that they might have been tribal leaders</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">healers medicine women they were both</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">mothers but they were also leaders in</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">their communities and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">if we remember that we have that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">capacity inside of us we</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">have the ability to tap into uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">being present to our family becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">living that life while also doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">something um outside of that role</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">as well so i think it&#39;s just inherent to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">our ability and our capabilities um as</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">women to really</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">juggle all of that because there is this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">as i kind of mentioned there&#39;s this like</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">enduring</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">capacity of both sacrifice but also</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">replenishment that&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">feminine principle</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">um so i think that for anyone sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">struggling to feel if those things are</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">i certainly think uh they are both</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">within our psyche and spirit we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">these deep sort of instinctual elements</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">that we can draw upon</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">the archetype of the matriarch to really</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">guide us through</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:05.200" style="s2">um and then just to the other point</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">about the the transitional</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">phase of the maiden into the matriarch</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">i always really like to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">kind of next unfolding step</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">of the archetypal journey as being</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">both a point of tension because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">sort of trial and an initiation like</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">what what does it mean for the maiden</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">for the that young sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">unshaped ego consciousness to move into</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">motherhood which is to move into</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">maturity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">to to learn what the sacrifice uh will</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">as you move away from that more selfish</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">bubble that you&#39;ve been in to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">sacrifice your body as well to bring</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">life into this space and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">um and and really being willing to face</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">like the challenges that come</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">with any of these points of transition</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">and understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">um those moments of collision and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">tension are opportunities for us to grow</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">more deeply into just these more</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:05.120" style="s2">realized individuals</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">and it is a loss in some ways you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.120" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">there&#39;s always something that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">leave behind as we transition from one</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">mode of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">into another but it&#39;s kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">this is our story this is really who</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">we&#39;re meant to be evolving growing</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">transforming beings rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">kind of stagnant and stuck in a space of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">of youth</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">um and just to kind of throw another</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">archetypal spin on it like those who</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">stay stuck in that youthful place um</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">kind of then step into like the puer</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">syndrome the peter pan the eternal child</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">and so that becomes its own</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">pathological dynamic that um we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">be aware of so turning towards the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:48.399" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:48.399" style="s2">as an opening of opportunity and growth</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">even in the name like peter pan</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">it really seems to indicate that that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:58.320" style="s2">something um</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">common in masculine development it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.320" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">interesting to be thinking about it from</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">the feminine context</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">because i mean the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">situation for women is so unique</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">like considering our history and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">know the fact that there has been a kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">of decoupling</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.079" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">where you can become a matriarch in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">sense of like a leader as a woman</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">and never have gone through the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.880" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">of pregnancy you know and because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">part of the initiation</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">right into the matriarchal is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">motherly</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.320" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">kind of dimension yeah um and so i i</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">guess i&#39;m i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">what is like your understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">kind of peter pan syndrome for</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">for a woman sure yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">they&#39;re it&#39;s sort of like classical</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:45.519" style="s2">young terms sort of drawing on latin is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">the puer and that&#39;s the boy</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the eternal the child in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">masculine sense but the puella</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">is the the eternal child of the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a recognition of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">certainly of when the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">consciousness becomes</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">stuck and rooted in that place and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">just recognizing the complexity of an</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">individual&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">psychology is you can very outwardly</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">look like you&#39;ve stepped into this role</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">of let&#39;s say the matriarch you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">you&#39;re really successful in your work</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">and um you know financially stable and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">all these things are great but</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">internally there&#39;s a piece of you that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:22.959" style="s2">has yet to be initiated or grown</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">into say motherhood because there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.959" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">that puella dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">and maybe a fear of really embracing</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:30.959" style="s2">what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">leave behind uh youth and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">um to to understand what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">and to to bring life into this world</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">now solely responsible for which is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">terrifying thing to really consider i</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">think for many of us who have yet to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">have children</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">so you can have this dynamic of mature</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">aspects</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">that are at a tension with um</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">severely um underdeveloped um more</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">immature aspects and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">that feminine principle kind of stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:03.920" style="s2">that place might stay</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">in naivety um she might be overly</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.920" end="00:13:07.120" style="s2">trusting</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">as well kind of always giving of herself</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">but never actually really</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">putting the roots down i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">tends to be very characteristic of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">poer and the pueblas they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">just floating</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">they&#39;re floating through life they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">scared to anchor</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">um scared to really connect and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">some other kind of dynamic going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">that&#39;s caused that something they may be</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">running from inside of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">but kind of really opening up to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">the transformation that might come from</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">really rooting and anchoring</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">and sacrificing might actually be the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:43.839" style="s2">sort of medicine that&#39;s needed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:43.839" style="s2">bring balance to that more immature side</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">so i&#39;m hearing you use the word mother</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">in a literal</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">sense which i think is so important with</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">birth and the cycles of evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">archetypes and the new forms</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">i was wondering about the metamorphoral</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">woman the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">the women of philosophy the women of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">design the women of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">internal fabric however the woman of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">internal fire</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">the the woman giving birth to um</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">new forms of being yeah do you see a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">metaphysical connection</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">between that kind of mother and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">the mother giving birth on a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">physical level yeah absolutely um</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">that feminine principle of the mother</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:37.040" style="s2">that archetype is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">purely of creation and and how does that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">really become um sort of concretized</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">into an individual&#39;s life what are they</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">giving birth to what are they breathing</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">life into sometimes it&#39;s an actual human</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">being that other times it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">it&#39;s some grander project</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">some goal of life something at least at</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">this time that you&#39;re cultivating and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">that kind of requires that deeply</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">mothering</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">instinctual nature to to nurture it</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.959" end="00:15:06.639" style="s2">and and bring it slowly into existence</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.639" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not to say that you can&#39;t really be</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">who you&#39;re meant to be if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">have a child or something like that i</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">think some people know very deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">downside that that&#39;s what they&#39;re meant</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">for and that&#39;s what they are here to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2">give but there are other ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">to pass on the knowledge and insight and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">of of yourself and that can come through</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">the offerings</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">that um that that&#39;s birthed through that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">creation principle so certainly really</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">happen in many other forms as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">many other forms metaphysical connection</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about like giving</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">birth whether</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">it&#39;s to uh child or current or</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:49.040" style="s2">to a beautiful form of art and how this</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">all related to kind of this this cycle</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">of birth</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">yeah what i think of here is</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">this is a little dark and but this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">philosopher quaint um the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:10.399" style="s2">the darkness the shadow the the pain</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">of giving birth whether to a child</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.399" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">or a new current or</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">a new art movement or you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">even a a new project a new company</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">yeah the the pain and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">cycle of rebirth through that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">how would you describe the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">connection in relation to the pain of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">giving birth metaphorically and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">and how this this connected the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">shadow</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">yeah um i i think that we can look</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">towards a lot of uh mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">folklore and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">see like the vindictive angry</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:54.480" style="s2">controlling mother where we see that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">birth and creation has caused some sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.480" end="00:16:57.440" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">manifestation of darkness in the mother</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.440" end="00:17:01.120" style="s2">and she&#39;s no longer in balance she&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">longer the great mother she&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.120" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">moved into this darker place and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">kind of happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">when that occurs is is highly really</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">on the situation but often times</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">when i think an individual hasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">integrated that more</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">youthful maiden kind of earlier</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">child-like essence and they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">maybe thrust into sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">archetypal motherhood there can be this</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">anger and this resentment</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">that just boils and boils in the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">and then eventually it starts lashing</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:37.919" style="s2">out and that might look</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">like the you know the evil wicked</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.919" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">stepmother who&#39;s just always angry at</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:44.080" style="s2">at the young princess or something like</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">that and if you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.080" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">psychologically as we often do from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">union perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">that maiden that princess the young girl</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">the young girl inside of herself or this</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">the evil stepmother is the part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">herself that can manifest as bad and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">how might uh the evil stepmother be</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">railing against the maiden</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">inside of her because she maybe feels uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s been lost in some way that she</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">she wants to stamp it out because</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t feel good to have that piece</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:15.679" style="s2">of herself anymore and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">desire to really want to repress it um</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.679" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">so i think that often when an individual</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">is forced into that place and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">happen as naturally and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">that integration process is broken for</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">it creates all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">psychological disharmony</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">hmm wow yeah yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">that&#39;s hitting me hard and i&#39;m sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">hitting other people</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">hard that are here um i i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">wanting to listen to your podcast</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.799" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">is it um more about metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">archetypes tell us about your golden</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">shadow podcast</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">with my friend and collaborator aaron</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">rodgerson</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">he&#39;s here hi aaron and um i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">each week we kind of are thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">inspires us what kind of deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">interesting topic that we&#39;ve stumbled</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">into and recently we did an episode on</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">masculinity and femininity and wanting</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">to really explore that from that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">deeply archetypal place but also look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">dynamics of of our culture and how that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.080" end="00:19:36.440" style="s2">plays into it and that inherently kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:39.440" style="s2">of taps us into some of those classic</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.440" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">archetypes um and so we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.440" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">circumambulating this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">masculine feminine and just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">draw in these different pieces to kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">make sense of it i think that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">on our podcast we&#39;re trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">sense make together the two of us and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">want to invite the audience into that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">nice i&#39;m definitely gonna tune in to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">episode i have it in my queue so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:10.240" style="s2">for doing this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">and um i wanted to kind of circle back</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.240" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">to what you mentioned earlier about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">sonic</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">yes and like so is the phonic connected</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">to the devouring mother are those do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">see those things as</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.280" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">metaphysically connected or are they</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">their own kind of categories</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">yeah i think there&#39;s a few different</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">ways to look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">it um to me like inherently sonic brings</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">up this very</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">underworld earth-based um kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">wildness</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">and that devouring mother um we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">see her sort of archetypally express</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">through some of those characters that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">one might consider</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">sort of sonic in nature but um</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">just because something sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:51.280" style="s2">underworld and dark and earthly and wild</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.159" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t give it an</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.280" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">inherently sort of um negative</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">connotation it&#39;s not really pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">in any way</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">but um i think an interesting character</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">to sort of talk about with the sonic is</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">like baba yaga who&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">popular in a lot of russian sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">slavic folklore and she&#39;s thought of as</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">wild witch woman who certainly is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.240" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">devouring like she&#39;ll literally eat like</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">children or the hero or something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">that but she&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">life-giving um it really depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">fairy tale itself but you see kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">nature uh of of the phonic here which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">she&#39;s she&#39;s really of the earth she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">dark</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">she&#39;s taps into this this energy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">this magic that kind of comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">from being an expression of of nature</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">itself and that can be both life-giving</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">and it can be destructive and so within</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">her we kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">i think the power of of the return to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">dark earthy immensely powerful feminine</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">and she can be devouring at times and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">what kind of is learned or gained</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">through that principle when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">happening but</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">she&#39;s also regenerative there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">folklore of vasilisa the beautiful that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">i think does a really good job of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">the heroine the young maiden ventures</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">into baba yaga&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">hut and does all these tasks kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:15.039" style="s2">learn from her and comes away with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">skull that kind of lights up and shoots</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.039" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">fire out of its eyes and kills this</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">wicked evil stepsisters and the mother</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">and it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">psychologically if we look at that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">think about vasalisa learning</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">anger and power and that dark</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">primal energy from baba yaga so she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">not destroyed by her she&#39;s not devoured</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">but she actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">gains this this you might say golden</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">shadow aspect by</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">getting in touch with that phonic baba</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">yaga inside of herself she learns that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">power she draws</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">it into her psyche and she&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">kind of take out these</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">these evil figures so the phonic is is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">powerful and it really</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">develops in all these different ways and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">it can at times feel really dark and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">shadowy and scary</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">um but it&#39;s also something that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">really tap us into a deep primal power</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:04.720" style="s2">why do you think that the sonic is</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">associated with the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.720" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">um i i definitely feel that there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">like a natural archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">pattern towards recognizing the sonic as</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">feminine because it&#39;s it&#39;s of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">and we see it in like</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">pachamama or gaia you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:24.159" style="s2">earth is often expressed as female and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">that&#39;s not always true you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">look at egyptian mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">the the kind of like matron goddesses</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">nut and she&#39;s of the sky</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">so it does change really depending on</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">the culture but for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">um mother nature is creation</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">and at her best and in its most</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">complexity and i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">principle is inherently feminine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">life-giving and life-producing so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">kind of naturally relate to the earth</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">when we personify her to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">um be the kind of penultimate like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">mothering goddess and to me the phonic</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">is is</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">the expression of that as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">do you think a callisto</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">i know a lot of people that talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">the kali yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">they&#39;ve stand in conservative circles</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">they get pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">death and civilization yeah did you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">connect the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">kali yuga to kalimantan</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">and how would you relate these to each</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">um for those who maybe aren&#39;t super</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">familiar like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">in more hindu and like yogic um</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">ideas the you guys are like these</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">seasons of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">of consciousness i wouldn&#39;t even call</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">them seasons of life they last for like</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">hundreds sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">thousands of years and currently we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">in kali yuga</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">which is all like about destruction and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">disintegration</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">and um it&#39;s often characterized by war</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">and a lot of strife</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">and kali of course is this powerful</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">goddess of destruction</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">but even destruction is in itself part</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">of the rebirth cycle</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">and i think as the the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">principle brings</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">disintegration she&#39;s also kind of sowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">the seeds for new life</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">and i think kali yuga if we think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">that symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">is kind of tearing down these old frames</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">but in</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:19.120" style="s2">to then purposefully like reintegrate or</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">regrow them or re-stabilize them and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.120" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">we have to go through these life and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">death cycles and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">the mothering sort of feminine principle</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2">is what gives us the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">usher in the new energy or the new life</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.880" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:33.279" style="s2">and it also kind of brings the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">destruction as well it&#39;s kind of to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.279" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">like amoral like mother nature is amoral</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">she&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">bring a storm and that might you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">end a drought and things are great but</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">it might also bring a storm and things</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">are just</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">destroyed you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">happen and there&#39;s no kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:49.279" style="s2">moral drive behind it it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">these greater flows that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.279" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">that we&#39;re a part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">feel that with</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">that was made</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">by karen williams i don&#39;t know if she</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">wants to follow up on that karen if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:46.880" style="s2">want to mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">and talk about your comment but i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">it actually pointed out something</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">pretty critical about the differences</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">men and women and their initiation into</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">adulthood um</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">karen you&#39;re welcome to to speak to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">or i can if you if you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.679" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">just like waiting a second to see if she</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.919" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">i&#39;m going to read the comment because i</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">think it&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">so she says in most mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">archetypal stories both sons</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:15.679" style="s2">and daughters belong to the mother until</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">the father takes the son</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.679" end="00:27:19.039" style="s2">or the son goes off on the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">adventure to find his father to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.039" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2">initiated into</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">manhood so that points to the difference</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">you know that the the man that the boy</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">leaves to be a man</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t really illuminate what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.200" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">what happens with the girls perhaps with</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">the women and how they they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">initiated</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">um alexander talks about um the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">nominology versus eventology so like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">nomad</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">kind of this like circular eternal thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:51.360" style="s2">this like um perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">kind of sameness that exists within the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">and the kind of difference the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">difference of the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">how do you see the kind of uh the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">stories or the archetypal dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">those aspects or differences between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:06.640" style="s2">male or the female</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">kind of initiation into adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">sure and i think actually karen and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">muted herself was there anything you</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">wanted to add karen before</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">i jumped in yeah i&#39;m here um yeah i was</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:18.159" style="s2">just you know because i it was reminding</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">me of joseph campbell</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.159" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">and you know the hero with a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">faces and how</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">you know just um you know between</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:29.520" style="s2">daughters and sons there&#39;s just so many</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">more complexities in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.520" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">you know boys reach manhood uh and of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:36.159" style="s2">course we don&#39;t really have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.000" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">initiations in in our you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.159" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">present-day culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">um but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">it you know and i guess even</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">psychologically from the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">you know we&#39;re born um that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">mother is the first love object uh for</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">both sons and daughters</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s in in that respect it&#39;s easier</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">the power of the matriarch and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">don&#39;t you think that the just the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">of women always being</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">associated with the kitchen and with</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:40.159" style="s2">cooking</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">and sustenance you know when they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:43.919" style="s2">uh</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.919" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">and and basically providing food for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">family that it was like you know they</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">hearth was the source of and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">was brewing</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">in that cauldron and um and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">just the trust involved and assuming</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">the mother knows what to cook and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:03.679" style="s2">nutritious and what&#39;s poisonous and what</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">you know what herbs to pick and what</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">what mushrooms or</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">herbs not not to pick um so that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:11.039" style="s2">mother yeah you know she not only gives</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">birth but she</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.039" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">sustains the life of of all the men and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">women in the family</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">hence the kitchen witch i&#39;m assuming</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">idea of the kitchen witch i actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">have one hanging in my own kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">you know kind of plays into that i idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">of the crone</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">yeah and and the matriarch as the not</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">only a giver of life but also a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">sustainer</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">yeah oh thank you yeah so many wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">points there</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">um just to that first idea around the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:44.799" style="s2">the matriarch uh providing not just life</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">but also the sustenance</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.799" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">is i think part of the task of what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">the feminine principle does and what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">the matriarch</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">um that that archetypal role is is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">just to be the the crucible of life</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">but to also sustain life and to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">to be both like an energy in a container</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:05.919" style="s2">for that to continue and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">um you know i pull a lot from like greek</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.919" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">mythology and we see like</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">the feminine goddesses being ones that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">continue to provide that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">that the structure of life and substance</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">you have you know demeter who</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">is like goddess of the harvest um</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:21.919" style="s2">or hestia goddess of the hearth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">like we see the feminine principle</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.919" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">in these ideas and that we tap into that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">when we want to continue to hold</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:32.320" style="s2">the home or to support the family um</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">you know and that doesn&#39;t only have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.320" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">mean you&#39;re doing that for a literal</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">naturally the feminine principle offers</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">us doing that you know in partnership</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">with others in our community</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">to our creative projects so um to really</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:49.039" style="s2">within the feminine principle i think is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">to learn how to juggle all these many</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">roles and expressions of it and i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">the initiation of of the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">is that you you hold uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.279" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">maybe like the love of the mother but</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">you learn also what it means to like</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">love a partner</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">and and love a child or to love your</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">friend or to love</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">the whatever sort of project you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">bringing into existence</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">it&#39;s um that kind of idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">of the mother i think is that she has</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">this unboundless</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">well of of of abundance and life-giving</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">source to really offer</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">um and kind of just initiating into that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">principle is not so much the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">idea which is the adventuring and kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">moving out into the unknown i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:37.840" style="s2">sometimes the the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:39.039" style="s2">sort of heroines journey is holding the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.840" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.039" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">of of of life in all its different forms</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">protecting it and nurturing it and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">passing it on</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">um and the masculine kind of goes out</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">um kind of shapes things a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">differently than say the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:58.399" style="s2">the heroine&#39;s journey so looking at</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">these principles really kind of taps you</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.399" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">into like the complexity of just</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">what it means to be human in all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:04.399" style="s2">different ways but really the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">youthful</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.399" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">initiation for the feminine is learning</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:13.760" style="s2">um kind of to to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">of that life source kind of being so</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.760" end="00:33:18.640" style="s2">internally informed and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">kind of expressing outwards towards um</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.640" end="00:33:22.559" style="s2">other individuals or other situations</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">while also needing to sustain your own</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">kind of if we even think about it as</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">mother earth it&#39;s like we can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">pull all of her resources she has to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:31.679" style="s2">sustain herself</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">so that she can also sustain everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">else that&#39;s on it and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:36.559" style="s2">is the kind of powerful challenge that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">she is left with</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.559" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">um that&#39;s what she&#39;s tasked with</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">um i&#39;d like that i want to there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">many good questions here</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">just one one last question</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">that i have i&#39;m already familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">the lima aleister crowley&#39;s philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">yeah a bit without crowley the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">the mother of abominations the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">are you familiar with the verse about</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">the babylon goddess</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">the babylonian goddesses yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">babylonian hill the new babylon amber</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">sophia you&#39;re referred to as the mother</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">of abominations what</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">is your take on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">um and we&#39;re looking at things from like</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">the crowley&#39;s perspective i think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:27.679" style="s2">always had this</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.560" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">really um controversial</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">way of exploring dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">that kind of shake people up and even</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">just you saying like the mother of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">abomination makes me think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">the principle of the feminine that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">not just the life giving but</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">like death giving as well that she comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">in and she&#39;s both creation but she</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">she takes away or she&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">chaos principle of chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">and that can make people feel really</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">uncomfortable they don&#39;t want to think</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:56.879" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">that dark destructive principle but you</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.879" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">think about you know a woman scorned or</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:01.839" style="s2">a mother who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">hell bent on destruction and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.839" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">nothing that will get in her way and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">i think like</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.599" style="s2">just what that&#39;s bringing up for me with</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">that idea of the abomination</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.599" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">is that chaotic principle that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">feminine holds</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">as well and that&#39;s kind of the contrast</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">to that more orderly kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">masculine principle and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">that we as</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">uh women or we who are tapping into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">feminine principle</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.079" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">need to understand because that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">a part of the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">and if we if we don&#39;t want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">our own potential for</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">destruction or chaos or being an</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:38.400" style="s2">abomination</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">um we are surely then uh to act it out</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.400" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">in ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">that are out of our control so i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">especially with crowley he was always</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">willing to push</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">things into a place that made people</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.599" style="s2">really uncomfortable that was really</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">necessary really necessary just for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.599" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">collective conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">definitely definitely both worlds here</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">um yeah we&#39;ve been going go ahead i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">taking some questions</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">um aaron&#39;s question so many good ones</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">so many good ones so yeah yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">gonna take the questions or even i i</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:15.040" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">this is you okay so yeah um aaron</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.040" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">would you like to mute yourself and ask</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">a question</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">um yes can the feminine archetype</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">rise in our society without the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">masculine archetype</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">descending and if uh if the matriarch</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">needs to rise does the patriarch need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">step down in some way or can they both</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">rise together in some way and what does</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">that look like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:44.960" style="s2">i think from my perspective um</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">balance is is always the mix of both</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the image of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:49.119" style="s2">the yin and yang of chaos and order kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:52.240" style="s2">of dancing</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.119" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">the eternal dance you might say so if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.240" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">feel that things are out of balance</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">because there is this focus or</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">too much energy or power given to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">patriarch</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">then the matriarch does need to rise um</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">maybe in the form of women leaders which</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">we&#39;re really seeing materialize at least</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:11.680" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:14.320" style="s2">in the west for the first time the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.680" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">potential for a woman to be in</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.320" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">uh in office is something that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">happened before or we&#39;re seeing women</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">leaders</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">in these powerful places women ceos</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">women creators it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">holding that potential of of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.200" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">um in their hands while also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">juggling everything else</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">but at the same time i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">that means it needs to be the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">destruction</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">of the archetypal patriarch um</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">because that that to me kind of brings</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">it&#39;s we need the dance of both</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">principles together and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">for those who maybe are too wrapped up</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">in um a kind of patriarchal um</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">space they might need to have more of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">that that nurturing</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">um emotionally informed relationally</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">connected matriarchal nature to to come</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">in and that might be like um a call to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">of say um our men or those who who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">more in the masculine principle</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">psychologically to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:16.800" style="s2">to invite the feminine into themselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">and work on it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">uh to bring sort of wholeness to their</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">own psychology in that way</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">i think it manifests as women kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">coming into</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">literal power um in in certain positions</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">but um i my hope would be that these</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">things can exist in harmony</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">because we really need both to to fully</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">express the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">the balance of of of what our potential</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:46.400" style="s2">beautiful i think that question leads</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:48.960" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.400" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">peter&#39;s really well so peter would you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.960" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:57.680" style="s2">ask your question thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:39:00.320" style="s2">um okay so young wrote</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:02.160" style="s2">more about a man&#39;s anima and less about</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.320" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">a woman&#39;s animus i believe</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">uh how does a woman animus show up uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">what are the pathological ways of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">it&#39;s showing up today</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">uh eg erzatz animus yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">so just a couple of notes here that this</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">concept behind anima anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.839" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">um comes from jungian theory the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">anima</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">is that within a man there&#39;s an internal</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">feminine figure feminine archetype um</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">especially if you put yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">context of uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:34.000" style="s2">kind of 19th century europe the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">the internal feminine or within a woman</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.000" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">that there&#39;s an internal masculine is</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">something maybe a little controversial</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">things that people really weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">at that time and so uh for young really</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">being this</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">sort of empirical phenomenological uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:48.880" style="s2">scientist</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2">you know he could see these different</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.880" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">dynamics manifesting in people that were</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.720" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">not just purely masculine or purely</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">no matter our gender or biology or</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">orientation and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">the anonymous is the masculine dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">within a woman</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">and and peter is right young tended to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">write a little bit more about the anima</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">so the feminine and the man</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">but for us when we consider what the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">animus</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">in is is that kind of um internal</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:18.240" style="s2">uh logos principle is often what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">associated with so it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">the ability to get more in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:24.640" style="s2">that thinking function which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">kind of in opposition to what my what</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.640" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">people might consider to be like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">stereotypical</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">typical feminine the feeling type</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">emotionally informed very</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">um centered on relational dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">keeping harmony</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.240" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">um the thinking function really taps us</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">into logic</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">and reason and rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">and expression and communication and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">doing so in a way that sometimes is</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">more informed by concepts or ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">rather than if those concepts</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">or ideas feel good to the person or if</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:56.560" style="s2">it makes them feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">so the the anonymous is our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.560" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">to tap into that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">inner masculine inside of ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">to develop</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:05.760" style="s2">say the thinking function to to dive</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">into the logical</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.760" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">more philosophical world you might say</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">pathologically i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">when a woman turns away from that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:16.960" style="s2">and is overly reliant maybe on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">dynamic is that um it kind of closes you</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">off to one</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">maybe the ability to communicate very</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:30.079" style="s2">clearly when that emotional damage</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">dynamic is kind of uh being stirred in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">way where you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">upset want to express type of you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">anger or frustration</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">um the woman can or you know one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">kind of tapped into that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">more pathological anonymous um can come</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:45.760" style="s2">off as just</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:47.680" style="s2">not seeming very rational and i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.760" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s such a stereotype right</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.680" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">like you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">a woman gets really angry and she</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:53.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound logical anymore</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">and you know we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.640" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">generalizations here but</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">the idea is if we can tap into that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">thinking function in that masculine</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:04.319" style="s2">in everyday life and integrated into us</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">we can rely upon our rationality in</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.319" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">times of hardship and we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">rely upon it and cultivate it in times</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:11.280" style="s2">of balance</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">and we just have this greater access to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.280" end="00:42:15.280" style="s2">our toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">it allows us to kind of step outside of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.280" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">our internal bubble</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">or that which we&#39;re kind of seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">just the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">the few constellations of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">relationships we have and we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">grander greater picture</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">we think maybe less about the nurturance</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">and more about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">you know orderly or right or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">truthful</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">and that can really help bring balance</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">to a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">you know someone might be driving</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">towards um</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">you know acting out in a way that feels</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">right but actually isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">logically correct and so that can</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">certainly be a pathological</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.839" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">manifestation of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">um and the idea of course with all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">this is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">to to have greater access to these</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:55.839" style="s2">pieces so that we just see more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">in our self better</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.839" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">interact with the world in a more</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">balanced way it&#39;s not really about</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">perfection but</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">but wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">wellness yeah yeah the integration</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">of the different sides of the self</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">everything from</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">the devouring mother to</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">the peter pan the child</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">the different types the the light</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:28.319" style="s2">and the taboo kind of all being part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">the same thing i i like how you</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">discussed how all of these archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">are possessed by all women</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">and this leads me into a question that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">saw from key</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">earlier in the chat um</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty poetic</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">question and i think there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">lot of answers here</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">and i want to ask you um</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">or maybe maybe he could ask he um maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">you could get into this morning do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">mute yourself and ask this question</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">oh hi</p>

<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">actually um based on a comment that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">made earlier so</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">i would like to invite manus to speak</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:41.359" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:41.359" style="s2">comment so that i can ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">yeah i was asking uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">well making a comment earlier just uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">when you guys were talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">you know the the initiation of a woman</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">and in</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">in you know the pain of giving birth and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">all of that kind of stuff that happens</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:11.599" style="s2">it just made me think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting how violent any</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.599" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">act of creation is</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">uh you know whether giving birth or</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">breaking through and making an idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">reality pushing through barriers like an</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">or even when a seed dies dies in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">ground and bursts to shoot</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">roots and leaves yeah key take it away</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">okay well</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">it i really liked the way in which that</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">question was</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">or rather the comment was asked and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">inspired</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">the question because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:49.119" style="s2">i just creation is a concept that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">understanding so</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">with that said i kind of went to what is</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">and then wanted to wonder about whether</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">the big bang was violent</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">that&#39;s such a massive question so many</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">metaphors and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">poeticisms was the big of being</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:21.520" style="s2">violent and i i would love to to hear</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">you talk about this in whatever way you</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.520" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">would like</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">uh sure yeah okay i&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">even the idea that in one moment</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">maybe there was darkness and stillness</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">and nothing and then suddenly from that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.359" end="00:46:42.400" style="s2">point of one might call destruction like</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">something is born something is created</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">something bursts into life and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">all this tension</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">and energy and power that forces that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">huge boom um and we&#39;re seeing like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">effects of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">literally now it&#39;s measurable in our</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">universe you know that there&#39;s all of</p>

<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">creation is really taking hold in our</p>

<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">certainly i think the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">experience of of if we&#39;re looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:16.560" style="s2">through birth literal birth in this case</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">um is</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">one of of discomfort and pain and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">in a moment of of true like life-giving</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">energy that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">kind of allows something to be birthed</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">into existence</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">and and that is destructive and that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">painful and that is sort of chaotic in</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">nature that is that feminine principle</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">um i think the power of the feminine is</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">to endure that</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">um i think i asked my mother once what</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">was it like</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">giving birth and she says well you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">when i do think about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">um it was really painful but every time</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:52.640" style="s2">i was going to give birth to another</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">child and there was four of us</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:56.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like the pain of that she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:58.720" style="s2">really recall it we have this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.559" end="00:48:01.200" style="s2">kind of not like compartmentalize it</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.720" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">but to to hold it and integrate it back</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.200" end="00:48:05.280" style="s2">into ourselves so that we can keep that</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">regenerative nature happening that she</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.280" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">can give</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">life again and again and again and not</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">be so traumatized by what happened the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">way the body was</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">scarred um and that&#39;s part of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.200" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">um enduring powerful feminine</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">and certainly what i think we see in all</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">forms of creation i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">uh manus was even saying that even in</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">entrepreneurial dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">there&#39;s so much struggle and pain that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">going into that and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">loss and sacrifice and um and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">just part of tapping</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">into that enduring quality that we need</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">to really have for uh for creation to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.960" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">um to happen in our life</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.839" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">great i love that poetic question</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">um hamdi actually there&#39;s there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">comments that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">dance around the same theme of like</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">integration of the masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">um so i wanted to tag in hamdi and see</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">if she wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">her question um did you want to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">yeah sure what did i write</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">yeah so basically i feel as if we live</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:26.400" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">masculine um dominating uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.400" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">energy based society so i was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">had an idea how do we integrate both</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">masculine</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">feminine energies within ourselves so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">that way like</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">the society can become more bomb just</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">starts with</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">us oh yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">ideas yeah i i love your point there</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">because i agree i think it does start</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">with us as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">it&#39;s about um self-discernment and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">personal responsibility and recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">our own</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">biases or way that we&#39;ve given up our</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">power or what we&#39;re not tapped into</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:06.640" style="s2">that allows us to be pulled into a</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">collective narrative you might say and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.640" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">so if we feel that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:11.200" style="s2">the world is sort of being ruled by an</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">over domineering</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.200" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">masculine energy in what ways inside of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:17.839" style="s2">ourselves might we</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">invite the feminine in and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.839" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">inherently connects us</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">to not just a part of ourself but also</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">to to other individuals i think the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">feminine is</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">she always has an eye towards um</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.319" style="s2">life inside of herself but also in</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">others so in the in the community in</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.319" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">relationships and it makes you more</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">compassionate and empathetic</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">and understanding um and that brings</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:47.599" style="s2">understand others um to maybe forgive</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">when you really don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.599" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">um and and so yes it really does start</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">with oneself</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">and and doing that inner contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">of where do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">out of balance within these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">archetypal dynamics how do you express</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">what&#39;s your relationship to it um you</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">know if you&#39;re feeling angry at</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">the more masculine energy can</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">you hold that tension of being upset</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.319" end="00:51:14.000" style="s2">with it but then also not</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">want to throw it out or suppress it also</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.000" end="00:51:17.440" style="s2">because that in turn just</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">pushes the masculine down into a dark</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.440" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">place um so it&#39;s this tricky dance</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">but it really does start with oneself um</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">and asking those questions</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">of what does my relationship to these</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">dynamics feel like and</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">you know where can i invite in more</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">rational</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:35.359" style="s2">uh logic where can i bring more</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">structure that&#39;s the masculine but also</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.359" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">where can i</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">be more open where can i invite in</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">creation where can i</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:43.440" style="s2">be more emotionally uh intuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:45.440" style="s2">compassionate and forgiving</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">and understanding um and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.440" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">kind of helps us</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">really interact with the world and with</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">ourself in a way that i think will have</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">a collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">impact and kind of bring us back to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.559" end="00:52:09.520" style="s2">masculine energy i prefer</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">personally to feminine energy</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:16.480" style="s2">and because a lot of the feminine energy</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:19.200" style="s2">is not the transcendent feminine energy</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">that ellis is speaking about a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.200" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">can be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">superficial mean mean girl</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:32.079" style="s2">yeah esque very very petty</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">um very bright side or no side um</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.079" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">self-care hashtag activism but like</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">when they meet someone who actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.359" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">you know like has that internal flame</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.839" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about they</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">accuse us of i think trans or</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">um you know what&#39;s interesting i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">always had people tell me that i strike</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.720" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">them as very masculine</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">and very feminine at the same time and i</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">i i i find that such a great compliment</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">um because i i try and just naturally</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">tap into</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">um you know a lot of strength and energy</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">and vision and being a leader and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">wanting to like make things happen</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">and and construct things it&#39;s like my</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">really strong masculine side</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:22.160" style="s2">and then i also want to be able to tap</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:24.000" style="s2">into the realm where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.160" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">vulnerable and emotional and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.000" end="00:53:29.440" style="s2">interested in creation</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:33.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s just wanting to be fluent in</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.440" end="00:53:35.839" style="s2">um just the dynamics of of one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.280" end="00:53:36.640" style="s2">human psychology i want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.839" end="00:53:38.880" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">roll in the masculine when it&#39;s time and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.880" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">ease back into the feminine when</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.880" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">it feels good to me and um and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:49.280" style="s2">and i find it just to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">allows me to have a lot of fluidity in</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">all different areas of my life and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:55.839" style="s2">um and i think makes it it makes me able</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">to relate just more to the world in</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.839" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">general because it&#39;s not just through</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:53:59.119" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">the lens of the masculine or through the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.119" end="00:54:02.640" style="s2">lens of the feminine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the inner play and that dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.640" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">kind of flowing through me</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">and um and if so someone says like you</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">know you&#39;re pretty masculine i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">hey thanks like</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">i&#39;m that&#39;s a huge compliment to me okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a really uh interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.079" end="00:54:21.040" style="s2">from cody do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:23.280" style="s2">meet yourself and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.040" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">um yeah yeah it&#39;s kind of i couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.280" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">really put it into words maybe you guys</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">can help with it</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:32.000" style="s2">um there seems to be like um</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:34.079" style="s2">like the feminine is kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.000" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">big metaphysical default</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.079" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">of like existence like we are in a womb</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">the earth is a woman like we are in one</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s feminine um we&#39;re gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">and go down to the ooze</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">and just be dissolved into and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:48.799" style="s2">catholic um we have to be born</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:50.880" style="s2">to have this conversation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.799" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">feminine and so the question is like is</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.880" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">death then</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">also is that inevitability of death does</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:54:57.040" style="s2">that also fit i&#39;m feminine</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking of like the sandman if</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.040" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve read that comic book in there um</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">death is a woman um she&#39;s awesome you</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:05.599" style="s2">know um and she&#39;s and she&#39;s kind and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">she&#39;s she does</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.599" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">she&#39;s kind at the moment of death um so</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">and then it the question is then the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:15.760" style="s2">the right does masculine rise out of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">that as a response to that of the fear</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.760" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">of that of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">that is powerful if if the default is</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">and she has birth and death that is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">most powerful energy that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">and of existence so then is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:31.839" style="s2">the rise of the masculine actually a</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">response to that and then maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.839" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s gone too far</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">but um so that&#39;s just yeah kind of a big</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">big question there and i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been probably throwing some polly</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:41.839" style="s2">in there and she talks a lot about that</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:43.599" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">oh this is such a good question i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.599" end="00:55:46.799" style="s2">there&#39;s so many different ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:48.720" style="s2">to look at it and you can certainly say</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.799" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.720" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">that death kind of as a as an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:55.599" style="s2">principle seems to</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">um be owned by the feminine but i i kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.599" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">see this as uh even maybe scaling out</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:05.599" style="s2">farther layers where the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:05.920" style="s2">depth kind of flows through masculine</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.599" end="00:56:07.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.920" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">feminine just kind of depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">lens that you&#39;re looking through and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:15.520" style="s2">the inherent dynamic of of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">of what is happening and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.520" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">are times when</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:20.480" style="s2">death is personified as feminine or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">literal</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.480" end="00:56:25.359" style="s2">female figure um very classically many</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">times as as like a masculine you know we</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.359" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">can think about like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">the underworld holders that of like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:32.319" style="s2">devil or</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">of hades but there needs to be like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">feminine principle within it so</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:37.839" style="s2">if we look at as an example um you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">the underworld being ruled by hades the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.839" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">masculine</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:41.760" style="s2">he also needs a queen and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">persephone and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.760" end="00:56:44.960" style="s2">she needs to be the balance that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:47.520" style="s2">brings more</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">of that uh that nurturance principle</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.520" end="00:56:51.119" style="s2">that maybe brings the rebirth back</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">um as we think about it at least in</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.119" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">cosmology of greek mythology</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">that when persephone rises back up from</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:00.799" style="s2">she brings spring you know winter has</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.280" end="00:57:02.079" style="s2">ended because she has come back from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">underworld and she has</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.079" end="00:57:06.480" style="s2">been reunited with her mother demeter so</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">the feminine principle</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.480" end="00:57:11.280" style="s2">is very alive in death but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">a masculine principle</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:14.559" style="s2">that&#39;s alive in it too and what&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">the structure and order of</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.559" end="00:57:18.319" style="s2">the literal levels of hell one could</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">look at that as a very masculine way of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.319" end="00:57:21.680" style="s2">looking at death</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">or the ways in which one must like atone</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.680" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">for their sin i think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">masculine as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:28.720" style="s2">so i i kind of just see them</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:31.520" style="s2">interplaying with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:32.079" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if i could make a a</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.520" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">direct</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.079" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">decision if it&#39;s one or the other but i</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:41.839" style="s2">think kind of the ambiguity of it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:41.839" style="s2">something that i i want to hold</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:53.119" style="s2">beautiful so we&#39;ve come to our hour</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.920" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.040" end="00:58:52.319" style="s2">tensions between young men and young</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.319" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">um as they&#39;re attempting to to date</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">or to like share workspace share</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">digital space um to collaborate together</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">and the um the situation</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">and you know i have my own view on it</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">right uh but it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.520" end="00:59:17.280" style="s2">fraught um</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:19.119" style="s2">wait what is your diagnosis what do you</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.280" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">see going on and how does that relate to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.119" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">maybe some of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.079" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">bigger archetypes sure i think um</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">if i&#39;m looking at this from that</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:30.559" style="s2">symbolic sort of archetypal view</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">i think in many ways we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.559" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">disconnected from that level</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">of our psychology and that expression of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">that in</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:40.799" style="s2">in culture and society where um</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:42.240" style="s2">the sort of archetypes their</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:44.079" style="s2">psychological principles you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.240" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of like analogous to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.079" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">biological instincts and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:49.520" style="s2">parts of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.359" end="00:59:51.839" style="s2">of of of the psychic landscape that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.520" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">inform us that image the world that</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.839" end="00:59:56.240" style="s2">sense make the world and i think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="00:59:56.880" style="s2">inherent to us even if we&#39;re not aware</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.240" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.880" end="01:00:00.079" style="s2">but we also need to kind of be in touch</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.079" end="01:00:04.000" style="s2">and cultivate them and nurture them and</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">come into relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.000" end="01:00:08.880" style="s2">with it and in what ways are we doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:11.200" style="s2">that in our daily life what rituals do</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.880" end="01:00:12.160" style="s2">we have what initiations what stories do</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.200" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">we tell</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.160" end="01:00:15.599" style="s2">um each other we&#39;re so sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:18.640" style="s2">disconnected</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.599" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">from that dynamic i think in modern life</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.640" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">that it leads to uh confusion in all of</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:25.599" style="s2">these different ways where like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:27.359" style="s2">your role and what&#39;s my role and how do</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.599" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">i connect to you and what does this</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.359" end="01:00:29.760" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:31.280" style="s2">mean to us and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.760" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">instinctual that&#39;s driving people and</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.280" end="01:00:35.119" style="s2">then maybe even a</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">social dynamic that&#39;s clashing against</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.119" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">it and i think just in all of those</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">manifestations</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:43.680" style="s2">uh we&#39;re confused and and i think a</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">return to that more archetypal mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.680" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">or cultivating that in our life might be</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:49.760" style="s2">really helpful</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:51.599" style="s2">in in getting to know oneself better but</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.760" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">also being able to really orient to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.599" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">and each</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.599" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">do you other bringing back the bringing</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.440" end="01:01:00.079" style="s2">and integrating with the mythic or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:02.240" style="s2">archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.079" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">knowing is actually part of what could</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:05.920" style="s2">help people</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">navigate the complexity of of of</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.920" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">interacting</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">yeah definitely yes i think um</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">ian mcgill chris kind of talks about</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">this as well and</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:16.640" style="s2">is something that i think he sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">echoes this need to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.640" end="01:01:19.839" style="s2">return to the mythic mind um to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:21.680" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">the right brain right right brain</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:26.559" style="s2">dynamics versus the left brain</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">and and and how do we return to that</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">individually but also collectively which</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">you know doesn&#39;t mean that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.640" end="01:01:35.920" style="s2">do um you know what we always did before</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">and how that was expressed but it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.920" end="01:01:40.240" style="s2">like how how can these things evolve and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">how can we support their evolutions</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.240" end="01:01:44.319" style="s2">religious expressions mythological</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:46.079" style="s2">expressions spiritual expressions</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.319" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">cultural expressions um</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.079" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">it&#39;s so interwoven into uh just how we</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">understand our life and i think when</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s empty it really does</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">impact us in all these ways</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.280" end="01:02:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting too because maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:06.559" style="s2">there&#39;s even a connection between</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.720" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">the hemispheres of the brain having</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.559" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">masculine or feminine characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:12.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">maybe the you know the what was it the</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.000" end="01:02:16.160" style="s2">we need more right brain</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:16.799" style="s2">right yeah yeah that&#39;s like kind of more</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.160" end="01:02:19.760" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.799" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">right like intuitive yeah yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.760" end="01:02:21.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely a way that those</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.599" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">things can be mapped out and looked at</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">as the kind of logical um</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:31.920" style="s2">left brain which is about reason and um</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">kind of ordering and structure and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.920" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">maybe more of that right brain which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:35.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">creation and more of like this wildness</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.839" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">to it um so i think you can definitely</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">map out the masculine and feminine onto</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">the the hemispheres of the brain as well</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">so what do you think about</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:58.079" style="s2">the ultra ultra masculine women now</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:02:58.880" style="s2">the social activists and the ultra ultra</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.079" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.880" end="01:03:03.119" style="s2">men now you know the voice as people</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:05.680" style="s2">like to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.119" end="01:03:06.880" style="s2">do you think this is a response to</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.680" end="01:03:08.960" style="s2">what&#39;s going on right now</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.880" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">what what what do you think about this</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.960" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">extreme gender conformity from the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.000" end="01:03:18.880" style="s2">hmm interesting um yes i think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these manifestations of</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.880" end="01:03:23.839" style="s2">it where there might be</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.720" end="01:03:26.000" style="s2">um a kind of over compensation happening</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.839" end="01:03:28.480" style="s2">maybe someone feels like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.000" end="01:03:30.640" style="s2">a need to tap into that like contra</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.480" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">sexual dynamic so the masculine wanting</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.640" end="01:03:34.160" style="s2">to tap into the feminine</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:35.520" style="s2">and because it&#39;s out of balance it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.160" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">being done in this way</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.520" end="01:03:40.880" style="s2">that destabilizes things um and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:43.520" style="s2">you might then have these uh sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.880" end="01:03:46.480" style="s2">cultural and social expressions of it</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.520" end="01:03:47.039" style="s2">that still don&#39;t seem like quite right</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.480" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.039" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s it&#39;s every individual&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:53.520" style="s2">journey to really find</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:56.319" style="s2">their their way towards balance and um</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.520" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">i&#39;m very much of the mindset that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.319" end="01:03:59.520" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:00.400" style="s2">a very deep part of you that really kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.520" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.400" end="01:04:03.520" style="s2">is trying to order and bring you towards</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:06.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.520" end="01:04:07.920" style="s2">kind of like what your equilibrium is</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.160" end="01:04:08.720" style="s2">and so for those individuals who maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.920" end="01:04:10.799" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.720" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">caught in a place where those those</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.799" end="01:04:13.920" style="s2">aspects are manifesting and and they are</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">imbalanced</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:17.760" style="s2">there&#39;s probably signs somewhere in your</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">dreams maybe i&#39;m gonna have to plug</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.760" end="01:04:20.799" style="s2">dreams because that&#39;s the big thing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.039" end="01:04:23.839" style="s2">into unconscious expression</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.799" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">what&#39;s happening there um subtle things</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.839" end="01:04:27.359" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.880" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">uh not as easy to pay attention to not</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.359" end="01:04:30.720" style="s2">as um</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">obviously in the sphere of conscious</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.720" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">um because i think if if we&#39;re on one</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:37.920" style="s2">side or the other it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">imbalance and maybe part of that is like</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.920" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">we just need that collectively</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:43.680" style="s2">for things to kind of even out but</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:44.559" style="s2">hopefully it&#39;s not bringing that</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.680" end="01:04:47.200" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.559" end="01:04:47.680" style="s2">hardship or pain or or something if if</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.200" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.680" end="01:04:52.079" style="s2">kind of on the other sort of contra</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:54.559" style="s2">sexual end of things but</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.079" end="01:04:56.000" style="s2">um you know however someone decides to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.559" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">express themselves is</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.000" end="01:05:01.520" style="s2">ultimately up to them to decide but um</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:02.880" style="s2">having that self-discernment to really</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.520" end="01:05:04.880" style="s2">ensure that it&#39;s being done in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:08.799" style="s2">balanced way is certainly a tool that</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.880" end="01:05:10.370" style="s2">one really needs to hone</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:12.799" style="s2">that&#39;s solid advice</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.370" end="01:05:15.280" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.799" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">um we have a question from rob oh would</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.280" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">you like to</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">and yourself yeah um my question was</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">women are often celebrated for accessing</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:25.280" style="s2">the masculine while men</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">are often denigrated for embodying the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.280" end="01:05:28.880" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.319" end="01:05:30.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious why you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">happening whether you agree that it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.319" end="01:05:33.520" style="s2">happening is it</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:35.359" style="s2">and what do you make of it in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.520" end="01:05:37.520" style="s2">archetypal balance yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:39.520" style="s2">um i think yeah definitely that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.520" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">happening and i think very</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.520" end="01:05:43.280" style="s2">classically this is a sign of like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">imbalance of like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.280" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">the masculine dynamic as as a society</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:51.359" style="s2">it feels threatening for in this case a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:54.480" style="s2">man to access</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.359" end="01:05:56.240" style="s2">his feminine um you can think about a</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.480" end="01:05:57.680" style="s2">highly generalized situation though but</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.240" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">you have a group of men</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:01.839" style="s2">and one of those individuals might have</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">more of a feminine expression</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.839" end="01:06:04.960" style="s2">what will those group of friends do make</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:07.520" style="s2">fun of him</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.960" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">you know you know put him down because</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.520" end="01:06:10.079" style="s2">he&#39;s being more</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">emotional or something like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.079" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:16.160" style="s2">a perpetuation of of of</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">individuals not feeling like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.160" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">allowed to tap into the complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:23.200" style="s2">expression inside of themselves and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:26.559" style="s2">then we perpetuate a dynamic that</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.200" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">brings like collective imbalance so</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.559" end="01:06:30.400" style="s2">i think it&#39;s certainly um an indication</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.920" end="01:06:33.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.400" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">there&#39;s an imbalance and a lot of shadow</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.440" end="01:06:37.920" style="s2">in the masculine and it&#39;s so front and</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:40.799" style="s2">center because we have been in more of</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.920" end="01:06:42.319" style="s2">this like masculine age of thought</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.799" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">and it really is sort of going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.319" end="01:06:47.280" style="s2">require that we give</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:49.440" style="s2">space for in this case men to dive into</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.280" end="01:06:49.839" style="s2">their feminine to express it and us to</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.440" end="01:06:51.839" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.839" end="01:06:52.880" style="s2">kind of push back and say uh that</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.839" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t belong</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.880" end="01:06:57.039" style="s2">um because that sort of flip side of not</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:06:58.960" style="s2">being in touch with</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.039" end="01:07:01.440" style="s2">the feminine expression is that the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.960" end="01:07:03.359" style="s2">emotional world is sort of untapped or</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.440" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">when it comes out it comes out in a way</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.359" end="01:07:09.200" style="s2">that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:11.680" style="s2">dangerous or violent or pathological so</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.200" end="01:07:13.359" style="s2">what i would hope for is the ability for</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.680" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">individuals to create that environment</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.359" end="01:07:16.319" style="s2">where they feel</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">safe and more vulnerable enough to</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.319" end="01:07:20.720" style="s2">express it because we really do need</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:24.319" style="s2">both of these dynamics both within</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.720" end="01:07:24.319" style="s2">ourselves and also collectively</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.559" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">sure and there&#39;s even like i mean even</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.160" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">the pejoratives of masculinity are like</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:32.640" style="s2">you&#39;re being a</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:34.359" style="s2">yeah yeah like even the language yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.640" end="01:07:36.319" style="s2">yeah i think sometimes about like the</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.359" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">differentiation you know trying to keep</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.319" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2">this maybe goes back to cody&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">of like if</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">if the ground or the medium is feminine</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.240" end="01:07:45.520" style="s2">and this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">hole to differentiate from the feminine</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.520" end="01:07:48.960" style="s2">as the man</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:50.480" style="s2">than to you know put down a man for his</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.960" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">association with the feminine</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.480" end="01:07:54.240" style="s2">point out that he has not left you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">the womb</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.240" end="01:07:58.160" style="s2">or something and uh to kind of ostracize</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:01.200" style="s2">him for not</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.160" end="01:08:04.720" style="s2">being being different yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.200" end="01:08:05.359" style="s2">um there&#39;s there&#39;s certainly i think a</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.720" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.359" end="01:08:10.559" style="s2">that&#39;s being cultivated right now where</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:11.680" style="s2">even those who want to dive into that</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.559" end="01:08:15.359" style="s2">are feeling like</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.680" end="01:08:18.159" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s unsafe or it&#39;s unwelcome and</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.359" end="01:08:19.839" style="s2">there&#39;s ways in which we are</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.159" end="01:08:22.239" style="s2">perpetuating that by just</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.839" end="01:08:23.759" style="s2">the language that we use and someone</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.239" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">might think well i&#39;m just joking like</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.759" end="01:08:26.080" style="s2">i&#39;m just giving him a hard time you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.080" end="01:08:30.080" style="s2">that has an effect it has a</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:33.040" style="s2">psychological effect and these things</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.080" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">carry out into the world um and they</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.040" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">pass on</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:37.520" style="s2">you know from person to person or</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:40.319" style="s2">generation to generation and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.520" end="01:08:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s about recognizing these habits and</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">willing to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.600" end="01:08:47.759" style="s2">do the the unusual thing to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.640" end="01:08:50.719" style="s2">press against um the norms and um</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.759" end="01:08:52.400" style="s2">to allow kind of that other element in</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.719" end="01:08:54.000" style="s2">so that we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.400" end="01:08:57.359" style="s2">at least feel like we&#39;re all able to</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.000" end="01:08:57.359" style="s2">express ourselves more fully</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.600" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">we have a beautiful final question okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">from brian brian would you like to meet</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.839" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">yourself</p>

<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">how do you set on fire the imagination</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.199" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">or how or</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">or or a template for future goddesses</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">how can i nourish or introduce things to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:25.839" style="s2">my 12 year old</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:27.830" style="s2">daughter because she&#39;s active in the</p>

<p begin="01:09:27.830" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.839" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a really great question okay um</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">yes this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.000" end="01:09:37.279" style="s2">um okay there&#39;s a few different ways</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:40.640" style="s2">that i&#39;m looking at this</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.279" end="01:09:43.199" style="s2">and one is how does one create a space</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.640" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">in the home where uh the natural</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.199" end="01:09:47.040" style="s2">inclinations of the feminine can be</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">expressed like what is she interested in</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.040" end="01:09:50.560" style="s2">what does she want</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:52.159" style="s2">to to cultivate and create in her own</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.560" end="01:09:53.920" style="s2">life and how do we give</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.159" end="01:09:55.520" style="s2">space to that how do we allow that to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.920" end="01:09:58.719" style="s2">expressed what&#39;s drawing her</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.520" end="01:10:01.280" style="s2">interests how are you</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.719" end="01:10:03.120" style="s2">surrounding her with things that feel</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.280" end="01:10:05.199" style="s2">that they&#39;re that they&#39;re giving energy</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.120" end="01:10:06.000" style="s2">and life so that she can explore those</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.199" end="01:10:08.640" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">um i think partly it&#39;s also really</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.640" end="01:10:12.560" style="s2">helpful to think about</p>
