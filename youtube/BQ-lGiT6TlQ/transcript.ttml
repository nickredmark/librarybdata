<p begin="00:00:00.620" end="00:00:05.520" style="s2">okay one of my ideas is again I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.020" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">name things so I kind of name them based</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">on what they already are but is like</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.620" end="00:00:12.420" style="s2">Facebook for neighborhoods just go</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:16.260" style="s2">social media for neighborhoods something</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.420" end="00:00:19.109" style="s2">right either but I had a bad experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.260" end="00:00:21.060" style="s2">with one of my neighbors still kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">ongoing whenever I parked behind him he</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.060" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">does crap to my car I think it&#39;s him I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">think I know who it is and so far</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:31.019" style="s2">because I kind of have a crappy car I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">just kind of let it go and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.019" end="00:00:35.219" style="s2">better it&#39;s done to my card and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">else on the block but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.219" end="00:00:39.270" style="s2">like part of me wants to take vengeance</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">like eat his car and at the time I had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.270" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">child in diapers I&#39;m like Willa you peed</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">on my car do you really like I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">access to much worse things much more</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">readily than you do but I did not just</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:49.829" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:51.750" style="s2">but part of what came out of that was I</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.829" end="00:00:53.250" style="s2">was like God like if he could</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.750" end="00:00:57.000" style="s2">communicate with me better and I could</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.250" end="00:00:58.590" style="s2">communicate with him better I think we</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.000" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">would get a lot more like I think that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.590" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">he&#39;d be like one he wouldn&#39;t do those</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">things to my car because he&#39;d realized</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">I&#39;m like a single mom with a disability</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">who needs my car to be parked there or</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">at least can have my car parked there</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">like I live across the street and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">I&#39;d understand his side better maybe he</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.729" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">has a really good reason for not wanting</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:21.930" style="s2">me to part behind his car door nobody</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">parks and but more than that like to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.930" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">able to say hey I&#39;m going on vacation</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">recreating those on neighborhoods that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">we had generations ago or a generation</p>

<p begin="00:01:58.469" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">to be in a way that&#39;s easily because</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.149" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">there can be one person who kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">creates that for the neighborhood but</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">I&#39;m not that personality and I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">like it to be easier with my current</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">personality because I don&#39;t want to</p>
