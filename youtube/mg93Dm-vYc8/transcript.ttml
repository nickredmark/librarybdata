<p begin="00:00:05.609" end="00:00:09.690" style="s2">the first place we released episode 19</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.830" end="00:00:11.790" style="s2">on the biomedical implications of</p>

<p begin="00:00:16.470" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">significant enough episode and we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:22.289" style="s2">so much feedback around it</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:23.789" style="s2">before we continue any kind of line of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.289" end="00:00:25.470" style="s2">thinking surrounding that episode we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.789" end="00:00:27.750" style="s2">wait for my brother and his wife Heather</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">so thanks for all the feedback it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.929" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">very interesting to process the second</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:39.090" style="s2">episode with Roger Penrose now I know</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">what I&#39;m supposed to do I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.090" end="00:00:42.690" style="s2">talk about quantum consciousness and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">emperor&#39;s new mind maybe ask Roger about</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.690" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">the many-worlds interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.129" end="00:00:48.030" style="s2">quantum mechanics or the weirdness of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">quantum entanglement I&#39;m actually not</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.030" end="00:00:51.350" style="s2">that interested I also don&#39;t want to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">back to his earliest work on</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.350" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">singularities and general relativity</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:58.440" style="s2">with Stephen Hawking what I instead want</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">to do is to remind you what Roger is in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:03.420" style="s2">fact famous for he&#39;s one of the greatest</p>

<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">theoretical physics in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">line of thought I also think he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">great example of what the UK does well</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">he has a very idiosyncratic approach to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">trying to solve the deepest problems in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:22.680" style="s2">theoretical physics called twister</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.680" end="00:01:25.290" style="s2">always follow it so if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.820" end="00:01:27.630" style="s2">following everything in today&#39;s episode</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.290" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">instead of deciding that the episode has</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.630" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">somehow failed you try to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:33.390" style="s2">people who are working in mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:34.740" style="s2">and theoretical physics spend most of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:36.509" style="s2">their time listening to colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.740" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">completely lost as to what their</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.509" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">colleagues are saying so if you start to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">feel that you are being left behind by</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">some line of thinking what we do is in</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:47.399" style="s2">general wait to see if another line of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:49.140" style="s2">thinking opens up that we can try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.399" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">catch you&#39;re not going to get all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.140" end="00:01:52.110" style="s2">waves and in fact the same thing is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">happening to me while I&#39;m interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">Roger he&#39;s not understanding everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">I&#39;m saying I&#39;m not understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">everything he&#39;s saying and in fact this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">is normal so what I would like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">to instead present you guys with an idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">of what science actually sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">when people are talking from two</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">slightly different perspectives we spend</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">an awful lot of time simply trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.540" style="s2">understand each other and if that feels</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:15.430" style="s2">a little bit uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.540" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">well then in fact you&#39;re getting a true</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.430" end="00:02:18.519" style="s2">scientific experience which is often</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:20.260" style="s2">very different than what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.519" end="00:02:22.150" style="s2">when everything is pre-chewed in</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.260" end="00:02:30.730" style="s2">spoon-fed hope you enjoy it without</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.150" end="00:02:32.290" style="s2">further ado Sir Roger Penrose hello you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:34.540" style="s2">found the portal I&#39;m your host Eric</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.290" end="00:02:36.549" style="s2">Weinstein and I&#39;m here today with none</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.549" end="00:02:44.799" style="s2">welcome good to have you I&#39;m extremely</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.470" end="00:02:46.510" style="s2">excited about having you here there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.799" end="00:02:48.069" style="s2">lots of questions that you typically get</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.510" end="00:02:52.510" style="s2">asked these days many of them about</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.069" end="00:02:54.549" style="s2">consciousness some of them about art</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.510" end="00:02:57.129" style="s2">objects that come out of your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.549" end="00:03:00.010" style="s2">but I know you in a professional</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.129" end="00:03:01.840" style="s2">capacity as one of the important most</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.010" end="00:03:04.810" style="s2">important people at the Nexus of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.840" end="00:03:06.220" style="s2">geometry and physics in our time of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.810" end="00:03:08.019" style="s2">course you can&#39;t say that you can make</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.220" end="00:03:09.879" style="s2">all sorts of faces but I can assure you</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.019" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">that it&#39;s true you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.879" end="00:03:14.650" style="s2">Leonard Cohen quote where from a song</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:16.540" style="s2">called the future where he says you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.650" end="00:03:18.069" style="s2">don&#39;t know me from the wind you never</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.540" end="00:03:20.199" style="s2">will you never did but I&#39;m the little</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.069" end="00:03:22.660" style="s2">Jew that wrote the Bible and I have what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.199" end="00:03:24.940" style="s2">I consider to be the Bible right here</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.660" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">which is a book you wrote called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.940" end="00:03:30.579" style="s2">road to reality which there&#39;s no getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:32.530" style="s2">away from maybe in my opinion the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.579" end="00:03:33.879" style="s2">important modern book of our time</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.530" end="00:03:36.129" style="s2">because what it tries to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.879" end="00:03:39.940" style="s2">summarize what we know about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.129" end="00:03:41.379" style="s2">of all of this at the deepest level and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.940" end="00:03:43.269" style="s2">I think what I want to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.379" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">introduce you to our audience which has</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.269" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">been habituated over perhaps 16 or so</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:53.139" style="s2">interviews not to expect to understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:54.910" style="s2">everything they want to work they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.139" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">to hear conversations unlike any they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.910" end="00:03:59.620" style="s2">heard and so we&#39;ll do some combination</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:01.510" style="s2">of explaining things but some</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.620" end="00:04:04.329" style="s2">combination of allowing them to look up</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.510" end="00:04:06.129" style="s2">things in their own free time if your</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.329" end="00:04:07.739" style="s2">game should we talk about the road to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.129" end="00:04:09.359" style="s2">reality and you can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.739" end="00:04:15.099" style="s2">that&#39;d be great</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.359" end="00:04:17.380" style="s2">so we&#39;re where are we in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.099" end="00:04:20.260" style="s2">coming to understand what this place is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.380" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">in which we find ourselves what we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.260" end="00:04:26.200" style="s2">made out of and what we know about our</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">own context it&#39;s a very tough question</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.200" end="00:04:30.770" style="s2">that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:32.660" style="s2">when I wrote that book it was more or</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.770" end="00:04:36.470" style="s2">less the state of the world at the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.660" end="00:04:40.190" style="s2">I now feel I should rewrite part of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.470" end="00:04:41.690" style="s2">because things have changed in one</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.190" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">important way in particular as far as</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.690" end="00:04:46.580" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned whether other people agree</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:48.110" style="s2">with me is another question but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.580" end="00:04:50.510" style="s2">think I&#39;m going to rewrite it because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.110" end="00:04:52.540" style="s2">was such an effort and I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.510" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">would be likely to live long enough to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.540" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">do a good job out of it it has that much</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:05:00.169" style="s2">really changed since you wrote the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:02.150" style="s2">a lot of level a lot has not changed the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.169" end="00:05:04.250" style="s2">thing that has changed in my view he</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.150" end="00:05:06.710" style="s2">sees whether people agree with me on</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.250" end="00:05:08.870" style="s2">this is another question is to do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.710" end="00:05:12.110" style="s2">cosmology right you see I have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.870" end="00:05:14.720" style="s2">proposal which I didn&#39;t have I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.110" end="00:05:17.090" style="s2">new since the book it&#39;s not all that new</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s about 15 years old but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.090" end="00:05:21.500" style="s2">new since I wrote that book in an art</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:23.510" style="s2">time skills that&#39;s quite new now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.500" end="00:05:26.690" style="s2">pretty new let&#39;s just just to get some</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.510" end="00:05:31.430" style="s2">context you were born in the early 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.690" end="00:05:35.150" style="s2">yeah um yes okay you you got a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.430" end="00:05:37.010" style="s2">live through if not the original general</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.150" end="00:05:41.090" style="s2">relativistic and quantum revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.010" end="00:05:43.310" style="s2">their consequences in particular you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.090" end="00:05:46.729" style="s2">were able to take classes from people</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.310" end="00:05:49.370" style="s2">like Paul Dirac who scarcely seems like</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.729" end="00:05:54.789" style="s2">a human being sometimes more like a god</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.370" end="00:05:57.800" style="s2">oh yeah that was an experience yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.789" end="00:06:00.139" style="s2">whether I when I was at Cambridge as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.800" end="00:06:02.660" style="s2">graduate student I did my undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.139" end="00:06:05.690" style="s2">work at London University University</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.660" end="00:06:08.360" style="s2">College and then I went to Cambridge as</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.690" end="00:06:10.940" style="s2">a graduate student and I went to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.360" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">algebraic geometry so I wasn&#39;t trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.940" end="00:06:20.169" style="s2">do physics at all and I I&#39;d encountered</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:22.820" style="s2">a friend of my brothers dennis sciama</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.169" end="00:06:25.310" style="s2">when i think i was at university college</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.820" end="00:06:29.270" style="s2">isn&#39;t undergraduate and he given a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.310" end="00:06:31.250" style="s2">series of talks on cosmology but it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.270" end="00:06:34.099" style="s2">started with the the earth and then he</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.250" end="00:06:36.680" style="s2">sort of worked his way out and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.099" end="00:06:40.200" style="s2">talked about what was then referred to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.680" end="00:06:42.900" style="s2">as the steady state theory where the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.200" end="00:06:45.930" style="s2">galaxies the universe expands and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.900" end="00:06:48.660" style="s2">expands and expands but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.930" end="00:06:52.290" style="s2">change because all the time there is new</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.660" end="00:06:54.150" style="s2">matter created hydrogen and the universe</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.290" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">expands and then you get new material</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.150" end="00:07:02.100" style="s2">and it keeps replenishing what&#39;s gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:04.830" style="s2">lost and I thought it was quite an</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.100" end="00:07:06.780" style="s2">intriguing I mean I Dennis was a great</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.830" end="00:07:11.220" style="s2">fan of this model and so I was really</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.780" end="00:07:14.790" style="s2">taken by it so that where the story was</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.220" end="00:07:17.400" style="s2">that I was in Cambridge visiting my</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.790" end="00:07:20.100" style="s2">brother my older brother Oliver who did</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.400" end="00:07:22.770" style="s2">statistical mechanics and he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.100" end="00:07:25.560" style="s2">actually much more precocious than I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.770" end="00:07:29.430" style="s2">he was two years ahead and he was I</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.560" end="00:07:31.530" style="s2">think finishing his research there but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.430" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">had been listening to these talks by</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.530" end="00:07:36.600" style="s2">Fred Hoyle and he was talking I think in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:39.300" style="s2">his last talk about how in the steady</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.600" end="00:07:41.100" style="s2">state model the galaxies expands it way</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:44.460" style="s2">expands away and then when they reached</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.100" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">the speed of light they disappear and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.460" end="00:07:49.050" style="s2">thought that can&#39;t be quite right and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:51.780" style="s2">started drawing pictures with like cones</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.050" end="00:07:53.310" style="s2">and things like this and I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.780" end="00:07:55.230" style="s2">they would simple they would fade</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.310" end="00:07:58.200" style="s2">gradually fade but they wouldn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.230" end="00:07:59.880" style="s2">disappear and when I visited Cambridge</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.200" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">visiting my brother and we were at this</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.880" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2">the kingswood restaurant in Cambridge</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:07.020" style="s2">and I said to my brother said look I</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:09.450" style="s2">don&#39;t understand what Fred was saying he</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.020" end="00:08:10.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sort of make sense to me and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.450" end="00:08:12.690" style="s2">said but I don&#39;t know about cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.650" end="00:08:14.430" style="s2">but sitting over there on the table is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.690" end="00:08:16.770" style="s2">friend of mine he knows all the answers</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.430" end="00:08:19.980" style="s2">to these things and that was Dennis</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.770" end="00:08:22.350" style="s2">Sharma and so I explained this problem I</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.980" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">had to Dennis and he was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.350" end="00:08:25.650" style="s2">impressed because he didn&#39;t he said he</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:29.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t know the answer but he would ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.650" end="00:08:32.360" style="s2">Fred Fred Hoyle and but the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.610" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">was that when I did come up to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.360" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">graduate work in djenne in algebraic</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:43.590" style="s2">geometry Dennis decided to take me under</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.500" end="00:08:46.470" style="s2">his wing and try to persuade me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.590" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">change my subject and do we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.470" end="00:08:52.290" style="s2">simultaneously under the great geometers</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">Hodge as well as Dennis Trump</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.290" end="00:08:57.000" style="s2">well Hodge was my supervisor</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:58.680" style="s2">see Dennis was just a friend I said Haji</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.000" end="00:09:01.290" style="s2">was my supervisor originally until he</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.680" end="00:09:03.769" style="s2">threw me out and and Todd became my</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.290" end="00:09:08.850" style="s2">supervisor that&#39;s another little story</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.769" end="00:09:12.449" style="s2">but but Dennis just wanted to get me</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.850" end="00:09:12.689" style="s2">interested do work in cosmology this was</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.449" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.689" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">I never he wanted me to change my</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:20.339" style="s2">subject I learned an awful lot from</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">Dennis about physics because Dennis sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.339" end="00:09:26.879" style="s2">of knew everything and everybody and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:28.230" style="s2">had a real knack of getting if he</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.879" end="00:09:31.410" style="s2">thought two people should meet each</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.230" end="00:09:33.660" style="s2">other he got made sure they did meet</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.410" end="00:09:40.019" style="s2">each other in one case it was Stephen</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.660" end="00:09:41.550" style="s2">Hawking but Dennis was actually a hey</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.019" end="00:09:43.829" style="s2">when you mentioned Iraq Dennis was</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.550" end="00:09:46.259" style="s2">actually the last graduate with at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.829" end="00:09:49.560" style="s2">time he was the only graduate student of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.259" end="00:09:53.220" style="s2">Dirac&#39;s is that right yes Dennis was mr.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.560" end="00:09:55.800" style="s2">art was famously sort of difficult I</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.220" end="00:09:57.569" style="s2">think that you know in recent years this</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.800" end="00:09:59.189" style="s2">book came out of grammar mail of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.569" end="00:10:04.410" style="s2">strangest man that puts directs</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.189" end="00:10:06.569" style="s2">bizarreness he was difficult to get to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.410" end="00:10:10.259" style="s2">know but there&#39;s a bit of an irony here</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.569" end="00:10:13.050" style="s2">I mean certainly he was hard for</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.259" end="00:10:15.930" style="s2">physicists and so on to get to know him</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.050" end="00:10:17.399" style="s2">now there were two people and actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.930" end="00:10:18.300" style="s2">maybe I could just say one thing to our</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.399" end="00:10:21.750" style="s2">listeners yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.300" end="00:10:24.600" style="s2">in my estimation if not yours Dirac</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.750" end="00:10:27.300" style="s2">would be neck and neck with Einstein for</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.600" end="00:10:29.879" style="s2">the greatest of 20th century physicists</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.300" end="00:10:32.009" style="s2">I think I wouldn&#39;t be far off at that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.879" end="00:10:33.569" style="s2">description for some reason his press</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.009" end="00:10:35.029" style="s2">wasn&#39;t nearly as good maybe because of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.569" end="00:10:37.709" style="s2">his hair I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.029" end="00:10:41.550" style="s2">well he didn&#39;t talk much this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.709" end="00:10:44.339" style="s2">the problems no I agree I think he was I</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.550" end="00:10:45.750" style="s2">mean you think about all the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.339" end="00:10:48.329" style="s2">mechanics people who developed that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.750" end="00:10:51.480" style="s2">amazing subject and Dirac was really the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.329" end="00:10:54.300" style="s2">one who put it all in order and so on</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.480" end="00:10:56.610" style="s2">well is is is and this gets to a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.300" end="00:10:59.730" style="s2">odd issue which is that you have wielded</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.610" end="00:11:03.689" style="s2">taste and beauty as a weapon your entire</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.730" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">life your drawings are among the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.689" end="00:11:07.350" style="s2">compelling I remember the first time one</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:09.990" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.350" end="00:11:12.210" style="s2">using our friend Joe Rogan&#39;s program is</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.990" end="00:11:14.400" style="s2">to push out discussion of the hopf</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.210" end="00:11:16.650" style="s2">fibration because it&#39;s an it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.400" end="00:11:20.520" style="s2">non-trivial principle bundle that can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.650" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">visually seen mm-hmm and since the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.520" end="00:11:26.190" style="s2">seems to be about principle bundles it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:28.530" style="s2">a bit odd that the general population</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.190" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know that stuff of which we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.530" end="00:11:35.550" style="s2">yes we&#39;re like the hopf fibration or the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">Clifford parallels was instrumental in</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.550" end="00:11:39.780" style="s2">the subject of Krishna theory well but</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:41.640" style="s2">the first time I ever saw a diagram it</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.780" end="00:11:43.800" style="s2">was somebody reproducing a diagram they</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.640" end="00:11:47.090" style="s2">had seen of yours and so the way in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.800" end="00:11:50.370" style="s2">which you have used art and sketches</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.090" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">moment yeah it was drawn by hand largely</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.370" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">I mean they were running some circles</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:57.510" style="s2">involved which I use a compass for but</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:12:01.310" style="s2">basically I drape my hand there were two</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.510" end="00:12:05.490" style="s2">versions of it the first one was more I</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.310" end="00:12:07.550" style="s2">sort of thread you die first one was had</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.490" end="00:12:09.780" style="s2">more circles in it and I thought I draw</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.550" end="00:12:10.830" style="s2">there&#39;s more simply in the second</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.780" end="00:12:14.510" style="s2">version but actually I had three</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.830" end="00:12:20.010" style="s2">versions the third version is in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.510" end="00:12:21.450" style="s2">road to reality but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.010" end="00:12:25.410" style="s2">best I think the second version perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.450" end="00:12:27.450" style="s2">is the best so so Dirac getting back to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.410" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">it had this elegance of mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.450" end="00:12:36.420" style="s2">it was unrelenting yes and he famously</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:38.640" style="s2">brought in these bizarre objects with</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.420" end="00:12:40.200" style="s2">which some of us are obsessed others of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.640" end="00:12:42.380" style="s2">us don&#39;t understand the obsession called</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.200" end="00:12:44.340" style="s2">spinners which is whatever a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.380" end="00:12:48.500" style="s2">prerequisite to getting to twist your</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.340" end="00:12:53.130" style="s2">theory which you&#39;ve popularized well I</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.500" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">went to the UC Dirac gave a course of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.130" end="00:12:58.620" style="s2">lectures in quantum mechanics and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">first course was sort of basic quantum</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.620" end="00:13:04.440" style="s2">mechanics and the second course was on</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:07.350" style="s2">quantum field theory but also spinners</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.440" end="00:13:10.890" style="s2">and there&#39;s an interesting story about</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.350" end="00:13:14.970" style="s2">that which I don&#39;t know the answer to in</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.890" end="00:13:16.770" style="s2">the second course he deviated from his</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:43.950" style="s2">for me were absolutely what I needed you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.610" end="00:13:46.350" style="s2">see I&#39;d learned from my work on</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.950" end="00:13:49.350" style="s2">algebraic geometry which ended that by</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.350" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">trying to understand tensor systems as</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.350" end="00:13:53.910" style="s2">abstract systems and things which you</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:55.200" style="s2">can&#39;t represent in terms of compare</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.910" end="00:13:56.760" style="s2">should just say that in terms of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.200" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">two components spin as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.760" end="00:14:01.920" style="s2">out for the lay audience all of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">matter that they think about whether</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.920" end="00:14:07.550" style="s2">it&#39;s in bound up in electrons or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:10.350" style="s2">quarks that make up protons and neutrons</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.550" end="00:14:11.940" style="s2">if you think of these things as waves</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.350" end="00:14:13.260" style="s2">which many people in our audience will</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:14.670" style="s2">be familiar with that concept the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.260" end="00:14:17.430" style="s2">question is what are they wait what</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.670" end="00:14:19.710" style="s2">medium are they waves in and they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.430" end="00:14:21.690" style="s2">medium would be a medium of spinners</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.710" end="00:14:22.860" style="s2">which is not something that&#39;s easy for</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.690" end="00:14:25.140" style="s2">people to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.860" end="00:14:29.730" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s they&#39;re not and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.140" end="00:14:31.560" style="s2">the formalism you see Dennis I told him</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.730" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">I need to understand about spinners and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.560" end="00:14:37.020" style="s2">particularly to the simplest ones of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:39.750" style="s2">these two components - and he suggested</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.020" end="00:14:41.460" style="s2">I read this book by Corson so I got the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.750" end="00:14:44.820" style="s2">book by course and and I found it</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.460" end="00:14:47.310" style="s2">completely incomprehensible just the I</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.820" end="00:14:49.560" style="s2">mean it was a fascinating book because</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.310" end="00:14:51.140" style="s2">it it was very comprehensive and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.560" end="00:14:52.890" style="s2">described all these different spins</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.140" end="00:14:55.380" style="s2">fields and different things like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.890" end="00:14:56.750" style="s2">and using a lot of two components</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.380" end="00:15:00.660" style="s2">minutes which is the right way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.750" end="00:15:03.800" style="s2">but to introduce what these objects were</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.660" end="00:15:07.100" style="s2">was almost incomprehensible I found</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.800" end="00:15:09.390" style="s2">mainly because you have these</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.100" end="00:15:11.910" style="s2">translation symbols all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.390" end="00:15:14.810" style="s2">and they mess up the appearance of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.910" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">formula so I just found this thing very</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.810" end="00:15:20.820" style="s2">complicated and incomprehensible but</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:22.830" style="s2">then I went to Dirac&#39;s second course it</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.820" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">may have been not the same year I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.830" end="00:15:26.580" style="s2">he went one year I did the first and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:28.260" style="s2">maybe the second course was when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.580" end="00:15:29.550" style="s2">research fellow rather than when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.260" end="00:15:31.890" style="s2">graduate student I can&#39;t quite remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.550" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">I think must have been when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.890" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">graduate research fellow</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:39.350" style="s2">way he this was a course on quantum</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:44.620" style="s2">field theory and things like that but he</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.350" end="00:15:47.720" style="s2">sort of deviated from his normal course</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.620" end="00:15:50.029" style="s2">in one week to talk about two components</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.720" end="00:15:52.550" style="s2">minutes and fame for me this was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.029" end="00:15:55.129" style="s2">what I needed it made the whole subject</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.550" end="00:15:57.620" style="s2">clear from this complete confusion that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.129" end="00:15:59.990" style="s2">it had before now then you see many</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.620" end="00:16:02.029" style="s2">years later I talked to Graham farmer</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.990" end="00:16:04.970" style="s2">and I told him the story and he said</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.029" end="00:16:07.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a very strange Dirac would never</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.970" end="00:16:09.410" style="s2">deviate from his course he just he</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.610" end="00:16:11.959" style="s2">thought when he got his course perfect</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.410" end="00:16:15.230" style="s2">it was perfect he would never change and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.959" end="00:16:18.050" style="s2">this was true of his first yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.230" end="00:16:21.439" style="s2">course the short term the initial course</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.050" end="00:16:23.089" style="s2">which I went to which people often said</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.439" end="00:16:25.939" style="s2">to me well I think it&#39;s not such a great</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.089" end="00:16:28.250" style="s2">course it&#39;s exactly like his book well</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.939" end="00:16:31.730" style="s2">hadn&#39;t read his book so to me this was</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.250" end="00:16:33.379" style="s2">sure the book is amazing too but not</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.730" end="00:16:36.170" style="s2">having read the book I found this course</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.379" end="00:16:37.670" style="s2">absolutely stunning and it made things</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.170" end="00:16:41.300" style="s2">after you think Dirac actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.670" end="00:16:43.459" style="s2">understand understood these objects is</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.300" end="00:16:45.709" style="s2">most mysterious of various Minnis</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.459" end="00:16:47.630" style="s2">spinners in general I mean he brought</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.709" end="00:16:50.360" style="s2">them into physics they had been</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.630" end="00:16:52.189" style="s2">previously found inside of mathematics I</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.360" end="00:16:55.339" style="s2">think by people like killing and Lee I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.189" end="00:16:59.029" style="s2">not sure yes but cotton is the car ten</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.339" end="00:17:01.430" style="s2">perhaps I don&#39;t think I mean let me</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.029" end="00:17:03.230" style="s2">throw out a really dangerous I yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.430" end="00:17:05.480" style="s2">don&#39;t think any of us understand them at</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.230" end="00:17:07.909" style="s2">all and the part of the problem was is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.480" end="00:17:10.939" style="s2">that he understood very well what could</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.909" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">be said about them yeah but that if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.939" end="00:17:15.829" style="s2">know I asked you before but like your</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.829" end="00:17:18.140" style="s2">favorite film you said 2001 you could</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.829" end="00:17:20.120" style="s2">make an argument that spinners are in</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.140" end="00:17:22.220" style="s2">mathematics and physics like the Monell</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.120" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">if it&#39;s always encountered nobody ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.220" end="00:17:26.059" style="s2">understands exactly what it means but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:28.429" style="s2">always grabs your attention because it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.059" end="00:17:30.950" style="s2">seems so absolutely bizarre and highly</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.429" end="00:17:34.789" style="s2">conserved well I always like to think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.950" end="00:17:37.250" style="s2">things geometrically and least for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.789" end="00:17:38.690" style="s2">two component ones you see when you go</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.250" end="00:17:41.570" style="s2">up to higher dimensions you still have</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.690" end="00:17:43.730" style="s2">spinners but the spinners the dimension</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.570" end="00:17:45.890" style="s2">of the spinners goes up exponentially so</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.730" end="00:17:47.110" style="s2">each time you add the two to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.890" end="00:17:49.330" style="s2">intervention of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.110" end="00:17:51.880" style="s2">space and the dimension of spinors is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.330" end="00:17:55.299" style="s2">multiplied by two so I think I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.880" end="00:17:58.690" style="s2">2d for example yeah you&#39;d get spinners</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.299" end="00:18:00.640" style="s2">of dimension 2 to the D over 2 that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.690" end="00:18:03.250" style="s2">the sort of thing that&#39;s right and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">the the well the usually ones talks</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.250" end="00:18:07.299" style="s2">about the dirac spinors which are the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.870" end="00:18:09.640" style="s2">four Dement the for the false means</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.299" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">right but they split into these two two</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.640" end="00:18:13.450" style="s2">and two</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">in even dimensions yes that&#39;s right in</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.450" end="00:18:19.990" style="s2">even dimensions and I like to understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:21.880" style="s2">these things geometrically so you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.990" end="00:18:24.549" style="s2">see what the two-component spinor</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.880" end="00:18:27.910" style="s2">represented this picture of a of a flag</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.549" end="00:18:29.980" style="s2">so you have the flagpole goes along the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.910" end="00:18:31.690" style="s2">light cone so that&#39;s it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.980" end="00:18:33.130" style="s2">vector like piece of it yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.690" end="00:18:35.169" style="s2">vector and now and then you have an</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.130" end="00:18:38.950" style="s2">extra piece of date an extra piece which</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.169" end="00:18:40.620" style="s2">is this flag plane hmm and you get a</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.950" end="00:18:43.660" style="s2">pretty good geometrical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.620" end="00:18:47.860" style="s2">the one little catch to it is that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.660" end="00:18:50.260" style="s2">you rotate it through 100 300 360</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.860" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">degrees so you might think just the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.260" end="00:18:55.799" style="s2">it started it&#39;s not the same as it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:59.559" style="s2">before it&#39;s it&#39;s changed its sign and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.799" end="00:19:02.290" style="s2">then you rotate it again that won&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.559" end="00:19:04.419" style="s2">any sense to anyone but if I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.290" end="00:19:06.850" style="s2">way of looking at that is if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.419" end="00:19:07.870" style="s2">Klein bottle yes for those of some</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.850" end="00:19:09.490" style="s2">people will be listening to this an</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.870" end="00:19:12.070" style="s2">audience I&#39;m watching it in video a</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.490" end="00:19:14.140" style="s2">complying bar all in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.070" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">that can be made precise has a square</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.140" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">root that would be a torus that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:21.160" style="s2">double color so it seems like a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:24.130" style="s2">weird thing to take a square root of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.160" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">strange topological mobius like object</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.130" end="00:19:29.230" style="s2">but there you are yeah so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:31.570" style="s2">the square root of the rotations that</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.230" end="00:19:33.400" style="s2">has this double effect but we say it</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.570" end="00:19:34.809" style="s2">linguistically in a way that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.400" end="00:19:37.150" style="s2">almost impossible for anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.809" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">understand I think this was a mystery I</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.150" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">mean I understood that spinner was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:43.150" style="s2">square root of a vector you see and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:45.910" style="s2">couldn&#39;t make head or tail of that idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.150" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">and it was when I went to Dirac&#39;s course</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.910" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">it did become clear and he made he gave</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:55.450" style="s2">this very impressive illustration which</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:57.640" style="s2">I thought was due to Dirac I learned</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.450" end="00:19:59.060" style="s2">later it was just a Hermann Val hmm did</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.640" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">you imagine a cone</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.060" end="00:20:05.250" style="s2">circular côtes yes it&#39;s based like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:08.070" style="s2">circular cross section and another equal</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.250" end="00:20:11.190" style="s2">cone which rolls on it so one is fixed</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.070" end="00:20:13.170" style="s2">and the other one rolls around on it now</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.190" end="00:20:17.160" style="s2">you see when you were imagine initially</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.170" end="00:20:19.320" style="s2">the cone is almost just a little spike I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.160" end="00:20:21.510" style="s2">mean he was a tiny circle at the end and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.320" end="00:20:23.790" style="s2">when you roll one on the other it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.510" end="00:20:25.860" style="s2">rolling one coin on the other coin so</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.790" end="00:20:27.950" style="s2">you and you can see when you roll one</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.860" end="00:20:33.390" style="s2">coin another coin it goes around twice</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.950" end="00:20:36.750" style="s2">because Marie&#39;s degrees as you go around</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.390" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">okay now when you imagine gradually</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.750" end="00:20:41.640" style="s2">increasing the angle the semi angle of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:44.070" style="s2">the cone and you do it again you keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.640" end="00:20:47.040" style="s2">thinking of that motion until it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.070" end="00:20:49.110" style="s2">almost flat and then what&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.040" end="00:20:51.810" style="s2">one&#39;s just a little wobble all right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.110" end="00:20:54.560" style="s2">when it becomes flat this motion goes to</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.810" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">nothing so this illustrates how a</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.560" end="00:21:00.630" style="s2">rotation through four pi right two</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">complete rotations gradually can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.630" end="00:21:06.690" style="s2">deformed into no rotation at all however</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:08.610" style="s2">with single rotation it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.690" end="00:21:10.740" style="s2">disappear well I think with a with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.610" end="00:21:12.450" style="s2">pulley system in a wheel we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.740" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">any trouble imagining the wheel that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.450" end="00:21:19.290" style="s2">rotates twice as fast half as fast not</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">at all hooked up to one particular crank</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.290" end="00:21:25.320" style="s2">wheel right yeah the problem comes when</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:27.270" style="s2">that that&#39;s not the generic case the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.320" end="00:21:29.790" style="s2">generic case is usually encountered one</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.270" end="00:21:32.310" style="s2">dimension higher three and up has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.790" end="00:21:34.650" style="s2">familiar because something called the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.310" end="00:21:39.660" style="s2">fundamental group as in structure Z mod</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.650" end="00:21:41.850" style="s2">Z to Z in dimension two so there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.660" end="00:21:43.980" style="s2">something where in the place where you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.850" end="00:21:47.190" style="s2">can see this most easily it&#39;s slightly</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.980" end="00:21:49.230" style="s2">misleading and then in higher dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.190" end="00:21:51.000" style="s2">you have to learn how to tutor your</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.230" end="00:21:53.010" style="s2">intuition which is this problem at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.000" end="00:21:54.990" style="s2">of us who try to think about higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.010" end="00:21:57.300" style="s2">dimensional objects encounters that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.990" end="00:21:59.420" style="s2">have to use the visual cortex we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.300" end="00:22:02.040" style="s2">handed and then we have to trick it into</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.420" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">imagining worlds beyond where we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.040" end="00:22:07.620" style="s2">but you see direct has another thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">that&#39;s not there&#39;s a thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.620" end="00:22:12.630" style="s2">direct scissors problem mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:14.980" style="s2">so you imagine a chair with which as the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.630" end="00:22:17.320" style="s2">pieces of wood going out like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.980" end="00:22:19.450" style="s2">yeah and you have a pair of scissors I</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.320" end="00:22:21.780" style="s2">think this is director joke there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.450" end="00:22:24.100" style="s2">pair of scissors and through the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.780" end="00:22:25.480" style="s2">when you put your fingers you have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.100" end="00:22:27.070" style="s2">piece of string which goes through this</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.480" end="00:22:28.450" style="s2">and then goes around the chair and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.070" end="00:22:30.460" style="s2">comes back through the other one goes</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.450" end="00:22:32.679" style="s2">back again right now the problem is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.460" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">take the scissors and you rotate them</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.679" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">through 360 360 degrees and the strings</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:40.270" style="s2">will tangle that we kill and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:41.440" style="s2">you do you can&#39;t untangle it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.270" end="00:22:44.050" style="s2">allowed to move the sisters around</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:45.610" style="s2">parallel not rotate them and you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.050" end="00:22:48.870" style="s2">move the string around it and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.610" end="00:22:51.970" style="s2">undo it but you do twice three hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.870" end="00:22:55.570" style="s2">400-700 20 degrees to complete rotations</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.970" end="00:22:57.610" style="s2">and then you find you can untangle it so</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.570" end="00:22:59.500" style="s2">this was the direct scissors problem and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.610" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">I think the trick the joke was it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.500" end="00:23:04.320" style="s2">pair of scissors so if you get super</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">frustrated and he wrote a paper</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.320" end="00:23:11.110" style="s2">explaining that I think max Newman yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">wrote a paper Dirac did this is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.110" end="00:23:16.300" style="s2">illustration how you can undo it when</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:18.190" style="s2">it&#39;s minutes right it&#39;s 4pi for someone</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.300" end="00:23:20.620" style="s2">trainees degrees but to prove that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.190" end="00:23:22.780" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do it with this is I think you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.620" end="00:23:24.670" style="s2">okay max Newman if you&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.780" end="00:23:26.770" style="s2">video called air on the Dirac string</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.670" end="00:23:28.840" style="s2">which illustrates this in video form</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.770" end="00:23:31.030" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen I would highly recommend it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.840" end="00:23:33.220" style="s2">because it shows this off as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.030" end="00:23:35.380" style="s2">similarity to the belt tricked the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.220" end="00:23:37.960" style="s2">foreseen wineglass yeah and it well is</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.380" end="00:23:39.850" style="s2">all the different versions I find I</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.960" end="00:23:42.010" style="s2">could do that one actually yeah I had</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.850" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">Joe Rogan try it yeah I think he got</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.010" end="00:23:48.130" style="s2">almost all the way around yeah no I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">done it with a glass like that and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.130" end="00:23:55.750" style="s2">comes back very stylish to to complete</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:59.500" style="s2">rotations in the rotation yes so this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.750" end="00:24:02.590" style="s2">a very fundamental property of the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.500" end="00:24:04.510" style="s2">that is somehow not discussed I think I</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.590" end="00:24:06.070" style="s2">find it very interesting that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.510" end="00:24:07.450" style="s2">want to talk to me about the multiverse</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.070" end="00:24:10.570" style="s2">sometimes they want to talk to me about</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.450" end="00:24:12.760" style="s2">quantum measurement problem but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.570" end="00:24:13.900" style="s2">that we are somehow based on a square</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.760" end="00:24:16.030" style="s2">root and I would disagree with you</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.900" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">slightly if you would permit it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.030" end="00:24:19.750" style="s2">just a question of the square root of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:22.120" style="s2">this of the vectors it&#39;s the square root</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.750" end="00:24:22.690" style="s2">of the the algebra generated by the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.120" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">vectors</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.690" end="00:24:26.710" style="s2">that really this the spinners are this</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:30.220" style="s2">exterior or Clifford algebra oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.710" end="00:24:33.160" style="s2">this object has fascinated me my entire</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.220" end="00:24:35.220" style="s2">life and it&#39;s very strange that all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.160" end="00:24:38.290" style="s2">you know the stability of matter and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.220" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">matters strange properties with electron</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.290" end="00:24:42.700" style="s2">shells are all coming out of this weird</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:44.740" style="s2">not that it appears everywhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.700" end="00:24:46.600" style="s2">universe and it&#39;s not universally known</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.740" end="00:24:48.340" style="s2">that it&#39;s even there yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.600" end="00:24:51.580" style="s2">difference between the family owns and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.340" end="00:24:56.220" style="s2">the bosons so the particles which have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.580" end="00:24:59.170" style="s2">spin which is half an odd number right</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.220" end="00:25:01.480" style="s2">which which have this curious property</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.170" end="00:25:03.310" style="s2">that you rotate them and they get back</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.480" end="00:25:06.340" style="s2">to manage themselves and it&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.310" end="00:25:09.900" style="s2">for for matter because the Pauli</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.340" end="00:25:13.060" style="s2">exclusion principle depends on the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.900" end="00:25:15.700" style="s2">family statistics which is to do with</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.060" end="00:25:17.830" style="s2">the this exact this property so without</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.700" end="00:25:19.330" style="s2">this nodded miss and the scissor trick</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.830" end="00:25:21.850" style="s2">or whatever you want to call it we</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.330" end="00:25:23.860" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have a periodic table and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.850" end="00:25:25.330" style="s2">chemical elements you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.860" end="00:25:26.440" style="s2">anything we&#39;d have anything yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.330" end="00:25:28.120" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have it you wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.440" end="00:25:30.250" style="s2">fermions in otherwise we wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.120" end="00:25:33.910" style="s2">things which have an exclusion principle</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.250" end="00:25:37.300" style="s2">so and the bosons which are the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.910" end="00:25:38.730" style="s2">they they like to be on if you have two</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.300" end="00:25:41.260" style="s2">bosons</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.730" end="00:25:42.790" style="s2">in you can have them in the same state</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.260" end="00:25:44.500" style="s2">make rather like to be in the same state</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.790" end="00:25:46.540" style="s2">so you get these things called</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.500" end="00:25:48.220" style="s2">bose-einstein condensates where if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.540" end="00:25:50.620" style="s2">get the very coal they all flop together</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.220" end="00:25:52.090" style="s2">into the same state but for the fermions</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.620" end="00:25:53.980" style="s2">it&#39;s completely the opposite they hate</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.090" end="00:25:56.230" style="s2">to be in the same state well they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.980" end="00:25:59.620" style="s2">be and this is what sort of pushes them</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.230" end="00:26:00.970" style="s2">apart so you got the Fermi principle so</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.620" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">you have this path it&#39;s a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.970" end="00:26:06.070" style="s2">called the spin statistics theorem yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:08.260" style="s2">that says that if things have a nodded</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.070" end="00:26:10.570" style="s2">nosov a particular kind then they either</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.260" end="00:26:11.830" style="s2">are highly individualistic or highly</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.570" end="00:26:14.440" style="s2">communist stick whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.830" end="00:26:16.030" style="s2">call it my question would be there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.440" end="00:26:18.970" style="s2">another aspect of that that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.030" end="00:26:20.980" style="s2">very curious about which is when we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.970" end="00:26:22.030" style="s2">to treat these objects quantum</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.980" end="00:26:24.100" style="s2">mechanically and you&#39;ve of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.030" end="00:26:26.670" style="s2">thought a great deal and quantum theory</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.100" end="00:26:30.310" style="s2">we have two totally different</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.670" end="00:26:32.470" style="s2">prescriptions for how to make these</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.310" end="00:26:33.760" style="s2">different objects quantum mechanical but</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.470" end="00:26:36.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a one-to-one correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.760" end="00:26:39.490" style="s2">between these two</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.280" end="00:26:41.590" style="s2">utterly different treatments that matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.490" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">and force get quantum mechanically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.590" end="00:26:45.940" style="s2">the darndest thing when you get these</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">two kinds of particle or two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.940" end="00:26:52.900" style="s2">atoms two bosons and the family owns an</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:54.370" style="s2">inch has to do with the make a complete</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.900" end="00:26:56.710" style="s2">rotation do they come back to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.370" end="00:26:59.020" style="s2">or do they come back to minus themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.710" end="00:27:01.270" style="s2">that&#39;s the top of logic yeah but then</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.020" end="00:27:05.320" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole swing out I go under</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.270" end="00:27:07.210" style="s2">like bear is in integration which is no</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.320" end="00:27:09.220" style="s2">integration at all I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.210" end="00:27:11.230" style="s2">effectively almost lying about what</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.220" end="00:27:16.420" style="s2">you&#39;re doing to the fermions yes and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.230" end="00:27:18.400" style="s2">make them look like bosons and yet what</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.420" end="00:27:22.120" style="s2">we what we seem to get out of this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.400" end="00:27:24.220" style="s2">that nobody I I don&#39;t think anyone could</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.120" end="00:27:26.020" style="s2">have anticipated that there would be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.220" end="00:27:28.540" style="s2">dictionary of two totally different</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.020" end="00:27:30.970" style="s2">structures which are seems to be almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.540" end="00:27:33.190" style="s2">word-for-word yeah cuz they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.970" end="00:27:36.460" style="s2">totally different in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.190" end="00:27:39.190" style="s2">take to a two-family out system and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.460" end="00:27:42.640" style="s2">get the bosons so you well they have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.190" end="00:27:44.520" style="s2">same well yes that&#39;s right no yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.640" end="00:27:48.130" style="s2">I could ask you a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.520" end="00:27:51.400" style="s2">mm-hmm so I want to get to supersymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.130" end="00:27:53.110" style="s2">but before I do I said yes okay go on</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.400" end="00:27:58.030" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna make you work this morning</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.110" end="00:28:01.240" style="s2">so I can understand that yeah so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.030" end="00:28:03.880" style="s2">my question am I correct that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.240" end="00:28:07.950" style="s2">lived through two eras an era of fairly</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.880" end="00:28:11.850" style="s2">rapid development in testable</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.950" end="00:28:13.780" style="s2">fundamental physics coming from theory</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.850" end="00:28:15.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to be very careful about</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.780" end="00:28:22.740" style="s2">setting that up so I don&#39;t walk into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.220" end="00:28:27.370" style="s2">trap and I a stagnant fear era in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.740" end="00:28:29.260" style="s2">theoretical predictions coming at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.370" end="00:28:34.020" style="s2">level of fundamental theory have not</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.260" end="00:28:36.190" style="s2">been rapidly confirmed by experiment</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.020" end="00:28:37.990" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking of things like string</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.190" end="00:28:40.930" style="s2">theory I&#39;m thinking about a regime</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.990" end="00:28:43.660" style="s2">before the early 70s and a regime</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.930" end="00:28:45.670" style="s2">following the early supersymmetry is</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.660" end="00:28:47.470" style="s2">that what you meant well it could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.670" end="00:28:50.470" style="s2">grand unified theory supersymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.470" end="00:28:53.560" style="s2">Technicolor it could be asymptotic</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.470" end="00:28:55.450" style="s2">it could be any one of a number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.560" end="00:28:56.110" style="s2">speculative theories from loop quantum</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.450" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">gravity</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.110" end="00:29:02.920" style="s2">regi calculus extremely reassuring think</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:06.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried a million different things</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.920" end="00:29:08.410" style="s2">that don&#39;t they didn&#39;t really pan out</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.090" end="00:29:10.380" style="s2">well it seems like well if you&#39;ll permit</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.410" end="00:29:13.420" style="s2">an American metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.380" end="00:29:15.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve been waved into third base and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.420" end="00:29:18.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve been waiting for the signal to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.100" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">come home for about 50 years and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.160" end="00:29:22.390" style="s2">not even sure that anyone&#39;s still you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:23.650" style="s2">know there at home plate well you see</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.390" end="00:29:24.970" style="s2">you might be wrong playing the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.650" end="00:29:27.880" style="s2">game that&#39;s the trouble you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.970" end="00:29:30.760" style="s2">rounders would do it well I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.880" end="00:29:32.740" style="s2">a lot of intriguing ideas you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.760" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">basically I think you were hinting it</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.740" end="00:29:38.980" style="s2">supersymmetry is one of them which but</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:40.620" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ve thrown off close to ten I</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.980" end="00:29:43.420" style="s2">pretty pop I could do it pretty easily</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.620" end="00:29:45.880" style="s2">but I guess you had there&#39;s nothing new</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.420" end="00:29:48.780" style="s2">about that they were people were playing</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.880" end="00:29:52.750" style="s2">around with not something I&#39;m Kelvin</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.780" end="00:29:55.780" style="s2">with the idea that nots might be at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.750" end="00:29:57.940" style="s2">basis of particle identity yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.780" end="00:30:00.670" style="s2">mean these ideas come back again in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.940" end="00:30:03.010" style="s2">different form but certainly in the I</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.670" end="00:30:06.220" style="s2">guess the 19th century people were</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.010" end="00:30:09.610" style="s2">playing with well I guess you can go</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.220" end="00:30:11.640" style="s2">back further than that phlogiston well</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.610" end="00:30:16.770" style="s2">that&#39;s true but I would say that Maxwell</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.640" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">was the first great condensation of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.770" end="00:30:22.710" style="s2">theoretical ideas where an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:25.780" style="s2">amount of theory surrounding yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.710" end="00:30:27.940" style="s2">magnetism electricity visible light</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.780" end="00:30:30.910" style="s2">invisible light well that was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.940" end="00:30:34.360" style="s2">huge revolution that all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.910" end="00:30:36.790" style="s2">now can be unpacked from a single</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.360" end="00:30:39.100" style="s2">geometric equation but that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.790" end="00:30:43.020" style="s2">I mean people know about Galileo they</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.100" end="00:30:47.140" style="s2">know about Newton you know about Kepler</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.020" end="00:30:50.620" style="s2">they know about Einstein and they also</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.140" end="00:30:53.650" style="s2">may know about the modern quantum field</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.620" end="00:30:56.350" style="s2">theory Heisenberg Schrodinger people how</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.650" end="00:30:58.870" style="s2">many people know about Maxwell not</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.350" end="00:31:00.670" style="s2">enough not enough all the Maples do have</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.870" end="00:31:03.140" style="s2">Maxwell&#39;s equations tattooed on their</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.670" end="00:31:06.290" style="s2">backsides well some people do yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.140" end="00:31:09.130" style="s2">but the general public don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.290" end="00:31:12.410" style="s2">Maxwell but Maxwell&#39;s equations</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.130" end="00:31:16.130" style="s2">completely changed our way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.410" end="00:31:17.420" style="s2">the world and we live off it without</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.130" end="00:31:21.530" style="s2">thinking you know you&#39;ve got these</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.420" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">lights here well these are visible</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.530" end="00:31:25.340" style="s2">lights so we we know you knew my visible</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:29.390" style="s2">right but we didn&#39;t know anything about</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.340" end="00:31:33.580" style="s2">X rays x rays radio waves they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.390" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">part of the same scheme electromagnetism</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.580" end="00:31:37.370" style="s2">dynamic well some of this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:40.570" style="s2">Faraday just before makes sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.370" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">so Faraday had a lot of the influential</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.570" end="00:31:45.770" style="s2">ideas electromagnetism well they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:48.500" style="s2">little bit of that was known before</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.770" end="00:31:50.030" style="s2">Oersted knew that if you had an electric</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.500" end="00:31:51.830" style="s2">current then you get a magnetic field</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.030" end="00:31:53.179" style="s2">but it was the other way around with</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.830" end="00:31:55.130" style="s2">Maxwell now if you have a varying</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.179" end="00:31:56.690" style="s2">magnetic field you&#39;ve got a current and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.130" end="00:31:59.240" style="s2">you combine these ideas you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.690" end="00:32:01.549" style="s2">dynamo so these these things go to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.240" end="00:32:03.250" style="s2">Faraday and he has sort of clues that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.549" end="00:32:06.740" style="s2">there might be some connection with</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.250" end="00:32:09.740" style="s2">light but he didn&#39;t have the equations</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.740" end="00:32:12.679" style="s2">but even max you know I&#39;m very partial</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.740" end="00:32:15.470" style="s2">to this book on orchids that followed</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.679" end="00:32:18.169" style="s2">Darwin&#39;s Origin of Species oh yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.470" end="00:32:20.809" style="s2">was the book he wrote you the title is</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.169" end="00:32:22.250" style="s2">and I always I love reciting it it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.809" end="00:32:23.510" style="s2">the various contrivances by which</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.250" end="00:32:25.790" style="s2">British and foreign orchids are</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.510" end="00:32:27.380" style="s2">fertilized by insects and so you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.790" end="00:32:29.210" style="s2">well why would he write a damn fool book</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.380" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">like that after Origin of Species and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.210" end="00:32:32.780" style="s2">the answer is he wanted to test whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:34.340" style="s2">he understood his own theory and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.780" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">it&#39;s revealed that he didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.340" end="00:32:37.910" style="s2">the full application I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:40.160" style="s2">same thing is true of Maxwell&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.910" end="00:32:42.380" style="s2">equations which is this is perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.160" end="00:32:44.929" style="s2">best dress rehearsal for unification</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.380" end="00:32:47.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve ever seen you know full</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.929" end="00:32:51.140" style="s2">unification and on the other hand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.780" end="00:32:53.960" style="s2">not until the late 50s that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.140" end="00:32:58.160" style="s2">unpack the last trivial consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.960" end="00:33:01.220" style="s2">the theory with the this bizarre effect</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.160" end="00:33:07.309" style="s2">of passing an electron beam around an</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.220" end="00:33:09.559" style="s2">insulated wire enough yeah in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.309" end="00:33:12.140" style="s2">had dinner last night we we asked yucker</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.559" end="00:33:13.970" style="s2">Aronoff hood if he wanted to come but</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.140" end="00:33:14.950" style="s2">he&#39;s in Israel and he sends his regards</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.970" end="00:33:18.549" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.950" end="00:33:21.700" style="s2">sent mine back oh I don&#39;t know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.549" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">great fun I always but that was a that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.700" end="00:33:28.929" style="s2">was a very weird thing where we learned</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:34.330" style="s2">that if you have a an insulated solenoid</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.929" end="00:33:36.970" style="s2">that the phase of the electron beam</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.330" end="00:33:38.590" style="s2">going in a circle around it would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.970" end="00:33:41.169" style="s2">shifted despite the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.590" end="00:33:42.820" style="s2">electromagnetic field could be treated</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.169" end="00:33:45.309" style="s2">as 0 because the electromagnetic</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.820" end="00:33:47.830" style="s2">potential this precursor yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.309" end="00:33:49.299" style="s2">turned out to carry the actual content</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.830" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">that it before that it had been thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.299" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">that that was just a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.980" end="00:33:55.059" style="s2">convenience product to recover</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:57.399" style="s2">electromagnetism and it turned out that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.059" end="00:34:00.669" style="s2">that geometric object was more important</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.399" end="00:34:03.429" style="s2">and you know in part the reason I bring</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.669" end="00:34:06.669" style="s2">this up is that we would have no way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.429" end="00:34:10.799" style="s2">visualizing this effect if it were not</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.669" end="00:34:14.429" style="s2">for your interaction with MC Escher and</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.799" end="00:34:17.589" style="s2">there you have to explain that one well</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.429" end="00:34:19.389" style="s2">you know this this this etching called</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.589" end="00:34:21.129" style="s2">ascending and descending oh yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.389" end="00:34:24.309" style="s2">yeah which is sometimes referred to as</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.129" end="00:34:27.909" style="s2">the Penrose stairs yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.309" end="00:34:30.339" style="s2">well you want that story well thank you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.909" end="00:34:33.309" style="s2">but what I was gonna say about wire mass</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.339" end="00:34:37.230" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah is that the photon is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.309" end="00:34:40.599" style="s2">really best represented in some sense as</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.230" end="00:34:43.000" style="s2">the angles of a set of stairs like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.599" end="00:34:44.829" style="s2">with this very mysterious property that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.000" end="00:34:46.589" style="s2">what you&#39;re really talking about is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.829" end="00:34:49.210" style="s2">we would call horizontal subspaces</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.589" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">pictured as stairs and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.210" end="00:34:53.379" style="s2">there&#39;s a paradox of going around and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:54.609" style="s2">you seem to be going up all the time but</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.379" end="00:34:57.099" style="s2">you&#39;re back to where you came is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.609" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">same thing as saying I never go up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.099" end="00:35:01.000" style="s2">yet I come back higher or lower and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:03.160" style="s2">that&#39;s called Halle Nomi and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.000" end="00:35:05.049" style="s2">have a means of visualizing that except</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.160" end="00:35:06.520" style="s2">for like either rock-paper-scissors or</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.049" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">your work with Escher is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.520" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">comment well I had is it the first time</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:16.569" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever heard somebody say this well</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:18.700" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s a quite complicated story</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.569" end="00:35:22.420" style="s2">hit her you see when I was a graduate</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.700" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">student in Cambridge I think it was in</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.420" end="00:35:28.180" style="s2">my second year when the International</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:29.110" style="s2">Congress of mathematicians took place in</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.180" end="00:35:32.650" style="s2">Amsterdam</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.110" end="00:35:35.530" style="s2">and so I and a few friends decided we</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.650" end="00:35:38.980" style="s2">would go to this meeting and I remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.530" end="00:35:41.380" style="s2">I think I was just about to get on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.980" end="00:35:46.300" style="s2">bus or a tram or something and Sean</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.380" end="00:35:49.330" style="s2">Wylie who is a lecturer in in algebraic</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.300" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">topology was just about to get off the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.330" end="00:35:56.380" style="s2">bus I was getting on he had this catalog</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:57.340" style="s2">in his hand of an exhibition in the van</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.380" end="00:36:02.290" style="s2">Gogh Museum</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.340" end="00:36:03.970" style="s2">and this was a picture the one called</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.290" end="00:36:06.370" style="s2">night and day with birds flying our</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.970" end="00:36:07.540" style="s2">heart into the day in the night and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.370" end="00:36:09.070" style="s2">checked it</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.540" end="00:36:10.840" style="s2">the birds changed into the spaces</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.070" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">between the birds when we go and ice</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.840" end="00:36:14.920" style="s2">look at this imagine that&#39;s amazing what</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:16.660" style="s2">is that well they come from you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.920" end="00:36:19.960" style="s2">well as you&#39;d be very interested this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.660" end="00:36:22.390" style="s2">this in the van Gogh Museum there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.960" end="00:36:25.300" style="s2">this exhibition by an artist called Asha</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.390" end="00:36:26.890" style="s2">so I&#39;ve never heard of him before and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.300" end="00:36:29.800" style="s2">went to this exhibition and I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.890" end="00:36:31.840" style="s2">absolutely blown away I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.800" end="00:36:33.940" style="s2">most amazing thing I remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.840" end="00:36:36.520" style="s2">particularly one called relativity where</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.940" end="00:36:38.290" style="s2">people walk up the stairs of gravity</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.520" end="00:36:41.710" style="s2">directions in two different ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.290" end="00:36:44.410" style="s2">and I thought this was hugely impressive</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.710" end="00:36:47.350" style="s2">and I went away thinking well I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.410" end="00:36:50.590" style="s2">to do something impossible you see and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.350" end="00:36:52.420" style="s2">didn&#39;t see I had an idea about an</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.590" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">impossible structure with bridges and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.420" end="00:36:57.100" style="s2">roads and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:37:00.100" style="s2">so locally makes sense but as a whole it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.100" end="00:37:01.870" style="s2">was inconsistent and I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.100" end="00:37:04.030" style="s2">seen anything quite like that in his</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.870" end="00:37:06.460" style="s2">exhibition so I played around with this</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.030" end="00:37:09.220" style="s2">and then I sort of whittled it down to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.460" end="00:37:13.360" style="s2">the triangle which people refer to as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.220" end="00:37:15.370" style="s2">tribe are so it it&#39;s triangle which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.360" end="00:37:19.180" style="s2">locally a completely consistent picture</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.370" end="00:37:21.550" style="s2">but as a whole it&#39;s impossible and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.180" end="00:37:23.560" style="s2">showed this to my father and then he</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.550" end="00:37:25.410" style="s2">started drawing impossible buildings and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.560" end="00:37:29.100" style="s2">and then he came up with this staircase</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.410" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">so we decided we&#39;d like to write a paper</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.100" end="00:37:36.040" style="s2">together on this and we had no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:38.710" style="s2">the subject was I mean what Peter said</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.040" end="00:37:40.870" style="s2">the paper like this - what journal so he</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.710" end="00:37:42.230" style="s2">decided since he knew the editor of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.870" end="00:37:44.300" style="s2">British Journal of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.230" end="00:37:47.089" style="s2">and he thought he&#39;d be able to get it</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.300" end="00:37:49.820" style="s2">through we decided the subject with</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.089" end="00:37:52.310" style="s2">psychology of course is as you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.820" end="00:37:55.160" style="s2">not if it&#39;s more in a way mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.310" end="00:37:57.859" style="s2">because it&#39;s illustrates ideas well of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.160" end="00:37:59.990" style="s2">ecology and other things like that which</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.859" end="00:38:03.020" style="s2">which I didn&#39;t quite know I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.990" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">illustrating at the time but anyway we</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.020" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">wrote this paper and we gave some</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:14.300" style="s2">reference to a sure I think reference to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:16.490" style="s2">the catalog and my father sent a copy to</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.300" end="00:38:18.950" style="s2">a friend a Dutch friend IRS&#39;s and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.490" end="00:38:22.730" style="s2">managed to get it to Asia and then my</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.950" end="00:38:25.130" style="s2">father in Asia had a correspondence so</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.730" end="00:38:28.130" style="s2">that was this is Lionel Penrose Lana my</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.130" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">father Lana Penrose yes but I actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.130" end="00:38:35.480" style="s2">visited Esha Tennant and he had sent to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:39.079" style="s2">print to my father with the dedication</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.480" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">to it and he gave me another so I and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.079" end="00:38:45.650" style="s2">have in the body but in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:47.510" style="s2">ceremony Museum you see I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.650" end="00:38:50.150" style="s2">indebted to you for this for this reason</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.510" end="00:38:53.300" style="s2">because when I when I have to describe</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.150" end="00:38:55.220" style="s2">what general relativity is yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.300" end="00:38:57.770" style="s2">don&#39;t wish to lie the way everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.220" end="00:39:01.250" style="s2">lies I&#39;m gonna lie I&#39;m gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.770" end="00:39:03.770" style="s2">differently I say that you have to begin</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.250" end="00:39:06.609" style="s2">with four degrees of freedom and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.770" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">you have to put rulers and protractors</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.609" end="00:39:10.750" style="s2">into that system so that you can measure</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:13.970" style="s2">length and angle that gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.750" end="00:39:17.510" style="s2">miraculously to a derivative operator</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.970" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">that measures rise over run that rise is</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.510" end="00:39:22.040" style="s2">measured from a reference level those</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:24.859" style="s2">reference levels don&#39;t knit together and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.040" end="00:39:27.890" style="s2">they form Penrose stairs and the degree</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.859" end="00:39:29.510" style="s2">of Escher Nisour Penrose nests is what</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.890" end="00:39:31.849" style="s2">is measured by the curvature tensor</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.510" end="00:39:33.079" style="s2">which breaks into three pieces you throw</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.849" end="00:39:34.430" style="s2">one of them away called the viol</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.079" end="00:39:36.650" style="s2">curvature and you readjust the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.430" end="00:39:38.089" style="s2">proportions of the other two and you set</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.650" end="00:39:41.660" style="s2">that equal to the amount of stuff now</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.089" end="00:39:43.550" style="s2">that&#39;s a very long causal chain yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:45.560" style="s2">it is linguistically an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.550" end="00:39:48.410" style="s2">description of what general relativity</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.560" end="00:39:50.569" style="s2">actually is yeah well let&#39;s trace that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.410" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">it&#39;s also illustrates comb ology which I</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.569" end="00:39:54.619" style="s2">was being interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:56.010" style="s2">oh yeah years ago but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.619" end="00:39:58.350" style="s2">whether it&#39;s BBC I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.010" end="00:40:01.140" style="s2">was there was an interview was for some</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.350" end="00:40:03.480" style="s2">reason they were interested in twister</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.140" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">theory now they think they&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.480" end="00:40:06.870" style="s2">well they thought me well I guess they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:09.540" style="s2">heard that word I saw Brian and at one</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.870" end="00:40:11.850" style="s2">point they say well he surprisingly not</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.540" end="00:40:13.860" style="s2">in the beginning they asked me what what</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.850" end="00:40:16.740" style="s2">good it was you see what can you use it</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.860" end="00:40:18.630" style="s2">for so I said oh you can use it to solve</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.740" end="00:40:20.550" style="s2">Maxwell&#39;s equations you see then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.630" end="00:40:21.840" style="s2">equations of little Christian magnetism</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.550" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">and light and so they got a bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.840" end="00:40:26.490" style="s2">interested they said oh how do you do</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:28.290" style="s2">that well it actually involves an idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.490" end="00:40:30.630" style="s2">that I couldn&#39;t really explain here it</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.290" end="00:40:32.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible to you know in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.630" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">of popular talk about this no no what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.130" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">it exactly no no no I couldn&#39;t do it no</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:36.870" style="s2">what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:40.110" style="s2">it&#39;s an idea it&#39;s something called Combe</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.870" end="00:40:42.540" style="s2">ology no I could explain that so then I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.110" end="00:40:44.430" style="s2">went back at home and and I I was lying</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.540" end="00:40:45.840" style="s2">my brain I thought I think I can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.430" end="00:40:47.730" style="s2">know it&#39;s this impossible triangle</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.840" end="00:40:50.550" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly an illustration of karim</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.730" end="00:40:52.790" style="s2">ology so i went back the next day and</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.550" end="00:40:55.170" style="s2">told them that they weren&#39;t interested</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.790" end="00:40:58.350" style="s2">they didn&#39;t use it i think i may have</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.170" end="00:41:00.360" style="s2">tried to explain yes where you have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.350" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">look at something which is locally</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.360" end="00:41:04.920" style="s2">consistent right but with an ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:06.510" style="s2">about it so here the ambiguities you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.920" end="00:41:09.060" style="s2">not quite sure you draw a picture of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.510" end="00:41:10.830" style="s2">the ambiguity is that you don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.060" end="00:41:13.020" style="s2">far away it is it could be bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.830" end="00:41:17.400" style="s2">further away or smaller and closer and</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.020" end="00:41:20.250" style="s2">the picture is consistent but you get an</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.400" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">inconsistency if you go around right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.250" end="00:41:25.410" style="s2">locally because you have a freedom yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:26.430" style="s2">you misuse this freedom in a sense so</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.410" end="00:41:29.790" style="s2">the glitch in it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.430" end="00:41:32.370" style="s2">is this impossible structure well I I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.790" end="00:41:34.320" style="s2">had this so this is actually my son and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.370" end="00:41:37.380" style="s2">my 14 year old son&#39;s copy of that book</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.320" end="00:41:38.580" style="s2">yes and I was having to describe this to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.380" end="00:41:41.880" style="s2">him :</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.580" end="00:41:45.720" style="s2">what calm ology was and I said that one</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.880" end="00:41:48.870" style="s2">forms which is a piece of technology in</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.720" end="00:41:52.230" style="s2">mathematics that you can analogize to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.870" end="00:41:54.360" style="s2">radar guns so that while you&#39;re driving</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.230" end="00:41:55.860" style="s2">and the policeman shoots your car with</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.360" end="00:41:57.870" style="s2">the radar gun he&#39;s measuring the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.860" end="00:41:59.820" style="s2">component of speed in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.870" end="00:42:02.310" style="s2">his gun yeah and so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.820" end="00:42:04.950" style="s2">that eats the vector of speed and spits</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.310" end="00:42:10.080" style="s2">out a number and you could imagine it a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.950" end="00:42:12.150" style="s2">racetrack that wanted to have a circular</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.080" end="00:42:15.720" style="s2">series of radar guns to measure the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.150" end="00:42:18.510" style="s2">speed of cars going around now the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.720" end="00:42:21.060" style="s2">question is you also recognize that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.510" end="00:42:25.050" style="s2">could build a poor man&#39;s version of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.060" end="00:42:26.760" style="s2">speed system by heating the track to</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.050" end="00:42:29.010" style="s2">some temperature and measuring how</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.760" end="00:42:31.890" style="s2">quickly the temperature changes the car</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.010" end="00:42:34.170" style="s2">went over but you can&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.890" end="00:42:35.940" style="s2">the one thing that you want which is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.170" end="00:42:39.360" style="s2">series of radar guns that are always</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.940" end="00:42:41.970" style="s2">measuring the speed going around the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.360" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">track because at some point if the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.970" end="00:42:46.170" style="s2">temperature is going down down down down</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:47.790" style="s2">down down down then it&#39;s going to be ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.170" end="00:42:50.040" style="s2">degrees below where ever it started</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.790" end="00:42:52.200" style="s2">which is your paradox again yes well</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.040" end="00:42:54.180" style="s2">there&#39;s something nice example somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.200" end="00:42:56.280" style="s2">made an ignorant remember who were you a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.180" end="00:42:57.720" style="s2">company you have a ball going up the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.280" end="00:43:00.930" style="s2">stairs or down it which everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.720" end="00:43:03.660" style="s2">you accompany that with it with a a note</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.930" end="00:43:05.400" style="s2">going up or down and you can make it</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.660" end="00:43:06.810" style="s2">sound as though it keeps on going all</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.400" end="00:43:10.530" style="s2">the way up and all the way up all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.810" end="00:43:12.630" style="s2">time by the harmonics you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.530" end="00:43:14.850" style="s2">you how monican is you going right below</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.630" end="00:43:17.190" style="s2">with it yes yeah sub perceptual so</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.850" end="00:43:18.690" style="s2">there&#39;s this auditory illusion that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.190" end="00:43:20.040" style="s2">captures these yes you&#39;ve have an</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.690" end="00:43:21.450" style="s2">auditory version at the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.040" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">something had this ball bouncing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.450" end="00:43:25.950" style="s2">with that that&#39;s not me but that&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:27.660" style="s2">of a cheat you I mean my point would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.950" end="00:43:31.860" style="s2">that you&#39;re Escher stairs or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.660" end="00:43:34.710" style="s2">Penrose stairs are the the cheat is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.860" end="00:43:36.920" style="s2">it appears to be flat in other words</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.710" end="00:43:41.460" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to achieve that on a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.920" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">curved object but that what you did was</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.460" end="00:43:46.380" style="s2">to create the illusion as taking place</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">in a plane or where you can draw it in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.380" end="00:43:50.130" style="s2">it in a rectilinear system if you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:51.840" style="s2">an interpretation of a three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.130" end="00:43:53.580" style="s2">thing which put you in an ambiguous and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.840" end="00:43:55.980" style="s2">so you saw the movie Inception of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.580" end="00:44:00.750" style="s2">where they they realized this actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.980" end="00:44:04.710" style="s2">yes they have an obsession but that</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.750" end="00:44:07.230" style="s2">effect is the soul of the Aronoff Bohm</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.710" end="00:44:09.720" style="s2">effect which surprised the world in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.230" end="00:44:12.690" style="s2">late 50s because it was never so late</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.720" end="00:44:16.020" style="s2">into the game it is it is a common same</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.690" end="00:44:18.540" style="s2">sort of thing that&#39;s right well of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.020" end="00:44:21.570" style="s2">course like so many things people point</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.540" end="00:44:23.759" style="s2">out that this Oscar righteous father</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.570" end="00:44:26.519" style="s2">whose it was a Swedish artist had drawn</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.759" end="00:44:28.109" style="s2">things like this before ah I think round</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.519" end="00:44:30.959" style="s2">about the year I was born he had a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.109" end="00:44:33.059" style="s2">picture which is well with cubes going</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.959" end="00:44:34.229" style="s2">around it wasn&#39;t exactly the same but it</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.059" end="00:44:36.239" style="s2">was I&#39;ve said I think I&#39;ve seen these</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.229" end="00:44:37.589" style="s2">photos the one with the cube tears and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.239" end="00:44:41.130" style="s2">then he had versions with stairs</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.589" end="00:44:42.839" style="s2">staircases to never put an issue he</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.130" end="00:44:45.269" style="s2">never put any perspective in it which</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.839" end="00:44:46.619" style="s2">seemed to me that was a something missed</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.269" end="00:44:47.969" style="s2">opportunity yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.619" end="00:44:50.939" style="s2">no in my triangle I did put some</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.969" end="00:44:52.289" style="s2">perspective yeah so this slightly you</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.939" end="00:44:56.219" style="s2">can see but you can do it with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.289" end="00:44:59.729" style="s2">perspective and it still works so what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.219" end="00:45:01.559" style="s2">want to get at is I think also that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.729" end="00:45:04.949" style="s2">have this very funny thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.559" end="00:45:08.219" style="s2">recently starting from the early 70s</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.949" end="00:45:12.029" style="s2">where we started miss telling our own</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.219" end="00:45:14.099" style="s2">physics history because of the needs of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.029" end="00:45:16.829" style="s2">the community to look like we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.099" end="00:45:18.329" style="s2">succeeding when we weren&#39;t or we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.829" end="00:45:21.959" style="s2">succeeding at something different than</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.329" end="00:45:23.519" style="s2">we were trying to succeed at and in part</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.959" end="00:45:26.729" style="s2">one of the reasons that I want to use</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.519" end="00:45:28.349" style="s2">this podcast to discuss science is to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.729" end="00:45:31.409" style="s2">give alternate versions of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.349" end="00:45:33.089" style="s2">happened and I want to explore one or</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.409" end="00:45:35.939" style="s2">two of them with you now you and I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.089" end="00:45:37.859" style="s2">a very funny relationship which we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.939" end="00:45:40.109" style="s2">really know each other but you were</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.859" end="00:45:43.199" style="s2">quite close to Michael attea at various</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.109" end="00:45:44.699" style="s2">ways and I was we have graduate students</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.199" end="00:45:46.469" style="s2">together and say in the same grew the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.699" end="00:45:48.659" style="s2">same year absolutely the same year it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.469" end="00:45:50.159" style="s2">by the same supervisor incredible yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.659" end="00:45:51.959" style="s2">that&#39;s right and then you continue to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.159" end="00:45:55.769" style="s2">cross-pollinate ideas yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.959" end="00:45:58.019" style="s2">over the years yes for for listeners who</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.769" end="00:46:01.999" style="s2">don&#39;t know Michael attea was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.019" end="00:46:05.099" style="s2">absolutely most dominant and generative</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.999" end="00:46:07.679" style="s2">I don&#39;t even know what to call him like</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.099" end="00:46:09.389" style="s2">beyond genius a seer of type but he I</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.679" end="00:46:11.399" style="s2">said she had such a broad understanding</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.389" end="00:46:13.529" style="s2">of mathematics it&#39;s about me and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.399" end="00:46:15.389" style="s2">geometry more generally and analysis</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.529" end="00:46:17.699" style="s2">they were just incredible and algebra he</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.389" end="00:46:20.909" style="s2">wrote a book on on communitive algebra</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.699" end="00:46:24.329" style="s2">the now he had a partner</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.909" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">for much of his career Isidore singer</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.329" end="00:46:30.359" style="s2">who I was quite close to for a minute oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:32.069" style="s2">yeah and is was again another one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.359" end="00:46:33.479" style="s2">these figures that if I&#39;d never met one</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.069" end="00:46:35.990" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t know that the human mind was</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.990" end="00:46:42.589" style="s2">repeated insight and they came up with</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.430" end="00:46:45.740" style="s2">something called the Atia singer index</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.589" end="00:46:47.510" style="s2">theorem which governs worlds in which</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.740" end="00:46:49.880" style="s2">there are no time dimensions but only</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.510" end="00:46:51.500" style="s2">space dimensions or no space dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.880" end="00:46:54.380" style="s2">and only time dimensions but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.500" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">just equations without any differential</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.380" end="00:46:57.710" style="s2">equations the differential equation if</p>

<p begin="00:46:57.710" end="00:47:03.830" style="s2">is coming very often in three main</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.619" end="00:47:06.890" style="s2">fields of study elliptic hyperbolic and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.830" end="00:47:09.290" style="s2">parabolic then the idea is that wave</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.890" end="00:47:11.660" style="s2">equations would be hyperbolic the type</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.290" end="00:47:15.020" style="s2">that you&#39;re worried about in physics but</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:17.660" style="s2">things like soap films look like</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.020" end="00:47:19.880" style="s2">elliptic equations and a TN singer had</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.660" end="00:47:23.510" style="s2">this incredible insight into the nature</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.880" end="00:47:25.940" style="s2">of elliptic equations do you that so now</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.510" end="00:47:29.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve got an extremely general theorem</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.940" end="00:47:31.790" style="s2">which covers goes over all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.150" end="00:47:33.260" style="s2">different areas of mathematics and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.790" end="00:47:35.990" style="s2">it has applications well it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.260" end="00:47:38.300" style="s2">tells you that the the knotted nough</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.990" end="00:47:41.599" style="s2">some beautiful space that you might be</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.300" end="00:47:43.760" style="s2">exploring like some kind of high</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.599" end="00:47:45.589" style="s2">dimensional donut that&#39;s knotted many</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.589" end="00:47:51.980" style="s2">that that topological knotted miss tells</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.310" end="00:47:56.599" style="s2">you something about the kinds of waves</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.980" end="00:47:58.820" style="s2">that can dance on that space yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.599" end="00:48:03.530" style="s2">said it&#39;s a very remarkable theorem so</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.820" end="00:48:07.099" style="s2">it means does that theorem in the so</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.530" end="00:48:11.630" style="s2">called elliptic category world of space</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.099" end="00:48:14.810" style="s2">in no time let&#39;s say relate strongly in</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.630" end="00:48:17.030" style="s2">your estimation to the most important</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.810" end="00:48:19.160" style="s2">hyperbolic equations that govern the</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.160" end="00:48:23.240" style="s2">due to the constraints of relativity in</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.240" end="00:48:28.910" style="s2">dimensions well I can say if I used it</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.130" end="00:48:32.630" style="s2">there and at least two different</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.910" end="00:48:34.670" style="s2">continent contacts yes maybe more so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.630" end="00:48:37.099" style="s2">mean I&#39;m not an expert in that area at</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.670" end="00:48:39.589" style="s2">all and it was mainly when I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.099" end="00:48:40.940" style="s2">to solve a particular problem I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.589" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">know how much detail you want to go into</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.940" end="00:48:47.570" style="s2">these things it had to do with how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">make twister theory work in curved</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.570" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">spaces</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">but I ran up into a question which had</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:59.790" style="s2">to do it has to do with complex geometry</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:49:04.230" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got geometry in which instead</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.790" end="00:49:06.180" style="s2">of using real numbers to use you think</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.230" end="00:49:11.430" style="s2">of measuring with rulers say and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.180" end="00:49:13.369" style="s2">ruler is one dimensional the numbers go</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.430" end="00:49:15.270" style="s2">along one dimension if you like and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.369" end="00:49:17.640" style="s2">complex numbers where you have the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.270" end="00:49:20.070" style="s2">square root of minus one incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.640" end="00:49:22.500" style="s2">into the number system they&#39;re really a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.070" end="00:49:24.750" style="s2">two dimensional so the geometry of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.500" end="00:49:27.540" style="s2">complex numbers has twice as many as the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.750" end="00:49:31.290" style="s2">real numbers but the geometry of complex</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.540" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">numbers is particularly fascinating or</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.290" end="00:49:35.670" style="s2">nicely Al Jarreau you might see the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:37.560" style="s2">analysis or whatever it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.670" end="00:49:39.630" style="s2">particularly fascinating and I was sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.560" end="00:49:42.780" style="s2">of when I learned about this when I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.630" end="00:49:45.030" style="s2">at an undergraduate doing mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.780" end="00:49:48.030" style="s2">and I thought it was an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.030" end="00:49:52.550" style="s2">beautiful because when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.030" end="00:49:55.920" style="s2">real numbers you have you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.550" end="00:49:58.710" style="s2">draw curve which is a function so this</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.920" end="00:50:00.750" style="s2">this curve has some shape and you might</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.710" end="00:50:02.790" style="s2">want to see what is it a smooth curve</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.750" end="00:50:06.210" style="s2">that means you have a tangent direction</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.790" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">as you go around it maybe it jumps so</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.210" end="00:50:11.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not not even continuous but may be</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.920" end="00:50:13.020" style="s2">smooth or it may be you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.190" end="00:50:14.670" style="s2">curvature of this curve and you might</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.020" end="00:50:16.680" style="s2">might not be smooth enough to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.670" end="00:50:19.290" style="s2">curvature C so if there&#39;s one degree of</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.680" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">smoothness or two degrees or you or you</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.290" end="00:50:22.740" style="s2">can have three degrees or four degrees</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:26.099" style="s2">and they&#39;re all different or an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.740" end="00:50:27.960" style="s2">number of degrees or that you can expand</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.099" end="00:50:31.290" style="s2">your function in the power series</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.960" end="00:50:33.330" style="s2">they&#39;re all different and then we learn</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.290" end="00:50:35.000" style="s2">about complex you see all we now do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.330" end="00:50:39.500" style="s2">all over again and you&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.000" end="00:50:43.290" style="s2">analysis on algebra if you like geometry</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.500" end="00:50:46.109" style="s2">where thee it uses complex numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.290" end="00:50:49.140" style="s2">then suddenly you find that if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.109" end="00:50:50.810" style="s2">smooth everything comes with it you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.140" end="00:50:54.210" style="s2">differentiate as many times as you like</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.810" end="00:50:56.070" style="s2">you can expand as a power series and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.210" end="00:50:58.890" style="s2">thought ask incredibly magic you just</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.070" end="00:51:01.050" style="s2">have to do it once rather than is all</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.890" end="00:51:01.880" style="s2">Craig all these different kinds I should</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.050" end="00:51:05.810" style="s2">say the math</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.880" end="00:51:08.600" style="s2">petitions yes quite often view the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.810" end="00:51:11.720" style="s2">complex case the name the case of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.600" end="00:51:13.970" style="s2">complex numbers as the natural case yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.720" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">and the case of real numbers as</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.970" end="00:51:18.080" style="s2">artificially tortured yes which is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:21.290" style="s2">complete reversal from how most</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.080" end="00:51:24.620" style="s2">engineers yes and you have actually have</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.290" end="00:51:27.740" style="s2">been quite instrumental in making the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.620" end="00:51:30.140" style="s2">case for the fundamentally complex</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.740" end="00:51:33.770" style="s2">nature that it&#39;s not just an envy me</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.140" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">instead physics but that nature appears</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.770" end="00:51:40.010" style="s2">to be essentially complex I think you</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:43.430" style="s2">see by just hearing this nature of</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.010" end="00:51:46.070" style="s2">complex analysis right and how beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.430" end="00:51:47.450" style="s2">it struck me as being and I&#39;ve had this</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.070" end="00:51:49.820" style="s2">sort of feeling wouldn&#39;t they be</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.450" end="00:51:53.960" style="s2">wonderful if these numbers were somehow</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.820" end="00:51:55.700" style="s2">the basis of way physical world operates</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.960" end="00:51:57.830" style="s2">I have no reason to think that and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.700" end="00:52:00.380" style="s2">I learned about quantum mechanics and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.830" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">was amazed to find yeah there they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.380" end="00:52:05.270" style="s2">they&#39;re not just useful convenience you</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:07.250" style="s2">can use them to simplify ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.270" end="00:52:09.170" style="s2">mathematics you can you know might have</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.250" end="00:52:11.450" style="s2">an integral you would have to work</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.170" end="00:52:12.350" style="s2">awfully hard to get rid of yes but there</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.450" end="00:52:14.350" style="s2">are things you find it you&#39;re a little</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.350" end="00:52:16.790" style="s2">trick to do it now at least for me come</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.350" end="00:52:18.530" style="s2">with contour integrals and they drop us</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.790" end="00:52:20.060" style="s2">in an amazing way and I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.530" end="00:52:22.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a piece of magic but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.060" end="00:52:24.110" style="s2">tell you anything about the world it</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.100" end="00:52:25.970" style="s2">just tells you this is a neat way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.110" end="00:52:27.830" style="s2">doing things and then I learn about</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.970" end="00:52:29.690" style="s2">quantum mechanics and suddenly these</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.830" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">numbers they&#39;re right there at the basis</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.690" end="00:52:33.380" style="s2">of the whole subject and I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:35.930" style="s2">was an amazing thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.380" end="00:52:39.290" style="s2">maybe these complex numbers are really</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.930" end="00:52:40.730" style="s2">there at the root of everything I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.290" end="00:52:43.940" style="s2">think you wanted to talk about twisters</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.730" end="00:52:45.260" style="s2">and yeah yes yeah maybe I can intro that</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.940" end="00:52:47.170" style="s2">and then try to fit that into this</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.260" end="00:52:50.120" style="s2">history that I&#39;m claiming we don&#39;t tell</p>

<p begin="00:53:40.190" end="00:53:43.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we see slowly I could</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.720" end="00:53:45.590" style="s2">come to that in a minute because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.550" end="00:53:47.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting story the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.590" end="00:53:49.430" style="s2">these things sort of come together and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.570" end="00:53:51.080" style="s2">take many many years sometimes before</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.430" end="00:53:54.310" style="s2">they come together but I was really</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.080" end="00:53:59.780" style="s2">intrigued by these complex numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.310" end="00:54:02.890" style="s2">there is well something let me tell you</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.780" end="00:54:06.920" style="s2">we saw the origin of the twister idea I</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.890" end="00:54:11.000" style="s2">was struck by the fact that you see</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.920" end="00:54:14.180" style="s2">people know that that when things travel</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.000" end="00:54:18.650" style="s2">with a great speed and in in according</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.180" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">to Einstein special relativity they get</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.650" end="00:54:22.970" style="s2">sort of flattened in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:25.160" style="s2">motion now this is a way of talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.970" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">about it and you get this Lorentz</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.160" end="00:54:31.760" style="s2">contraction as its called</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:34.190" style="s2">now I was playing around with relativity</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.760" end="00:54:35.960" style="s2">and thinking about it was this two</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.190" end="00:54:38.300" style="s2">component spinners and thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.960" end="00:54:41.960" style="s2">the geometry of it worked and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.300" end="00:54:47.810" style="s2">if you think of the sky you see the sky</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.960" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">is is where you have vectors in four</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.810" end="00:54:53.090" style="s2">dimensions think of a vector or</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:56.150" style="s2">something which has it has a magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.090" end="00:54:58.580" style="s2">in the direction to it as well and into</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.150" end="00:55:00.830" style="s2">ordinary space you&#39;ve got this idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.580" end="00:55:03.080" style="s2">vector which is quite common people know</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.830" end="00:55:06.970" style="s2">about but when you&#39;re in four dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.080" end="00:55:09.950" style="s2">then you have space and time together</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.970" end="00:55:12.320" style="s2">but do you have particular vectors which</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.950" end="00:55:15.950" style="s2">are called null and these are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.320" end="00:55:17.510" style="s2">along the light-cone so these this is an</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.950" end="00:55:20.120" style="s2">ordinary vector might represent a</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.510" end="00:55:22.370" style="s2">velocity so you have a particle moving</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.120" end="00:55:24.010" style="s2">along with a certain speed and your</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.370" end="00:55:27.560" style="s2">four-dimensional vector would point</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.010" end="00:55:28.850" style="s2">along the velocity or the momentum of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.560" end="00:55:31.910" style="s2">that particle so</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.850" end="00:55:35.090" style="s2">weirdly in the space-time metric of</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.910" end="00:55:36.200" style="s2">Einstein yeah these are vectors that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.090" end="00:55:38.930" style="s2">not zero</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.200" end="00:55:41.000" style="s2">but if you used in Stein&#39;s special</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.930" end="00:55:43.970" style="s2">rulers and protractors what would the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.000" end="00:55:47.390" style="s2">length of these vectors a0 they would so</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.970" end="00:55:49.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a really it&#39;s a it&#39;s linguistically</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.390" end="00:55:51.350" style="s2">tricky to talk about these things</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.430" end="00:55:53.960" style="s2">because they&#39;re nonzero things that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.350" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">would be measured to be of zero length</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.960" end="00:56:02.690" style="s2">if that concept of length was in fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">yeah extended from your normal concept</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.690" end="00:56:05.510" style="s2">of length</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:08.840" style="s2">yes the idea that something of length</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.510" end="00:56:10.910" style="s2">zero means it&#39;s two points the distance</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.840" end="00:56:12.680" style="s2">between them is zero you think of them</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.910" end="00:56:14.060" style="s2">right on top of each other or if the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.680" end="00:56:15.860" style="s2">distance is very very small they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.060" end="00:56:17.630" style="s2">pretty close to each other but in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.860" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">kind of geometry will call it minkovski</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.630" end="00:56:21.460" style="s2">Jarmusch because although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:25.370" style="s2">describing Einstein&#39;s special relativity</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.460" end="00:56:27.410" style="s2">the gym geometry was not an stein people</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.370" end="00:56:29.570" style="s2">often say oh I&#39;m son introduces</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.410" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">four-dimensional space-time that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.570" end="00:56:35.960" style="s2">true it was makovski and Einstein I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:39.380" style="s2">I heard that this is real this is not</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.960" end="00:56:43.130" style="s2">just a sort of a weird artifact of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.380" end="00:56:44.330" style="s2">description of various processes that</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.130" end="00:56:46.610" style="s2">were being gonna test yes but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.330" end="00:56:50.630" style="s2">kind of geometry and Mackowski showed</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.610" end="00:56:53.630" style="s2">that the the space of special relativity</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.630" end="00:56:55.750" style="s2">is really four dimensional and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.630" end="00:56:58.790" style="s2">kind of geometry in which you can have</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.750" end="00:57:00.230" style="s2">distances which is zero although the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.790" end="00:57:03.980" style="s2">points are a sort of long way away from</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.230" end="00:57:07.700" style="s2">each other and this represents a light</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.980" end="00:57:10.580" style="s2">ray so you have one event say and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.700" end="00:57:12.890" style="s2">light through that reaches another event</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.580" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">when I say event I mean not just a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.890" end="00:57:18.440" style="s2">special position but the time as well so</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:20.750" style="s2">you mean a position in space-time</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.440" end="00:57:22.910" style="s2">space-time so you need four coordinates</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.750" end="00:57:25.250" style="s2">three space in one time coordinate so</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.910" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what we call an event and so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.250" end="00:57:30.620" style="s2">have a point or an event in space-time</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:33.380" style="s2">and imagine a particle moving with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.620" end="00:57:36.140" style="s2">speed of light to another such event now</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.380" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">the distance between those two in these</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.140" end="00:57:42.010" style="s2">kind of geometry that minkovski</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:43.390" style="s2">introduced is zero so and he</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.010" end="00:57:45.190" style="s2">we played around with different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.390" end="00:57:48.070" style="s2">geometry and he realized that special</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.190" end="00:57:50.860" style="s2">relativity is really best described by</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.070" end="00:57:53.800" style="s2">this kind of what we call minkovski in</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.860" end="00:57:56.560" style="s2">geometry so you can have zero distances</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.800" end="00:57:57.190" style="s2">and yet the points are not on top of</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.560" end="00:58:00.130" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.190" end="00:58:02.680" style="s2">so your idea was to take all the points</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.130" end="00:58:04.840" style="s2">that are bizarrely zero just that&#39;s away</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.680" end="00:58:08.710" style="s2">and then make those the new points in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.840" end="00:58:10.600" style="s2">new space it wasn&#39;t quite that I have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.710" end="00:58:14.440" style="s2">come up to this slowly because it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.600" end="00:58:18.190" style="s2">took years but the initial idea isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.440" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">hard to understand really you see if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.190" end="00:58:23.950" style="s2">look out at the sky what do you see when</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:26.650" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing light rays or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.950" end="00:58:28.870" style="s2">seeing photons coming to your eye which</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.650" end="00:58:30.790" style="s2">have traveled with the speed of light so</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.870" end="00:58:35.350" style="s2">the world line in four dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.790" end="00:58:38.230" style="s2">that photon is tilted over at what</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.350" end="00:58:42.910" style="s2">represents the speed of light now in</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.230" end="00:58:44.770" style="s2">this Minkowski geometry that distance</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.910" end="00:58:48.730" style="s2">has a clear meaning so let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.770" end="00:58:51.240" style="s2">give that the supposedly the photon is</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.730" end="00:58:54.010" style="s2">emitted at one point when event and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.240" end="00:58:57.640" style="s2">received at another event now to that</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.010" end="00:59:00.460" style="s2">photon the time between one and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.640" end="00:59:02.770" style="s2">other is zero and that time measure is</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.460" end="00:59:04.510" style="s2">exactly the distance measure in</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.770" end="00:59:06.190" style="s2">Minkowski geometry suppose the particle</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.510" end="00:59:08.410" style="s2">was not traveling the speed of light</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.190" end="00:59:12.360" style="s2">suppose it traveled with half a speed of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.410" end="00:59:15.850" style="s2">light or some other speed then its time</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.360" end="00:59:17.740" style="s2">experience of time is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.850" end="00:59:20.500" style="s2">distance according to minkowski&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.740" end="00:59:22.210" style="s2">geometry so you say if it travels with</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.500" end="00:59:25.330" style="s2">very very very great speed suppose you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.210" end="00:59:28.750" style="s2">travel to a planet which is 4 light</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.330" end="00:59:30.700" style="s2">years away and you travel with but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.750" end="00:59:32.860" style="s2">won&#39;t do the calculation right here me</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.700" end="00:59:35.770" style="s2">with half the speed of light then you</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.860" end="00:59:38.650" style="s2">would the experience that you would of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.770" end="00:59:40.600" style="s2">time you experience is less than the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.650" end="00:59:43.180" style="s2">time that somebody here on earth would</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.600" end="00:59:46.330" style="s2">think that it took you to get there so</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.180" end="00:59:49.390" style="s2">as you travel faster you your experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.330" end="00:59:51.220" style="s2">of the passage of time or slows down in</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.390" end="00:59:53.380" style="s2">a sense you don&#39;t think it&#39;s as long and</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.220" end="00:59:55.570" style="s2">if you actually travel the speed of</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.380" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">light that experience would be zero</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.570" end="00:59:59.650" style="s2">so this is the experience of the length</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:01.360" style="s2">of time if you add weight you could have</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.650" end="01:00:04.630" style="s2">a very very good clock you carry with</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.360" end="01:00:06.520" style="s2">you and you see how what clock made of</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.630" end="01:00:08.170" style="s2">pure light it all gets pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.520" end="01:00:09.730" style="s2">heavy out here well you don&#39;t make you</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.170" end="01:00:12.100" style="s2">know you can measure the clock</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.730" end="01:00:13.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a a nuclear clock or something and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.100" end="01:00:15.190" style="s2">you&#39;re not traveling with the speed of</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.510" end="01:00:17.560" style="s2">light because you can&#39;t get this before</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.190" end="01:00:21.130" style="s2">but the time measured by that nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.560" end="01:00:22.330" style="s2">clock would be the distance in Minkoff I</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.130" end="01:00:26.790" style="s2">should point out just for our listeners</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.330" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">yes even people who do this field of</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.790" end="01:00:31.990" style="s2">differential geometry morning noon and</p>

<p begin="01:00:37.540" end="01:00:41.680" style="s2">because it just it breaks your head it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:43.840" style="s2">a very difficult different intuition</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.680" end="01:00:45.730" style="s2">very different when you go back and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.840" end="01:00:47.580" style="s2">think about the puzzles that people had</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.730" end="01:00:49.840" style="s2">when Einstein right introduced his</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.580" end="01:00:52.690" style="s2">special and most particularly general</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.840" end="01:00:54.040" style="s2">relativity they found it very puzzling</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.690" end="01:00:55.690" style="s2">you could see look at the arguments</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.040" end="01:00:57.940" style="s2">people that well we keep using these</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.690" end="01:01:00.700" style="s2">words like yeah I&#39;m and length and all</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.940" end="01:01:02.920" style="s2">of these things that have become we</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.700" end="01:01:05.830" style="s2">don&#39;t recognize that in that one</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.920" end="01:01:07.240" style="s2">innocent decision to break off one</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.830" end="01:01:07.810" style="s2">degree of freedom and treat it</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.240" end="01:01:10.830" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.810" end="01:01:12.970" style="s2">that&#39;s right that all of our linguistic</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.830" end="01:01:13.480" style="s2">intuition goes out yeah what&#39;s that all</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.970" end="01:01:15.670" style="s2">over again</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.480" end="01:01:17.770" style="s2">yeah well it was a curious experience I</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.670" end="01:01:22.030" style="s2">had because I was giving a series of</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.770" end="01:01:24.280" style="s2">lectures and see after all these were</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.030" end="01:01:28.420" style="s2">the but our lectures given in what was</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.280" end="01:01:31.180" style="s2">it they forget exactly what the dates</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.420" end="01:01:33.130" style="s2">were maybe this roundabout nine nineteen</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.180" end="01:01:35.050" style="s2">seventy or something like that and there</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.130" end="01:01:37.510" style="s2">was a collection of mathematicians in</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.050" end="01:01:40.060" style="s2">the collection physicists John Wheeler</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.510" end="01:01:42.370" style="s2">and Cecile DeWitt had organized this it</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.060" end="01:01:45.850" style="s2">was a very interesting meeting well</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.370" end="01:01:47.320" style="s2">people from both areas of expertise were</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.850" end="01:01:48.840" style="s2">brought together and at that time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.320" end="01:01:50.620" style="s2">hard to believe now but at that time</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.840" end="01:01:53.200" style="s2">mathematicians and physicists were</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.620" end="01:01:55.120" style="s2">barely talking to each other and they</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.200" end="01:01:58.960" style="s2">got me to give us this series of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.120" end="01:02:03.940" style="s2">lectures and I decide you for Jim Simons</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:05.860" style="s2">and CN yang get together and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.940" end="01:02:07.570" style="s2">good question when was that I am billing</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.860" end="01:02:08.480" style="s2">seventy five seventy say it was before</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.570" end="01:02:10.609" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.480" end="01:02:11.990" style="s2">I&#39;m listening before that&#39;s it right I</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.609" end="01:02:16.070" style="s2">think so yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.990" end="01:02:17.990" style="s2">I really have to have my memories dates</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.070" end="01:02:19.490" style="s2">it&#39;s not like if you&#39;ll I know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.990" end="01:02:23.240" style="s2">you&#39;re hot on the on the trail of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.490" end="01:02:26.150" style="s2">but just 211 something in Roman Jack Eve</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.240" end="01:02:27.410" style="s2">at MIT once beautifully said um</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.150" end="01:02:30.910" style="s2">and he&#39;d I don&#39;t think I wrote it down</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.410" end="01:02:33.290" style="s2">he said we used we didn&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.910" end="01:02:35.300" style="s2">partnership that was possible between</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.290" end="01:02:38.330" style="s2">mathematics and physics because we the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.300" end="01:02:40.670" style="s2">physicists used to talk to the analysts</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.330" end="01:02:42.920" style="s2">and he said the analyst either told us</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.670" end="01:02:45.500" style="s2">things that were absolutely trivial and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.920" end="01:02:47.780" style="s2">irrelevant or things that we already yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.500" end="01:02:50.270" style="s2">he said when we talked to the geometers</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.780" end="01:02:53.350" style="s2">we started to learn new things that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.270" end="01:02:56.660" style="s2">never considered yes well it was very</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.350" end="01:02:58.880" style="s2">much cross-fertilization there but I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.660" end="01:03:00.619" style="s2">going to say I gave his lectures that I</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.880" end="01:03:02.570" style="s2">think it was twelve lectures and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.619" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">wasted my time on something some weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.570" end="01:03:08.500" style="s2">going to and said I&#39;d left myself only</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:11.390" style="s2">three lectures to describe the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.500" end="01:03:13.340" style="s2">singularities the black hole idea which</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.390" end="01:03:15.859" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the term black hole wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.340" end="01:03:17.510" style="s2">useless then but the collapse you just</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.859" end="01:03:18.920" style="s2">called the Schwarzschild singulars well</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.510" end="01:03:20.869" style="s2">it was called the singularity when it</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.920" end="01:03:22.700" style="s2">that was the thing people called it the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.869" end="01:03:25.250" style="s2">swatch of singularity which what we now</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.700" end="01:03:29.630" style="s2">call a horizon right and I remember on</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.250" end="01:03:32.570" style="s2">my third lecture from the end describing</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.630" end="01:03:34.520" style="s2">the basically what we call a black hole</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.570" end="01:03:38.450" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about the Schwarz singularity</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.520" end="01:03:40.040" style="s2">and I was explaining that the Z it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.450" end="01:03:43.310" style="s2">basically to do with a zero link</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.040" end="01:03:45.230" style="s2">business and and steen rod was a very</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.310" end="01:03:47.390" style="s2">distinguished mathematician he was</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.230" end="01:03:49.070" style="s2">Princeton Norman steerer no yeah and he</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.390" end="01:03:51.100" style="s2">had written this book on five abundance</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.070" end="01:03:54.320" style="s2">which is absolutely impenetrable</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.100" end="01:03:55.910" style="s2">impenetrable but also fundamental to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.320" end="01:03:58.520" style="s2">subject yes but it&#39;s so impenetrable</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.910" end="01:03:59.840" style="s2">that I never got to the point but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.520" end="01:04:01.190" style="s2">he was there at the back of the room and</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.840" end="01:04:03.770" style="s2">I remember telling Moses and he was</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.190" end="01:04:06.260" style="s2">absolutely dumbfounded they see you</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.770" end="01:04:08.210" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s a real expert at this</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.260" end="01:04:10.490" style="s2">kind of german romanian geometry when he</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.210" end="01:04:13.580" style="s2">would call it where you have the notion</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.490" end="01:04:15.619" style="s2">of when the distance is a small then the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.580" end="01:04:17.660" style="s2">points are close together and here you</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.619" end="01:04:20.240" style="s2">have this other kind of geometry and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.660" end="01:04:21.849" style="s2">intuition you need for that geometry was</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:23.469" style="s2">completely foreign as</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.849" end="01:04:25.660" style="s2">point you were just making well because</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.469" end="01:04:27.309" style="s2">yeah we do have this weird way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.660" end="01:04:29.109" style="s2">talking about something that sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.309" end="01:04:31.930" style="s2">this we might call it like non hausdorff</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.109" end="01:04:35.380" style="s2">topology but it is a hausdorff topology</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.930" end="01:04:38.529" style="s2">yes but it is it&#39;s it&#39;s so the problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.380" end="01:04:40.869" style="s2">is is it&#39;s pulling apart two different</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.529" end="01:04:42.910" style="s2">notions of the word close that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.869" end="01:04:45.430" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s right because you think</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.910" end="01:04:47.229" style="s2">of close means a small distance right so</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.430" end="01:04:49.420" style="s2">you imagine a little tiny ball where the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.229" end="01:04:51.999" style="s2">distance from that point is it was more</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.420" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">you know mathematics makes you pay for</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.999" end="01:04:56.469" style="s2">every attempt to sort of intuitively</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:04:59.319" style="s2">encode something that isn&#39;t precise</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.469" end="01:05:02.410" style="s2">we&#39;ve been discussing the fact that this</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.319" end="01:05:06.069" style="s2">intuition is very very strange involving</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.410" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">how to think about spaces of the type</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.069" end="01:05:11.309" style="s2">that Einstein and minkovski and Pangkor</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.079" end="01:05:15.039" style="s2">a were considering yes how does that</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.309" end="01:05:17.349" style="s2">begin to lead us towards these more</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.039" end="01:05:19.989" style="s2">speculative ideas of yours surrounding</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.349" end="01:05:22.749" style="s2">complex numbers and the twister program</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.989" end="01:05:24.430" style="s2">I don&#39;t think many people many many of</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.749" end="01:05:26.259" style="s2">them may have heard of it but even in</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.430" end="01:05:28.390" style="s2">even in mathematic you have to know that</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.259" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">you got you were sort of seen as leaving</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.390" end="01:05:32.920" style="s2">a cult it had its own newsletter its own</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:34.719" style="s2">bizarre drawings it was very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.920" end="01:05:36.940" style="s2">to communicate to members of the twister</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.719" end="01:05:39.160" style="s2">cult because they didn&#39;t speak like</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.940" end="01:05:43.209" style="s2">other people well we had this twisted</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.160" end="01:05:46.749" style="s2">newsletter which was a it started off by</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.209" end="01:05:49.539" style="s2">it&#39;s just in handwriting and it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.749" end="01:05:51.279" style="s2">duplicated and then that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.539" end="01:05:54.309" style="s2">that for the moment are very good talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.279" end="01:05:55.420" style="s2">about the basic the origin of twisters</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.309" end="01:05:58.809" style="s2">here if you like how where did it come</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.420" end="01:06:02.549" style="s2">from it was really in fact your big bet</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.809" end="01:06:04.869" style="s2">in physics do you think yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.549" end="01:06:06.489" style="s2">well you see it&#39;s between that and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.869" end="01:06:08.559" style="s2">cosmology but the cosmology a bit</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.489" end="01:06:11.650" style="s2">different because it not such okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.559" end="01:06:14.349" style="s2">a wild idea yeah but it&#39;s not a whole</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.650" end="01:06:16.479" style="s2">body of wild ideas which twist a theorem</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.349" end="01:06:18.459" style="s2">or is all right</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.479" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">but it has lots of connections with</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.459" end="01:06:22.509" style="s2">mathematics as pure mathematics and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">connections with physics let me describe</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.509" end="01:06:27.729" style="s2">the basis of it because I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.640" end="01:06:31.449" style="s2">got most of the things we need you see</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.729" end="01:06:34.299" style="s2">the light-cone describes how from one</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.449" end="01:06:35.260" style="s2">point or one event in space-time all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.299" end="01:06:37.660" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.260" end="01:06:38.859" style="s2">points of zero distance from it or</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.660" end="01:06:45.160" style="s2">another with all the light rays from</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.859" end="01:06:47.020" style="s2">that point now let me think about it the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.160" end="01:06:48.970" style="s2">other way around that is my past light</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.020" end="01:06:50.740" style="s2">cone so I&#39;m sitting at a certain point</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.970" end="01:06:54.010" style="s2">in space-time and I look out at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.740" end="01:06:57.310" style="s2">universe and all the light rays that get</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.010" end="01:07:02.530" style="s2">to me as a particular instant moment of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.310" end="01:07:05.410" style="s2">my time come along this path like her so</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.530" end="01:07:07.540" style="s2">that&#39;s imagine this kind of stretching</p>

<p begin="01:07:07.540" end="01:07:13.780" style="s2">bigger as it goes back in time and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.550" end="01:07:16.270" style="s2">that&#39;s all the events which are in one</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.780" end="01:07:18.670" style="s2">moment of my time I was I see those</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.270" end="01:07:22.690" style="s2">events so I see a lot of stars in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.670" end="01:07:24.310" style="s2">sky now let&#39;s suppose that I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.690" end="01:07:26.350" style="s2">stars and sky look like points you see</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.310" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">so that you have the sphere the</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.350" end="01:07:31.750" style="s2">celestial sphere which is my field of</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:33.400" style="s2">vision if I&#39;m imagining myself out in so</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.750" end="01:07:35.470" style="s2">imagine that the earth was transparent</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.400" end="01:07:37.540" style="s2">so you weren&#39;t that&#39;s one way oh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.470" end="01:07:40.869" style="s2">go out into space then I guess I can be</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.540" end="01:07:43.060" style="s2">looking at the world all around me now</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.869" end="01:07:45.790" style="s2">let&#39;s imagine that another astronaut</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.060" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">comes whizzing past me at nearly the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.790" end="01:07:51.040" style="s2">speed of light and just as we passed</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:53.490" style="s2">each other he looks he or she looks out</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.040" end="01:07:56.200" style="s2">at the sky at the same moment as I do</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.490" end="01:08:00.570" style="s2">now because of a phenomenon known as</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.200" end="01:08:03.520" style="s2">aberration the Stars will be slightly</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.570" end="01:08:08.800" style="s2">not in the same place with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.520" end="01:08:11.740" style="s2">that astronaut as me this guy is</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.800" end="01:08:14.650" style="s2">somewhat distorted but it&#39;s distorted in</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.740" end="01:08:18.819" style="s2">a very particular way which is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.650" end="01:08:20.470" style="s2">called conformal a way say this in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.819" end="01:08:22.270" style="s2">simple way suppose I happen to see a</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.470" end="01:08:26.460" style="s2">configuration of stars that happened to</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.270" end="01:08:26.460" style="s2">me on a circle suppose they work</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.569" end="01:08:32.980" style="s2">encyclopédie these in a circle even</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.540" end="01:08:35.020" style="s2">though the transformation would not be a</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.980" end="01:08:36.580" style="s2">rotation of the sphere sky would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.020" end="01:08:39.009" style="s2">squashed up more on one end and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.580" end="01:08:41.020" style="s2">stretched out on the other end but the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.009" end="01:08:42.779" style="s2">thing about that transformation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.020" end="01:08:46.210" style="s2">something which I knew about from my</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.779" end="01:08:48.699" style="s2">complex analysis days do you think of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.210" end="01:08:52.749" style="s2">the what&#39;s called the Riemann sphere</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.699" end="01:08:54.819" style="s2">this is the plane of points it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.749" end="01:08:58.509" style="s2">complex plane or the vessel plane are</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.819" end="01:09:01.869" style="s2">the point at play the points represent</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.509" end="01:09:03.159" style="s2">the complex numbers so zero is in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.869" end="01:09:03.639" style="s2">middle if you like and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.159" end="01:09:06.429" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.639" end="01:09:09.039" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got minus one and I and</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.429" end="01:09:10.979" style="s2">minus I are all on the circle and you go</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.039" end="01:09:14.079" style="s2">out and infinity is way out to infinity</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.979" end="01:09:16.679" style="s2">but the Riemann sphere folds all this up</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.079" end="01:09:19.539" style="s2">into a sphere so infinity is now point</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.679" end="01:09:21.130" style="s2">just a little bit like if you have a if</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.539" end="01:09:24.009" style="s2">you have a caramel coating around an</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.130" end="01:09:26.769" style="s2">apple you&#39;re folding that you&#39;ve wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.009" end="01:09:29.400" style="s2">around us and at the point where the</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.769" end="01:09:32.409" style="s2">stick would go into the Apple all of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.400" end="01:09:34.599" style="s2">boundary of that candy would come</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.409" end="01:09:36.549" style="s2">together yes and it&#39;s what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.599" end="01:09:38.949" style="s2">stereographic projection you can project</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.549" end="01:09:41.170" style="s2">from the North Pole and all the other</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.949" end="01:09:42.579" style="s2">points flatten out into the plane so you</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.170" end="01:09:44.259" style="s2">can see all the points on the sphere</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.579" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">except for the point from which your</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.259" end="01:09:47.859" style="s2">project exactly and that&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:49.839" style="s2">stereographic projection and it has this</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.859" end="01:09:52.389" style="s2">remarkable property that it sends</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.839" end="01:09:54.400" style="s2">circles to circles or you could say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.389" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">conformal that is angles are preserved</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.400" end="01:09:58.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very beautiful transform a</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:02.170" style="s2">used to play around with these things</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.360" end="01:10:06.369" style="s2">just for fun of them now the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.170" end="01:10:09.969" style="s2">that the transformations of this sphere</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.369" end="01:10:12.880" style="s2">to itself which preserve the angles is</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.969" end="01:10:14.889" style="s2">also transformation which is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.880" end="01:10:19.300" style="s2">called analytic or column holomorphic</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.889" end="01:10:22.059" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the most smooth transformation</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.300" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">you can have so just the analog of</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.059" end="01:10:26.769" style="s2">smooth but free complex objects rather</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:28.599" style="s2">than real objects and where real and</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.769" end="01:10:31.030" style="s2">complex means the types of numbers yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.599" end="01:10:34.090" style="s2">that&#39;s right so it&#39;s search what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.030" end="01:10:35.829" style="s2">smooth is and complex analysis and those</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.090" end="01:10:38.679" style="s2">transformations which send the sphere</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.829" end="01:10:39.369" style="s2">the sphere are exactly those in</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.679" end="01:10:43.479" style="s2">relativity</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.369" end="01:10:45.099" style="s2">so the different observers passing me at</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.479" end="01:10:48.809" style="s2">different speeds looking at the same sky</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.099" end="01:10:53.409" style="s2">the map from my sky to their skies is</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.809" end="01:10:56.769" style="s2">exactly these complex transformations of</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.409" end="01:10:58.630" style="s2">the sphere and this actually is what you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.769" end="01:11:00.350" style="s2">exactly get when you use two component</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.630" end="01:11:02.780" style="s2">spinners and you see the description</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.350" end="01:11:04.850" style="s2">when you move from one observer to</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.780" end="01:11:07.550" style="s2">another is exactly those ones which</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.850" end="01:11:11.390" style="s2">transform the sky in this conformal way</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.550" end="01:11:13.100" style="s2">to itself and often people find this</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.390" end="01:11:15.680" style="s2">puzzling I find it puzzling recently</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.100" end="01:11:19.010" style="s2">because suppose you had a sphere which</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.680" end="01:11:21.680" style="s2">is whizzing you know an alien spaceship</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.010" end="01:11:23.750" style="s2">which is a sphere shooting past you at</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.680" end="01:11:25.520" style="s2">nearly the speed of light well you see</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.750" end="01:11:28.070" style="s2">the direction of motion it will be</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:29.450" style="s2">contracted by the Lorentz contraction so</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.070" end="01:11:32.420" style="s2">when you look at it you should see it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.450" end="01:11:34.310" style="s2">sort of flattened out you don&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.420" end="01:11:35.840" style="s2">a sphere goes a circle goes to a circle</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.310" end="01:11:38.390" style="s2">if you see it as a circle when it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.840" end="01:11:40.010" style="s2">moving you&#39;ll still see it as a circle</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.390" end="01:11:42.800" style="s2">and the boundary of a thing will look</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.010" end="01:11:44.930" style="s2">like a circle which is moving and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.800" end="01:11:46.490" style="s2">work away and think about it well you</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.930" end="01:11:48.140" style="s2">see where the light waves go and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.490" end="01:11:49.850" style="s2">front of it in the back of it and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.140" end="01:11:51.800" style="s2">see really you don&#39;t see the flattening</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.850" end="01:11:53.930" style="s2">it really it doesn&#39;t look like it like I</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.800" end="01:11:58.150" style="s2">said a circle its boundary looks like a</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.930" end="01:12:00.440" style="s2">circle so I wrote a paper on this almost</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.150" end="01:12:04.430" style="s2">simultaneously there wasn&#39;t somebody</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.440" end="01:12:10.120" style="s2">else wrote a paper mainly thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.430" end="01:12:11.870" style="s2">the small circles and spheres but this</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.120" end="01:12:13.850" style="s2">transformation that was really what</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.870" end="01:12:17.000" style="s2">started me off if I understand correctly</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.850" end="01:12:20.240" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t yeah we have another</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.000" end="01:12:22.940" style="s2">mutual acquaintance a friend Raul Bhat</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.240" end="01:12:25.730" style="s2">and yes he showed us that the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.940" end="01:12:28.190" style="s2">seems to repeat every eight dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.730" end="01:12:30.020" style="s2">in a certain way but during the first</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.190" end="01:12:33.110" style="s2">cycle of what you might call baat</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.020" end="01:12:34.310" style="s2">periodicity from zero to seven or one to</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.110" end="01:12:35.990" style="s2">eight depending upon how you like the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.310" end="01:12:38.810" style="s2">cat yeah yeah you get these things</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.990" end="01:12:42.140" style="s2">called low dimensional coincidences oh</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.810" end="01:12:43.490" style="s2">yes and so that that they don&#39;t recur</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.140" end="01:12:45.440" style="s2">because of your point earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.490" end="01:12:47.510" style="s2">spinners that spinners grow yes</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.440" end="01:12:51.080" style="s2">exponentially whereas vectors grow</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.510" end="01:12:52.640" style="s2">linearly that&#39;s right and but during the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.080" end="01:12:55.250" style="s2">first period where these things are of</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.640" end="01:12:59.120" style="s2">comparable strength yes you&#39;ve get all</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.250" end="01:13:01.160" style="s2">of these objects where depending upon</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.120" end="01:13:03.200" style="s2">you define in two different contexts you</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.160" end="01:13:05.060" style="s2">turn out to be the same object that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.200" end="01:13:08.300" style="s2">not are you&#39;re making use of that here</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.060" end="01:13:10.430" style="s2">it is that it&#39;s the well the Lawrence</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.300" end="01:13:13.129" style="s2">group we&#39;re like you know that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.430" end="01:13:16.039" style="s2">rotations of space and time</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.129" end="01:13:18.169" style="s2">which we might call so1 three or so1</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.039" end="01:13:21.199" style="s2">three double cover would be equal to</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.169" end="01:13:23.090" style="s2">something else called SL to see which</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.199" end="01:13:24.559" style="s2">would mention complex numbers even</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.090" end="01:13:27.439" style="s2">though there&#39;s no complex numbers to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.559" end="01:13:29.030" style="s2">seen in space and time yeah it depends</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.439" end="01:13:32.149" style="s2">on that that one of those coincidences</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.030" end="01:13:35.989" style="s2">what&#39;s triple coincidence I think you</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.149" end="01:13:38.989" style="s2">said answer which one is depending upon</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.989" end="01:13:42.369" style="s2">in this description but the point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.989" end="01:13:46.159" style="s2">making here is that in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.369" end="01:13:47.989" style="s2">relativity is described when you do it</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.159" end="01:13:50.419" style="s2">in the two spinner form which is really</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.989" end="01:13:52.280" style="s2">expressed in this fact that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.419" end="01:13:56.149" style="s2">transformation of the Riemann sphere to</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.280" end="01:13:58.639" style="s2">itself which is a complex transformation</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.149" end="01:14:00.260" style="s2">this is the most general transformation</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.639" end="01:14:02.899" style="s2">of the sphere to itself when you think</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.260" end="01:14:06.379" style="s2">of that sphere as a Riemann sphere so</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.899" end="01:14:08.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a complex one-dimensional space you</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.379" end="01:14:09.289" style="s2">might say surely it&#39;s two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.030" end="01:14:11.719" style="s2">well it&#39;s two-dimensional in real</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.289" end="01:14:13.639" style="s2">numbers but one-dimensional and complex</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.719" end="01:14:16.519" style="s2">numbers because the complex each complex</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.639" end="01:14:17.689" style="s2">number us carries the information of two</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.519" end="01:14:19.429" style="s2">real number so for example</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.689" end="01:14:21.229" style="s2">mathematicians would call what most</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.429" end="01:14:23.809" style="s2">people call the complex plane they might</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.229" end="01:14:25.820" style="s2">call it a complex line it&#39;s complex line</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.809" end="01:14:28.189" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah and so the language</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.820" end="01:14:29.869" style="s2">again is intended to make things very</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.189" end="01:14:32.119" style="s2">hostile to the newbie</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.869" end="01:14:33.439" style="s2">yes right that&#39;s true but you have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.119" end="01:14:36.139" style="s2">get used to the idea that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.439" end="01:14:38.090" style="s2">thinking complex when you think of it</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.139" end="01:14:39.800" style="s2">sort of really sort of concretely in in</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.090" end="01:14:41.269" style="s2">their real terms</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.800" end="01:14:43.399" style="s2">that you have to double the number of</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.269" end="01:14:45.559" style="s2">real dimensions to get the number of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.399" end="01:14:46.999" style="s2">complex but I want my audience laugh but</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.559" end="01:14:50.209" style="s2">I don&#39;t want them to feel stupid for</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.999" end="01:14:53.260" style="s2">making the mistake every one person you</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.209" end="01:14:56.539" style="s2">have the number of good so we have the</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.260" end="01:14:58.129" style="s2">complex numbers playing a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.539" end="01:15:00.079" style="s2">role in relativity that&#39;s the really</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.129" end="01:15:03.139" style="s2">point I wanna make and it&#39;s the complex</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.079" end="01:15:06.939" style="s2">sphere so the Riemann sphere which is</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.139" end="01:15:10.129" style="s2">this one-dimensional in in complex sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.939" end="01:15:13.369" style="s2">two-dimensional in the real sense object</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.129" end="01:15:16.369" style="s2">which is fundamental now this Riemann</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.369" end="01:15:20.109" style="s2">sphere appears in the most basic way in</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.369" end="01:15:23.149" style="s2">quantum mechanics to you think of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.109" end="01:15:27.260" style="s2">spin now that&#39;s the practically in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.149" end="01:15:29.250" style="s2">most direct conflict the most direct</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.260" end="01:15:30.900" style="s2">quantum-mechanical thing in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.250" end="01:15:33.210" style="s2">sense where you see quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.900" end="01:15:36.810" style="s2">playing a real role as quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.210" end="01:15:38.910" style="s2">which is hard to grasp normally but you</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.810" end="01:15:41.790" style="s2">can see it here is the geometry really</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.910" end="01:15:44.700" style="s2">works you see if you have an object of</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.790" end="01:15:47.610" style="s2">spin 1/2 that&#39;s the smallest nonzero</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.700" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">spin you can have such an electron so</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.610" end="01:15:54.090" style="s2">think of an electron it has been half</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:57.660" style="s2">now what that means is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.090" end="01:16:00.090" style="s2">basically two states of spin which</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.660" end="01:16:02.160" style="s2">people call spin up and spin down well</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.090" end="01:16:04.440" style="s2">what does that mean right hey put your</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.160" end="01:16:05.610" style="s2">thumb up like they&#39;re right-handed spin</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.440" end="01:16:09.360" style="s2">is where your fingers go</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.610" end="01:16:12.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s spin up means right hand is</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.360" end="01:16:13.800" style="s2">about up spin down is right hand is</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.120" end="01:16:16.320" style="s2">about down oh that&#39;s left-handed about</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.800" end="01:16:18.090" style="s2">that and those are the two basic states</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.320" end="01:16:20.250" style="s2">but what&#39;s special about up and down</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.090" end="01:16:22.650" style="s2">nothing so you think of what about right</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.250" end="01:16:25.200" style="s2">left forwards backwards all those are</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.650" end="01:16:27.750" style="s2">combinations of up and down and there</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.200" end="01:16:31.170" style="s2">are complex combinations through these</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.750" end="01:16:33.300" style="s2">complex numbers which lie at the basis</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.170" end="01:16:35.970" style="s2">of quantum mechanics but here you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.300" end="01:16:39.630" style="s2">see in a visual way what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.970" end="01:16:42.000" style="s2">you see you can say up down what&#39;s left</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.630" end="01:16:45.090" style="s2">and right where these are combinations</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.000" end="01:16:48.210" style="s2">have up and down so you add this much of</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.090" end="01:16:51.180" style="s2">up to that much of down and you get to</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.210" end="01:16:53.130" style="s2">the to the right right and and you - it</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.180" end="01:16:55.260" style="s2">you get to the left or I times you get</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.130" end="01:16:58.920" style="s2">forwards about whatever it is and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.260" end="01:17:00.750" style="s2">complex numbers come in to describe</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.920" end="01:17:04.710" style="s2">these possible directions of spin and</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.750" end="01:17:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the Riemann sphere again so you but</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.710" end="01:17:08.070" style="s2">you were relating these complex numbers</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.240" end="01:17:10.320" style="s2">of quantum mechanics do the directions</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.070" end="01:17:13.700" style="s2">in space so you have a connection</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.320" end="01:17:16.020" style="s2">between these rather abstract numbers</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.700" end="01:17:18.030" style="s2">which are fundamental to quantum</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.020" end="01:17:20.220" style="s2">mechanics and the much more concrete</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.030" end="01:17:24.780" style="s2">picture of the directions in space Wells</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.220" end="01:17:27.840" style="s2">but Roger I think you&#39;re both well let</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.780" end="01:17:29.940" style="s2">me be challenge you slightly go on yes</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.840" end="01:17:32.520" style="s2">what you&#39;re really talking about is a</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.940" end="01:17:36.480" style="s2">very important fork in the road for</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.520" end="01:17:39.150" style="s2">physics do you wet yourself to the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.480" end="01:17:40.290" style="s2">that we&#39;re actually given and you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.150" end="01:17:41.850" style="s2">Mach was famous</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.290" end="01:17:44.850" style="s2">for having said this phrase the world is</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.850" end="01:17:46.860" style="s2">given only once and so we happen to know</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.850" end="01:17:48.480" style="s2">that there does exist a world that</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.860" end="01:17:51.630" style="s2">appears to be well modeled by three</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.480" end="01:17:53.490" style="s2">spatial in one temporal dimension that</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.630" end="01:17:56.790" style="s2">and then the key question is do you wish</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.490" end="01:17:59.130" style="s2">to have a more general theory which it</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.790" end="01:18:02.160" style="s2">works in all dimensions or which works</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.130" end="01:18:03.570" style="s2">for all different divisions between how</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.160" end="01:18:05.730" style="s2">many spatial on how many temporal</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.570" end="01:18:07.770" style="s2">dimensions and what I see you is having</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.730" end="01:18:11.790" style="s2">done which I think is incredibly noble</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.770" end="01:18:16.490" style="s2">brave and scientifically valid is to</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.790" end="01:18:19.290" style="s2">work with mathematics that are really</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.290" end="01:18:24.720" style="s2">we&#39;re given rather than sort of keeping</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.290" end="01:18:25.440" style="s2">some kind of I mean like you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.720" end="01:18:27.870" style="s2">married</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.440" end="01:18:29.820" style="s2">to the world we live in in a way that</p>

<p begin="01:18:29.820" end="01:18:33.900" style="s2">wishing to keep their options open I</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.800" end="01:18:37.980" style="s2">think you&#39;ve hit on a very crucial point</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.900" end="01:18:39.270" style="s2">absolutely right I mean for example with</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.980" end="01:18:42.990" style="s2">string theory know that people talk</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.270" end="01:18:44.820" style="s2">about 26 dimensions or 10 spatial</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.990" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">Dermott or 11 or 12 and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.820" end="01:18:49.820" style="s2">and sure the mathematics we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:52.740" style="s2">mathematics to handle these things and</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.820" end="01:18:53.280" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s important the way the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.740" end="01:18:55.620" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.280" end="01:18:58.050" style="s2">but I was never attracted by that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.620" end="01:18:59.850" style="s2">for basically two reasons one was the</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.050" end="01:19:02.220" style="s2">reason I&#39;m just trying to subscribe here</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.850" end="01:19:06.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.220" end="01:19:07.740" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for a way in which you find</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.000" end="01:19:11.130" style="s2">the mathematics to describe the world</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.740" end="01:19:13.980" style="s2">which is very particular to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.130" end="01:19:17.150" style="s2">dimensionality we see so the three space</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.980" end="01:19:20.280" style="s2">dimensions and one time dimension is</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.150" end="01:19:22.530" style="s2">described in this formalism very</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.280" end="01:19:24.120" style="s2">directly and if you&#39;re going to try and</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.530" end="01:19:25.800" style="s2">talk about other numbers of dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.120" end="01:19:27.840" style="s2">of space and time it doesn&#39;t work well</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.800" end="01:19:29.040" style="s2">as much as I really like to stick it to</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.840" end="01:19:31.530" style="s2">the string theorist</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.040" end="01:19:34.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not exactly their problem</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.530" end="01:19:37.140" style="s2">either because 26 is really because</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.080" end="01:19:38.910" style="s2">that&#39;s two more than 24 and 10 is really</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.140" end="01:19:40.410" style="s2">because it&#39;s two more than eight and an</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.910" end="01:19:42.720" style="s2">eight you have something special called</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.410" end="01:19:46.200" style="s2">try ality yes and so what they were</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.720" end="01:19:47.760" style="s2">really doing was figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.200" end="01:19:51.720" style="s2">build different theories around</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.760" end="01:19:53.010" style="s2">different highly specific targets but</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.720" end="01:19:55.890" style="s2">you see there it&#39;s the beaut</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.010" end="01:20:00.480" style="s2">mathematics which sure well is a good</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.890" end="01:20:01.980" style="s2">guide but it has to be leaving with any</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.480" end="01:20:04.440" style="s2">reason they never grow up to playing</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.980" end="01:20:08.070" style="s2">with reality that&#39;s the sort of thing I</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.440" end="01:20:09.660" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s perfectly good to explore</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.070" end="01:20:12.840" style="s2">all these different things and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.660" end="01:20:14.880" style="s2">valuable but I&#39;m trying to follow a</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.840" end="01:20:17.610" style="s2">route which is viewed I think in many</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.880" end="01:20:21.870" style="s2">quarters is very narrow I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.610" end="01:20:23.910" style="s2">a route which is work specifically for</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.870" end="01:20:27.960" style="s2">the number of space-time dimensions that</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.910" end="01:20:29.520" style="s2">we have and is if I&#39;m there aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.960" end="01:20:31.590" style="s2">Twister theory which do work in other</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.520" end="01:20:34.440" style="s2">dimensions but they run out very quickly</p>

<p begin="01:23:11.040" end="01:23:17.280" style="s2">yes it is only in low dimensions where</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.300" end="01:23:19.770" style="s2">you get to play the game with what are</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.280" end="01:23:21.300" style="s2">called deformation complexes where the</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.770" end="01:23:23.700" style="s2">first term is the symmetry is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.300" end="01:23:25.770" style="s2">problem the second term is the fields or</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.700" end="01:23:27.750" style="s2">the waves and the problem and the third</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.770" end="01:23:29.520" style="s2">term is the equations and the problem</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.750" end="01:23:32.130" style="s2">and then you get to cut it off at that</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.520" end="01:23:35.100" style="s2">point and have that be with this magical</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.130" end="01:23:39.420" style="s2">concept of an elliptic complex so for</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.100" end="01:23:41.370" style="s2">example in dimension 4 we gleaned</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.420" end="01:23:43.080" style="s2">something bizarre which is that there an</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.370" end="01:23:45.330" style="s2">infinite number of different ways to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.080" end="01:23:46.740" style="s2">calculus in four-dimensional space and</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.330" end="01:23:48.240" style="s2">only one way to do it in every other</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.740" end="01:23:50.100" style="s2">dimension yes yes well there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.240" end="01:23:52.950" style="s2">special they are about for certainly</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.100" end="01:23:54.720" style="s2">that&#39;s true and the connections maybe</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.950" end="01:23:57.180" style="s2">not that clear at the moment but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.720" end="01:23:59.070" style="s2">we will see that this is it may be</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.180" end="01:24:00.960" style="s2">differentiable structures are more of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.070" end="01:24:03.900" style="s2">part of physics it&#39;s it&#39;s quite possible</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.960" end="01:24:05.430" style="s2">how amazing that yeah I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.900" end="01:24:08.070" style="s2">another very bizarre one I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.430" end="01:24:10.650" style="s2">whether this has ever come up if you</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.070" end="01:24:13.170" style="s2">have two sets of symmetries known as Li</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.650" end="01:24:18.409" style="s2">groups that act transitively</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.170" end="01:24:20.780" style="s2">on the same sphere in usual position</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.409" end="01:24:23.179" style="s2">then either their intersection acts</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.780" end="01:24:27.380" style="s2">transitively on that sphere or the</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.179" end="01:24:28.610" style="s2">dimension of that sphere is 15 and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.380" end="01:24:30.290" style="s2">believe that the intersection of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.610" end="01:24:33.080" style="s2">groups looks like the electro strong</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.290" end="01:24:34.850" style="s2">group so it&#39;s very close to the particle</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.080" end="01:24:37.489" style="s2">spectrum of theoretical physics yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.850" end="01:24:40.760" style="s2">pulled out of nowhere just from talking</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.489" end="01:24:43.850" style="s2">about severe transitive grouping well</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.760" end="01:24:45.500" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that one I mean in particle</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.850" end="01:24:47.810" style="s2">physics I mean I&#39;ve never really been</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.500" end="01:24:50.719" style="s2">somebody who studied particle physics</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.810" end="01:24:53.270" style="s2">closely is that right I didn&#39;t know well</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.719" end="01:24:56.239" style="s2">I mean in general where I have but but I</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.270" end="01:24:57.710" style="s2">suppose I felt we&#39;re maybe a long way</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.239" end="01:25:00.920" style="s2">from really understanding what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.710" end="01:25:03.170" style="s2">on there I don&#39;t know I mean I hope I</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.920" end="01:25:05.300" style="s2">hope that it wasn&#39;t that well you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.170" end="01:25:07.820" style="s2">we have no it&#39;s a completely I often</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.300" end="01:25:10.130" style="s2">have although different views from one</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.820" end="01:25:13.070" style="s2">of these things I think we&#39;re almost at</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.130" end="01:25:14.330" style="s2">the end well that&#39;s an interesting scene</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.070" end="01:25:16.580" style="s2">so how do you come to the idea that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.330" end="01:25:17.920" style="s2">may be quite far I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.580" end="01:25:20.270" style="s2">we&#39;re necessarily far I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.920" end="01:25:24.440" style="s2">understanding why the groups are the</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.270" end="01:25:25.790" style="s2">groups that we see and people have</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.440" end="01:25:27.469" style="s2">different theories about these let me</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.790" end="01:25:31.670" style="s2">ask you then a couple of questions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.469" end="01:25:33.739" style="s2">go on so very early in this new</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.670" end="01:25:39.440" style="s2">stagnation post the standard model</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.739" end="01:25:42.679" style="s2">people like Glashow and george i and</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.440" end="01:25:47.949" style="s2">patty and salam put forward these</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.679" end="01:25:50.179" style="s2">unifying symmetries that remain very odd</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.949" end="01:25:53.389" style="s2">because they&#39;re so attractive and</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.179" end="01:25:55.760" style="s2">powerful the the prettiest of them being</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.389" end="01:25:57.770" style="s2">something called spin ten which</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.760" end="01:26:02.090" style="s2">physicists persist in calling s o ten</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.770" end="01:26:04.010" style="s2">for reasons that escape me yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.090" end="01:26:06.050" style="s2">this is the one which doesn&#39;t exist or</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.010" end="01:26:10.929" style="s2">is that not that one well the original</p>

<p begin="01:26:10.929" end="01:26:15.650" style="s2">was disproven in its most basic form and</p>

<p begin="01:26:23.780" end="01:26:28.850" style="s2">think that they sort of rushed to commit</p>

<p begin="01:26:29.770" end="01:26:35.430" style="s2">maybe if I worked in the subject</p>

<p begin="01:26:53.400" end="01:26:57.270" style="s2">these groups of what they are and so on</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.140" end="01:26:58.590" style="s2">let me not talk about it because I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="01:27:13.770" end="01:27:17.220" style="s2">which needs to be explored here hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.360" end="01:27:21.840" style="s2">been explored the things we did at one</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.220" end="01:27:23.400" style="s2">time I&#39;m sort of deviating a bit from</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.840" end="01:27:25.830" style="s2">the general trend but there was a</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.400" end="01:27:27.660" style="s2">question of how we trate trate how we</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.830" end="01:27:31.020" style="s2">treat massive particles in twister</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.660" end="01:27:33.780" style="s2">theory and naturally twister theory</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.020" end="01:27:35.160" style="s2">describes massless things things go</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.780" end="01:27:36.030" style="s2">along the light-cone and that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.160" end="01:27:39.240" style="s2">things with others because you</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.030" end="01:27:41.370" style="s2">privileged the like owns it yeah then</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.240" end="01:27:44.700" style="s2">the treatment of particles that were</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.370" end="01:27:47.010" style="s2">massless got a privileged treatment</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.700" end="01:27:50.160" style="s2">privileged treatment and not just that</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.010" end="01:27:52.250" style="s2">you find transformations there is a way</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.160" end="01:27:54.420" style="s2">of representing the Maxwell equations</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.250" end="01:27:56.970" style="s2">this is the thing that was mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.420" end="01:28:00.240" style="s2">about the TV program way of describing</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.970" end="01:28:02.340" style="s2">the Maxwell equations which you get out</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.240" end="01:28:05.430" style="s2">of twister theory and it comes directly</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.340" end="01:28:08.040" style="s2">out then what about the Dirac equation</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.430" end="01:28:09.780" style="s2">you want to talk about massive particles</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.040" end="01:28:14.520" style="s2">well then where it seems to lead you as</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.780" end="01:28:17.070" style="s2">you think of the we see a massive</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.520" end="01:28:20.090" style="s2">particle has a momentum that which is</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.070" end="01:28:23.280" style="s2">time like so points within the cone and</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.090" end="01:28:26.040" style="s2">one way you can describe a time like one</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.280" end="01:28:27.540" style="s2">is think of to look no one soar to light</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.040" end="01:28:30.360" style="s2">like one so you think of a zig zag</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.540" end="01:28:32.190" style="s2">so it&#39;s got a zig and a zag and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.360" end="01:28:33.360" style="s2">one convenient way Jake or you might</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.190" end="01:28:34.320" style="s2">have one which is made of three</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.360" end="01:28:37.080" style="s2">zigzagged</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.320" end="01:28:40.260" style="s2">dog something like that and you can get</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.080" end="01:28:41.670" style="s2">at the time like line out of so you can</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.260" end="01:28:43.380" style="s2">build it up from different primitive</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.670" end="01:28:45.390" style="s2">that&#39;s right so the argument is that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.380" end="01:28:46.469" style="s2">have a twister for each of these zigs</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.390" end="01:28:48.000" style="s2">and zags</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.469" end="01:28:51.300" style="s2">and so you have might have two of them</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.000" end="01:28:52.620" style="s2">you might have three of them and you see</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.300" end="01:28:54.180" style="s2">how many of them give you the same</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.620" end="01:28:55.830" style="s2">amount and then you get these groups in</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.180" end="01:28:57.960" style="s2">twisted theory and these groups look</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.830" end="01:29:02.070" style="s2">like the particle physics groups so you</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.960" end="01:29:04.590" style="s2">get su 2 and su 3 and the idea we has oh</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.070" end="01:29:06.960" style="s2">well that&#39;s the basis for these parties</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.590" end="01:29:11.670" style="s2">so su 2 doesn&#39;t impress me much because</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.960" end="01:29:13.710" style="s2">it&#39;s ubiquitous but su 3 is a very nice</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.670" end="01:29:16.140" style="s2">on you this is the the group that</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.710" end="01:29:19.110" style="s2">represents the strong force then holds</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.140" end="01:29:23.219" style="s2">our yeah well you see there&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.110" end="01:29:27.180" style="s2">that su 3 gives you this gate you can</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.219" end="01:29:29.070" style="s2">gauge it so you have there is a</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.180" end="01:29:31.830" style="s2">difference between the su 2 and the su 3</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.070" end="01:29:33.270" style="s2">that that the quantum chromodynamics if</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.830" end="01:29:36.420" style="s2">you like which is the theory which comes</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.270" end="01:29:38.820" style="s2">from gauging su 3 is a genuine gauge</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.420" end="01:29:45.180" style="s2">theory but when you try and do it for su</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.820" end="01:29:47.850" style="s2">to the left for the electrons and we can</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.180" end="01:29:49.440" style="s2">weak weak isospin you either gauging it</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.850" end="01:29:52.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really work because you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.440" end="01:29:54.060" style="s2">better special it&#39;s not the full group</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.350" end="01:29:56.070" style="s2">so on so there&#39;s something funny about</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.060" end="01:29:58.500" style="s2">it okay and there are other theories</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.070" end="01:29:59.640" style="s2">which might be a more promising way to</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.500" end="01:30:02.520" style="s2">go let&#39;s not go into that because this</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.640" end="01:30:05.489" style="s2">is all guessing but the idea is that you</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.520" end="01:30:07.949" style="s2">could develop a particle physics using</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.489" end="01:30:09.840" style="s2">many twisters gonna have it in in other</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.949" end="01:30:13.260" style="s2">words if I&#39;m not misunderstanding you</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.840" end="01:30:14.160" style="s2">the idea is that the extra data I mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.260" end="01:30:16.410" style="s2">we have a problem</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.160" end="01:30:19.020" style="s2">in the standard model yeah in that we</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.410" end="01:30:21.510" style="s2">have effectively a an origin story with</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.020" end="01:30:23.310" style="s2">two gods there&#39;s the god of Einstein</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.510" end="01:30:25.949" style="s2">that gives us space and time and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.310" end="01:30:28.400" style="s2">there&#39;s this other god that gives us su</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.949" end="01:30:31.020" style="s2">3 cross su 2 cross u 1 which give us the</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.400" end="01:30:32.400" style="s2">non-gravitational forces and all of</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.020" end="01:30:34.500" style="s2">these particle properties we call</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.400" end="01:30:40.500" style="s2">quantum numbers and this has no</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.500" end="01:30:42.449" style="s2">connection to the space and time data</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.500" end="01:30:44.280" style="s2">well that&#39;s the sort of thing yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.449" end="01:30:46.380" style="s2">it looks as though it&#39;s quite separate I</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.280" end="01:30:49.080" style="s2">mean they must be tied up at some stage</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.380" end="01:30:51.210" style="s2">but we haven&#39;t got to that but the idea</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.080" end="01:30:53.130" style="s2">here was to try and do it via twisters</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.210" end="01:30:55.020" style="s2">well I&#39;m just trying to say that we had</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.130" end="01:30:57.360" style="s2">we were got very excited about this for</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.020" end="01:30:59.580" style="s2">a while and then it was a long time ago</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.360" end="01:31:01.800" style="s2">because when people discovered</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.580" end="01:31:03.630" style="s2">come I think it was charming to suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.800" end="01:31:06.500" style="s2">this didn&#39;t fits and so we gave up at</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.630" end="01:31:10.770" style="s2">level and so by charm you mean the the</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.500" end="01:31:13.350" style="s2">addition of entirely separate versions</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.770" end="01:31:15.300" style="s2">of the familiar family of matter so we</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.350" end="01:31:17.610" style="s2">now think we have three copies of matter</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.300" end="01:31:19.170" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re the second two are repeated</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.610" end="01:31:20.250" style="s2">at higher mass get that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.170" end="01:31:22.680" style="s2">yes yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.250" end="01:31:25.170" style="s2">and so people go I mean it didn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.680" end="01:31:27.840" style="s2">so simple at that point so and various</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.170" end="01:31:30.270" style="s2">things didn&#39;t seem to fit so well but I</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.840" end="01:31:32.670" style="s2">think we should go back to that from the</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.270" end="01:31:35.700" style="s2">insights that going from general</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.670" end="01:31:37.080" style="s2">relativity I mean there&#39;s a long story</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.700" end="01:31:43.830" style="s2">which should be probably hard to</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.080" end="01:31:45.930" style="s2">describe here but the construction see</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.830" end="01:31:49.680" style="s2">Twista theory starts off as a theory</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.930" end="01:31:52.050" style="s2">about space flat space-time that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.680" end="01:31:54.060" style="s2">bothers me about it exactly and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.050" end="01:32:00.180" style="s2">what bothers a lot of people when you</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.060" end="01:32:04.410" style="s2">see very good company that I was at the</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.180" end="01:32:06.510" style="s2">time at the University of Texas for a</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.410" end="01:32:08.640" style="s2">year and this Alfred shield had put a</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.510" end="01:32:11.280" style="s2">lot of people together who were relative</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.640" end="01:32:12.600" style="s2">general relativity experts hoping that</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.280" end="01:32:15.840" style="s2">something would come out of it I guess</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.600" end="01:32:18.600" style="s2">and I had an office next to angle about</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.840" end="01:32:20.300" style="s2">cooking we might learn a lot from</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.600" end="01:32:25.500" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.300" end="01:32:28.380" style="s2">and on the other side I had an office it</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.500" end="01:32:33.420" style="s2">was Roy curse office and Ray Sachs was</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.380" end="01:32:35.370" style="s2">all the way down and I have to backtrack</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.420" end="01:32:39.720" style="s2">because the question is where did where</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.370" end="01:32:41.400" style="s2">did Twista theory come from now I had a</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.720" end="01:32:43.350" style="s2">lots and lots of ideas that I was trying</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.400" end="01:32:46.110" style="s2">to fit together part of these were</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.350" end="01:32:47.730" style="s2">trying to combine the Riemann sphere of</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.110" end="01:32:50.160" style="s2">relativity with the Rema sphere of</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.730" end="01:32:52.230" style="s2">quantum mechanics and various other</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.160" end="01:32:54.930" style="s2">mathematical ideas which come into</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.230" end="01:32:56.610" style="s2">quantum field theory and I they were</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.930" end="01:32:58.200" style="s2">sort of floating around and I remember</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.610" end="01:33:00.390" style="s2">drawing a big piece of paper with all</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.200" end="01:33:03.810" style="s2">these ideas which were roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.390" end="01:33:05.550" style="s2">of the nature that the world we see is</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.810" end="01:33:08.220" style="s2">described by real numbers but sort of</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.550" end="01:33:11.070" style="s2">hiding behind it is a world of complex</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.220" end="01:33:14.010" style="s2">numbers and they somehow</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.070" end="01:33:17.160" style="s2">control this world of real numbers so</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.010" end="01:33:19.140" style="s2">the dynamics is somehow controlled by</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.160" end="01:33:22.350" style="s2">the way the complex numbers work this</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.140" end="01:33:24.570" style="s2">was a vague thought I had and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.350" end="01:33:27.360" style="s2">think of a picture in which you added</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.570" end="01:33:30.989" style="s2">you see space-time has four dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.360" end="01:33:32.340" style="s2">and I needed to add basically one more</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.989" end="01:33:35.160" style="s2">dimension because I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.340" end="01:33:37.230" style="s2">incorporate the idea again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.160" end="01:33:40.200" style="s2">difficult to describe these things on a</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.230" end="01:33:42.570" style="s2">sort of popular program but it was an</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.200" end="01:33:45.090" style="s2">idea fundamental to quantum field theory</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.570" end="01:33:47.010" style="s2">which has to do with splitting your</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.090" end="01:33:49.590" style="s2">field amplitudes into positive and</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.010" end="01:33:51.630" style="s2">negative frequencies and it&#39;s a anger</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.590" end="01:33:53.670" style="s2">birth had been pressed upon me that this</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.630" end="01:33:55.290" style="s2">was very fundamental to quantum field</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.670" end="01:33:58.260" style="s2">theory most people weren&#39;t stressing it</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.290" end="01:33:59.670" style="s2">at that time and the way to think about</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.260" end="01:34:02.400" style="s2">this is think of the Riemann sphere</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.670" end="01:34:04.739" style="s2">again and you have the equator of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.400" end="01:34:06.930" style="s2">Riemann sphere describing the real</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.739" end="01:34:10.140" style="s2">numbers together with an infinity and</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.930" end="01:34:12.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this complex numbers on one</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.140" end="01:34:14.460" style="s2">side and one Hemisphere and what&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.630" end="01:34:17.400" style="s2">the other hamster and the ones which are</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.460" end="01:34:19.410" style="s2">positive frequency which is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.400" end="01:34:23.220" style="s2">fundamental thing for quantum field</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.410" end="01:34:24.720" style="s2">theory extend into 1/2 so this to me was</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.220" end="01:34:27.180" style="s2">a very beautiful way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.720" end="01:34:28.950" style="s2">it rather than splitting everything into</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.180" end="01:34:30.570" style="s2">Fourier components and taking taking</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.950" end="01:34:32.130" style="s2">half of them and that was seen to me you</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.570" end="01:34:34.950" style="s2">have four degrees of freedom with one</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.130" end="01:34:37.050" style="s2">extra real degree of freedom one extra</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.950" end="01:34:39.420" style="s2">dimension like the Riemann sphere going</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.050" end="01:34:41.730" style="s2">from the you have to the whole sphere</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.420" end="01:34:43.800" style="s2">yeah and I wanted it to divide it in two</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.730" end="01:34:45.690" style="s2">halves yeah and that was the picture I</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.800" end="01:34:47.700" style="s2">wanted and you tried to do the</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.690" end="01:34:49.920" style="s2">space-time it doesn&#39;t work was first my</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.700" end="01:34:51.630" style="s2">space-time is four-dimensional and if</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.920" end="01:34:53.280" style="s2">you complexified say dimensional that</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.630" end="01:34:57.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t divide into this just something</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.280" end="01:35:01.950" style="s2">else so I I knew that wasn&#39;t right okay</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.480" end="01:35:05.040" style="s2">now I was in Austin Texas I had friends</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.950" end="01:35:08.430" style="s2">in Dallas now this was the year in which</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.040" end="01:35:11.160" style="s2">Kennedy was assassinated and my friends</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.430" end="01:35:13.680" style="s2">in Dallas were to dinner and it was the</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.160" end="01:35:15.720" style="s2">next place that Kennedy was to go to and</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.680" end="01:35:17.310" style="s2">he was going to give a speech and they</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.720" end="01:35:20.160" style="s2">all got worried because he didn&#39;t turn</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.310" end="01:35:22.920" style="s2">up and they were generally quite right</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.160" end="01:35:25.340" style="s2">to be worried because he&#39;d been shot</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.920" end="01:35:27.810" style="s2">and this was a great shock to us all and</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.340" end="01:35:30.720" style="s2">so we decided we wanted to count myself</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.810" end="01:35:32.430" style="s2">down and wins a trip to trip from Austin</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.720" end="01:35:35.550" style="s2">where I was and Dallas where the others</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.430" end="01:35:38.460" style="s2">were and we went off in a few cars to</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.550" end="01:35:40.770" style="s2">San Antonio and maybe to the coast and</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.460" end="01:35:44.370" style="s2">this was to try and recover from the</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.770" end="01:35:46.380" style="s2">shock and coming back that all the women</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.370" end="01:35:49.710" style="s2">folk wanted to gossip and so on and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.380" end="01:35:50.820" style="s2">was with pish-tosh part he was a nice</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.710" end="01:35:54.510" style="s2">fellow I liked him a lot</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.820" end="01:35:56.190" style="s2">and garyun but he didn&#39;t speak much so</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.510" end="01:35:57.840" style="s2">well there are others when to gossip and</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.190" end="01:36:00.030" style="s2">I was sort of left over and we with the</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.840" end="01:36:04.170" style="s2">two of us went in the car driving back</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.030" end="01:36:06.930" style="s2">to Austin and so I had a nice silent</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.170" end="01:36:10.890" style="s2">drive coming back and I started to think</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.930" end="01:36:12.780" style="s2">about these constructions that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.890" end="01:36:15.060" style="s2">already and he was in Dallas at the time</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.780" end="01:36:17.340" style="s2">an English fellow who lived in Dallas</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.060" end="01:36:19.500" style="s2">and he constructed these solutions of</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.340" end="01:36:23.280" style="s2">the Maxwell equations which had this</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.500" end="01:36:25.230" style="s2">curious twist in them and I understood</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.280" end="01:36:27.090" style="s2">these things and I realized that they</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.230" end="01:36:30.750" style="s2">were described by as you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.090" end="01:36:33.180" style="s2">the hops map are they Clifford parallels</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.750" end="01:36:35.550" style="s2">these are you can think of a sphere in</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.180" end="01:36:36.900" style="s2">four dimensions three dimensions clear</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.550" end="01:36:40.260" style="s2">four dimensions and you have these</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.900" end="01:36:42.470" style="s2">circles which fill the whole space no</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.260" end="01:36:45.960" style="s2">two intersect and they every to link</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.470" end="01:36:47.660" style="s2">beautiful configuration and I realized</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.960" end="01:36:49.710" style="s2">that this was the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.660" end="01:36:52.770" style="s2">geometrically described these solutions</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.710" end="01:36:56.210" style="s2">that IRA had found and I tried to think</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.770" end="01:37:04.500" style="s2">about this and I thought well okay these</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.210" end="01:37:06.210" style="s2">sort of describe well the way I&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.500" end="01:37:08.700" style="s2">had to fit all of us to think of it</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.210" end="01:37:10.320" style="s2">think of a light ray yeah and then you</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.700" end="01:37:12.570" style="s2">think of all the light rays which meet</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.320" end="01:37:14.130" style="s2">that light ray so you&#39;ve got a one light</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.570" end="01:37:16.320" style="s2">ray and all the other slight trace was</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.130" end="01:37:19.110" style="s2">metered and that family of light ray is</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.320" end="01:37:22.290" style="s2">you can have Maxwell&#39;s solutions and max</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.110" end="01:37:24.300" style="s2">which point along those rays so what he</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.290" end="01:37:27.300" style="s2">did this was his trick you move that</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.300" end="01:37:31.170" style="s2">light ray into the complex so you add a</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.300" end="01:37:33.720" style="s2">complex number to thee to two extra</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.170" end="01:37:35.340" style="s2">dimensions well it pushes the light ray</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.720" end="01:37:38.639" style="s2">into the complex</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.340" end="01:37:39.869" style="s2">then you can construct this twisting you</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.639" end="01:37:41.520" style="s2">don&#39;t see the light ray anymore</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.869" end="01:37:43.889" style="s2">expression to the complex but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.520" end="01:37:46.440" style="s2">still got the complex family of light</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.889" end="01:37:48.000" style="s2">rays which meet it in a certain sense so</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.440" end="01:37:49.650" style="s2">I try to understand what that looks like</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.000" end="01:37:51.360" style="s2">and I thought this is yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.650" end="01:37:53.540" style="s2">pushing something into the complex and</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.360" end="01:37:55.650" style="s2">you describe it by means of this</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.540" end="01:37:58.260" style="s2">complicated twisting family of right</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.650" end="01:37:59.580" style="s2">marries so I in the drive back I thought</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.260" end="01:38:02.400" style="s2">well let&#39;s count the number of</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.580" end="01:38:06.889" style="s2">dimensions there are these as I call</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.400" end="01:38:09.929" style="s2">them later Robinson congresses and I was</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.889" end="01:38:12.780" style="s2">gratified or startles or whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.929" end="01:38:14.429" style="s2">right word is to find that the number</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.780" end="01:38:16.710" style="s2">the number of dimensions of these</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.429" end="01:38:19.440" style="s2">conquer this my family right which was</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.710" end="01:38:21.570" style="s2">six six dimensional family what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.440" end="01:38:24.150" style="s2">dimension of family of light rays five</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.570" end="01:38:26.909" style="s2">so the ones you actually see directly in</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.150" end="01:38:28.940" style="s2">the light rays that&#39;s the real thing and</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.909" end="01:38:32.880" style="s2">the thing which governing in the</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.940" end="01:38:34.650" style="s2">mysterious complex world add one</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.880" end="01:38:36.630" style="s2">dimension they can twist right-handed</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.650" end="01:38:39.119" style="s2">that&#39;s one way left-handed it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.630" end="01:38:41.130" style="s2">other way divide something into exactly</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.119" end="01:38:43.139" style="s2">what I was looking for fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.130" end="01:38:44.730" style="s2">I got in that and then additionally had</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.139" end="01:38:47.550" style="s2">this structure of three complex</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.730" end="01:38:49.679" style="s2">dimensions yes yes well I went I had to</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.550" end="01:38:51.210" style="s2">go back and get hold of my blackboard</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.679" end="01:38:54.239" style="s2">and trying to work it out no and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.210" end="01:38:56.130" style="s2">exhilarated so it was it was a complex</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.239" end="01:39:00.780" style="s2">projective three space you have these</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.130" end="01:39:02.699" style="s2">two twisters and I know pretty chuffed</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.780" end="01:39:04.560" style="s2">with myself didn&#39;t realize what this was</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.699" end="01:39:07.500" style="s2">you have a five dimensional space which</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.560" end="01:39:08.820" style="s2">divides this six real dimensional space</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.500" end="01:39:10.949" style="s2">which is really a three complex</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.820" end="01:39:12.960" style="s2">dimension space into two half so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.949" end="01:39:16.290" style="s2">understanding you you would start out</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.960" end="01:39:18.869" style="s2">off with a seven dimensional sphere you</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.290" end="01:39:21.780" style="s2">take an action by a circle to get see</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.869" end="01:39:23.550" style="s2">the complex projective three space and</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.780" end="01:39:25.860" style="s2">then you could further quotient that out</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.550" end="01:39:29.429" style="s2">by two spheres to get the four</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.860" end="01:39:31.199" style="s2">dimensional sphere well yes you have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.429" end="01:39:34.800" style="s2">have oh you can think of it as a sphere</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.199" end="01:39:38.480" style="s2">and maybe I&#39;m not seeing it correct you</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.800" end="01:39:40.800" style="s2">can&#39;t think of it as a sphere and</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.480" end="01:39:43.170" style="s2">probably you at a complex projected yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.800" end="01:39:44.429" style="s2">yeah you can think of a seven sphere now</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.170" end="01:39:46.650" style="s2">let me just tell you what I find</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.429" end="01:39:49.350" style="s2">fascinating about this story is that</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.650" end="01:39:51.720" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a pea</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.350" end="01:39:54.030" style="s2">traveling between two cities where you</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.720" end="01:39:55.860" style="s2">realize something is the hopf fibration</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.030" end="01:39:58.980" style="s2">well you it was a hot foundation but I</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.860" end="01:40:00.630" style="s2">hadn&#39;t actually thought of it you may</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.980" end="01:40:04.740" style="s2">not know the following no go ahead yes</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.630" end="01:40:12.930" style="s2">yes Isidore singer took the work of Jim</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.740" end="01:40:15.270" style="s2">Simons and Frank yang yeah yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.930" end="01:40:18.270" style="s2">on the trip to Oxford where you Michael</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.270" end="01:40:20.490" style="s2">work yes he said oh my god this is the</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.270" end="01:40:22.380" style="s2">quarter jnana crathers an the complex</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.490" end="01:40:24.660" style="s2">hopf fibration he said it was about nice</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.380" end="01:40:26.880" style="s2">instantly when he realized that the</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.660" end="01:40:29.130" style="s2">self-dual instant-on equations were</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.880" end="01:40:31.230" style="s2">going to be a revolution and so it was</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.130" end="01:40:34.500" style="s2">the exact moment of the relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.230" end="01:40:36.270" style="s2">something is non-trivial in his case as</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.500" end="01:40:38.700" style="s2">the quaternion ik rather than the</p>

<p begin="01:40:47.280" end="01:40:52.800" style="s2">think as we were just saying because you</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.380" end="01:40:54.800" style="s2">think of the vector space for which the</p>

<p begin="01:40:54.800" end="01:41:01.740" style="s2">for complex dimensions and then that</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.430" end="01:41:03.510" style="s2">means eight real well so and this is</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.740" end="01:41:07.650" style="s2">look I want to tie this into a bigger</p>

<p begin="01:42:53.969" end="01:42:57.780" style="s2">underneath particle physics is as or</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.219" end="01:43:01.010" style="s2">more geometric than the theory of</p>

<p begin="01:43:13.650" end="01:43:18.179" style="s2">yes you have another one yeah which is</p>

<p begin="01:43:44.489" end="01:43:49.290" style="s2">that what we had previously treated as</p>

<p begin="01:43:49.290" end="01:43:56.460" style="s2">uncertainty principle became the beauty</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.340" end="01:43:58.310" style="s2">of a geometric quantum so now you had</p>

<p begin="01:44:35.220" end="01:44:40.470" style="s2">was a grab-bag that made absolutely no</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.040" end="01:44:42.270" style="s2">effing sense pedagogically to anybody</p>

<p begin="01:44:42.270" end="01:44:48.810" style="s2">and what they taught us and this is</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.420" end="01:44:50.250" style="s2">coming from the the 1980s on is is the</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.810" end="01:44:53.420" style="s2">quantum field theory would have been</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.250" end="01:44:55.650" style="s2">discovered by topologists and geometers</p>

<p begin="01:45:20.040" end="01:45:24.690" style="s2">greatest accidental quantum field theory</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.230" end="01:45:26.820" style="s2">for some reason the physics community is</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.690" end="01:45:30.960" style="s2">still telling us stories about</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.820" end="01:45:33.630" style="s2">entanglement and about multiverses and</p>

<p begin="01:45:36.720" end="01:45:41.190" style="s2">anything I&#39;ve ever seen has been a</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.370" end="01:45:43.620" style="s2">revolution that&#39;s been plowing through</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.190" end="01:45:46.040" style="s2">mathematics and physics is covered up</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.620" end="01:45:48.600" style="s2">because they want to tell a story about</p>

<p begin="01:45:48.600" end="01:45:56.340" style="s2">together what the eff yeah I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.040" end="01:45:59.370" style="s2">worried about my wildly off no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.340" end="01:46:00.840" style="s2">think you are you see I mean a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.370" end="01:46:03.330" style="s2">these things that I wish I knew more</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.840" end="01:46:06.750" style="s2">about you see for example Coulomb theory</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.330" end="01:46:10.140" style="s2">and so on which which you know life is</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.750" end="01:46:12.470" style="s2">too short but but these askings out of</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.140" end="01:46:16.680" style="s2">the attea singer theory where yeah he</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.470" end="01:46:19.440" style="s2">finds these determinant lines which are</p>

<p begin="01:46:28.450" end="01:46:33.130" style="s2">that give us the theory I think the</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.910" end="01:46:36.430" style="s2">trouble here you see mathematics is full</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.130" end="01:46:41.920" style="s2">of all sorts of beautiful deep theory</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.430" end="01:46:43.540" style="s2">and most of mathematics as it exists now</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.920" end="01:46:46.450" style="s2">in the sense of what&#39;s written in</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.540" end="01:46:49.720" style="s2">journals and so on has almost no bearing</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.450" end="01:46:51.520" style="s2">on the physical world now you see I feel</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.720" end="01:46:53.680" style="s2">totally convinced and I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.520" end="01:46:55.690" style="s2">expressing something similar that if you</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.680" end="01:46:59.410" style="s2">find the right route through this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.690" end="01:47:01.210" style="s2">you will really find the key to what</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.410" end="01:47:04.600" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing in the physical world now</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.210" end="01:47:08.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve found many such keys and general</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.600" end="01:47:11.890" style="s2">relativity to the Lorentzian version of</p>

<p begin="01:47:11.890" end="01:47:16.750" style="s2">yes silly romanian geometry so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.070" end="01:47:18.730" style="s2">picked up a beautiful area of</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.750" end="01:47:21.760" style="s2">mathematics and turned it into into</p>

<p begin="01:47:21.760" end="01:47:29.110" style="s2">reverses has given a lot back to</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.690" end="01:47:32.050" style="s2">mathematics and also with quantum</p>

<p begin="01:47:32.050" end="01:47:36.400" style="s2">theory meant but me I think there are</p>

<p begin="01:47:36.400" end="01:47:41.830" style="s2">very beautiful mathematics and which</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.350" end="01:47:43.240" style="s2">will reveal themselves as important in</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.830" end="01:47:44.920" style="s2">the physics where you haven&#39;t got to it</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.240" end="01:47:50.020" style="s2">what do you make of the fact that we now</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.920" end="01:47:52.960" style="s2">have three separate geometries so you</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.020" end="01:47:56.140" style="s2">have Romani in geometry as the parent of</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.960" end="01:47:58.480" style="s2">general relativity yes you have eros</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.140" end="01:48:00.700" style="s2">money in geometry which is based on sort</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.480" end="01:48:02.920" style="s2">of these Penrose stares coming from</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.700" end="01:48:07.390" style="s2">fiber bundle theory which is the parent</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.920" end="01:48:09.280" style="s2">of the Maxwell classical theory but also</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.390" end="01:48:11.140" style="s2">the classical theory that would be</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.280" end="01:48:13.450" style="s2">underneath the strong force holding</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.140" end="01:48:15.280" style="s2">protons together one want to repel and</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.450" end="01:48:18.310" style="s2">the weak force which causes beta decay</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.280" end="01:48:20.710" style="s2">all right and then you&#39;ve got this other</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.310" end="01:48:24.940" style="s2">geometric theory which is the geometric</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.710" end="01:48:28.090" style="s2">quantum and they&#39;re not the same</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.940" end="01:48:34.150" style="s2">geometry so for example the geometry</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.090" end="01:48:36.630" style="s2">that the Jim Simons and CN yang find has</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.150" end="01:48:39.739" style="s2">this property called gauge symmetry you</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.630" end="01:48:43.999" style="s2">have the opportunity for gauge</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.739" end="01:48:47.749" style="s2">tree in the Einstein theory but because</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.999" end="01:48:51.139" style="s2">Einstein takes curvature and uses</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.749" end="01:48:53.239" style="s2">something called linear algebra to</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.139" end="01:48:55.190" style="s2">project all of the curvature information</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.239" end="01:48:57.980" style="s2">into a smaller subset killing off</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.190" end="01:49:01.099" style="s2">something called viol curvature if you</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.980" end="01:49:02.929" style="s2">gauge symmetries and then project it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.099" end="01:49:05.749" style="s2">not the same as projecting and then</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.929" end="01:49:09.469" style="s2">gauge symmetry so the opportunity to use</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.749" end="01:49:12.349" style="s2">gauge theory is lost by the specific</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.469" end="01:49:14.059" style="s2">genius of Einstein well you see there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.349" end="01:49:15.829" style="s2">a good example because he did this</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.059" end="01:49:18.499" style="s2">amazing thing when producing general</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.829" end="01:49:21.289" style="s2">relativity but then in his later years</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.499" end="01:49:23.570" style="s2">he tried to develop the theory and his</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.289" end="01:49:25.159" style="s2">unified field theory switch from a</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.570" end="01:49:28.969" style="s2">mathematical point of view was not</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.159" end="01:49:32.119" style="s2">really a very it&#39;s not likely to give</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.969" end="01:49:33.829" style="s2">much new insights but you know he was</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.119" end="01:49:36.619" style="s2">right to think you should find a unified</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.829" end="01:49:38.030" style="s2">scheme and so on and bring the well he</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.619" end="01:49:41.380" style="s2">troubled one trouble as he didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.030" end="01:49:44.749" style="s2">he considered electromagnetism but the</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.380" end="01:49:46.010" style="s2">particle physics didn&#39;t play much of a</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.749" end="01:49:47.869" style="s2">role in what he was doing well he died</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.010" end="01:49:50.360" style="s2">before quarks weren&#39;t but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.869" end="01:49:53.329" style="s2">assuming he never he was innocent of su3</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.360" end="01:49:56.929" style="s2">in its various yeah yes I think the</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.329" end="01:50:01.909" style="s2">thing is there&#39;s huge beautiful things</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.929" end="01:50:03.769" style="s2">in mathematics and we&#39;d like to think</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.909" end="01:50:07.130" style="s2">and I like to think that they do have a</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.769" end="01:50:10.489" style="s2">role in fundamental role roles that</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.130" end="01:50:12.139" style="s2">we&#39;ve not yet discovered in operating</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.489" end="01:50:12.559" style="s2">weather work well the way the world</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.139" end="01:50:15.550" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.559" end="01:50:17.659" style="s2">is dependent on very deep mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.550" end="01:50:20.510" style="s2">the trouble is that there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.659" end="01:50:22.219" style="s2">wrong steps in the sense that many</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.510" end="01:50:25.010" style="s2">beautiful things in mathematics which</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.219" end="01:50:26.619" style="s2">are guided in certain directions which</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.010" end="01:50:29.780" style="s2">from the point of view of mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.619" end="01:50:33.110" style="s2">are great and they can be generalizing</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.780" end="01:50:36.949" style="s2">ideas and and revealing all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.110" end="01:50:39.289" style="s2">previously unknown beauties but the</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.949" end="01:50:42.440" style="s2">proportion of these which we find has</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.289" end="01:50:44.630" style="s2">relevance to physics it&#39;s so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.440" end="01:50:47.329" style="s2">small at the moment now I think that in</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.630" end="01:50:53.090" style="s2">some ways maybe the most powerful the</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.329" end="01:50:56.570" style="s2">most sure having complex numbers</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.090" end="01:50:58.400" style="s2">and the analysis of complex numbers is</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.570" end="01:51:01.850" style="s2">one example where he once does seem to</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.400" end="01:51:04.610" style="s2">see a role in operating the way the</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.850" end="01:51:07.460" style="s2">world works and I&#39;m sure there we will</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.610" end="01:51:09.260" style="s2">find other things it&#39;s just there are so</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.460" end="01:51:10.550" style="s2">many temptations in directions which are</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.260" end="01:51:11.840" style="s2">not particularly to do with this I</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.550" end="01:51:13.490" style="s2">understand that but what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.840" end="01:51:18.920" style="s2">understand and what I&#39;m absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.490" end="01:51:20.900" style="s2">unsympathetic with is that we have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.920" end="01:51:23.720" style="s2">of people who once upon a time had a lot</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.900" end="01:51:27.110" style="s2">of different ideas now most of the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.720" end="01:51:29.330" style="s2">at the moment we&#39;re brutally honest it</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.110" end="01:51:31.340" style="s2">we are so constrained by this point in</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.330" end="01:51:34.460" style="s2">our story in theoretical physics that</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.340" end="01:51:36.980" style="s2">almost every new idea is dead on arrival</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.460" end="01:51:40.580" style="s2">unless you specifically keep it from</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.980" end="01:51:43.940" style="s2">predicting things that we don&#39;t see yo</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.580" end="01:51:45.490" style="s2">yeah right and so what I see is is that</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.940" end="01:51:48.230" style="s2">you&#39;ve got different and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.490" end="01:51:51.770" style="s2">sociological and economic critique is</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.230" end="01:51:54.260" style="s2">that you have a class of naughty boys</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.770" end="01:51:58.640" style="s2">who are very badly behaved who get to</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.260" end="01:52:00.980" style="s2">make all sorts of claims who talked to</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.640" end="01:52:02.480" style="s2">the press incessantly over decades about</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.980" end="01:52:04.790" style="s2">all the wonderful things they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.480" end="01:52:06.110" style="s2">to do which they don&#39;t do and then you</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.790" end="01:52:07.880" style="s2">haven&#39;t got another group of people</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.110" end="01:52:09.920" style="s2">whose feet are held to the fire where</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.880" end="01:52:12.110" style="s2">the instant they start to consider</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.920" end="01:52:15.230" style="s2">something that might for example violate</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.110" end="01:52:18.020" style="s2">a no-go theorem they&#39;re roundly</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.230" end="01:52:19.810" style="s2">humiliated now what I see you is having</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.020" end="01:52:24.820" style="s2">done is to carve out a very unusual</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.810" end="01:52:29.200" style="s2">niche twister theory is at a minimum an</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.820" end="01:52:32.450" style="s2">incredibly valuable tool for generating</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.200" end="01:52:37.280" style="s2">solutions on one space from solutions on</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.450" end="01:52:39.410" style="s2">another let&#39;s say however it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.280" end="01:52:41.210" style="s2">somewhat tolerated within the system</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.410" end="01:52:45.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a minority point of view it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.210" end="01:52:47.870" style="s2">minority community but it is allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.170" end="01:52:50.480" style="s2">play a parallel game to the string world</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.870" end="01:52:53.230" style="s2">where the string theorists have lived</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.480" end="01:52:55.730" style="s2">for years in my estimation on</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.230" end="01:52:57.770" style="s2">externalities there are lots of positive</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.730" end="01:52:59.600" style="s2">externalities of having and I do think</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.770" end="01:53:01.820" style="s2">that&#39;s the smartest community out there</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.600" end="01:53:03.410" style="s2">I do think that in general they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.820" end="01:53:05.270" style="s2">smarter than the relativists they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.410" end="01:53:06.150" style="s2">even smarter than most of the geometers</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.270" end="01:53:07.980" style="s2">they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.150" end="01:53:09.960" style="s2">sufferable they&#39;re very clever people</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.980" end="01:53:13.739" style="s2">yeah very good okay so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.960" end="01:53:16.260" style="s2">insufferable oh yeah and the problem</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.739" end="01:53:20.130" style="s2">with that community is is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.260" end="01:53:22.949" style="s2">actually accomplished a great deal that</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.130" end="01:53:25.949" style="s2">isn&#39;t of a stringy nature that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.949" end="01:53:28.260" style="s2">yes and I do think that what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.949" end="01:53:30.179" style="s2">done is they&#39;ve instead of quantizing</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.260" end="01:53:32.340" style="s2">geometry which is what quantum gravity</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.179" end="01:53:36.719" style="s2">was supposed to be they it backfired and</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.340" end="01:53:40.290" style="s2">they they had the geometry geometry is</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.719" end="01:53:42.320" style="s2">the quantum and that&#39;s the main legacy</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.290" end="01:53:47.489" style="s2">of these people is it something that</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.320" end="01:53:49.530" style="s2">they you know they they took off for for</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.489" end="01:53:50.969" style="s2">Paris and landed in Tokyo which is very</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.530" end="01:53:52.469" style="s2">impressive as a feat but it wasn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.969" end="01:53:54.270" style="s2">they were setting out to do I I think</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.469" end="01:53:56.640" style="s2">basically I agree with that and</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.270" end="01:53:58.500" style="s2">certainly string theories had a big</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.640" end="01:54:01.080" style="s2">influence in various areas of</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.500" end="01:54:03.179" style="s2">mathematics but the influence directly</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.080" end="01:54:05.219" style="s2">in physics has been pretty minimal</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.179" end="01:54:06.719" style="s2">thinking what do you think about the</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.219" end="01:54:09.120" style="s2">legacy of something like supersymmetry</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.719" end="01:54:12.620" style="s2">which is that&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.120" end="01:54:15.120" style="s2">isn&#39;t it yes what&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.620" end="01:54:16.770" style="s2">partly from a personal point of view</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.120" end="01:54:18.870" style="s2">because when I first heard about it and</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.770" end="01:54:21.330" style="s2">a lot of it was on conformal</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.870" end="01:54:22.560" style="s2">supersymmetry right and I could see</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.330" end="01:54:25.050" style="s2">there was a lot of connection with</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.560" end="01:54:27.150" style="s2">Twista theory the only thing I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.050" end="01:54:32.159" style="s2">like was you were led to these algebras</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.150" end="01:54:34.530" style="s2">which didn&#39;t commute and well you there</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.159" end="01:54:36.300" style="s2">was the square of something with zero or</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.530" end="01:54:38.010" style="s2">something whatever I mean they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.300" end="01:54:39.719" style="s2">the kind of algebra that you needed in</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.010" end="01:54:42.630" style="s2">twisted theory you needed complex</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.719" end="01:54:46.800" style="s2">analysis but anyway I went I visited</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.630" end="01:54:48.330" style="s2">zoomy know at one point and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.800" end="01:54:50.429" style="s2">most intrigued because I could this is</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.330" end="01:54:53.550" style="s2">half of the duo that came up with a sort</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.429" end="01:54:55.590" style="s2">of originally original deep well yes a</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.550" end="01:54:57.270" style="s2">supersymmetric model absolutely yes and</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.590" end="01:54:59.010" style="s2">so I thought there&#39;s enough connections</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.270" end="01:55:02.190" style="s2">here I&#39;d like to understand it better</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.010" end="01:55:04.170" style="s2">and yeah I think I understood a bit more</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.190" end="01:55:06.390" style="s2">but one thing I remember particularly</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.170" end="01:55:08.400" style="s2">this is a little bit of a side point but</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.390" end="01:55:10.440" style="s2">I was talking about two component</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.400" end="01:55:12.239" style="s2">spinners and I realized he was somebody</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.440" end="01:55:14.909" style="s2">who understand it understood it</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.239" end="01:55:18.090" style="s2">perfectly well and he told me this story</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.909" end="01:55:19.130" style="s2">he said he once written the paper in</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.090" end="01:55:21.469" style="s2">which he</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.130" end="01:55:22.489" style="s2">two component spinners and it was worked</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.469" end="01:55:26.540" style="s2">out very well</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.489" end="01:55:28.699" style="s2">a few months later Abdul Salam did the</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.540" end="01:55:30.980" style="s2">same thing but using four component</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.699" end="01:55:32.719" style="s2">spinners and he said everybody referred</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.980" end="01:55:34.850" style="s2">to a blitz allows paper and nobody</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.719" end="01:55:37.010" style="s2">referred to his paper and he said well</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.850" end="01:55:39.199" style="s2">that from then on he he said he vowed</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.010" end="01:55:41.150" style="s2">never to write a paper using the two</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.199" end="01:55:42.340" style="s2">spinner formalism which I thought was</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.150" end="01:55:45.400" style="s2">pretty ironic</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.340" end="01:55:48.530" style="s2">particularly since Dirac himself I was</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.400" end="01:55:50.570" style="s2">intriguing that a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.530" end="01:55:52.730" style="s2">early days of looking at generalizing</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.570" end="01:55:57.170" style="s2">the Dirac equation and for high spins</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.730" end="01:55:59.570" style="s2">and so on and there were you know Duffin</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.170" end="01:56:01.040" style="s2">comer and what only the ones from well</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.570" end="01:56:02.780" style="s2">they were all cause different names for</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.040" end="01:56:04.989" style="s2">all the different spins and they were</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.780" end="01:56:07.520" style="s2">all in coarse and smoke I remember and</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.989" end="01:56:08.780" style="s2">Dirac wrote this header isn&#39;t it I think</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.520" end="01:56:10.760" style="s2">earlier I&#39;m can&#39;t remember the history</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.780" end="01:56:12.639" style="s2">of which is which but I think earlier</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.760" end="01:56:16.070" style="s2">this paper where he did a whole lot</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.639" end="01:56:18.020" style="s2">using two spinners I mean direct using</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.070" end="01:56:19.130" style="s2">two spinners what you see clearly he</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.020" end="01:56:20.960" style="s2">knew about them as far as I was</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.130" end="01:56:22.400" style="s2">concerned because he&#39;d acted on them but</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.960" end="01:56:23.420" style="s2">this was much earlier than that he had</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.400" end="01:56:25.460" style="s2">this paper in the Royal Society</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.420" end="01:56:29.810" style="s2">describing all the different spins with</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.460" end="01:56:33.949" style="s2">two spinners much more much clearer much</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.810" end="01:56:37.130" style="s2">more general simple systematic and again</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.949" end="01:56:39.260" style="s2">nobody seemed to direct paper which is</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.130" end="01:56:40.909" style="s2">quite curious because he&#39;d I mean</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.260" end="01:56:42.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge irony there because he</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.909" end="01:56:45.260" style="s2">wrote his initial paper using these four</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.770" end="01:56:47.150" style="s2">spinners and didn&#39;t realize until may be</p>

<p begin="01:56:48.800" end="01:56:52.909" style="s2">that you could write all this and two</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.480" end="01:56:55.250" style="s2">spinners and in some ways it was simpler</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.909" end="01:56:57.830" style="s2">and really used this to generalize to</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.250" end="01:57:00.710" style="s2">all the spins but for some curious</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.830" end="01:57:03.230" style="s2">reason nobody or very few people seem to</p>

<p begin="01:57:58.099" end="01:58:02.570" style="s2">is written in two spinners and you can</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.989" end="01:58:05.239" style="s2">see it&#39;s just the same equation that you</p>

<p begin="01:58:12.230" end="01:58:15.769" style="s2">it&#39;s the same equation and you can see</p>

<p begin="01:58:18.710" end="01:58:24.170" style="s2">would venture to argue that even the</p>

<p begin="01:59:49.700" end="01:59:59.930" style="s2">forward it strikes me that what we have</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.900" end="02:00:03.700" style="s2">learned about our physical world and</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.930" end="02:00:06.830" style="s2">what comes up in this book is of a very</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.700" end="02:00:08.540" style="s2">frightening nature that Einstein&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:00:08.540" end="02:00:13.940" style="s2">them through Hilbert sit in sight come</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.600" end="02:00:17.510" style="s2">from the simplest possible thing we</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.940" end="02:00:20.630" style="s2">could minimize yeah oh yes</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.510" end="02:00:22.850" style="s2">same thing for Maxwell&#39;s equations they</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.630" end="02:00:24.740" style="s2">spread from the electromagnetism to the</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.850" end="02:00:27.800" style="s2">weak force into the strong force because</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.740" end="02:00:29.120" style="s2">it was the simplest possible thing that</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.800" end="02:00:31.370" style="s2">could be optimized I think even</p>

<p begin="02:00:31.370" end="02:00:34.730" style="s2">to avoid saying those words yes I know</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.630" end="02:00:41.180" style="s2">it and then doesn&#39;t know it and then</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.730" end="02:00:45.560" style="s2">derive yes third equation I complete</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.180" end="02:00:47.930" style="s2">this triptych is the equation for matter</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.560" end="02:00:51.500" style="s2">which generates all of something called</p>

<p begin="02:00:51.500" end="02:00:57.320" style="s2">so I could make an excellent argument</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.280" end="02:00:58.790" style="s2">that the three major equations to be</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.320" end="02:01:03.590" style="s2">supplemented by one for the Higgs field</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.790" end="02:01:06.200" style="s2">now that we found it are the simplest</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.590" end="02:01:08.990" style="s2">and best possible equations of their</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.200" end="02:01:12.550" style="s2">type not that we&#39;ve found so far but</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.990" end="02:01:14.900" style="s2">provably so yes I think the trouble with</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.550" end="02:01:18.530" style="s2">simplicity arguments which I agree with</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.900" end="02:01:20.210" style="s2">is that it&#39;s simple in one context and</p>

<p begin="02:01:20.210" end="02:01:26.150" style="s2">yeah but nature has shown such I mean</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.270" end="02:01:29.510" style="s2">the thing that I can&#39;t get over is that</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.150" end="02:01:31.970" style="s2">her taste in mathematics you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.510" end="02:01:35.930" style="s2">analogized this to raiding a jewelry</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.970" end="02:01:38.960" style="s2">store with millions of pieces and in</p>

<p begin="02:01:38.960" end="02:01:45.260" style="s2">stuff I wanted to finish a story there</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.520" end="02:01:46.220" style="s2">you see which I didn&#39;t quite finish it</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.260" end="02:01:50.120" style="s2">relates to something you were saying</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.220" end="02:01:52.550" style="s2">earlier which I at one point you see</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.120" end="02:01:53.900" style="s2">Dirac was the same College as I was and</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.550" end="02:01:55.670" style="s2">John&#39;s College in Cambridge and where I</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.900" end="02:01:58.250" style="s2">was a fellow and I happened to be</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.670" end="02:02:00.330" style="s2">sitting opposite him at one point and I</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.250" end="02:02:01.530" style="s2">had been working on these two</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.330" end="02:02:04.110" style="s2">many ways of looking at general</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.530" end="02:02:05.460" style="s2">relativity and so I said that to him I</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.110" end="02:02:07.230" style="s2">thought you know I thought something he</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.460" end="02:02:09.600" style="s2">might be interested in goodbye would he</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.230" end="02:02:12.480" style="s2">have opportunities he taught me about it</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.600" end="02:02:13.620" style="s2">so so he reserved a room and I had a</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.480" end="02:02:15.330" style="s2">little discussion with him and then I</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.620" end="02:02:18.510" style="s2">wrote down this equation which is this</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.330" end="02:02:21.360" style="s2">wave equation which you which represents</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.510" end="02:02:24.030" style="s2">the bianchi identities and and I wrote</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.360" end="02:02:25.740" style="s2">this thing down in the rack I thought he</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.030" end="02:02:28.830" style="s2">would instantly recognize it because</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.740" end="02:02:30.030" style="s2">it&#39;s basically the same equation that he</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.830" end="02:02:34.620" style="s2">had in this paper with all these</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.030" end="02:02:36.060" style="s2">different spins and he asked me I wrote</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.620" end="02:02:38.670" style="s2">down the question is where does that</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.060" end="02:02:41.670" style="s2">equation come from so I said it comes</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.670" end="02:02:45.110" style="s2">from the Bianchi identities and he said</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.670" end="02:02:47.640" style="s2">what are the Bianchi identities holy cow</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.110" end="02:02:49.110" style="s2">and I thought well he&#39;s been writing all</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.640" end="02:02:52.440" style="s2">these papers in general relativity in</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.110" end="02:02:54.750" style="s2">quo you must know perfectly well the</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.440" end="02:02:56.760" style="s2">explanation presumably is you simply</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.750" end="02:02:58.470" style="s2">rediscovered them himself he just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.760" end="02:03:01.560" style="s2">know them we call the Bianchi identities</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.470" end="02:03:03.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t know it&#39;s a very curious story</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.560" end="02:03:07.290" style="s2">yeah and this was in the form that the</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.540" end="02:03:09.720" style="s2">derivative of the curvature in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.290" end="02:03:12.840" style="s2">the natural derivative is equal to zero</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.720" end="02:03:15.750" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah in vacuum say yes and you</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.840" end="02:03:17.850" style="s2">take the the viol curvature which is all</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.750" end="02:03:20.370" style="s2">that&#39;s left of the Riemann curvature and</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.850" end="02:03:23.820" style="s2">you write that in spinners and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.370" end="02:03:26.400" style="s2">spinner with four indices completely</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.820" end="02:03:28.290" style="s2">symmetrical and then when you write the</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.400" end="02:03:30.630" style="s2">derivative it&#39;s the derivative acting on</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.290" end="02:03:32.940" style="s2">those four things in one contraction the</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.630" end="02:03:34.590" style="s2">rivers got two indices and you contract</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.940" end="02:03:36.870" style="s2">one of those and that&#39;s the equation</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.590" end="02:03:38.430" style="s2">that&#39;s vanishes that&#39;s the equation same</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.870" end="02:03:40.500" style="s2">as the Maxwell equations the same as</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.430" end="02:03:44.790" style="s2">neutrino if you had one index and no</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.500" end="02:03:46.260" style="s2">mass and it&#39;s the way I think about</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.790" end="02:03:47.940" style="s2">these things and they&#39;re conformal</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.260" end="02:03:50.520" style="s2">invariant just very crucial that leads</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.940" end="02:03:54.180" style="s2">me to all sorts of ideas that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.520" end="02:03:56.220" style="s2">have thought of otherwise and it was</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.180" end="02:03:57.600" style="s2">clearly the sort of thing Dirac would</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.220" end="02:03:59.760" style="s2">have played with himself because his</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.600" end="02:04:02.580" style="s2">equation all the high spin equations</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.760" end="02:04:04.170" style="s2">although and securely in his paper he</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.580" end="02:04:06.900" style="s2">did the massless case a different way</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.170" end="02:04:09.360" style="s2">which I never quite understood why but</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.900" end="02:04:11.699" style="s2">anyway it was is there clearly things</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.360" end="02:04:15.690" style="s2">that he understood completely</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.699" end="02:04:17.250" style="s2">and somehow maybe never connected I</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.690" end="02:04:19.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know when it was do you did you</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.250" end="02:04:21.750" style="s2">read his 1963 article in Scientific</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.980" end="02:04:26.040" style="s2">American where he makes a very</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.750" end="02:04:28.739" style="s2">interesting case against naive</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.040" end="02:04:31.739" style="s2">application of the scientific method no</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.739" end="02:04:33.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t near Exit in subject absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.739" end="02:04:35.910" style="s2">in his more you should have seen that um</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.690" end="02:04:37.230" style="s2">he makes the point in the case of</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.910" end="02:04:39.330" style="s2">Schrodinger yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.230" end="02:04:41.010" style="s2">and he says Schrodinger would not have</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.330" end="02:04:44.000" style="s2">been led into error if he had not been</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.010" end="02:04:48.300" style="s2">pressed for agreement with experiment</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.000" end="02:04:50.130" style="s2">because Schrodinger then after</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.300" end="02:04:51.570" style="s2">publishing there was a period of time</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.130" end="02:04:53.600" style="s2">where wasn&#39;t understood that spin</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.570" end="02:04:56.160" style="s2">somehow entered the picture and</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.600" end="02:04:58.949" style="s2">complicated the theoretical prediction</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.160" end="02:05:00.660" style="s2">with its experimental verification but I</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.949" end="02:05:03.330" style="s2">think secretly he was actually talking</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.660" end="02:05:05.790" style="s2">about himself where he had introduced</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.330" end="02:05:07.440" style="s2">the Dirac equation there had to be</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.790" end="02:05:09.600" style="s2">positively and negatively charged</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.440" end="02:05:11.969" style="s2">particles hmm and at that time the</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.600" end="02:05:14.460" style="s2">electron and the proton were known but</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.969" end="02:05:16.650" style="s2">the positron and the antiproton were not</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.460" end="02:05:18.480" style="s2">and so he linked those two and</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.650" end="02:05:20.640" style="s2">Heisenberg immediately dinged him and</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.480" end="02:05:22.530" style="s2">said wouldn&#39;t those be of the same mass</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.640" end="02:05:23.969" style="s2">and you&#39;re obviously making an error and</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.530" end="02:05:26.070" style="s2">he didn&#39;t stick to his guns or have the</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.969" end="02:05:27.870" style="s2">courage of his convictions to predict</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.070" end="02:05:30.719" style="s2">the new particle or something man yeah</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.870" end="02:05:32.880" style="s2">and I think that that 1963 paper from</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.719" end="02:05:35.929" style="s2">Scientific American is direct trying to</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.880" end="02:05:41.100" style="s2">give us a gift from Mount Olympus to say</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.929" end="02:05:43.650" style="s2">stop with the incessant insistent on the</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.100" end="02:05:45.780" style="s2">naive scientific method give yourself</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.650" end="02:05:48.840" style="s2">more room to imagine more room to play</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.780" end="02:05:51.270" style="s2">more room to be wrong I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.840" end="02:05:52.890" style="s2">crucial thing is he he that was the</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.270" end="02:05:56.000" style="s2">thing about Dirac he just didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.890" end="02:05:59.160" style="s2">be wrong now he was very worried about</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.000" end="02:06:01.440" style="s2">saying things that were wrong and so</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.160" end="02:06:03.690" style="s2">often he would say nothing rather than</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.440" end="02:06:06.540" style="s2">anything so this is a big thing with him</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.690" end="02:06:07.620" style="s2">and I think he was disturbed by yeah</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.540" end="02:06:09.810" style="s2">you&#39;re right I mean he could have</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.620" end="02:06:11.699" style="s2">predicted instantly I think he needed</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.810" end="02:06:13.230" style="s2">more freedom and he didn&#39;t have it and</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.699" end="02:06:14.570" style="s2">he tried to give that freed away being</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.230" end="02:06:18.150" style="s2">too timid yes</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.570" end="02:06:21.480" style="s2">what aggression yeah let me ask you a</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.150" end="02:06:22.290" style="s2">harder question all right because we</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.480" end="02:06:24.780" style="s2">haven&#39;t asked you any hard four</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.290" end="02:06:28.410" style="s2">questions I&#39;ll be going</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.780" end="02:06:31.300" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be in your nineties soon</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.410" end="02:06:36.670" style="s2">if you were to come okay yes if you were</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.300" end="02:06:39.310" style="s2">to point to younger people there seems</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.670" end="02:06:42.340" style="s2">to be a failure to pass torches that</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.310" end="02:06:43.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed and you don&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.340" end="02:06:45.790" style="s2">the sort of a person I would imagine to</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.990" end="02:06:48.300" style="s2">have that problem who would you be</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.790" end="02:06:49.930" style="s2">pointing to I mean an Indian being</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.300" end="02:06:52.570" style="s2">individuals ooh</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.930" end="02:06:54.760" style="s2">I said tricky when i teii you not to</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.570" end="02:06:57.970" style="s2">push push anyone down but who would you</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.760" end="02:07:00.520" style="s2">who would you build up in a who&#39;s young</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.970" end="02:07:03.070" style="s2">and vital who might be you might say</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.520" end="02:07:06.370" style="s2">look if anyone&#39;s got the the scent this</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.070" end="02:07:07.990" style="s2">might be a person to look at I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.370" end="02:07:10.060" style="s2">not going to take you up on that one</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.990" end="02:07:12.490" style="s2">I&#39;ll decline ya&#39;ll declined to push</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.060" end="02:07:13.150" style="s2">further yes it&#39;s just it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.490" end="02:07:15.460" style="s2">obvious</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.150" end="02:07:20.050" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve certainly had people clearly</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.460" end="02:07:23.290" style="s2">good in inspirational ways and think of</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.050" end="02:07:25.030" style="s2">things I&#39;d never thought of but it&#39;s bit</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.290" end="02:07:26.590" style="s2">hard yes I don&#39;t know enough people I</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.030" end="02:07:30.160" style="s2">think it&#39;s probably somebody I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.590" end="02:07:35.290" style="s2">know Lucy yes do you do you worry that</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.160" end="02:07:38.110" style="s2">the glory that is the oxford school of</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.290" end="02:07:40.840" style="s2">geometry and physics may not continue</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.110" end="02:07:42.850" style="s2">with ours I do worry a bit about that</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.840" end="02:07:44.950" style="s2">yes I mean there wasn&#39;t it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.850" end="02:07:46.990" style="s2">unbelievable nucleus of people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.950" end="02:07:49.120" style="s2">absolutely right it&#39;s very remarkable</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.990" end="02:07:50.950" style="s2">and I worried that the UK doesn&#39;t value</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.120" end="02:07:55.420" style="s2">itself enough I think that you guys are</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.950" end="02:07:57.780" style="s2">so idiosyncratic and so weird and badly</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.420" end="02:08:00.550" style="s2">behaved I don&#39;t know what to call it but</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.780" end="02:08:03.820" style="s2">the UK has punched way above its weight</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.550" end="02:08:06.760" style="s2">by tolerant tolerating and encouraging</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.820" end="02:08:10.000" style="s2">personalities idiosyncrasies that I</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.760" end="02:08:12.340" style="s2">think that very there is a point there</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.000" end="02:08:16.660" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t know how to generalize across</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.340" end="02:08:18.270" style="s2">countries because maybe but I think I</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.660" end="02:08:22.330" style="s2">think you were right to some degree</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.270" end="02:08:25.750" style="s2">there is tolerance of eccentricity which</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.330" end="02:08:27.160" style="s2">which is specifically kind of into kind</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.750" end="02:08:29.320" style="s2">of tolerance which is specifically</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.160" end="02:08:32.470" style="s2">English or British I should say British</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.320" end="02:08:34.750" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;m nervous about saying</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.470" end="02:08:36.340" style="s2">things like that because you find</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.750" end="02:08:37.450" style="s2">somebody springs up somewhere else yes</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.340" end="02:08:38.950" style="s2">somebody else somebody hate you</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.450" end="02:08:40.360" style="s2">work but quite honestly what are they</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.950" end="02:08:42.130" style="s2">gonna do make you pay with your career I</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.360" end="02:08:45.850" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna happen yeah but I</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.130" end="02:08:47.770" style="s2">think I think what you say about the</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.850" end="02:08:51.970" style="s2">geometry developed in Oxford it was</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.770" end="02:08:53.890" style="s2">pretty distinctive yes but then the</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.970" end="02:08:56.380" style="s2">people moved out too I mean Michael went</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.890" end="02:08:59.110" style="s2">back to Cambridge well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.380" end="02:09:01.210" style="s2">but the Oxbridge system I mean if if I</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.110" end="02:09:02.680" style="s2">don&#39;t have to make it so peculiar to</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.210" end="02:09:08.740" style="s2">Oxford but you know even if I think</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.680" end="02:09:12.340" style="s2">about like a Nigel Hitchin or Mason I</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.740" end="02:09:15.040" style="s2">guess has been in that system yes not</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.340" end="02:09:16.570" style="s2">very able people yeah they&#39;re very odd</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.040" end="02:09:19.150" style="s2">Ellis no doubt about that</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.570" end="02:09:23.980" style="s2">yes yeah but it&#39;s I mean you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.150" end="02:09:26.860" style="s2">me to a bigger thing then but let me</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.980" end="02:09:30.670" style="s2">just you know one final thing have you</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.860" end="02:09:32.560" style="s2">been to the courtyard of the Simon</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.670" end="02:09:35.020" style="s2">Centre for geometry and physics at Stony</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.560" end="02:09:36.460" style="s2">Brook which is tiled with Penrose tiles</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.020" end="02:09:38.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve not been there I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.460" end="02:09:41.950" style="s2">photographs of the tiling is may I</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.950" end="02:09:45.580" style="s2">recommend a pilgrimage they have a wall</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.950" end="02:09:48.400" style="s2">there as well yes they so-called iconic</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.580" end="02:09:52.960" style="s2">wall which because Jim Simons made so</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.400" end="02:09:54.730" style="s2">much money he was able to chisel into</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.960" end="02:09:58.090" style="s2">some of them world&#39;s most important</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.730" end="02:10:00.880" style="s2">equations and principles that you and I</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.090" end="02:10:04.480" style="s2">probably think of as being the hallmarks</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.880" end="02:10:05.890" style="s2">of being alive you know just contact</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.480" end="02:10:08.050" style="s2">with these things they&#39;re actually in a</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.890" end="02:10:11.200" style="s2">place that can be visited with a key and</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.050" end="02:10:13.150" style="s2">I always think about in a fantastic</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.200" end="02:10:14.800" style="s2">world unlocking that wall and seeing</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.150" end="02:10:17.470" style="s2">whether it&#39;s in fact a gateway to</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.800" end="02:10:18.910" style="s2">something else yeah it&#39;s a long time</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.470" end="02:10:21.730" style="s2">since I&#39;ve been there and I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.910" end="02:10:24.370" style="s2">there since the world over pavings</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.730" end="02:10:26.230" style="s2">I I recommend it yeah no I&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.370" end="02:10:32.140" style="s2">they ask you one final question to us</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.230" end="02:10:35.860" style="s2">that we all worry when we&#39;ve gotten this</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.140" end="02:10:39.390" style="s2">far along your road to reality if you</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.860" end="02:10:42.850" style="s2">will that we&#39;re not going to live to see</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.390" end="02:10:46.200" style="s2">the final chapter or completion that</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.850" end="02:10:49.330" style="s2">this is a mystery like none other that</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.200" end="02:10:50.930" style="s2">probably in some sense does have an</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.330" end="02:10:54.490" style="s2">explanation and</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.930" end="02:10:57.200" style="s2">and a kind of end is that something that</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.490" end="02:11:01.490" style="s2">that occupies you I mean I find you</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.200" end="02:11:04.340" style="s2">absolutely vital and sharp as a tack but</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.490" end="02:11:06.500" style="s2">like I&#39;m worried about this at age 54</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.340" end="02:11:07.880" style="s2">that whatever what if I don&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.500" end="02:11:09.170" style="s2">chance to see the end is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.880" end="02:11:10.880" style="s2">something that animates so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.170" end="02:11:15.920" style="s2">huge amount of chance involved in these</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.880" end="02:11:18.350" style="s2">things so it&#39;s a gamble I think you know</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.920" end="02:11:22.180" style="s2">to see a real end to all this is too</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.350" end="02:11:25.940" style="s2">remote for that but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.180" end="02:11:29.330" style="s2">you see we didn&#39;t really discuss where</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.940" end="02:11:32.690" style="s2">Twista theory is stuck or has stuck for</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.330" end="02:11:34.910" style="s2">40 years and where I think it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.690" end="02:11:37.310" style="s2">that&#39;s somewhat unstuck you think it</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.910" end="02:11:38.930" style="s2">will be the answer well I&#39;m not sure how</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.310" end="02:11:42.140" style="s2">far it&#39;ll take us you see that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.930" end="02:11:45.260" style="s2">question but the main problem as I saw</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.140" end="02:11:48.230" style="s2">it in twister theory it did sort of</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.260" end="02:11:50.150" style="s2">rather surprisingly things which worked</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.230" end="02:11:51.980" style="s2">surprisingly well and one of these is to</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.150" end="02:11:55.040" style="s2">construct solutions of me Einstein</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.980" end="02:11:58.210" style="s2">equations or the Ricci flat it&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.040" end="02:12:01.460" style="s2">dimensional space times which were</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.210" end="02:12:04.250" style="s2">completely generic provided they were</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.460" end="02:12:05.900" style="s2">anti self dual now what that means is</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.250" end="02:12:09.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a complex solution of</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.900" end="02:12:12.170" style="s2">Einstein&#39;s vacuum equations which are</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.290" end="02:12:13.730" style="s2">left-handed in some sense and I why do</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.170" end="02:12:15.680" style="s2">we want complex solutions anyway you</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.730" end="02:12:17.480" style="s2">know you want the real solutions well</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.680" end="02:12:19.160" style="s2">you see I thought at one point well one</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.480" end="02:12:22.220" style="s2">useful way of thinking about the complex</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.160" end="02:12:24.770" style="s2">ones as these are wave functions because</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.220" end="02:12:26.060" style="s2">wave functions are naturally complex so</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.770" end="02:12:28.460" style="s2">I thought well this is a wave function</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.060" end="02:12:30.830" style="s2">but it&#39;s a nonlinear wave function so I</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.460" end="02:12:33.080" style="s2">called it the nonlinear graviton and it</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.830" end="02:12:34.730" style="s2">seemed to me a big step forward and</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.080" end="02:12:38.210" style="s2">understanding how quantum mechanics and</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.730" end="02:12:39.860" style="s2">gravity fit together but it got stuck it</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.210" end="02:12:43.580" style="s2">got stuck with what I call the googley</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.860" end="02:12:45.350" style="s2">problem now you have to if you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.580" end="02:12:46.940" style="s2">member of the former British Empire you</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.350" end="02:12:49.790" style="s2">probably don&#39;t know what a googly is</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.940" end="02:12:52.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a ball mold in the game of</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.790" end="02:12:54.200" style="s2">cricket you see in cricket unlike</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.490" end="02:12:57.890" style="s2">baseball you&#39;d like to spin the ball</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.200" end="02:12:59.420" style="s2">about its axis the direction it spins</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.890" end="02:13:01.460" style="s2">about the direction which is moving</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.420" end="02:13:03.410" style="s2">because it bounces that&#39;s a key thing so</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.460" end="02:13:04.690" style="s2">it bounces one way or there and to make</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.410" end="02:13:08.090" style="s2">it spin left hand</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.690" end="02:13:10.790" style="s2">it has a certain action with your hand</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.090" end="02:13:12.590" style="s2">and there&#39;s a clever thing that people</p>
<p begin="02:13:10.790" end="02:13:14.300" style="s2">do who are really good at this who can</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.590" end="02:13:17.060" style="s2">looks as though they&#39;re using the same</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.300" end="02:13:19.219" style="s2">action but it&#39;s very cleverly done that</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.060" end="02:13:20.869" style="s2">the ball spins the other way and you</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.219" end="02:13:23.360" style="s2">throw occasional one of these in it gets</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.869" end="02:13:25.730" style="s2">the batsman completely bamboozled and</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.360" end="02:13:28.400" style="s2">that&#39;s called the googly so using the</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.730" end="02:13:30.619" style="s2">same action that spins the ball left</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.400" end="02:13:32.449" style="s2">hand and you spin it right-handed so I</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.619" end="02:13:35.119" style="s2">used that term because seem very an act</p>
<p begin="02:13:32.449" end="02:13:37.280" style="s2">you have the frame the twisted framework</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.119" end="02:13:39.770" style="s2">which naturally gives you the</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.280" end="02:13:42.560" style="s2">left-handed graviton make it do the</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.770" end="02:13:44.150" style="s2">right-handed one and I struggled and</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.560" end="02:13:46.670" style="s2">struggled and struggled and have all</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.150" end="02:13:49.190" style="s2">sorts of wild ideas for how to do this</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.670" end="02:13:52.190" style="s2">and I came up with one which I was very</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.190" end="02:13:54.440" style="s2">proud of but it needed a cosmological</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.190" end="02:13:56.900" style="s2">constant to be zero and so I thought</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.440" end="02:13:59.420" style="s2">there is no cosmological constant then I</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.900" end="02:14:02.560" style="s2">had a discussion with Jerry Ostreicher</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.420" end="02:14:05.030" style="s2">who was a very distinguished</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.560" end="02:14:07.250" style="s2">astrophysicist and I was talking about</p>
<p begin="02:14:05.030" end="02:14:11.510" style="s2">the observations that there seemed to be</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.250" end="02:14:14.270" style="s2">a exponential expansion of the universe</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.510" end="02:14:16.909" style="s2">which seemed to indicate the presence of</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.270" end="02:14:18.440" style="s2">a positive cosmological constant so I</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.909" end="02:14:20.810" style="s2">said well you know surely that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.440" end="02:14:22.699" style="s2">really there it&#39;s dust or something and</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.810" end="02:14:24.980" style="s2">he looked at me I said that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.699" end="02:14:27.770" style="s2">point there are so many things in</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.980" end="02:14:30.380" style="s2">cosmology which works so much better if</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.770" end="02:14:33.619" style="s2">you put this cosmological constant in so</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.380" end="02:14:36.170" style="s2">I had to retract my view I threw out my</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.619" end="02:14:38.989" style="s2">construction but it took me many years</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.170" end="02:14:40.250" style="s2">to see when you have a cosmological</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.989" end="02:14:42.770" style="s2">constant you can do something that</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.250" end="02:14:45.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t work without it and this enables</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.770" end="02:14:48.230" style="s2">you to have a construction which I think</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.920" end="02:14:50.360" style="s2">solves this googley problem the trouble</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.230" end="02:14:52.250" style="s2">is from my point of view it translates</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.360" end="02:14:53.510" style="s2">it into algebra rather than geometry</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.250" end="02:14:55.280" style="s2">although you even get back to geometry</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.510" end="02:14:57.860" style="s2">by thinking of it as a connection on the</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.280" end="02:14:59.929" style="s2">bundle so that is a geometrical thing it</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.860" end="02:15:01.639" style="s2">is a connect connection and then you</p>
<p begin="02:14:59.929" end="02:15:03.290" style="s2">talk about this algebra and then instead</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.639" end="02:15:04.969" style="s2">of patching spaces together to make a</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.290" end="02:15:06.469" style="s2">curved manifold you patch the algebra</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.969" end="02:15:09.469" style="s2">together then they have to be non</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.469" end="02:15:11.260" style="s2">commutative at the point that made clear</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.469" end="02:15:14.000" style="s2">to me by Michael at T at one point and</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.260" end="02:15:16.280" style="s2">this is the proposal you just construct</p>
<p begin="02:15:14.000" end="02:15:17.450" style="s2">these algebras and they are connections</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.280" end="02:15:20.240" style="s2">on bundles</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.450" end="02:15:23.210" style="s2">and this enables you least in principle</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.240" end="02:15:26.180" style="s2">to find a generic solution of the answer</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.210" end="02:15:29.090" style="s2">and vacuum equations with cosmological</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.180" end="02:15:30.830" style="s2">constant when I say find it&#39;s so you</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.090" end="02:15:33.230" style="s2">mean it what would be called an Einstein</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.830" end="02:15:35.660" style="s2">manifold the Ricci scalar is constant in</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.230" end="02:15:38.360" style="s2">nonzero constant in non zero that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.660" end="02:15:39.710" style="s2">right that&#39;s right exactly what people</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.360" end="02:15:41.840" style="s2">call an Einstein&#39;s mate but this is</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.710" end="02:15:44.660" style="s2">Lorentzian or not understood positive</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.840" end="02:15:46.190" style="s2">definite but it&#39;s not a construction</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.660" end="02:15:48.560" style="s2">event that you sort of write this</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.190" end="02:15:50.210" style="s2">following me down it&#39;s you construct</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.560" end="02:15:52.760" style="s2">this algebra and then you look for sub</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.210" end="02:15:55.220" style="s2">algebra and the algebra and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.760" end="02:15:57.230" style="s2">the thing I&#39;m good at doing so but still</p>
<p begin="02:15:55.220" end="02:15:58.310" style="s2">it needs something to collaborate oh</p>
<p begin="02:15:57.230" end="02:16:00.860" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.310" end="02:16:02.540" style="s2">and I got distracted by cosmology and</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.860" end="02:16:04.400" style="s2">other things and I&#39;ll stay away from</p>
<p begin="02:16:02.540" end="02:16:05.750" style="s2">that consciousness stuff it&#39;ll suck all</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.400" end="02:16:09.740" style="s2">your time well that is a problem</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.750" end="02:16:11.210" style="s2">actually yeah but you see other people</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.740" end="02:16:13.220" style="s2">are doing that I&#39;m not really doing that</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.210" end="02:16:15.050" style="s2">I can go there get me to give lectures</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.220" end="02:16:18.410" style="s2">on it I give the same old lecture which</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.050" end="02:16:21.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve given many many well I have to say</p>
<p begin="02:16:18.410" end="02:16:24.110" style="s2">that if you stick with what you&#39;ve what</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.740" end="02:16:26.060" style="s2">you&#39;ve done in physics and keep trying</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.110" end="02:16:28.940" style="s2">to push that ball forward I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.060" end="02:16:30.860" style="s2">imagine a better use of your time you</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.940" end="02:16:32.750" style="s2">are invited any time you want to come</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.860" end="02:16:35.770" style="s2">back and return to this program this has</p>
<p begin="02:16:32.750" end="02:16:38.330" style="s2">been an extremely heavy load for our</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.770" end="02:16:40.670" style="s2">listeners know we don&#39;t apology</p>
<p begin="02:16:38.330" end="02:16:42.260" style="s2">you don&#39;t apologize for that we have to</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.670" end="02:16:44.300" style="s2">start doing something different because</p>
<p begin="02:16:42.260" end="02:16:46.010" style="s2">people are hungry to know what does it</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.300" end="02:16:48.050" style="s2">actually sound like to hear people</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.010" end="02:16:50.420" style="s2">talking about where things are rather</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.050" end="02:16:52.580" style="s2">than some spoon-fed prettified version</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.420" end="02:16:54.140" style="s2">that&#39;s like pre-chewed as if it were</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.580" end="02:16:57.980" style="s2">baby food I don&#39;t think they want that</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.140" end="02:16:59.660" style="s2">anymore no I agree and I think even if</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.980" end="02:17:01.730" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand all the things that</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.660" end="02:17:03.980" style="s2">they get some feeling from some of the</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.730" end="02:17:05.990" style="s2">things people are trying to do is is</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.980" end="02:17:08.540" style="s2">really important we are as important as</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.990" end="02:17:10.070" style="s2">the details or perhaps model part of it</p>
<p begin="02:17:08.540" end="02:17:11.540" style="s2">is just respecting our listeners they</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.070" end="02:17:13.850" style="s2">know that we don&#39;t know how to get this</p>
<p begin="02:17:11.540" end="02:17:15.560" style="s2">to them in exactly the right way and so</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.850" end="02:17:16.910" style="s2">I think we have the best listenership of</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.560" end="02:17:19.550" style="s2">any program out there because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.910" end="02:17:21.320" style="s2">been habituated to recognize that not</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.550" end="02:17:25.550" style="s2">every program and not every sentence is</p>
<p begin="02:17:21.320" end="02:17:27.500" style="s2">going to make sense so Roger thank you</p>
