<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:17.220" style="s2">gonna hand this over to Yancey who will</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.290" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">be facilitating today&#39;s workshop and as</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.220" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2">most of you know in addition to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">podcast I run I also run an in-person</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:25.560" style="s2">group in Toronto called the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">Explorers Club</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.560" end="00:00:31.349" style="s2">and we host regular events like the one</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">you&#39;re about to experience today and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.349" end="00:00:35.430" style="s2">recently decided to take these online</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">and I&#39;m dubbing them for now since</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.430" end="00:00:40.860" style="s2">making wormholes and I&#39;m inviting past</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.250" end="00:00:43.500" style="s2">podcast guests to facilitate whatever</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">they want to facilitate really and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.500" end="00:00:48.270" style="s2">idea coincided with me hanging out with</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:50.250" style="s2">Yancey a few weeks ago when he was in</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.270" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">Toronto and he mentioned that he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.250" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">doing workshops on a concept he</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">mentioned in his new book called bento</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">ism or the concepts called bento ism and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:02.039" style="s2">he was interested in doing some of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">online so I offered him this space and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.039" end="00:01:10.530" style="s2">platform for him to test one out so to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">introduce Yancey he is the former CEO</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.530" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">and co-founder of Kickstarter he is also</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:19.220" style="s2">a writer and author and his upcoming</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:27.720" style="s2">that being said I&#39;ll hand it over to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.229" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">Yancey and you will be completely in his</p>

<p begin="00:01:57.060" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">I&#39;ve been experimenting with what we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.619" end="00:02:06.600" style="s2">do together the previous four of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">have all happened in someone&#39;s house in</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:19.560" style="s2">treated this as a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:20.940" style="s2">like DIY Co experience that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.560" end="00:02:23.490" style="s2">coincidentally has always happened on</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.940" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">Sunday mornings we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.490" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">about that but anyway just some</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:29.910" style="s2">introduction for what we&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:32.370" style="s2">into together I asked Peter to send out</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.910" end="00:02:34.170" style="s2">a couple handouts beforehand of things</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.370" end="00:02:37.020" style="s2">that you&#39;ll be filling out and writing</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.170" end="00:02:38.520" style="s2">on today you&#39;ll need three pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.020" end="00:02:39.930" style="s2">paper to go through this today and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.520" end="00:02:42.540" style="s2">gonna need the first one of those right</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.930" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">now because I want to start this</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.540" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">experiment by having you take out a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:51.390" style="s2">piece of paper and write down four</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:53.310" style="s2">should I questions should I questions a</p>

<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:03:03.140" style="s2">should be related to your personal life</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.880" end="00:03:05.989" style="s2">one of these should be existential and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.140" end="00:03:09.269" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll just do three one one</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.989" end="00:03:11.400" style="s2">professional one personal and one</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.269" end="00:03:14.190" style="s2">existential so should I question might</p>

<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:26.040" style="s2">have to be so heavy but something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.100" end="00:03:27.630" style="s2">is from your real life that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.040" end="00:03:30.269" style="s2">really thinking about so I&#39;m gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.630" end="00:03:33.750" style="s2">just by giving you a minute to jot those</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.269" end="00:03:35.100" style="s2">down and I hope to think about how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.750" end="00:03:36.360" style="s2">let you ought to let me know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.100" end="00:03:37.829" style="s2">ready but we&#39;re gonna do that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.360" end="00:03:41.450" style="s2">gonna throw in a little bit of music</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.829" end="00:03:41.450" style="s2">while you do that just as we get started</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.230" end="00:04:02.389" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.450" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">yeah just simple should I questions real</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.100" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">real things you might be thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.079" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">three things and then once you write</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.320" end="00:04:15.720" style="s2">those down you could set them to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:18.169" style="s2">side we&#39;re not going to do anything with</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.720" end="00:04:18.169" style="s2">that quite yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.200" end="00:04:33.190" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:34.990" style="s2">he said something about how heavy these</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.190" end="00:04:38.200" style="s2">should be or something like that can you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.990" end="00:04:41.830" style="s2">remind me of that I don&#39;t think I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.200" end="00:04:43.240" style="s2">maybe one one heavy question I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.830" end="00:04:44.470" style="s2">it&#39;s just more like a real thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.240" end="00:04:45.730" style="s2">considering because this this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.470" end="00:04:48.970" style="s2">something we&#39;re gonna engage with later</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.730" end="00:04:50.320" style="s2">so if you wanted to explore a question</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.970" end="00:04:52.750" style="s2">like this is something that you will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.320" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">able to do so have heavier light is on</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.750" end="00:04:56.620" style="s2">you I think one that&#39;s maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:05:00.190" style="s2">challenging maybe one that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.620" end="00:05:03.810" style="s2">more day-to-day just do another twenty</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.190" end="00:05:03.810" style="s2">seconds and then I&#39;ll jump back in</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.350" end="00:05:16.100" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:25.270" style="s2">alright so you could set that to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.490" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">side and so I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:30.790" style="s2">for about fifteen to twenty minutes with</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">slides and then we&#39;re gonna engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.790" end="00:05:35.770" style="s2">few different exercises together so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.280" end="00:05:39.820" style="s2">want to start by asking you to picture</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.770" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">your commute to work you leave your</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.820" end="00:05:45.640" style="s2">house you get into your car you get onto</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:47.200" style="s2">your bike you get onto a subway you ride</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.640" end="00:05:50.950" style="s2">somewhere for 20 minutes and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.200" end="00:05:52.960" style="s2">show up at the office now think back and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.950" end="00:05:54.790" style="s2">consider what do you see on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:56.620" style="s2">right-hand side of the road on your way</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.790" end="00:05:59.620" style="s2">to work what kind of stores do you see</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.620" end="00:06:01.540" style="s2">and if you&#39;re someone that lives in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.620" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">residential area and commutes to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.540" end="00:06:05.229" style="s2">commercial area to go to your office as</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:07.330" style="s2">most people in the Western world do on</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.229" end="00:06:08.919" style="s2">the right-hand side of the street on</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.330" end="00:06:12.669" style="s2">your way to work you&#39;re going to see a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.919" end="00:06:15.640" style="s2">Starbucks or a coffee shop or a bank or</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.669" end="00:06:18.010" style="s2">a gas station now if you imagine your</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.640" end="00:06:20.229" style="s2">same commute home from work going from</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.010" end="00:06:22.419" style="s2">the office from a commercial area back</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.229" end="00:06:23.800" style="s2">home to a residential area on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.419" end="00:06:25.780" style="s2">right-hand side of the road then you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.800" end="00:06:28.390" style="s2">will see grocery stores and shopping</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.780" end="00:06:30.130" style="s2">centers and restaurants now the reason</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.390" end="00:06:32.020" style="s2">for this is something called the no</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.130" end="00:06:34.210" style="s2">left-turn rule in the world of retail</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.020" end="00:06:36.670" style="s2">planning and the idea is very simple</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.210" end="00:06:39.040" style="s2">it&#39;s much more difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.670" end="00:06:40.540" style="s2">turn left rather than right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.040" end="00:06:42.340" style="s2">wait to turn into traffic it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.540" end="00:06:44.440" style="s2">dangerous that people are less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.340" end="00:06:46.120" style="s2">do it and as a result for several</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.440" end="00:06:48.070" style="s2">decades now developers have</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.120" end="00:06:50.170" style="s2">intentionally tried to play big try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.070" end="00:06:52.150" style="s2">place businesses so that they can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.170" end="00:06:54.070" style="s2">right-hand turns at the right time of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.150" end="00:06:56.320" style="s2">day so things you need in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.070" end="00:06:59.110" style="s2">need to be right-hand turns on the to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.320" end="00:07:00.760" style="s2">work side of the street and things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.110" end="00:07:03.280" style="s2">people tend to need after work need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.760" end="00:07:05.710" style="s2">be right-hand turns on the to home side</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.280" end="00:07:08.740" style="s2">of the street now the no left turn rule</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.710" end="00:07:11.290" style="s2">is an example of a hidden default a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.740" end="00:07:13.090" style="s2">that our choices are being made for us</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.290" end="00:07:15.850" style="s2">without us being totally aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.090" end="00:07:18.850" style="s2">this sounds like something nefarious but</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.850" end="00:07:21.370" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be a classic example</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.850" end="00:07:24.820" style="s2">our organ donation rates where countries</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.370" end="00:07:26.410" style="s2">where forms opt people in automatically</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.820" end="00:07:28.900" style="s2">to donate their organs have far greater</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.410" end="00:07:31.570" style="s2">donation rates or societies where people</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.900" end="00:07:33.640" style="s2">have to actively choose to opt in we go</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.570" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">along with whatever that default is in</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.640" end="00:07:38.200" style="s2">front of us whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:40.690" style="s2">I&#39;m based in the US and here in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.200" end="00:07:42.610" style="s2">United States our Congress has never had</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.690" end="00:07:45.130" style="s2">a reelection rate of less than 80</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.610" end="00:07:47.350" style="s2">percent over the last 60 years the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.130" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">people keep getting reelected this</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.350" end="00:07:51.040" style="s2">despite the fact that the approval rate</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:53.320" style="s2">for Congress has plummeted during that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.040" end="00:07:56.500" style="s2">same time and you get something absurd</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.320" end="00:07:58.810" style="s2">like 2014 when Congress had an 11</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.500" end="00:08:01.870" style="s2">percent approval rating and 96 percent</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.810" end="00:08:04.780" style="s2">of them were reelected again we go along</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.870" end="00:08:07.480" style="s2">with defaults now I started thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.780" end="00:08:09.790" style="s2">about this question around this time in</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.480" end="00:08:12.280" style="s2">2014 when my neighborhood in New York</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.790" end="00:08:13.870" style="s2">City was starting to change there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.280" end="00:08:16.690" style="s2">place that had been there forever called</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.870" end="00:08:21.250" style="s2">Mars bar which was a punk dive bar from</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.690" end="00:08:23.650" style="s2">the CBGB&#39;s Punk era and in 2012-2013 it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.250" end="00:08:26.770" style="s2">got torn down and was replaced by a TD</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.650" end="00:08:28.360" style="s2">Bank not only was the kiddie Bank not</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.770" end="00:08:29.920" style="s2">the most beautiful or interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.360" end="00:08:32.200" style="s2">in the world but the crazy thing was</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.920" end="00:08:35.830" style="s2">that it was the fourth TD Bank within a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.200" end="00:08:37.420" style="s2">15 minute walk of that same corner local</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.830" end="00:08:39.100" style="s2">businesses were being pushed out and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.420" end="00:08:41.530" style="s2">this TD Bank was being put in its place</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.100" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">and when I started looking into this I</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.530" end="00:08:45.730" style="s2">discovered that this was happening on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:48.310" style="s2">mass scale across New York City in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.730" end="00:08:50.380" style="s2">2000s and early 2010&#39;s there was almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.310" end="00:08:53.020" style="s2">a thousand new bank branches</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.380" end="00:08:54.310" style="s2">across Manhattan and it suddenly dawned</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.020" end="00:08:56.470" style="s2">on me that in every one of these places</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.310" end="00:08:57.970" style="s2">where there had once been something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.470" end="00:09:01.030" style="s2">Mars bar that&#39;s where these banks were</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.970" end="00:09:02.410" style="s2">and so these businesses being run by New</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.030" end="00:09:04.510" style="s2">Yorkers for their fellow New Yorkers</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.410" end="00:09:06.340" style="s2">were being pushed out did the extent</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.510" end="00:09:08.290" style="s2">that there are almost as many subway</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.340" end="00:09:11.710" style="s2">station subway restaurants in New York</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.290" end="00:09:14.020" style="s2">as there are subway stations and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.710" end="00:09:15.880" style="s2">the reason why over the last 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.020" end="00:09:19.390" style="s2">the Entrepreneurship rates in America</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.880" end="00:09:21.520" style="s2">have dropped precipitously from 1977 to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.390" end="00:09:23.710" style="s2">today the Entrepreneurship rate per</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.520" end="00:09:26.650" style="s2">capita has dropped by half in America</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.710" end="00:09:29.080" style="s2">the same decline as smoking rates since</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.650" end="00:09:32.230" style="s2">then so as many more people used to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.080" end="00:09:35.350" style="s2">smoke in 1977&#39;s today proportionally a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.230" end="00:09:39.010" style="s2">similarly significant larger amount of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.350" end="00:09:40.810" style="s2">people used to be entrepreneurs - we</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.010" end="00:09:42.550" style="s2">hear about this being a start-up age but</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.810" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not true and if you go to any</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.550" end="00:09:46.510" style="s2">suburban area you will see Walmart&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:48.100" style="s2">big-box stores that show you that this</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.510" end="00:09:49.840" style="s2">is the case you can&#39;t have a small</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.100" end="00:09:51.790" style="s2">business in those places they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.840" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">dominated by chains and the hidden</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.790" end="00:09:56.950" style="s2">default behind this is the same reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:09:58.900" style="s2">why every movie is now a sequel this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.950" end="00:10:00.430" style="s2">a tweet from this summer of what was</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.900" end="00:10:02.710" style="s2">playing in the the theaters this summer</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.430" end="00:10:04.810" style="s2">all sequels and this is not something</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.710" end="00:10:06.190" style="s2">that we&#39;re imagining if you chart out</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.810" end="00:10:08.770" style="s2">the number of sequels prequels and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.190" end="00:10:11.050" style="s2">remakes in the top 10 of the box-office</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.770" end="00:10:13.300" style="s2">over the past 70 years it&#39;s only the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.050" end="00:10:15.520" style="s2">last 20 years that we&#39;ve had this sequel</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.300" end="00:10:17.560" style="s2">itis and so instead of telling new</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.520" end="00:10:19.030" style="s2">stories as Hollywood once did instead of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.560" end="00:10:21.640" style="s2">just retell stories that have already</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.030" end="00:10:23.650" style="s2">been told before and the reason why this</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.640" end="00:10:25.750" style="s2">is happening is the same reason why</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.650" end="00:10:29.170" style="s2">Taylor Swift is on the cover of every</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.750" end="00:10:31.390" style="s2">magazine now the I did the phrase I give</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.170" end="00:10:32.890" style="s2">to this reason that is driving this the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.390" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">hidden default that is driving this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.890" end="00:10:39.010" style="s2">financial maximization the belief that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:40.950" style="s2">the rational choice in any decision is</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.010" end="00:10:44.410" style="s2">whichever option makes the most money</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.950" end="00:10:49.060" style="s2">this is the hidden default that operates</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.410" end="00:10:51.010" style="s2">the world today now someone could very</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.060" end="00:10:53.830" style="s2">reasonably say hey isn&#39;t that just</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.010" end="00:10:55.270" style="s2">capitalism like what like isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.830" end="00:10:57.400" style="s2">what capitalism is what are we</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.270" end="00:11:00.760" style="s2">disagreeing with here and it&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.400" end="00:11:02.830" style="s2">in in Adam Smith in 1776 wrote it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.760" end="00:11:03.910" style="s2">from the benevolence of the butcher that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.830" end="00:11:05.320" style="s2">we expect to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.910" end="00:11:07.780" style="s2">but from their regard for their own</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.320" end="00:11:09.190" style="s2">self-interest but Adam Smith did not go</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.780" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">on to write that that butcher must</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.190" end="00:11:13.660" style="s2">maximize hog slaughter rates lower</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.560" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">safety standards and pay workers as</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.660" end="00:11:18.130" style="s2">little as possible and distribute that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:19.750" style="s2">money to shareholders instead but that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.130" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">is the standing a standard operating</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.750" end="00:11:24.280" style="s2">procedure for organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.690" style="s2">companies today and we can pinpoint the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.280" end="00:11:28.450" style="s2">moment when this really started to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.690" end="00:11:31.810" style="s2">happen it was in 1970 the Vietnam War</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.450" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">was raging young American men were and</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.810" end="00:11:37.150" style="s2">Vietnamese men were losing their lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:38.680" style="s2">in war and in America the debate started</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.150" end="00:11:40.540" style="s2">well what should companies be doing for</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.680" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">the greater good and into this argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.540" end="00:11:44.230" style="s2">the economist Milton Friedman wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.810" style="s2">landmark essay in The New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.230" end="00:11:49.210" style="s2">that argued that businesses had no</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.810" end="00:11:51.610" style="s2">social responsibility a phrase he puts</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.210" end="00:11:53.910" style="s2">in skeptical quote marks 23 times in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.610" end="00:11:56.230" style="s2">essay and said the only social</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.910" end="00:11:58.360" style="s2">responsibility businesses have is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.230" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">make as much money as they can that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.360" end="00:12:02.620" style="s2">the social service that they provide and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:03.910" style="s2">this idea really changed how business is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.620" end="00:12:06.460" style="s2">operated and there&#39;s a number of ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.910" end="00:12:10.570" style="s2">that we can track this one is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.460" end="00:12:13.120" style="s2">worker pay from 1948 to 1973 the wages</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.570" end="00:12:14.770" style="s2">of the egde American worker glued by 90</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:17.320" style="s2">percent and this was this is true in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.770" end="00:12:19.180" style="s2">every pay class the highest pay people</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.320" end="00:12:22.150" style="s2">the lowest paid people all saw similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.180" end="00:12:24.970" style="s2">levels of gains and then in 1973 this</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.150" end="00:12:26.680" style="s2">began to dramatically change even as</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.970" end="00:12:28.870" style="s2">worker productivity continued to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.680" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">increase at the same rate compensation</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.870" end="00:12:33.400" style="s2">flattened so if you&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:35.220" style="s2">high point of pay for productivity for</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.400" end="00:12:37.780" style="s2">the American worker that ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.220" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">1973 the same year that Pink Floyd&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.780" end="00:12:44.170" style="s2">Dark Side of the Moon came out that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:46.420" style="s2">long time ago now when I picture what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.170" end="00:12:48.700" style="s2">happening here a strange image comes to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.420" end="00:12:51.490" style="s2">mind and it&#39;s the mullet</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.700" end="00:12:54.400" style="s2">I trust you all remember the mullet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.490" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">the pinnacle of 80s hair technology with</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.640" end="00:13:04.960" style="s2">financial maximization is the mullet</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.580" end="00:13:47.230" style="s2">evidence of this change and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.070" end="00:13:49.450" style="s2">survey that UCLA has done every year</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.230" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">since the 1960s and it&#39;s a survey of</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">it asks them a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.980" end="00:13:57.160" style="s2">but one of the questions is what are</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.850" end="00:16:42.640" style="s2">really see or acknowledge so I call this</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.760" end="00:16:43.480" style="s2">this way of seeing bento ism like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.640" end="00:16:45.790" style="s2">bento box</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.480" end="00:16:48.100" style="s2">I call it bento ISM for a few reasons</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.790" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">one is that the bento comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.100" end="00:16:51.640" style="s2">Japanese word meaning convenience the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:54.370" style="s2">idea is that something that is always</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.640" end="00:16:56.890" style="s2">easy to have with you the bento also</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.370" end="00:16:59.500" style="s2">always has a variety of dishes never too</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.890" end="00:17:02.170" style="s2">much of any one thing so it&#39;s a balanced</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.500" end="00:17:04.510" style="s2">and convenient default and the bento</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.170" end="00:17:06.939" style="s2">also honors a Japanese eating philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.510" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">called Hara Hachi Bou which says the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.939" end="00:17:11.949" style="s2">goal of a meal is to be 80% full that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:13.990" style="s2">way you&#39;re still hungry for tomorrow so</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.949" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">the bento is a convenient healthy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.990" end="00:17:19.329" style="s2">balanced default for lunch</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:21.189" style="s2">bento ism is the same idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.329" end="00:17:24.610" style="s2">convenient and healthy and balanced way</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.189" end="00:17:26.860" style="s2">to see our true self interests so I want</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.610" end="00:17:28.360" style="s2">to demonstrate how this works using it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.860" end="00:17:31.150" style="s2">as an example and then we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.360" end="00:17:33.190" style="s2">engage with this together the example I</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.150" end="00:17:36.280" style="s2">want to give involves the movie Pulp</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.190" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">Fiction and the story of butch this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.280" end="00:17:40.870" style="s2">Bruce Willis&#39;s character and butch is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:42.760" style="s2">aging fighter with one last fight in him</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.870" end="00:17:44.490" style="s2">and he agrees to throw that fight after</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.760" end="00:17:46.740" style="s2">being paid off by a gangster</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.490" end="00:17:48.540" style="s2">about the last second instead of winning</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.740" end="00:17:49.860" style="s2">the fight like he&#39;s supposed to instead</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.540" end="00:17:51.780" style="s2">of sorry instead of losing the fight</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.860" end="00:17:54.270" style="s2">like he&#39;s supposed to which wins the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.780" end="00:17:56.040" style="s2">fight escapes out of a window and goes</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.270" end="00:17:58.560" style="s2">to a hotel room to go on the run with</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.040" end="00:18:00.510" style="s2">his girlfriend Fabien but just as</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.560" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">they&#39;re about to leave which discovers</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.510" end="00:18:06.360" style="s2">that they forgot to pack his gold watch</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:08.550" style="s2">and not just any gold watch his dead war</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.360" end="00:18:10.860" style="s2">hero father&#39;s gold watch the same gold</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.550" end="00:18:12.570" style="s2">watch that Christopher Walken memorably</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.860" end="00:18:15.060" style="s2">describes hiding in an uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.570" end="00:18:16.740" style="s2">place earlier in the movie so butch</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.060" end="00:18:19.650" style="s2">faces this question should I go back for</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.740" end="00:18:21.180" style="s2">the watch and even though he knows there</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.650" end="00:18:22.680" style="s2">are gangsters almost certainly waiting</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.180" end="00:18:25.230" style="s2">for them and that he is likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.680" end="00:18:27.150" style="s2">killed he chooses to go back to get it</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.230" end="00:18:29.930" style="s2">and from their experiences as he later</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.150" end="00:18:33.420" style="s2">says the single weirdest day of my life</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.930" end="00:18:37.020" style="s2">so my question is was Butch&#39;s choice to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.420" end="00:18:39.180" style="s2">go back and get the watch rationale it</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.020" end="00:18:40.800" style="s2">seems strange and silly to ask whether</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.180" end="00:18:43.020" style="s2">something that happens in a movie is</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.800" end="00:18:45.390" style="s2">rational or not acknowledged especially</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.020" end="00:18:47.370" style="s2">a Tarantino movie but I think this is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.390" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">interesting question because our notion</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.370" end="00:18:51.720" style="s2">of what is in our rational self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">today is largely based on ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.720" end="00:18:56.130" style="s2">were created in the development of game</p>

<p begin="00:19:46.440" end="00:19:50.940" style="s2">and I would say no if he was maximizing</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.270" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">for it isn&#39;t stupid it may be dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.220" end="00:21:02.370" style="s2">but it&#39;s not stupid because there are</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.370" end="00:21:07.409" style="s2">going back for worth going back for so</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.309" end="00:21:09.570" style="s2">we can imagine butch asking his bento</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.409" end="00:21:12.299" style="s2">this question should I go back for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.570" end="00:21:14.789" style="s2">watch and as he asked this question each</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.299" end="00:21:16.679" style="s2">of the bentos now me future me now as</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.789" end="00:21:18.330" style="s2">future us would respond with their</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.679" end="00:21:21.270" style="s2">perspective and we hear in his monologue</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.330" end="00:21:22.620" style="s2">what they think if we hear the now me</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.270" end="00:21:24.390" style="s2">voice I don&#39;t want to die you should</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.620" end="00:21:26.970" style="s2">leave this is just a watch</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.390" end="00:21:29.640" style="s2">there&#39;s his now us voice think of fabien</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.970" end="00:21:31.409" style="s2">leave but there&#39;s also the future me</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.640" end="00:21:33.659" style="s2">voice that tells him this watch is more</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.409" end="00:21:35.399" style="s2">than a watch it&#39;s a symbol and finally</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.659" end="00:21:37.710" style="s2">he finds the future us of his legacy</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.399" end="00:21:40.440" style="s2">which is that to live up to who he is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:43.049" style="s2">be self coherent he can&#39;t back down from</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.440" end="00:21:45.149" style="s2">this fight so butch makes a choice that</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.049" end="00:21:46.919" style="s2">is not maximizing for now me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.149" end="00:21:49.260" style="s2">maximizing for other areas of his</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.919" end="00:21:51.210" style="s2">self-interest but by consulting his</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.260" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">bento he found the rational choice and</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.210" end="00:21:56.669" style="s2">he got to see live to see another day</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:58.649" style="s2">so our self-interest is bigger than just</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.669" end="00:22:02.010" style="s2">this hockey stick space of now me there</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.649" end="00:22:03.539" style="s2">are other spaces to consider and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.010" end="00:22:05.370" style="s2">it&#39;s in that now me space where</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.539" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">financial maximization the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.370" end="00:22:10.950" style="s2">just every decision maximizing the value</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:12.330" style="s2">of money where that mindset comes from</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.950" end="00:22:14.399" style="s2">it&#39;s based on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.330" end="00:22:16.380" style="s2">self-maximizing now me game theory</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.399" end="00:22:17.970" style="s2">concept of the world but what about</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.380" end="00:22:19.500" style="s2">these other spaces and what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.970" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">there so I wanna give you three quick</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.500" end="00:22:22.950" style="s2">examples and then we&#39;re gonna talk a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">little bit the first one I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.950" end="00:22:26.850" style="s2">about is Patagonia Patagonia is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:27.960" style="s2">clothing maker that does all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.850" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">great things for the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.960" end="00:22:32.850" style="s2">they have a public benefit corporation</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:35.070" style="s2">charter that says that if they develop a</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.850" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">new technology that will materially help</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.070" end="00:22:38.580" style="s2">the environment they will share it with</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:41.010" style="s2">their competitors even if it will hurt</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.580" end="00:22:42.750" style="s2">their business and in 2014 Patagonia</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.010" end="00:22:45.090" style="s2">followed through on this they developed</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.750" end="00:22:47.429" style="s2">a new new kind of sustainable bio rubber</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.090" end="00:22:48.779" style="s2">for wetsuits and they gave it away they</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.429" end="00:22:50.970" style="s2">used a big ad campaign to give it away</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.779" end="00:22:53.010" style="s2">to their competitors this seems like an</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.970" end="00:22:55.350" style="s2">irrational choice but Patagonia is</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.010" end="00:22:57.510" style="s2">optimizing for sustainability a future</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.350" end="00:22:59.010" style="s2">US value there&#39;s still a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.510" end="00:23:00.990" style="s2">company that has to think about their</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.010" end="00:23:03.539" style="s2">now many needs but they can balance that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.990" end="00:23:06.299" style="s2">rationally rationally with this future</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.539" end="00:23:08.190" style="s2">US consideration another example is</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.299" end="00:23:10.860" style="s2">chick-fil-a which is the most highly</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.190" end="00:23:12.809" style="s2">rated fast-food chain in America it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.860" end="00:23:14.340" style="s2">also the only chain in America that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.809" end="00:23:16.950" style="s2">still closes on Sundays</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.340" end="00:23:18.059" style="s2">this is 23% less hours a year that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.950" end="00:23:20.250" style="s2">chick-fil-a is open than their</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.059" end="00:23:22.679" style="s2">competitors cost him a billion dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.250" end="00:23:24.990" style="s2">year but they still do this one day a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.679" end="00:23:28.620" style="s2">week they maximize and optimize for</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.990" end="00:23:30.059" style="s2">tradition rather than just money and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.620" end="00:23:34.110" style="s2">then the last example I want to share</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.059" end="00:23:36.269" style="s2">was Adele the pop star Adele and 2014</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.110" end="00:23:38.279" style="s2">Adele was going on tour for the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.269" end="00:23:40.919" style="s2">time in many years and when Adele goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.279" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">on tour she has a challenge which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.919" end="00:23:44.639" style="s2">that her tickets get immediately scalped</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:45.929" style="s2">and sold on the secondary ticketing</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.639" end="00:23:48.210" style="s2">websites for much more money</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.929" end="00:23:50.010" style="s2">this leaves Adele performing shows for</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.210" end="00:23:51.690" style="s2">either just wealthy fans or for people</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.010" end="00:23:53.250" style="s2">who are spending money they probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.690" end="00:23:55.409" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t to see her perform</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.250" end="00:23:57.750" style="s2">and so Adele found another way to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.409" end="00:24:00.149" style="s2">about this she found a startup that had</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.750" end="00:24:02.610" style="s2">built an algorithm to measure a fans</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.149" end="00:24:04.289" style="s2">loyalty to an artist it would analyze</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.610" end="00:24:06.779" style="s2">their social information Spotify</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.289" end="00:24:09.179" style="s2">information etc and use that as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.779" end="00:24:10.980" style="s2">prequalify people and invite them in to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.179" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">buy tickets without putting any</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.980" end="00:24:14.309" style="s2">restrictions of whether or not they</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:16.230" style="s2">could resell them the idea was that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.309" end="00:24:18.389" style="s2">could algorithmically maximize for a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.230" end="00:24:20.520" style="s2">kind of fairness and a kind of community</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.389" end="00:24:23.250" style="s2">experience and through that produce a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.520" end="00:24:24.870" style="s2">better outcome so fairness is another</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.250" end="00:24:25.370" style="s2">kind of nowis value that someone could</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.870" end="00:24:28.040" style="s2">maximize</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.370" end="00:24:30.410" style="s2">for and I&#39;ll skip the last example so</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.040" end="00:24:32.090" style="s2">this notion enough our self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.410" end="00:24:33.620" style="s2">being bigger than just this now me space</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.090" end="00:24:36.110" style="s2">is something and I found to be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.620" end="00:24:38.600" style="s2">powerful idea in my life and that&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.110" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">from applying this idea and using it to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.600" end="00:24:43.670" style="s2">develop my own values to discover what</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:47.510" style="s2">my own bento is about and I would now</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.670" end="00:24:50.150" style="s2">love to do that with someone here so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.510" end="00:24:51.800" style="s2">what I&#39;ll do is I will walk someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.150" end="00:24:55.730" style="s2">through the questions and we&#39;ll do this</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.800" end="00:24:58.309" style="s2">as a model sort of model exercise and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.730" end="00:24:59.929" style="s2">then after doing this together you all</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.309" end="00:25:02.600" style="s2">everyone else will be writing down these</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.929" end="00:25:04.910" style="s2">answers as well in their own time and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.600" end="00:25:06.260" style="s2">will experiment with with asking some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.910" end="00:25:09.020" style="s2">your should I questions to see your</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.260" end="00:25:10.850" style="s2">bento so I want to click back over to</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.020" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">zoom and figure out how to ask people to</p>

<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:00.210" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:02.130" style="s2">I identify a lot with like the imagery</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.210" end="00:31:04.350" style="s2">and and narrative stuff associated with</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.130" end="00:31:07.860" style="s2">heroism so I&#39;d like to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.350" end="00:31:12.030" style="s2">like myself reflected in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.860" end="00:31:15.860" style="s2">could be seen as admirable in like in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.030" end="00:31:19.520" style="s2">that sort of heroic sense like taking on</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.860" end="00:31:23.250" style="s2">worthwhile challenges that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.520" end="00:31:25.650" style="s2">yeah any anything you feel like is</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.250" end="00:31:28.380" style="s2">missing as you as you sort of hear this</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.650" end="00:31:36.330" style="s2">direction we&#39;re going anything you feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.380" end="00:31:37.950" style="s2">like is you&#39;d wanted to add another</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.330" end="00:31:39.810" style="s2">thing just to feel like I really</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.950" end="00:31:41.880" style="s2">appreciated the like the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.810" end="00:31:46.170" style="s2">while it was happening I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.880" end="00:31:48.630" style="s2">okay all right so now we&#39;re gonna switch</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.170" end="00:31:53.280" style="s2">back over so I can give you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.630" end="00:31:57.210" style="s2">more background so next we&#39;re gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.280" end="00:31:59.370" style="s2">about now us so now us are the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.210" end="00:32:02.940" style="s2">that we rely on and who we rely on us</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.370" end="00:32:05.400" style="s2">this is very contextual I think for most</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.940" end="00:32:08.520" style="s2">of us it&#39;s probably a similar subset of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.400" end="00:32:10.710" style="s2">family friends co-workers neighbors I</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.520" end="00:32:12.780" style="s2">would ask you to try to picture those</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.710" end="00:32:16.110" style="s2">people in your mind imagine who those</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.780" end="00:32:18.270" style="s2">people are and think about what do they</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.110" end="00:32:19.650" style="s2">give what do they give you in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.270" end="00:32:21.450" style="s2">relationship what is it that they really</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.650" end="00:32:23.090" style="s2">give to you and what is it that you give</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.450" end="00:32:25.410" style="s2">to them what is it the core of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.090" end="00:32:27.720" style="s2">exchange in the relationships that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.410" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">have is it about spending a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.720" end="00:32:32.040" style="s2">together is it about just like being</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:34.560" style="s2">having honest conversations it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.040" end="00:32:36.600" style="s2">having fun like what what what what is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.560" end="00:32:39.630" style="s2">at the core so of the three visions that</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.600" end="00:32:42.030" style="s2">you listed definitely having honest</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.630" end="00:32:45.890" style="s2">conversations really important feeling</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.030" end="00:32:49.640" style="s2">like were part of a community together</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.890" end="00:32:49.640" style="s2">is really important</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.330" end="00:32:57.230" style="s2">feeling what else you know as</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.840" end="00:33:00.120" style="s2">conversations being part of a community</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.230" end="00:33:02.750" style="s2">feeling like or somehow like mutually</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.120" end="00:33:05.160" style="s2">striving and improving and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.750" end="00:33:09.300" style="s2">influencing each other positively to do</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.860" end="00:33:29.220" style="s2">thinking about personal relationships</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.540" end="00:33:30.600" style="s2">like is there any or do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.220" end="00:33:32.540" style="s2">spaces where your obligations are a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.600" end="00:33:36.840" style="s2">little bit different or is this just</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.540" end="00:33:38.790" style="s2">feel bad this is about right okay all</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.840" end="00:33:44.370" style="s2">right so now going over to the last</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.790" end="00:33:47.520" style="s2">bento so future us is thinking the next</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.370" end="00:33:49.470" style="s2">generation our children</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.520" end="00:33:52.830" style="s2">you know it&#39;s worth considering that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.470" end="00:33:56.370" style="s2">future will be there now and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.830" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">to consider what future us needs and one</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.370" end="00:34:00.450" style="s2">way I&#39;d encourage you to think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:02.250" style="s2">this is to imagine yes what what like</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.450" end="00:34:05.400" style="s2">the next generation will need but also</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.250" end="00:34:06.690" style="s2">to reflect on like what what do we think</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.400" end="00:34:07.830" style="s2">what do you think you got as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.690" end="00:34:09.990" style="s2">generation from the previous generation</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.830" end="00:34:12.120" style="s2">and like what is that sort of iterative</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.990" end="00:34:14.640" style="s2">thing that you would feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.120" end="00:34:17.430" style="s2">important to be thinking about so so</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.640" end="00:34:18.990" style="s2">again just what comes to mind so first</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.430" end="00:34:20.610" style="s2">question you&#39;re trying to kind of trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.990" end="00:34:27.510" style="s2">to say like let&#39;s look at this in terms</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.610" end="00:34:30.150" style="s2">of like also how I&#39;m receiving a legacy</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.510" end="00:34:31.530" style="s2">from the previous generation well yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.150" end="00:34:35.220" style="s2">mean I I don&#39;t know that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.530" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">list those things I just find you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.220" end="00:34:37.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just easy to take a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:40.230" style="s2">for granted I just find one that when I</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.920" end="00:34:42.900" style="s2">sort of ask that question is just helps</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.230" end="00:34:45.150" style="s2">me think about what&#39;s what is like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.900" end="00:34:46.770" style="s2">foundation we stand on so maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.150" end="00:34:49.260" style="s2">not a healthy thing to directly think</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.770" end="00:34:51.240" style="s2">okay no no I think it&#39;s super helpful I</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.260" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">was just asking for clarification I</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.240" end="00:35:00.780" style="s2">think one thing is to feel like we</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:35:02.520" style="s2">maintained a I guess maybe one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.780" end="00:35:05.310" style="s2">most important things is maintaining a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.520" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">place for like real human beings in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.310" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">world as opposed to a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.720" end="00:35:14.970" style="s2">atomization and commodification of human</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:18.500" style="s2">behavior so so there so I guess yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.970" end="00:35:22.100" style="s2">some kind of keep humans human yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.500" end="00:35:22.100" style="s2">sure yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.530" end="00:35:32.990" style="s2">another thing would be that we give them</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.620" end="00:35:34.970" style="s2">a world that seems to have a optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.990" end="00:35:37.670" style="s2">like a shared sort of optimistic world</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.970" end="00:35:44.870" style="s2">view of the future and itself or</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.670" end="00:35:46.730" style="s2">ourselves yeah what else and I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.870" end="00:35:48.650" style="s2">I don&#39;t just mean well we&#39;re optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.730" end="00:35:52.940" style="s2">but I mean that there&#39;s a collective</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.650" end="00:35:56.570" style="s2">sense of of interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.940" end="00:35:58.280" style="s2">meaningfulness yeah yeah another thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.570" end="00:35:59.000" style="s2">would obviously be survival that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.280" end="00:36:02.450" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.000" end="00:36:07.130" style="s2">sure sure I mean maybe yeah maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.450" end="00:36:09.320" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll see well I mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.130" end="00:36:20.050" style="s2">else anything else you yeah anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.320" end="00:36:23.330" style="s2">else when I think we&#39;re good so great so</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.050" end="00:36:27.620" style="s2">the next thing I will be to look at your</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.330" end="00:36:30.860" style="s2">should I questions sure and I won&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.620" end="00:36:34.340" style="s2">you to pick one and you&#39;re gonna read it</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.860" end="00:36:36.830" style="s2">out loud and we&#39;re gonna talk it through</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.340" end="00:36:39.490" style="s2">from the perspective of each bento and</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.830" end="00:36:43.730" style="s2">just get a sense of like what it thinks</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.490" end="00:36:45.110" style="s2">all right so I&#39;ve been I have a youtube</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.730" end="00:36:46.700" style="s2">channel that started getting pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.110" end="00:36:48.430" style="s2">successful but I haven&#39;t used it in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.700" end="00:36:51.500" style="s2">while because I&#39;ve been uncertain about</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.430" end="00:36:52.940" style="s2">well how much I want to do it and how</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.500" end="00:36:54.920" style="s2">much I want to be involved in it with it</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.940" end="00:36:57.070" style="s2">and what kind of direction I want taken</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.920" end="00:37:00.050" style="s2">in so I guess my question right now is</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.070" end="00:37:05.360" style="s2">should I seriously commit to my youtube</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.050" end="00:37:07.640" style="s2">channel alright great so so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.360" end="00:37:09.470" style="s2">that through so the way I so the way you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.640" end="00:37:11.240" style="s2">the way you do this is that when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.470" end="00:37:12.770" style="s2">a question I generally start with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.240" end="00:37:15.710" style="s2">bottom left and I start with now a mini</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.770" end="00:37:17.810" style="s2">right so I ask so I try to isolate just</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.710" end="00:37:20.930" style="s2">the now need and what does the now</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.810" end="00:37:24.440" style="s2">meanest say to this question so as you</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.930" end="00:37:26.390" style="s2">as you focus just on like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.440" end="00:37:28.370" style="s2">basic sort of stuff wanting to do good</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.390" end="00:37:30.770" style="s2">avoidance of pain and just the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.370" end="00:37:32.330" style="s2">moment like visceral feeling what does</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.770" end="00:37:34.550" style="s2">that say to you in response to this</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.330" end="00:37:35.420" style="s2">question um the moment visceral feeling</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.550" end="00:37:38.660" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.420" end="00:37:41.180" style="s2">really positive because I really enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.660" end="00:37:43.340" style="s2">talking about ideas and I&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.180" end="00:37:45.530" style="s2">of ideas that I talked like with my</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.340" end="00:37:47.300" style="s2">friends and some of my friends are we</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.530" end="00:37:48.440" style="s2">get involved in these conversations I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.300" end="00:37:52.340" style="s2">have another friend who&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.440" end="00:37:54.440" style="s2">make content and so the now me senses</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.340" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s a really fun thing to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.440" end="00:37:59.330" style="s2">engaged with and there&#39;s a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:38:01.880" style="s2">open-ended creative potential to where</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.330" end="00:38:07.850" style="s2">things might go with it so I like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.880" end="00:38:09.590" style="s2">that sense that yeah I feel you I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.850" end="00:38:10.970" style="s2">sense you&#39;re energized by it yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.590" end="00:38:12.590" style="s2">sense I could sense it through the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.970" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">screen that you feel energy is energized</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.590" end="00:38:21.230" style="s2">by that okay great all right so so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:25.610" style="s2">go to your your future me so the future</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.230" end="00:38:29.570" style="s2">me wants you to be heroic no no no</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.610" end="00:38:31.880" style="s2">pressure but because I know it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.570" end="00:38:33.950" style="s2">it&#39;s Israel you can be yeah of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.880" end="00:38:39.020" style="s2">like everybody has a heroic aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.950" end="00:38:46.580" style="s2">them yeah but yeah so if I were to look</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.020" end="00:38:50.540" style="s2">back on it I would say that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.580" end="00:38:52.130" style="s2">it would be that way because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.540" end="00:38:55.100" style="s2">an interesting thing to do to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.130" end="00:38:58.430" style="s2">yourself involved in it and in creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.100" end="00:39:00.200" style="s2">content because there&#39;s a there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.430" end="00:39:02.150" style="s2">like a personal vulnerability that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.200" end="00:39:04.070" style="s2">create that kind of like archetypal like</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.150" end="00:39:06.440" style="s2">like the fool kind of doing something</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.070" end="00:39:08.930" style="s2">stupid Lee initially in order to develop</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.440" end="00:39:10.970" style="s2">confidence that&#39;s a totally yeah so like</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.930" end="00:39:14.180" style="s2">I have the belief that I have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.970" end="00:39:17.270" style="s2">belief that well I won&#39;t go into it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.180" end="00:39:19.970" style="s2">yeah I think that well doing something</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.270" end="00:39:21.860" style="s2">that could look stupid because they</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.970" end="00:39:23.720" style="s2">think that it&#39;s a really good idea is</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.860" end="00:39:25.970" style="s2">very admirable and that oftentimes it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.720" end="00:39:28.460" style="s2">produces some results it start to look</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.970" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">quite good enough look later on do you I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.460" end="00:39:32.620" style="s2">mean I think like does it feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:35.720" style="s2">risk worth taking</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.620" end="00:39:39.590" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s true yeah certainly certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.720" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2">yes okay all right great so that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.590" end="00:39:47.210" style="s2">yeses so far so now going to now us so</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">you&#39;re now us is about being a part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.210" end="00:39:52.340" style="s2">community helping each other honest</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:56.060" style="s2">conversations is how does this line up</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.340" end="00:39:57.950" style="s2">with that well okay so with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.060" end="00:39:59.690" style="s2">my best friend who&#39;s also started making</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.950" end="00:40:02.270" style="s2">content if there&#39;s there&#39;s a strong kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.690" end="00:40:05.720" style="s2">of like inter connection there so it</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.270" end="00:40:07.670" style="s2">really works in terms of our being part</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.720" end="00:40:10.900" style="s2">of a striving community together there</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.670" end="00:40:13.490" style="s2">and I have other friends who are and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.900" end="00:40:17.000" style="s2">have been sort of similarly interested</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.490" end="00:40:20.510" style="s2">in this kind of stuff I&#39;m going to put</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.000" end="00:40:22.070" style="s2">this I think a lot of my friends see</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.510" end="00:40:24.140" style="s2">this is something that I could do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.070" end="00:40:26.660" style="s2">would be really positive and so if I do</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.140" end="00:40:30.950" style="s2">something that&#39;s really positive for</p>

<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:19.730" style="s2">destiny is that making that choice would</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.540" end="00:42:22.790" style="s2">be in your self-interest and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.730" end="00:42:25.310" style="s2">a self coherent thing to do but I but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.790" end="00:42:27.410" style="s2">also see in here a couple interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.310" end="00:42:30.170" style="s2">ideas that say to me how you should go</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.410" end="00:42:34.580" style="s2">about doing this so if I look at like if</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.170" end="00:42:35.750" style="s2">I look at your now us values like honest</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.580" end="00:42:37.220" style="s2">conversations between the court of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.750" end="00:42:39.320" style="s2">community helping each other get better</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.220" end="00:42:42.440" style="s2">like those three things they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.320" end="00:42:44.690" style="s2">that is like that that could be your</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.440" end="00:42:47.060" style="s2">show Bible for your for how you approach</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.690" end="00:42:49.670" style="s2">like being a youtuber in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.060" end="00:42:52.250" style="s2">like there is a kind of truth of values</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.670" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">a truth of sharing if you do that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.250" end="00:42:56.420" style="s2">definitely keeping humans human yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:58.910" style="s2">seems like that probably also fulfills</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.420" end="00:43:01.160" style="s2">making most of your time but like I</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.910" end="00:43:02.780" style="s2">would kind of this to me is like would</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.160" end="00:43:04.640" style="s2">would be a pretty good map for you to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.780" end="00:43:06.890" style="s2">think about like what&#39;s the identity of</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.640" end="00:43:09.530" style="s2">my show like everything I make what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.890" end="00:43:11.990" style="s2">it what does it need to live up to what</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.530" end="00:43:13.550" style="s2">does it need to fulfill for me to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.990" end="00:43:16.180" style="s2">like sign off and be like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.550" end="00:43:19.640" style="s2">that&#39;s like a I&#39;ll put my name to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.180" end="00:43:21.530" style="s2">and so it can this both shows us like</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.640" end="00:43:23.930" style="s2">right right or wrong answers but I also</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.530" end="00:43:25.820" style="s2">think it shows us like what is either</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.930" end="00:43:28.340" style="s2">what is in our nature or what do we want</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.820" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">to be in our nature for how you go about</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.340" end="00:43:32.870" style="s2">doing these things right so so I look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:35.180" style="s2">this as it&#39;s like it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.870" end="00:43:37.730" style="s2">sense-making as the title title this</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.180" end="00:43:39.850" style="s2">session says but it&#39;s also like you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.730" end="00:43:43.400" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of empowering you I think to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.850" end="00:43:48.860" style="s2">to probably you know maximize the eunice</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.400" end="00:43:50.980" style="s2">of doing this right not just to do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.860" end="00:43:53.720" style="s2">but how do you do it in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.980" end="00:43:54.200" style="s2">self coherent in like a really broad</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.720" end="00:43:56.690" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.200" end="00:43:58.340" style="s2">yeah the phrase I I keep coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.690" end="00:44:00.050" style="s2">a self coherence I don&#39;t know what what</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.340" end="00:44:01.940" style="s2">that phrase means to people but you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.050" end="00:44:04.940" style="s2">I just think the world forces us into a</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.940" end="00:44:07.850" style="s2">lot of self-contradiction all the time</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.940" end="00:44:10.700" style="s2">yeah that makes sense and so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.850" end="00:44:14.300" style="s2">embody how we fully embody ourselves so</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.700" end="00:44:16.790" style="s2">so thank you thank you Jordan for being</p>

<p begin="01:17:58.140" end="01:18:02.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t know for some reason to feature</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.550" end="01:18:05.940" style="s2">us I put like the world at large and</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.940" end="01:18:08.760" style="s2">like community at large versus like us</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.940" end="01:18:10.350" style="s2">now maybe I considered people that are</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.760" end="01:18:12.570" style="s2">closer to me for some reason</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.350" end="01:18:14.370" style="s2">I was teamed with Phil and he mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.570" end="01:18:17.490" style="s2">community and I told they forgot to put</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.370" end="01:18:19.530" style="s2">that in now us but it&#39;s probably because</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.490" end="01:18:22.710" style="s2">I&#39;m just a selfish prick and only think</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.530" end="01:18:24.270" style="s2">about myself I have the same assumption</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.710" end="01:18:27.240" style="s2">I have the exact same an assumption of</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.270" end="01:18:30.780" style="s2">you is like us is closer and future us</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.240" end="01:18:32.160" style="s2">is more like have humanity writ large so</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.780" end="01:18:35.480" style="s2">I think I think that might be there</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.160" end="01:18:40.680" style="s2">might be a common default that we go to</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.480" end="01:18:42.560" style="s2">yeah so I guess like the now I Swiss may</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.680" end="01:18:51.630" style="s2">be the one I struggled the most with</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.560" end="01:18:55.140" style="s2">considering my mailbox yeah on that note</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.630" end="01:18:57.840" style="s2">that came to mind is when I was going</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.140" end="01:18:59.610" style="s2">through the my bento and then now us it</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.840" end="01:19:02.250" style="s2">seems like oh man the stuff that I want</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.610" end="01:19:04.770" style="s2">in it like the quality time just really</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.250" end="01:19:07.740" style="s2">being present with people I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.770" end="01:19:15.090" style="s2">that was most lacking in comparison to</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.740" end="01:19:18.570" style="s2">the now me I will say that since I like</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.090" end="01:19:24.090" style="s2">I made my first memento a year ago and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.570" end="01:19:26.760" style="s2">now like explicitly create now us time</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.090" end="01:19:28.620" style="s2">every day like I just have to I have</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.760" end="01:19:31.170" style="s2">I&#39;ve made it a conscious effort to like</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.620" end="01:19:34.230" style="s2">if it&#39;s a good day it requires me having</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.170" end="01:19:37.230" style="s2">now as time with someone because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.230" end="01:19:39.240" style="s2">something that I realized that without</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.230" end="01:19:43.170" style="s2">making effort I would just I just</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.240" end="01:19:45.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t pay attention to that by I</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.170" end="01:19:47.190" style="s2">think people probably all have different</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.000" end="01:19:51.810" style="s2">areas that are feel more natural to them</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.190" end="01:19:54.290" style="s2">than others any anyone else want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.810" end="01:19:54.290" style="s2">share anything</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.560" end="01:20:00.380" style="s2">I&#39;ll go here so just want one one kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.940" end="01:20:01.640" style="s2">of interesting thing and now I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.380" end="01:20:02.390" style="s2">thinking about this in reflection we</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.640" end="01:20:04.100" style="s2">didn&#39;t really talk about in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.390" end="01:20:06.860" style="s2">conversation but it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.100" end="01:20:09.080" style="s2">looking at the connections between kind</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.860" end="01:20:13.010" style="s2">of my values and what what I think our</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.080" end="01:20:14.990" style="s2">our values ought to be like my one of my</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.010" end="01:20:17.090" style="s2">true me things was intellectual honesty</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.990" end="01:20:19.280" style="s2">and I like care a lot about that as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.090" end="01:20:21.980" style="s2">kind of personal value and that also</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.280" end="01:20:23.690" style="s2">went into what I said for future us is</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.980" end="01:20:27.070" style="s2">just making sure that the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.690" end="01:20:31.940" style="s2">institutions of knowledge generation are</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.070" end="01:20:34.460" style="s2">maintained and and so I you know it</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.940" end="01:20:37.400" style="s2">helps me to see my own future goals in</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.460" end="01:20:41.870" style="s2">the context of future obstacles and kind</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.400" end="01:20:43.730" style="s2">of bring those into to coherence I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.870" end="01:20:46.870" style="s2">also that might say that might say to</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.730" end="01:20:49.700" style="s2">you that maybe the idea of working on</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.870" end="01:20:51.860" style="s2">the truthfulness of institutions over</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.700" end="01:20:54.140" style="s2">the long term maybe would have seemed</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.860" end="01:20:55.610" style="s2">like is that like is that a job like</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.140" end="01:20:57.620" style="s2">what what you&#39;ve been is that but I</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.610" end="01:20:59.750" style="s2">think this also might justify to you</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.620" end="01:21:01.730" style="s2">that like there is real rational value</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.750" end="01:21:04.100" style="s2">and an importance in that and like you</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.730" end="01:21:05.840" style="s2">can you could see where that exists it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.100" end="01:21:08.270" style="s2">not as easy to explain it as like</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.840" end="01:21:10.730" style="s2">something as immediate but I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.270" end="01:21:13.400" style="s2">this also makes the argument that like</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.730" end="01:21:16.400" style="s2">there is a that is a that is a pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.400" end="01:21:20.380" style="s2">worth working towards that yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.400" end="01:21:23.480" style="s2">provides imminent and long-term value</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.380" end="01:21:27.610" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s also a helpful way of</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.480" end="01:21:27.610" style="s2">thinking about like what makes for good</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.880" end="01:21:32.390" style="s2">institutions and communities as to what</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.020" end="01:21:35.200" style="s2">degree they like afford people</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.390" end="01:21:39.620" style="s2">practicing their personal longer-term</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.200" end="01:21:41.330" style="s2">values I imagine a lot that that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.620" end="01:21:43.250" style="s2">institutions around me or the the work</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.330" end="01:21:45.950" style="s2">around me or whatever allow me to</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.250" end="01:21:49.130" style="s2">express the values that I had here so</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.950" end="01:21:51.380" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s useful thank you thanks Jay</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.130" end="01:21:55.190" style="s2">anyone else like to share I have a</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.380" end="01:21:57.140" style="s2">question it was anyone just like have</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.190" end="01:21:59.900" style="s2">the worst time together talking to each</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.140" end="01:22:01.370" style="s2">other well it was was how did it feel to</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.900" end="01:22:04.460" style="s2">talk to another person and say hey</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.370" end="01:22:07.580" style="s2">here&#39;s what I&#39;m about did you feel seen</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.460" end="01:22:09.640" style="s2">in that what was that experience like</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.580" end="01:22:09.640" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.770" end="01:22:18.360" style="s2">unfortunately I&#39;m not gonna speak to</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.760" end="01:22:21.870" style="s2">that exactly I just want to go back to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.360" end="01:22:25.800" style="s2">the box because I actually find it a</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.870" end="01:22:28.110" style="s2">little revelatory because as everyone</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.800" end="01:22:31.500" style="s2">else is talking about there now so I</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.110" end="01:22:34.200" style="s2">kind of got stuck in a moment and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.500" end="01:22:42.810" style="s2">realized looking at the other three</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.200" end="01:22:45.270" style="s2">quadrants that I that&#39;s where my</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.810" end="01:22:49.290" style="s2">transformation is happening and then now</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.270" end="01:22:51.630" style="s2">as those are the parts and pieces that I</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.290" end="01:22:55.500" style="s2">think that are going to start shifting</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.630" end="01:22:58.140" style="s2">in my life because I started thinking</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.500" end="01:23:00.930" style="s2">about the responsibilities the</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.140" end="01:23:03.900" style="s2">connections that I may idealize in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.930" end="01:23:07.260" style="s2">future us but I don&#39;t necessarily have</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.900" end="01:23:10.620" style="s2">and then now us and so in that way being</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.260" end="01:23:13.110" style="s2">able to reflect on how I started stream</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.620" end="01:23:16.290" style="s2">of consciousness just writing things</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.110" end="01:23:20.070" style="s2">down in the quadrants it&#39;s helpful to</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.290" end="01:23:22.980" style="s2">reflect back on be like okay it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.070" end="01:23:26.040" style="s2">really fit with the other things that I</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.980" end="01:23:32.510" style="s2">desire for myself so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.040" end="01:23:39.360" style="s2">helpful so thank you yes you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.510" end="01:23:41.040" style="s2">on the internet yeah anyone else wanted</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.360" end="01:23:44.070" style="s2">to share anything I have I&#39;ll have like</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.040" end="01:23:45.690" style="s2">a little there&#39;s one one last small</p>

<p begin="01:23:45.690" end="01:23:51.030" style="s2">five-minute sort of thing before we end</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.450" end="01:23:54.180" style="s2">but anything anyone else wants to share</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.030" end="01:23:55.860" style="s2">get off their chest uh one thing I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.180" end="01:23:57.720" style="s2">is really interesting about this and</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.860" end="01:24:01.530" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to know exactly what to</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.720" end="01:24:04.050" style="s2">make of it but I feel like when you</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.530" end="01:24:05.790" style="s2">consider all four like in the rational</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.050" end="01:24:06.900" style="s2">self interesting obviously you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.790" end="01:24:08.460" style="s2">well that&#39;s not really what it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.900" end="01:24:09.840" style="s2">about because obviously you have to care</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.460" end="01:24:12.230" style="s2">about yourself in the future you have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.840" end="01:24:14.640" style="s2">care about everybody else also and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.230" end="01:24:17.010" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about this is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.640" end="01:24:20.760" style="s2">when you put things in context of all</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.010" end="01:24:23.850" style="s2">four quadrants things that you seem</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.760" end="01:24:24.630" style="s2">instinctively drawn to that maybe don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.850" end="01:24:27.000" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.630" end="01:24:28.770" style="s2">seem to make as much justifiable sense</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.000" end="01:24:30.990" style="s2">from the you know like just the now me</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.770" end="01:24:33.090" style="s2">perspective start to make a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.990" end="01:24:34.590" style="s2">sense and so it&#39;s I think it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.090" end="01:24:38.220" style="s2">cool how when you bring all these things</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.590" end="01:24:41.850" style="s2">in then you&#39;re you&#39;re like deeper drives</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.220" end="01:24:43.740" style="s2">start to all of a sudden make more sense</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.850" end="01:24:46.380" style="s2">and instead seem and seem less of some</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.740" end="01:24:49.170" style="s2">kind of like weird that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.380" end="01:24:51.420" style="s2">trying to justify to yourself so I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.170" end="01:24:55.020" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty cool uh hundred one</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.420" end="01:25:01.350" style="s2">hundred percent one hundred percent so</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.020" end="01:25:03.540" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go and talk again just a quick</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.350" end="01:25:12.510" style="s2">thing yeah somebody did share something</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.540" end="01:25:13.500" style="s2">in chat as well Oh Thank You Lee yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.510" end="01:25:19.740" style="s2">yeah totally</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.500" end="01:25:22.560" style="s2">I appreciate that yeah so I wanna so I</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.740" end="01:25:25.020" style="s2">want to show you on my bento and I want</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.560" end="01:25:27.270" style="s2">to talk about sort of the last steps of</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.020" end="01:25:28.710" style="s2">how I got there and and give you an</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.270" end="01:25:32.730" style="s2">opportunity to do that too we won&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.710" end="01:25:34.590" style="s2">all the way with that I see we do or</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.730" end="01:25:37.140" style="s2">should I so here I showed this before</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.590" end="01:25:40.260" style="s2">but here&#39;s the bento that I made this</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.140" end="01:25:42.210" style="s2">was me doing exactly what you all just</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.260" end="01:25:43.650" style="s2">did you know maybe I gave myself a</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.210" end="01:25:47.820" style="s2">little bit longer time to write down</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.650" end="01:25:49.380" style="s2">more things and I ended up trying to</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.820" end="01:25:51.030" style="s2">shorten that I had this idea like how</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.380" end="01:25:53.430" style="s2">can I get these things all down to like</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.030" end="01:25:55.680" style="s2">four or five words that I&#39;ll remember so</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.430" end="01:25:56.760" style="s2">I ended up circling things in here and</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.680" end="01:25:59.280" style="s2">trying to pull out what seemed</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.760" end="01:26:03.630" style="s2">consistent and then I ended up with this</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.280" end="01:26:05.310" style="s2">so this is my bento so my now me the way</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.630" end="01:26:07.260" style="s2">I end up summing up like what&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.310" end="01:26:10.290" style="s2">in line with my now me is showing people</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.260" end="01:26:11.700" style="s2">the matrix like I can make a living that</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.290" end="01:26:14.010" style="s2">way writing a book and whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.700" end="01:26:17.040" style="s2">that&#39;s also like where I&#39;m most just</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.010" end="01:26:19.380" style="s2">clicking my future me I found was about</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.040" end="01:26:21.510" style="s2">creating harmony and not selling out I</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.380" end="01:26:24.540" style="s2">saw this like don&#39;t sell out thing was</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.510" end="01:26:27.270" style="s2">just came up a lot that was interesting</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.540" end="01:26:28.800" style="s2">my now us was about my family and</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.270" end="01:26:31.470" style="s2">friends but what I was really focused on</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.800" end="01:26:33.540" style="s2">was deep time focus like those are the</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.470" end="01:26:35.370" style="s2">traits most important to me and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.540" end="01:26:37.440" style="s2">future us that I imagine it&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.370" end="01:26:38.190" style="s2">matrix it&#39;s not imagining there are no</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.440" end="01:26:40.980" style="s2">hidden defaults but</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.190" end="01:26:43.290" style="s2">like how do we iterate on that and so</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.980" end="01:26:46.140" style="s2">this is something that I have as my home</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.290" end="01:26:47.760" style="s2">screen on my phone that picture on the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.140" end="01:26:49.949" style="s2">left that&#39;s my desk sitting right next</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.760" end="01:26:52.890" style="s2">to me right now but these are things</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.949" end="01:26:54.570" style="s2">that I look at and think about and</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.890" end="01:26:58.560" style="s2">actually actively use when making</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.570" end="01:27:00.480" style="s2">decisions so an example a real example</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.560" end="01:27:02.550" style="s2">that changed how I thought about things</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.480" end="01:27:05.969" style="s2">is that one of the ways I make it living</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.550" end="01:27:07.500" style="s2">is as like a paid speaker and I will</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.969" end="01:27:09.510" style="s2">sometimes get asked to do talks for</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.500" end="01:27:12.510" style="s2">companies that I don&#39;t like or agree</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.510" end="01:27:14.280" style="s2">with and I always say no always say no</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.510" end="01:27:15.540" style="s2">to these things but I still like</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.280" end="01:27:19.170" style="s2">whenever I have to consider this</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.540" end="01:27:21.210" style="s2">question I get angsty and like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.170" end="01:27:23.520" style="s2">frustrating its emotionally difficult</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.210" end="01:27:24.870" style="s2">for me so I decided I would ask the bent</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.520" end="01:27:26.699" style="s2">oh I got another one of these and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.870" end="01:27:29.010" style="s2">asked the bento and it was interesting</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.699" end="01:27:31.530" style="s2">my now me which wants me to show people</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.010" end="01:27:33.630" style="s2">the matrix says yes I should do the talk</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.530" end="01:27:35.219" style="s2">for this company and also this provides</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.630" end="01:27:38.520" style="s2">for yourself but this is in line with</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.219" end="01:27:40.830" style="s2">who you are my now us not totally</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.520" end="01:27:42.239" style="s2">relevant but you know I did find it</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.830" end="01:27:43.710" style="s2">relevant that I didn&#39;t think I should</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.239" end="01:27:45.719" style="s2">just be preaching to the choir</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.710" end="01:27:47.480" style="s2">I felt like my now us was bigger than</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.719" end="01:27:50.460" style="s2">just like people I already knew the</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.480" end="01:27:52.440" style="s2">future us giving a talk for a company I</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.460" end="01:27:54.270" style="s2">don&#39;t like absolutely like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.440" end="01:27:56.430" style="s2">gonna build a better matrix it&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.270" end="01:27:59.790" style="s2">are the people but then I saw my future</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.430" end="01:28:01.500" style="s2">me voice which just says no cuz it says</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.790" end="01:28:05.600" style="s2">hey you might be selling out like are</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.500" end="01:28:08.400" style="s2">you a sellout and when I wrote this out</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.600" end="01:28:10.350" style="s2">it was like a enormous weight had been</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.400" end="01:28:12.330" style="s2">lifted because I always have that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.350" end="01:28:15.300" style="s2">you selling are you a sellout voice and</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.330" end="01:28:17.520" style="s2">now suddenly like I could I could put in</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.300" end="01:28:19.800" style="s2">a place and I could like respect it and</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.520" end="01:28:22.170" style="s2">and I thought of it I thought of this</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.800" end="01:28:23.969" style="s2">voice as less like something I had to</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.170" end="01:28:25.980" style="s2">wrestle with and more like a bouncer</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.969" end="01:28:27.300" style="s2">standing outside the door and I could</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.980" end="01:28:30.210" style="s2">tap it on the shoulder and I could say</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.300" end="01:28:32.640" style="s2">no no this is cool but I&#39;m I&#39;m allowing</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.210" end="01:28:35.190" style="s2">you to be here as like a values check</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.640" end="01:28:37.170" style="s2">for me as a like a yeah a bouncer for</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.190" end="01:28:40.800" style="s2">these kinds of choices and so this</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.170" end="01:28:42.480" style="s2">really shifted how I thought another</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.800" end="01:28:45.239" style="s2">example another example which I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.480" end="01:28:47.130" style="s2">include in here and the slides was a</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.239" end="01:28:49.020" style="s2">smoker asking whether they should quit</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.130" end="01:28:51.250" style="s2">smoking and what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.020" end="01:28:53.650" style="s2">the smoker is now us their future</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.250" end="01:28:55.930" style="s2">in their future me all say to quit like</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.650" end="01:28:58.270" style="s2">it&#39;s bad for your family you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.930" end="01:29:00.610" style="s2">alive in the future but the smokers now</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.270" end="01:29:02.830" style="s2">me which is rationally addicted to</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.610" end="01:29:04.450" style="s2">nicotine it says to keep smoking and it</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.830" end="01:29:06.010" style="s2">is like rationale for doing so because</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.450" end="01:29:08.650" style="s2">quitting will suck it&#39;s addicted</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.010" end="01:29:10.510" style="s2">nicotine so we struggled a reason with</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.650" end="01:29:13.810" style="s2">those voices because they are rational</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.510" end="01:29:16.180" style="s2">but just on like a limited point of view</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.810" end="01:29:18.880" style="s2">so the question is expanding that</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.180" end="01:29:20.410" style="s2">perspective and then allowing that to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.880" end="01:29:22.930" style="s2">a space that you start to operating in</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.410" end="01:29:25.570" style="s2">when making choices this is something</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.930" end="01:29:27.460" style="s2">you have to practice you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.570" end="01:29:28.930" style="s2">now a second nature thing for me I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.460" end="01:29:30.880" style="s2">been doing it for a year like really</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.930" end="01:29:33.640" style="s2">trying to live according to this mindset</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.880" end="01:29:36.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s not always easy but like</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.640" end="01:29:40.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t be teaching it in</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.910" end="01:29:42.520" style="s2">this way if it hasn&#39;t been but so the</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.720" end="01:29:45.370" style="s2">last thing to do would be for you to</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.520" end="01:29:47.800" style="s2">take your your brainstorming sheet that</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.370" end="01:29:51.520" style="s2">you have and to take that second bento</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.800" end="01:29:53.020" style="s2">picture that the printout or you could</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.520" end="01:29:55.030" style="s2">draw it on a piece of paper yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.020" end="01:29:56.890" style="s2">it would be to shorten down what you</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.030" end="01:29:59.650" style="s2">have in each bento down to like four or</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.890" end="01:30:01.660" style="s2">five words a catch phrase something that</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.650" end="01:30:03.400" style="s2">would be on a billboard just something</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.660" end="01:30:04.810" style="s2">that you might remember because if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.400" end="01:30:07.780" style="s2">can remember it then it becomes an</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.810" end="01:30:09.670" style="s2">easier muscle memory so that muscle</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.780" end="01:30:12.100" style="s2">memory for me when making choices as I</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.670" end="01:30:14.140" style="s2">think about something like I just run</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.100" end="01:30:17.890" style="s2">through the bentos and kind of in my</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.140" end="01:30:20.170" style="s2">head I see a you know red X or a green X</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.890" end="01:30:25.630" style="s2">if it&#39;s a yes than a red zero but to</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.170" end="01:30:28.750" style="s2">know but just a way to yeah just keep</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.630" end="01:30:30.640" style="s2">hold of what&#39;s important to you so I</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.750" end="01:30:32.110" style="s2">would encourage you to take this and</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.640" end="01:30:33.550" style="s2">spend a little time to come up with</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.110" end="01:30:37.060" style="s2">those four or five you know three or</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.550" end="01:30:39.340" style="s2">four word phrases someone&#39;s mic is on</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.060" end="01:30:41.140" style="s2">and if you can send that if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.340" end="01:30:42.940" style="s2">yeah love if you did that I&#39;m gonna send</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.140" end="01:30:44.320" style="s2">out something after this and if you want</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.940" end="01:30:47.950" style="s2">to share me your bento with me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.320" end="01:30:55.870" style="s2">interested in seeing it so that the</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.950" end="01:30:58.570" style="s2">simple steps using this mic is on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.870" end="01:31:00.650" style="s2">George&#39;s mic you have the option to meet</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.570" end="01:31:09.020" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.650" end="01:31:11.770" style="s2">oh there we go okay let me fit in here</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.020" end="01:31:11.770" style="s2">we&#39;re almost done</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.340" end="01:31:18.469" style="s2">yes so the so the using the bento in</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.050" end="01:31:20.360" style="s2">five steps you it is very simple when</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.469" end="01:31:22.489" style="s2">facing these should I decisions I find</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.360" end="01:31:24.230" style="s2">it works very just naturally with should</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.489" end="01:31:25.610" style="s2">I decisions you can make anything as</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.230" end="01:31:28.010" style="s2">should I decision if you wanted to but</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.610" end="01:31:29.900" style="s2">he&#39;s asked your bento you run it through</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.010" end="01:31:32.150" style="s2">those values you consider from those</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.900" end="01:31:33.620" style="s2">perspectives and like I did with Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.150" end="01:31:35.900" style="s2">and I think when you look at things that</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.620" end="01:31:37.940" style="s2">way you can understand not just what the</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.900" end="01:31:40.239" style="s2">right choice is but also like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.940" end="01:31:43.790" style="s2">right self coherent way to go about it</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.239" end="01:31:48.110" style="s2">um and I think the power of this idea is</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.790" end="01:31:49.730" style="s2">significant so here I have a bento and</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.110" end="01:31:51.710" style="s2">slightly relabeled where I&#39;ve made now</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.730" end="01:31:56.120" style="s2">us to save relationships and I&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.710" end="01:31:57.560" style="s2">future me to say values and imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.120" end="01:31:59.360" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at this and they you to</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.560" end="01:32:01.460" style="s2">that that is you your child that is the</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.360" end="01:32:04.100" style="s2">next generation and then we can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.460" end="01:32:06.040" style="s2">building their bento on to the previous</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.100" end="01:32:08.060" style="s2">generations and you can see how the</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.040" end="01:32:10.429" style="s2">relationships of the generation before</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.060" end="01:32:12.530" style="s2">and the values of the generation before</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.429" end="01:32:15.920" style="s2">form the foundation and for who that</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.530" end="01:32:20.600" style="s2">next person becomes this is how this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.920" end="01:32:23.150" style="s2">how values change or stay over time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.600" end="01:32:25.010" style="s2">by each generation sort of continuing</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.150" end="01:32:27.110" style="s2">them pushing them forward and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.010" end="01:32:29.210" style="s2">ultimately this process in the same way</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.110" end="01:32:31.850" style="s2">we learned it from our parents and this</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.210" end="01:32:33.770" style="s2">shift of like a values helix moving</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.850" end="01:32:36.980" style="s2">across generations this is what makes it</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.770" end="01:32:38.989" style="s2">where 36% of college students believe</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.980" end="01:32:41.570" style="s2">being rich is essential from you know to</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.989" end="01:32:43.429" style="s2">82% believing that today it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.570" end="01:32:45.260" style="s2">gradual change over time and that comes</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.429" end="01:32:48.710" style="s2">from that focus on values on that focus</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.260" end="01:32:50.929" style="s2">on future us and we live in life we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.710" end="01:32:52.630" style="s2">only bit focused on that now me we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.929" end="01:32:54.860" style="s2">just blind to these others bases</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.630" end="01:32:56.300" style="s2">relatively not contributing to the</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.860" end="01:32:58.880" style="s2">bigger picture we&#39;re not contributing to</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.300" end="01:33:01.719" style="s2">the longer-term so I think the power of</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.880" end="01:33:03.949" style="s2">acting from your bento and seeing our</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.719" end="01:33:06.710" style="s2">self-interest and the rational value</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.949" end="01:33:08.600" style="s2">space through this frame I think can be</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.710" end="01:33:11.840" style="s2">incredibly powerful and can be hugely</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.600" end="01:33:14.449" style="s2">transformational there&#39;s a lot of steps</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.840" end="01:33:17.329" style="s2">between here and there but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.449" end="01:33:19.820" style="s2">like turning left you need a destination</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.329" end="01:33:25.010" style="s2">worth going towards and the patience to</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.820" end="01:33:28.039" style="s2">get there so this whole lecture and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.010" end="01:33:29.949" style="s2">idea bento ISM is introduced in a book</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.039" end="01:33:32.479" style="s2">that comes out three weeks from today</p>

<p begin="01:35:59.909" end="01:36:03.869" style="s2">suggestion actually that maybe at the</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.979" end="01:36:06.479" style="s2">end we each take a turn introducing</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.869" end="01:36:08.039" style="s2">ourselves and maybe saying just</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.479" end="01:36:10.739" style="s2">something that we leave with just and</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.039" end="01:36:12.239" style="s2">your name and either a question or a</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.739" end="01:36:14.249" style="s2">learning that we leave with maybe we can</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.239" end="01:36:16.829" style="s2">start with Jake here in the top left and</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.249" end="01:36:18.539" style="s2">I&#39;ll go and then we&#39;ll go to Ryan and</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.829" end="01:36:25.349" style="s2">we&#39;ll just go around that Sun all right</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.539" end="01:36:28.199" style="s2">all right okay Thank You auntie that was</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.349" end="01:36:30.059" style="s2">great I guess the thing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.199" end="01:36:32.309" style="s2">thinking about and and leaving with is</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.059" end="01:36:34.550" style="s2">it occurred to me when you were giving</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.309" end="01:36:38.550" style="s2">the first part of your presentation that</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.550" end="01:36:39.899" style="s2">if you don&#39;t incentivize people to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.550" end="01:36:42.479" style="s2">socially responsible in one way or</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.899" end="01:36:44.249" style="s2">another then you get a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.479" end="01:36:46.079" style="s2">perversion of what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.249" end="01:36:49.679" style="s2">values driven business that is in fact</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.079" end="01:36:52.379" style="s2">covertly kind of driven by by market</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.679" end="01:36:54.030" style="s2">forces in the same way and so the</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.379" end="01:36:57.359" style="s2">question that that&#39;s sticking around for</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.030" end="01:36:59.129" style="s2">me is how can you design systems to</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.359" end="01:37:00.149" style="s2">incentivize those behaviors I suspect</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.129" end="01:37:03.199" style="s2">that&#39;s something you probably talk more</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.149" end="01:37:06.179" style="s2">about in your book so Thanks</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.199" end="01:37:09.179" style="s2">great thank you</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.179" end="01:37:11.339" style="s2">yeah cuz I&#39;m Yancey this is I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.179" end="01:37:13.319" style="s2">that it&#39;s possible to do something like</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.339" end="01:37:15.149" style="s2">this on the Internet and I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.319" end="01:37:16.979" style="s2">gonna send a survey after so I&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.149" end="01:37:19.679" style="s2">out a little bit more but like thank you</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.979" end="01:37:21.989" style="s2">all for being part of this this has been</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.679" end="01:37:24.119" style="s2">so strange to just talk alone in front</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.989" end="01:37:27.179" style="s2">of a camera to my computer for so long</p>

<p begin="01:38:10.800" end="01:38:14.599" style="s2">I need to put a bit more thought into</p>

<p begin="01:39:47.240" end="01:39:50.960" style="s2">of the people who are kind of like into</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.460" end="01:39:53.090" style="s2">the game be space that&#39;s the word that</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.960" end="01:39:55.190" style="s2">constantly is being used as coherence</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.090" end="01:39:57.290" style="s2">the guy that&#39;s coming on next week that</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.190" end="01:40:00.440" style="s2">I mentioned to you Jordan hall he uses</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.290" end="01:40:01.760" style="s2">that term a lot and the moments when I</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.440" end="01:40:04.220" style="s2">actually feel like I have that self</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.760" end="01:40:06.230" style="s2">coherence and reflecting on it now those</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.220" end="01:40:10.190" style="s2">kind of four boxes feel a line for that</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.230" end="01:40:12.620" style="s2">one moment mm-hm so I&#39;m taking away of</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.190" end="01:40:14.000" style="s2">that kind of just being sensitive to</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.620" end="01:40:15.650" style="s2">that felt sense feeling of when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.000" end="01:40:17.060" style="s2">not in coherence and then in going to</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.650" end="01:40:24.130" style="s2">some kind of activity like this</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.060" end="01:40:24.130" style="s2">to get back into it mm-hmm great Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.900" end="01:40:30.080" style="s2">first thing I&#39;m taking away from this is</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.160" end="01:40:31.400" style="s2">that well of course I&#39;d really like</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.080" end="01:40:33.470" style="s2">these mean ups like a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.400" end="01:40:38.090" style="s2">been saying but one thing I particularly</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.470" end="01:40:41.180" style="s2">like is how this meetup is oriented</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.090" end="01:40:43.040" style="s2">towards like self-actualization which is</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.180" end="01:40:44.900" style="s2">going to be a really important part of</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.040" end="01:40:46.610" style="s2">any like collective movement because</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.900" end="01:40:49.790" style="s2">people need to take time for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.610" end="01:40:52.880" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the serenity thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.790" end="01:40:55.010" style="s2">with Jordan Hall and game B and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.880" end="01:40:59.840" style="s2">other thing is I don&#39;t remember what it</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.010" end="01:41:02.320" style="s2">was that was gonna say yeah that&#39;s it I</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.840" end="01:41:09.380" style="s2">guess thanks a lot</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.320" end="01:41:11.300" style="s2">and film all right both things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.380" end="01:41:13.700" style="s2">really true with what Pearce said I</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.300" end="01:41:17.750" style="s2">think it was interesting for me to feel</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.700" end="01:41:21.800" style="s2">the coherence between all four boxes all</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.750" end="01:41:24.029" style="s2">simultaneously coming together and then</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.800" end="01:41:26.009" style="s2">just looking this as like a simple to</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.029" end="01:41:27.719" style="s2">two things coming to me at the right</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.009" end="01:41:29.639" style="s2">time where it&#39;s like I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.719" end="01:41:32.249" style="s2">thinking about myself it&#39;s like also</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.639" end="01:41:34.739" style="s2">think about us and then there&#39;s is also</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.249" end="01:41:37.979" style="s2">a dimensionality around time and I think</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.739" end="01:41:39.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just me at the right time yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.979" end="01:41:42.389" style="s2">then the third thing is around I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.839" end="01:41:46.859" style="s2">think it&#39;s just me and the collective</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.389" end="01:41:49.859" style="s2">there&#39;s like a spectrum that goes from</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.859" end="01:41:52.829" style="s2">me family to society to larger that</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.859" end="01:41:55.589" style="s2">obviously this is a simple like two by</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.829" end="01:42:03.559" style="s2">two but it can expand it to think maybe</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.589" end="01:42:03.559" style="s2">someone like that as well love them Paul</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.809" end="01:42:13.499" style="s2">yeah a couple take this one I love</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.759" end="01:42:15.389" style="s2">anything that has to do with we space</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.499" end="01:42:17.279" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.389" end="01:42:18.869" style="s2">that&#39;s a consideration here but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.279" end="01:42:23.339" style="s2">definitely something I feel like fits</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.869" end="01:42:25.829" style="s2">with that one of my big realizations and</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.339" end="01:42:28.409" style="s2">takeaways is that&#39;s I think I have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.829" end="01:42:33.979" style="s2">of consideration for a future us and now</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.409" end="01:42:38.219" style="s2">me but I could work a lot more on now us</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.979" end="01:42:40.439" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of vacancy there that and</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.219" end="01:42:44.189" style="s2">I&#39;m really hungry for a bento box right</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.439" end="01:42:48.659" style="s2">now it&#39;s though it&#39;s make you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.189" end="01:42:52.259" style="s2">fall next you stab you don&#39;t have a name</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.659" end="01:42:54.059" style="s2">they&#39;re just staff but hi howdy</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.259" end="01:43:00.059" style="s2">it&#39;s Ashley I&#39;m sorry about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.059" end="01:43:04.739" style="s2">it&#39;s a work so I I truly appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.059" end="01:43:07.169" style="s2">communal space I have really been</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.739" end="01:43:09.779" style="s2">energised by the interaction I like the</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.169" end="01:43:11.399" style="s2">breakout sessions that&#39;s new to me and</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.779" end="01:43:15.269" style="s2">so I thought it was really productive</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.399" end="01:43:17.729" style="s2">and then we came back as in a full</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.269" end="01:43:21.359" style="s2">circle which is always nice</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.729" end="01:43:23.099" style="s2">this is going to be really good for me</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.359" end="01:43:26.129" style="s2">because I am my counselor I wear a</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.099" end="01:43:29.309" style="s2">counseling hat and so mine I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.129" end="01:43:32.219" style="s2">be using this with students because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.309" end="01:43:34.639" style="s2">an educator and I think it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.219" end="01:43:39.380" style="s2">helpful and guess who gets the credit</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.639" end="01:43:41.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve done an amazing job here intern</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.380" end="01:43:48.570" style="s2">collectivizing our action are single</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.970" end="01:43:50.340" style="s2">action steps so to to see like I think</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.570" end="01:43:53.270" style="s2">it was Paul I&#39;m sorry about the names</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.340" end="01:43:56.130" style="s2">but seeing the spectrum and how each</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.270" end="01:43:59.490" style="s2">decision or choice or value based</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.130" end="01:44:01.380" style="s2">decision that we make affects all of us</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.490" end="01:44:02.880" style="s2">is really important than I really like</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.380" end="01:44:10.010" style="s2">how it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.880" end="01:44:16.490" style="s2">so thanks thanks for you thanks oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.010" end="01:44:20.190" style="s2">hey so for me it&#39;s the tool itself I</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.490" end="01:44:22.980" style="s2">feel like I think about the way I make</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.190" end="01:44:26.340" style="s2">decisions using this spectrum that</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.980" end="01:44:29.010" style="s2">exists right now in self coherence but</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.340" end="01:44:32.840" style="s2">this allows me to draw all these fine</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.010" end="01:44:35.820" style="s2">lines to use as a tool to also better</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.840" end="01:44:37.800" style="s2">talk about the way I&#39;m thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.820" end="01:44:40.710" style="s2">with with others around me</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.800" end="01:44:42.840" style="s2">some people are often confused by some</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.710" end="01:44:46.860" style="s2">of the decisions I make and and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.840" end="01:44:49.500" style="s2">always able to express why and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.860" end="01:44:54.000" style="s2">this is a good tool for talking to out</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.500" end="01:44:59.540" style="s2">there&#39;s in in expressing that totally</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.000" end="01:44:59.540" style="s2">totally I really like that usually</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.660" end="01:45:13.830" style="s2">absolutely loved it so I do like to pay</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.610" end="01:45:15.630" style="s2">a lot of attention to where precisely</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.830" end="01:45:16.410" style="s2">the new tools that I came across they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.630" end="01:45:18.360" style="s2">really useful</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.410" end="01:45:20.820" style="s2">I think this is a really good place in</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.360" end="01:45:22.350" style="s2">my life again I sort of echoing my</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.820" end="01:45:25.110" style="s2">earlier comment that I&#39;m taking away</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.350" end="01:45:28.140" style="s2">here is that there are there&#39;s a space</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.110" end="01:45:29.460" style="s2">of decision making where I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.140" end="01:45:32.220" style="s2">put in all the work of going through all</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.460" end="01:45:33.870" style="s2">my dollies one by one but I also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.220" end="01:45:36.180" style="s2">want to like do nothing but just by</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.870" end="01:45:39.960" style="s2">sheer instinct and I tend to actually</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.180" end="01:45:41.610" style="s2">operate just jumping back and forth I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.960" end="01:45:42.540" style="s2">been a better tool kit that allows you</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.610" end="01:45:43.989" style="s2">to operate somewhere in the mill and</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.540" end="01:45:47.170" style="s2">find a balance</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.989" end="01:45:54.340" style="s2">this is really nice I am in love with</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.170" end="01:45:56.170" style="s2">the idea of coherence and I look I I</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.340" end="01:45:59.380" style="s2">will not actually want to interesting</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.170" end="01:46:02.560" style="s2">things that I have in fact started</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.380" end="01:46:04.420" style="s2">treating a very long-term value as an</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.560" end="01:46:06.570" style="s2">immediate value because I spent some</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.420" end="01:46:09.610" style="s2">time sort of looking up in values</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.570" end="01:46:11.469" style="s2">integrity is really important and then</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.610" end="01:46:15.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve now come to like literally feel</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.469" end="01:46:18.280" style="s2">pleasure when I&#39;m when I think we in the</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.040" end="01:46:20.820" style="s2">immediate term so I have this mnemonic</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.280" end="01:46:22.750" style="s2">that I do exudate in the short term</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.820" end="01:46:25.030" style="s2">decision-making framework in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.750" end="01:46:26.730" style="s2">where I go integrity is important but</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.030" end="01:46:30.070" style="s2">when I looked at the four quadrants</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.730" end="01:46:32.530" style="s2">integrity is actually clearly a future V</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.070" end="01:46:34.090" style="s2">value yeah so it&#39;s interesting that I am</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.530" end="01:46:36.100" style="s2">still like developing a little bit and I</p>
