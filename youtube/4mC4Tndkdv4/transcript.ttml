<p begin="00:00:07.040" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">welcome it&#39;s great to be here again for</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.019" end="00:00:16.350" style="s2">another live Q&amp;A I&#39;d like to begin by</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:19.400" style="s2">once again thanking all my subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.350" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2">my viewers and all my patreon supporters</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.400" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">so as always we&#39;ll begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">questions from the patreon supporters</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:30.449" style="s2">and so let&#39;s get to them this is always</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:32.160" style="s2">so so interesting and enjoyable and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.449" end="00:00:35.790" style="s2">noticed that the the questions are</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.160" end="00:00:38.219" style="s2">getting very very incisive and their</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:40.940" style="s2">persecution so that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">impressive okay so the first question is</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.940" end="00:00:46.590" style="s2">from patreon supporter McKenzie Levitt</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.129" end="00:00:49.469" style="s2">and the question is what is the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.590" end="00:00:51.510" style="s2">useful way to characterize relationship</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.469" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">between mind and brain so Thank You</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.510" end="00:01:00.120" style="s2">McKenzie for your support so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:03.270" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very hard question I you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.120" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">could say and I think it would not be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.270" end="00:01:06.810" style="s2">dismissive you could say that almost all</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:08.610" style="s2">of my work as a cognitive sciences</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.810" end="00:01:11.189" style="s2">scientist is directed towards trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.610" end="00:01:13.229" style="s2">answer that question if you&#39;d asked me</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.189" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">that when I was in grad school was</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.229" end="00:01:18.299" style="s2">shortly shortly thereafter I would have</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">given sort of a classic answer like</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">Jerry Fodor would give and say that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">mind is the software and the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:28.020" style="s2">the hardware and like you can make the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">distinction between like for example</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.020" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">word and then what&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">which is a way in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">organizing information processing as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">program that can be moved around to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">different hardware and whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">hardware is the actual you know physical</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">stuff inside the machine and well I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">think there&#39;s some important kernel of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">truth in that I think the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">is now moved so I would now characterize</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">the relationship in a way that has moved</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">beyond that computational metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">whereas I think of minds relationships</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">the brain as the mind is a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">system that is being run it can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">implemented on many different material</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">platforms but that dynamical system is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.710" style="s2">not just in the head in the brain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">between the brain and the body</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.710" end="00:02:21.030" style="s2">and between the brain body at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:25.260" style="s2">embodied brain and the world and in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:26.910" style="s2">form of dynamical coupling and so just</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.260" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">to give you a perhaps a different</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.910" end="00:02:31.290" style="s2">analogy then instead of it like being</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:32.610" style="s2">the software/hardware distinction you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.290" end="00:02:36.360" style="s2">can think of a dynamical system is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:39.080" style="s2">something like as I&#39;ve sometimes use</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">like combustion combustion is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.080" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">self-organizing system but you know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:45.570" style="s2">can run on different things and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:47.030" style="s2">why you can catch fire with wood and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.570" end="00:02:49.740" style="s2">then the what fire can spread to other</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.030" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">material and the combustion right it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.740" end="00:02:53.490" style="s2">isn&#39;t loft of particular material</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:55.050" style="s2">implication it has to be connected to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.490" end="00:02:57.630" style="s2">you and implemented in something</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.050" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">material but it&#39;s not reducible to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.630" end="00:03:02.250" style="s2">that material property so that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:06.110" style="s2">would answer that the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.250" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">answering that question that way though</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.110" end="00:03:10.440" style="s2">just to be as fair to the question as</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:11.850" style="s2">possible is the word mind is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.440" end="00:03:14.940" style="s2">equivocal you could be referring to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.850" end="00:03:18.210" style="s2">intelligence in which I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.940" end="00:03:19.770" style="s2">talking about and in the mind is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.210" end="00:03:21.660" style="s2">dynamical system that&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.770" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">relevance realization on the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.660" end="00:03:26.610" style="s2">embedded brain you could be talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">about consciousness which i think is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.610" end="00:03:31.320" style="s2">higher-order thing etc so I&#39;m answering</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:35.370" style="s2">the questions for the very abstractly so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.320" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">it would cover both intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.370" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">consciousness and so that&#39;s why now</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:42.750" style="s2">entering it&#39;s somewhat abstract Lee in</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:46.860" style="s2">terms of its a dynamical system that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:50.010" style="s2">running on the embodied and embedded</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.860" end="00:03:53.940" style="s2">brain insofar as you are enacting</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.010" end="00:03:56.300" style="s2">sensory motor behavior as you attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.940" end="00:04:00.710" style="s2">solve problems and achieve your goals so</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.300" end="00:04:03.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the that&#39;s sort of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.710" end="00:04:07.020" style="s2">overall abstract answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.570" end="00:04:08.550" style="s2">like I say I think that time is a better</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.020" end="00:04:09.990" style="s2">way to answer that question which I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.550" end="00:04:11.370" style="s2">don&#39;t have time for right now is to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.990" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">away in ants and I try to give one</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.370" end="00:04:16.049" style="s2">example of it answer one of them like</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">what&#39;s intelligence and then perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.049" end="00:04:20.460" style="s2">what&#39;s consciousness and then more</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:21.579" style="s2">difficult while what is that what is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.460" end="00:04:23.379" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.579" end="00:04:27.550" style="s2">what&#39;s that what kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.379" end="00:04:29.020" style="s2">that is does it air to the brain but at</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.550" end="00:04:30.819" style="s2">least trying to give you an overall</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.020" end="00:04:34.120" style="s2">response and so thank you very much for</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.819" end="00:04:35.949" style="s2">that question answering that question is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.120" end="00:04:37.409" style="s2">kind of an answer today answering that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.949" end="00:04:40.210" style="s2">question not only for each one</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.409" end="00:04:42.190" style="s2">intelligence consciousness to solve but</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.210" end="00:04:46.150" style="s2">ant being able to answer that now for</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.190" end="00:04:48.370" style="s2">each and all in an integrated manner I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.150" end="00:04:50.889" style="s2">think is the primary goal that defines</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.370" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">cognitive sciences discipline so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.889" end="00:04:55.389" style="s2">saying that to indicate to you that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">giving you what I think is the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.389" end="00:04:59.710" style="s2">proposal for how we will eventually be</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:00.909" style="s2">able to answer that question I need you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.710" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">to understand that it&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.909" end="00:05:05.919" style="s2">controversial and it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:09.310" style="s2">that we have completed cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.919" end="00:05:10.629" style="s2">is not in any way it finished in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.310" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">position to claim to have finished</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.629" end="00:05:16.949" style="s2">answering that question by any means</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:22.659" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s move to the next question</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.949" end="00:05:25.090" style="s2">so this is also from McKenzie and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.659" end="00:05:29.590" style="s2">is what is your favorite example of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.090" end="00:05:33.789" style="s2">film that symbolizes the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.590" end="00:05:37.779" style="s2">ah that&#39;s that&#39;s very good there&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.789" end="00:05:40.569" style="s2">depends what by what you mean I like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.779" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">matrix insofar as it represents the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.569" end="00:05:45.729" style="s2">meaning crisis but also portrays</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:48.340" style="s2">neoplatonism and narcissism as the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.729" end="00:05:51.250" style="s2">answer to the meeting crisis so the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.340" end="00:05:53.080" style="s2">the meeting crisis is symbolized writers</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.250" end="00:05:55.060" style="s2">of course he feels and then this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.080" end="00:05:57.190" style="s2">where in the linear as a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.060" end="00:05:59.650" style="s2">Morpheus and he talks about how he you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.190" end="00:06:02.379" style="s2">know things just don&#39;t feel right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.650" end="00:06:03.879" style="s2">like a splinter in his mind and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.379" end="00:06:05.590" style="s2">that&#39;s very much a way of trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.879" end="00:06:08.229" style="s2">a phenomenology of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.590" end="00:06:10.599" style="s2">that sense of that knowing sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.229" end="00:06:13.300" style="s2">being out of sorts and other place and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.599" end="00:06:15.190" style="s2">disconnected from oneself and reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.300" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">and then what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.190" end="00:06:19.569" style="s2">that&#39;s metaphor and that is understood</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:21.099" style="s2">in through the metaphor the the gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.569" end="00:06:23.229" style="s2">metaphor the Neoplatonic metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.099" end="00:06:26.469" style="s2">cave the cave that has becoming the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.229" end="00:06:27.879" style="s2">entrapped the entrapping prison and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.469" end="00:06:30.460" style="s2">that brings we&#39;re there also a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.879" end="00:06:33.460" style="s2">entrapment which I sometimes wonder is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.460" end="00:06:35.500" style="s2">that perhaps sometimes the people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.460" end="00:06:39.220" style="s2">are criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.500" end="00:06:43.180" style="s2">physicalism from a religious perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.220" end="00:06:44.940" style="s2">if one of their motives is they feel</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.550" end="00:06:56.920" style="s2">is the case I&#39;m putting that out as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.800" end="00:06:59.080" style="s2">potential hypothesis to explore in</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.920" end="00:07:01.500" style="s2">discussion with people then I would like</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.380" end="00:07:11.920" style="s2">of addressing it I think also the true</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.920" end="00:07:17.620" style="s2">well and obviously the pun is in his</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.620" end="00:07:22.660" style="s2">also has a sort of a gnostic theme he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.060" end="00:07:34.450" style="s2">genuinely loves and to the world as it</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.910" end="00:07:37.720" style="s2">really is and of course that again</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.450" end="00:07:38.950" style="s2">represents some of the main things that</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.790" end="00:07:49.419" style="s2">also and so calling it favorite might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.470" end="00:07:51.490" style="s2">the wrong adjective but I think a movie</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.980" end="00:09:14.260" style="s2">represents a shift that we&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.600" end="00:09:17.140" style="s2">our socio-political culture which is the</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.800" end="00:09:41.410" style="s2">inherently absurd position it can it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.950" end="00:09:43.690" style="s2">tries to cover that absurdity by making</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.410" end="00:09:46.750" style="s2">as much of the world absurd around it</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.690" end="00:09:49.330" style="s2">and in that way the suffering of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.750" end="00:09:52.470" style="s2">disjunct between the absurdity of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.330" end="00:09:54.940" style="s2">narcissism and the intelligibility and</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.940" end="00:10:02.830" style="s2">undermined post truth and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.730" end="00:10:04.750" style="s2">and thereby the right the the difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.830" end="00:10:07.210" style="s2">between the absurd inner life of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.700" end="00:10:18.010" style="s2">I think we see that happening in joke or</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:19.180" style="s2">so the ship there the it maybe I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.010" end="00:10:21.970" style="s2">know if it&#39;s going to be a comprehensive</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.970" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">from the zombie mythos to the Joker</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.570" end="00:10:30.850" style="s2">mythos as a way of articulating a new</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:33.820" style="s2">way in which people are appropriating</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.850" end="00:10:35.470" style="s2">and experiencing and interpreting the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.820" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">meaning crisis I think is something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.470" end="00:10:39.550" style="s2">we should all pay very careful attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:41.950" style="s2">to particularly of course because of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.550" end="00:10:47.070" style="s2">intimate connection between the Joker&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.950" end="00:10:47.070" style="s2">program and a random chaotic violence</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.190" end="00:10:56.470" style="s2">so the next question is from the picture</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.750" end="00:10:58.450" style="s2">on Mike most people see themselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.470" end="00:11:00.280" style="s2">world in terms of being a subject in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.450" end="00:11:02.290" style="s2">world of other objects is the split</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.280" end="00:11:04.060" style="s2">between self and other hardwired into it</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.290" end="00:11:06.460" style="s2">or is it something that can be overcome</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.060" end="00:11:07.990" style="s2">with the right spiritual practice so</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.460" end="00:11:10.510" style="s2">thank you very much Mike for your</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.990" end="00:11:12.940" style="s2">support and for your actual question so</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.510" end="00:11:15.150" style="s2">that&#39;s a difficult question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.940" end="00:11:19.110" style="s2">question that I&#39;m actually working on</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.150" end="00:11:23.350" style="s2">right now I&#39;ve done some work with an RA</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.110" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">Elizabeth long I&#39;m also doing some other</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.350" end="00:11:31.800" style="s2">current work on this this question of</p>

<p begin="00:11:31.800" end="00:11:37.030" style="s2">democratic and Madeleine at the end on</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.630" end="00:11:41.800" style="s2">the cognitive continuum from insight to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.030" end="00:11:47.310" style="s2">enlightenment so there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.800" end="00:11:51.150" style="s2">which the subject object distinction</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.310" end="00:11:54.070" style="s2">which is of course was valorized by</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.150" end="00:11:58.300" style="s2">Aristotle into the sort of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.070" end="00:12:02.620" style="s2">logic of his metaphysics there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.300" end="00:12:06.340" style="s2">in which we can overcome that in that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.620" end="00:12:09.280" style="s2">can move to forms of cognition that do</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.340" end="00:12:11.620" style="s2">not depend on a subject predicate format</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.280" end="00:12:14.500" style="s2">in order to be processed which is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.620" end="00:12:16.860" style="s2">core of propositional processing but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.500" end="00:12:18.820" style="s2">might say well even in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.860" end="00:12:20.380" style="s2">procedural and perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.820" end="00:12:22.360" style="s2">states like flow where you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.380" end="00:12:25.900" style="s2">that one there still may be a sort of a</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.430" end="00:12:43.090" style="s2">is no distinction between inner and</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.920" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">progressively move us on a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:51.670" style="s2">where the sense of the egoic</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">autobiographical self and inner and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.670" end="00:12:57.310" style="s2">outer those various phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:13:00.190" style="s2">aspects of self and other can definitely</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.310" end="00:13:02.769" style="s2">be reduced and in some state</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.190" end="00:13:05.160" style="s2">in some states they seem to disappear</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.769" end="00:13:09.250" style="s2">I&#39;ve experienced it myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.160" end="00:13:11.529" style="s2">however I do not think that that then</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.250" end="00:13:14.740" style="s2">means that the self in terms of its</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.529" end="00:13:16.949" style="s2">functionality disappears so if we take</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.740" end="00:13:23.410" style="s2">the machinery of the self to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.949" end="00:13:30.490" style="s2">ultimately the processes by which this</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.410" end="00:13:32.649" style="s2">organism manages manages the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.490" end="00:13:36.250" style="s2">combinatorial explosion of information</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.649" end="00:13:38.829" style="s2">available to it and does framing I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.250" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">think we can move to a state in which we</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.829" end="00:13:43.269" style="s2">are frameless and we&#39;re not framing I</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:47.500" style="s2">don&#39;t think that makes any sense and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.269" end="00:13:49.660" style="s2">in that sense they are always in we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.500" end="00:13:52.139" style="s2">always so I I&#39;m suspicious of people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.660" end="00:13:56.110" style="s2">claim that they completely have no self</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.139" end="00:13:58.689" style="s2">and if the dot if what they mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.110" end="00:14:01.319" style="s2">is there is no process by which</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.689" end="00:14:03.610" style="s2">relevance realization is going on I</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.319" end="00:14:05.230" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that is or Hawaii you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.610" end="00:14:08.019" style="s2">want it I don&#39;t know what it is to be Oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.230" end="00:14:09.430" style="s2">what what what the state looks like it</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.019" end="00:14:11.470" style="s2">may be even it could even be called a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.430" end="00:14:13.000" style="s2">mental state at all in which one is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.470" end="00:14:15.130" style="s2">completely overwhelmed by combinatorial</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.130" end="00:14:24.910" style="s2">be that one so I think there&#39;s always in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.089" end="00:14:27.759" style="s2">this sense the machinery of the self</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.910" end="00:14:29.800" style="s2">that is the machinery of framing in a</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.730" end="00:14:54.850" style="s2">in that sense I think there&#39;s always an</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:56.550" style="s2">inner and an outer there&#39;s distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.850" end="00:14:58.389" style="s2">going on for processing now</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.550" end="00:15:01.000" style="s2">phenomenologically you may not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.389" end="00:15:03.670" style="s2">experiencing in any inner and outer but</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.000" end="00:15:05.949" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure because I&#39;ve studied the</p>

<p begin="00:15:09.370" end="00:15:13.569" style="s2">there so now there&#39;s a unity to it these</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:21.040" style="s2">therefore there&#39;s there&#39;s still the</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.689" end="00:15:45.009" style="s2">point before we should be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.819" end="00:15:46.660" style="s2">in moving from our phenomenology to our</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.730" end="00:15:59.379" style="s2">in which the autobiographical self</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.399" end="00:16:02.110" style="s2">disappears and even the sense of inner</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.379" end="00:16:04.600" style="s2">and outer experience disappears like</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.110" end="00:16:06.249" style="s2">experience those myself doesn&#39;t leave me</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.600" end="00:16:10.449" style="s2">to conclude for reasons that I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.249" end="00:16:14.709" style="s2">argued that the the sort of functioning</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.629" end="00:16:22.089" style="s2">that gives you a cognition it&#39;s coherent</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.089" end="00:16:27.610" style="s2">don&#39;t think that can be made to</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.610" end="00:16:32.679" style="s2">the question then of course remains</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.429" end="00:16:34.929" style="s2">which ones are relevant to our self</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.679" end="00:16:38.829" style="s2">viento and our moral development</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.929" end="00:16:41.290" style="s2">I think overcoming you know biases of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.829" end="00:16:44.619" style="s2">egocentrism getting more flexible in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.290" end="00:16:48.970" style="s2">perspective of framing all these kinds</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.069" end="00:16:59.980" style="s2">altered states facilitate an enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.740" end="00:17:02.139" style="s2">of our cognitive functioning such that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.980" end="00:17:03.639" style="s2">we can address perennial problems of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.139" end="00:17:06.850" style="s2">self-deception and self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.639" end="00:17:08.829" style="s2">behavior I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.850" end="00:17:12.669" style="s2">the that&#39;s the normative standard by</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.829" end="00:17:15.480" style="s2">which we should evaluate these claims to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.669" end="00:17:22.149" style="s2">removing the subject object distinction</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.480" end="00:17:24.370" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure if there is any other</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.149" end="00:17:27.130" style="s2">independent normativity that we could</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.370" end="00:17:30.220" style="s2">bring to bear to evaluate those</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.130" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">it claims so that&#39;s my best attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.220" end="00:17:35.410" style="s2">answer that question that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:39.430" style="s2">good question and I&#39;m gonna be talking a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.410" end="00:17:42.750" style="s2">lot more in after Socrates about</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.430" end="00:17:45.700" style="s2">different kinds of self-knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.750" end="00:17:48.010" style="s2">the the the very great difference before</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.700" end="00:17:50.560" style="s2">you between for example knowing your</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.010" end="00:17:53.650" style="s2">auto by yourself autobiographically and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.560" end="00:17:56.800" style="s2">then becoming metacognitively aware the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.650" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">self-awareness of of your right of your</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.800" end="00:18:02.740" style="s2">of your awareness that kind of direct</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:04.330" style="s2">procedural perspective on metacognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.740" end="00:18:07.300" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to talk a lot about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.330" end="00:18:10.600" style="s2">in in after Socrates so hopefully that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.300" end="00:18:12.820" style="s2">will also give some more a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.600" end="00:18:15.690" style="s2">vocabulary and theoretical grammar to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.820" end="00:18:19.630" style="s2">wrestle with the perennial problem of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.690" end="00:18:22.590" style="s2">what should we think about the our</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.630" end="00:18:26.770" style="s2">adherence to and the nature of the self</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.590" end="00:18:30.370" style="s2">so I&#39;d like to turn to another patreon</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.770" end="00:18:33.400" style="s2">supporter Sergei by carrying that sorry</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.370" end="00:18:34.600" style="s2">Mack Arkin thank you and just let me saw</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.400" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">that I&#39;m sorry for mispronouncing your</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.600" end="00:18:41.140" style="s2">name but take comfort in the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:42.340" style="s2">nobody gets my name right guys so so</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.140" end="00:18:44.560" style="s2">thank you again for your support I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.340" end="00:18:46.090" style="s2">gonna read your question in a recent Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.560" end="00:18:47.620" style="s2">you talked about San Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.090" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">mentioned that his meditation practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.620" end="00:18:51.100" style="s2">is to focus on transforming the mind but</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:53.500" style="s2">not on transforming how the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.100" end="00:18:56.200" style="s2">reveals itself to one&#39;s mind could you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.500" end="00:18:58.600" style="s2">elaborate more on ways on the ways how</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.200" end="00:19:00.280" style="s2">medicate meditation can be adjusted to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.600" end="00:19:02.470" style="s2">focus more on the latter transforming</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.280" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">the world or on other practices that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.470" end="00:19:06.130" style="s2">could be employed for that purpose maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:07.510" style="s2">you could also point to some guidance on</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.130" end="00:19:10.140" style="s2">how to do that practice guided</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.510" end="00:19:13.150" style="s2">meditation course by you or someone else</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.140" end="00:19:15.370" style="s2">so one thing and I&#39;ve argued there</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.150" end="00:19:18.630" style="s2">Senate published a paper with Leo</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.370" end="00:19:20.860" style="s2">Ferraro on this a chapter in the book on</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.630" end="00:19:26.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s it called hypnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.860" end="00:19:28.510" style="s2">meditation towards a contest but is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.920" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">towards the science of conscious flames</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.510" end="00:19:33.130" style="s2">I think is what it&#39;s called and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:36.070" style="s2">an article in there on mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.130" end="00:19:37.450" style="s2">we argued that the meditative practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.070" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">of stepping back and looking at the mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.450" end="00:19:40.430" style="s2">and I made a similar argument</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:42.650" style="s2">in the video skiers should be</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.430" end="00:19:44.060" style="s2">complimented with contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.650" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">practices that are meant to look out</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.060" end="00:19:48.980" style="s2">into how the world is disclosing itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:51.170" style="s2">to you now of course you&#39;re transforming</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.980" end="00:19:52.940" style="s2">the mind but the goal there is to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.170" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">transform the mind in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.940" end="00:19:58.520" style="s2">you&#39;re transforming how the world is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.950" end="00:20:00.350" style="s2">disclosed to you so meta is a practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.520" end="00:20:04.220" style="s2">like that and what you do in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.350" end="00:20:05.480" style="s2">practice is you can do it either</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.220" end="00:20:06.890" style="s2">imaginative layer you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.480" end="00:20:09.050" style="s2">literally but let&#39;s say it imagine Italy</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.890" end="00:20:12.950" style="s2">you would call up the image of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.050" end="00:20:15.050" style="s2">in your life and then you direct a sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.950" end="00:20:16.340" style="s2">of open-heartedness towards them not</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.050" end="00:20:19.130" style="s2">that&#39;s not the goal although I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.340" end="00:20:21.170" style="s2">some versions of loving-kindness or</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.130" end="00:20:22.790" style="s2">contemplative practice misrepresent that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.170" end="00:20:23.870" style="s2">as it&#39;s a method it&#39;s meant to put you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.790" end="00:20:26.450" style="s2">into a state of openness and receptivity</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.870" end="00:20:29.660" style="s2">and what you&#39;re trying to do is become</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.450" end="00:20:31.490" style="s2">aware of the identity you&#39;re assuming</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.660" end="00:20:33.980" style="s2">and the identity or signing that whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.490" end="00:20:36.470" style="s2">Co identification process because that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.980" end="00:20:38.540" style="s2">of course is affecting how the world is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.470" end="00:20:43.070" style="s2">able to disclose itself to you if your</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.540" end="00:20:45.230" style="s2">identity is locked and the right and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:47.000" style="s2">then it&#39;s locked to write the identity</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.230" end="00:20:48.890" style="s2">or assuming is locked and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.000" end="00:20:51.080" style="s2">locked to the identity or signing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.890" end="00:20:53.090" style="s2">things ability to disclose itself to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.080" end="00:20:55.340" style="s2">in new ways is seriously truncated and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.090" end="00:20:57.410" style="s2">hampered your salient landscape it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.340" end="00:21:00.140" style="s2">sort of really boxing it in almost like</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.410" end="00:21:01.970" style="s2">an annoying dog problem so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.140" end="00:21:03.860" style="s2">practices you can do is add meta</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.970" end="00:21:06.730" style="s2">practice and you can you can buy books</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.860" end="00:21:09.500" style="s2">on how to do that or loving-kindness</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.730" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">there is also in the book from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.500" end="00:21:12.350" style="s2">Buddhist tradition there&#39;s what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:14.630" style="s2">contemplating the marks of existence in</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.350" end="00:21:16.550" style="s2">which you enter you first get into a</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.789" end="00:24:42.169" style="s2">ways there&#39;s many other ways like</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.169" end="00:24:47.539" style="s2">relation so I think it has an</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.539" end="00:24:56.299" style="s2">called the transitive and I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.919" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">argue that the the the problem is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.299" end="00:25:01.100" style="s2">words so I&#39;m hesitating because we use</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:03.230" style="s2">these words in a slippery fashion</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.100" end="00:25:06.440" style="s2">subjective and objective are often used</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.230" end="00:25:09.559" style="s2">as ontological terms but they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.440" end="00:25:11.690" style="s2">also epistemological terms they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.559" end="00:25:16.809" style="s2">ways of knowing as opposed to kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.690" end="00:25:21.320" style="s2">being and we slide between them and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.809" end="00:25:25.429" style="s2">insofar as the trend rejected is its own</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.320" end="00:25:27.649" style="s2">ontological category I think it is more</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.429" end="00:25:29.529" style="s2">primordial than subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.649" end="00:25:31.880" style="s2">objectivity as epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.529" end="00:25:34.940" style="s2">categories it&#39;s the ontological thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.880" end="00:25:39.130" style="s2">that grounds the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.940" end="00:25:42.830" style="s2">subjective and objective ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.130" end="00:25:46.130" style="s2">and so I do think it has its own</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.830" end="00:25:48.200" style="s2">ontological status now I think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.130" end="00:25:50.779" style="s2">ultimately maps into the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.200" end="00:25:53.000" style="s2">something like structural realism is</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.779" end="00:25:55.190" style="s2">correct in which I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.000" end="00:25:56.630" style="s2">fundamentally most real and physics</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.190" end="00:25:58.520" style="s2">seems to be moving this way and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.630" end="00:26:00.230" style="s2">there&#39;s many there&#39;s many people in</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.520" end="00:26:01.490" style="s2">theoretical physics are very interested</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.230" end="00:26:04.520" style="s2">in the philosophical position of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.490" end="00:26:06.590" style="s2">structuralism because what structurally</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.520" end="00:26:08.390" style="s2">also you can look at lady mins book</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.590" end="00:26:10.669" style="s2">everything must go as an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.390" end="00:26:12.889" style="s2">and and this is the idea that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.669" end="00:26:16.710" style="s2">what&#39;s most real are the real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.889" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">the real relations and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.710" end="00:26:20.820" style="s2">we should take that as the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:23.070" style="s2">primitive and then see objects and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.820" end="00:26:24.690" style="s2">events and and whatnot coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.070" end="00:26:27.299" style="s2">that I think you could make a good case</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.690" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">and some people have that Whitehead was</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.299" end="00:26:33.629" style="s2">arguing for something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:37.259" style="s2">insofar as trans jacked if &#39;ti is a real</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.629" end="00:26:39.059" style="s2">relationship that grounds subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.259" end="00:26:43.080" style="s2">objectivity in the way I&#39;ve described I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.059" end="00:26:45.389" style="s2">think it is a species of the real</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.080" end="00:26:47.940" style="s2">relations the real patterns that I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.389" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">are ultimately the fundamental building</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.940" end="00:26:53.580" style="s2">blocks now that&#39;s that that of course is</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:55.860" style="s2">a very controversial thing to say the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.580" end="00:26:57.629" style="s2">the west from Aristotle on has tended to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.860" end="00:26:59.879" style="s2">view objects the things that are related</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.629" end="00:27:01.559" style="s2">as primary and then the relation as</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.879" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">derivative which is of course the direct</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.559" end="00:27:07.350" style="s2">opposite of what you see in Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:10.379" style="s2">philosophy in which the relations take</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.350" end="00:27:14.879" style="s2">priority and they&#39;re the relati emerge</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.379" end="00:27:17.759" style="s2">out of the of the relations and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.879" end="00:27:21.210" style="s2">also has to do with the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.759" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">West equates realness with actuality</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.210" end="00:27:28.710" style="s2">whereas Eastern philosophy sees often</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:31.139" style="s2">sees real possibility as more real than</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.710" end="00:27:35.759" style="s2">actuality and so these are some very</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.139" end="00:27:37.710" style="s2">important contrasts but you do see with</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.759" end="00:27:40.889" style="s2">the rise of structural realism and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.710" end="00:27:43.110" style="s2">procession of real patterns the very</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.889" end="00:27:44.249" style="s2">real chance that the West might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.110" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">shifting to something much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.249" end="00:27:50.039" style="s2">analogous to what has been prevalent in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">the East in which real relations and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.039" end="00:27:56.850" style="s2">systems of relations are the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">ground from which everything else can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.850" end="00:28:02.429" style="s2">seen to emerge so that&#39;s my best attempt</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:08.100" style="s2">to answer the question on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.429" end="00:28:10.619" style="s2">ontological status relationship so on</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.080" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">texts available I don&#39;t know there I</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.740" end="00:29:00.929" style="s2">know that future thinkers they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:02.520" style="s2">a believe it&#39;s every Monday they meet</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.929" end="00:29:04.290" style="s2">and do a watch party and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.520" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">through episodes of the awakening in the</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.549" end="00:29:13.320" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a running bibliography</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.250" end="00:29:26.010" style="s2">like I said there are course notes</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.130" end="00:29:28.710" style="s2">because of the watch parties that future</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.010" end="00:29:30.450" style="s2">thinkers are doing excellent discussion</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.710" end="00:29:33.030" style="s2">of my work by the way there by the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.450" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">people that tune in for that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.030" end="00:29:38.340" style="s2">very appreciative and grateful for that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:40.470" style="s2">there&#39;s also some really excellent</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.340" end="00:29:43.380" style="s2">commentary and some of it critical but</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.470" end="00:29:47.220" style="s2">yeah but constructive criticism by</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.380" end="00:29:50.070" style="s2">Andrew Sweeney he&#39;s got he&#39;s got a site</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.220" end="00:29:54.030" style="s2">on the medium where he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.070" end="00:29:55.410" style="s2">commentary on all all the videos and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.030" end="00:29:58.200" style="s2">think it&#39;s an excellent commentary i</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.410" end="00:30:00.990" style="s2">think it makes material very accessible</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.200" end="00:30:03.620" style="s2">without in any way dumbing or watering</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.990" end="00:30:07.190" style="s2">it down so I recommend taking a look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.620" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">that excellent commentary and reflection</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.190" end="00:30:17.220" style="s2">if you want to see some more critical</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:18.390" style="s2">more critical take by Andrew on on my</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.220" end="00:30:19.559" style="s2">work you did take a look not only at</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.390" end="00:30:22.710" style="s2">some of the stuff he does in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.559" end="00:30:26.669" style="s2">commentary I andrew is a great guy we</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.710" end="00:30:29.910" style="s2">have a good relationship so but he and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.669" end="00:30:32.160" style="s2">Alexander Bardot who also I have a have</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.910" end="00:30:38.010" style="s2">a good working relationship with they</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.160" end="00:30:39.420" style="s2">did a recent video on criticizing me and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.010" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">in comparison to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.420" end="00:30:43.290" style="s2">Jordan Peterson I know that I responded</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">it and I think there&#39;s some excellent</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.290" end="00:30:48.810" style="s2">discussion about that okay so let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:52.380" style="s2">a look at the next question from Steven</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.810" end="00:30:55.890" style="s2">last well a patron thank you for your</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.380" end="00:31:00.180" style="s2">support and Jordan Hall has taken to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.890" end="00:31:02.400" style="s2">calling me Johnny D I like it is it cool</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.180" end="00:31:05.430" style="s2">that we started calling you Johnny v um</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.400" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">so I want this there&#39;s a lot more to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.430" end="00:31:11.460" style="s2">that and I yeah I I thought I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:12.870" style="s2">Jordan directly about this so and I need</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.460" end="00:31:19.260" style="s2">to relate this story and I don&#39;t mean to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.870" end="00:31:21.150" style="s2">be overly personal this is about how</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.260" end="00:31:22.260" style="s2">people are going to call me so I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.150" end="00:31:27.770" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate to be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.260" end="00:31:31.950" style="s2">personal right now not that long ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.770" end="00:31:35.540" style="s2">let me turn around and or explain I used</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.950" end="00:31:37.680" style="s2">to live and with being a very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.540" end="00:31:40.410" style="s2">situation for me often socially I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.680" end="00:31:43.410" style="s2">socially phobic and I often did not have</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.410" end="00:31:44.580" style="s2">much in common with the people that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.410" end="00:31:47.940" style="s2">lived around me they were not bad people</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.580" end="00:31:49.380" style="s2">and I&#39;m not judging them as people if</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.940" end="00:31:51.240" style="s2">and when I did that in the past I</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.380" end="00:31:54.270" style="s2">apologize I think that was wrong with me</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.240" end="00:31:57.540" style="s2">like wrong but nevertheless there was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.270" end="00:32:00.180" style="s2">there was disconnect I didn&#39;t belong</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.540" end="00:32:01.740" style="s2">there and I mean this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.180" end="00:32:04.710" style="s2">has happened to me periodically through</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.740" end="00:32:06.750" style="s2">my life a realization of not belonging</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.710" end="00:32:10.740" style="s2">perhaps what I got interested in</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.750" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">relevance realization but so I used to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.740" end="00:32:18.830" style="s2">go to parties and social gatherings and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:21.510" style="s2">there was a there was a woman there and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.830" end="00:32:22.830" style="s2">like we weren&#39;t friends in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.510" end="00:32:24.990" style="s2">spending any time together outside of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.830" end="00:32:28.770" style="s2">these social circumstances but we we</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.990" end="00:32:30.920" style="s2">were very friendly acquaintances and she</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.770" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">was quite high stud status woman she was</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.920" end="00:32:38.090" style="s2">very driven you know attractive halo</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:40.860" style="s2">effect very smart successful mother</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.090" end="00:32:45.570" style="s2">raising great kids so she&#39;s very high</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.860" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">sort of high status and she went out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.570" end="00:32:50.580" style="s2">her way to make me feel welcome when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">would come to those parties and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.580" end="00:32:55.110" style="s2">gatherings</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:57.179" style="s2">and she would do that no one had ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.110" end="00:33:01.620" style="s2">done this before by saying hey it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.179" end="00:33:05.159" style="s2">Johnny ve or welcome Johnny V and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.620" end="00:33:10.110" style="s2">meant a great deal to me and then a</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.159" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">great great deal to me unfortunately and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.110" end="00:33:20.299" style="s2">know that long ago she died quite young</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:25.140" style="s2">and unexpected and very significant loss</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.299" end="00:33:27.510" style="s2">and so when Jordan started doing that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.140" end="00:33:30.450" style="s2">called up and you know it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.510" end="00:33:33.960" style="s2">bittersweet but it called out the deep</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.450" end="00:33:38.850" style="s2">appreciation I had for that wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.960" end="00:33:40.740" style="s2">woman and it also made me feel because I</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.850" end="00:33:44.610" style="s2">thought it was constant he was also</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.740" end="00:33:47.250" style="s2">welcoming me into a social situation in</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.610" end="00:33:49.289" style="s2">the same kind of manner and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.250" end="00:33:50.299" style="s2">deeply deeply appreciated appreciative</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.110" end="00:38:57.780" style="s2">provides counter evidence to that lie</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.900" end="00:38:59.610" style="s2">because what it shows is that can drop</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.610" end="00:39:04.740" style="s2">enhanced then that can really also help</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.310" end="00:39:07.740" style="s2">address you know a tendency towards</p>

<p begin="00:39:25.620" end="00:39:30.780" style="s2">taste for the flow State and then learn</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.650" end="00:40:33.369" style="s2">do you think about animal ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.299" end="00:40:35.680" style="s2">then treatment enrolled in human society</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.369" end="00:40:41.140" style="s2">that&#39;s a very that&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:45.430" style="s2">question so I thought a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.140" end="00:40:47.490" style="s2">and I&#39;ve reflected on it in on my life</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.430" end="00:40:54.339" style="s2">and it&#39;s affected my personal practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.490" end="00:40:55.510" style="s2">so I&#39;ll try to understand sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.339" end="00:40:57.220" style="s2">trying to answer the question about what</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.510" end="00:40:58.690" style="s2">I think but I&#39;m trying to also justify</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.220" end="00:41:02.349" style="s2">it in terms of argumentation because of</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.690" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">course you know this is something that</p>

<p begin="00:41:08.170" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">the sort of one of the primary projects</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:22.329" style="s2">of an ethical way of life is to protect</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.270" end="00:41:30.819" style="s2">argued here in Q&amp;A and I&#39;ve argued on</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.730" end="00:41:36.220" style="s2">the series I think we are wired to find</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.819" end="00:41:38.170" style="s2">I think we are wired to find meaning</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.220" end="00:41:41.230" style="s2">making and meaning makers inherently</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.170" end="00:41:43.569" style="s2">valuable and I think that is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.230" end="00:41:45.910" style="s2">ultimate grounding the the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.569" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">Mitchell I know that with others the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.910" end="00:41:50.820" style="s2">Heidegger talks well I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:55.800" style="s2">the ultimate grounding of ethics the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.820" end="00:41:59.610" style="s2">ethical is that which reliably helps to</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.610" end="00:42:06.360" style="s2">making and meaning makers so I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.090" end="00:42:10.860" style="s2">that insofar as we have good evidence</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.360" end="00:42:15.990" style="s2">for organisms being capable of such</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.860" end="00:42:17.820" style="s2">meaning making we have a obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.990" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">them even though they might not be able</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.820" end="00:42:23.160" style="s2">to reciprocate with justice to us</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.640" end="00:42:26.610" style="s2">because justice is only capable where</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.160" end="00:42:28.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a reciprocity between moral</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.610" end="00:42:32.010" style="s2">agency so I don&#39;t think we can expect</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.860" end="00:42:36.620" style="s2">justice for example from animals but</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.010" end="00:42:39.020" style="s2">nevertheless we should extend ethical</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.620" end="00:42:42.210" style="s2">obligation towards them</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.020" end="00:42:44.040" style="s2">now that gets in that of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.210" end="00:42:46.230" style="s2">always the question about where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.040" end="00:42:49.560" style="s2">where&#39;s the morality groans in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.230" end="00:42:51.750" style="s2">metaphysics and the ontology I&#39;ll tell</p>

<p begin="00:43:12.990" end="00:43:18.030" style="s2">because I think of intelligence as the</p>

<p begin="00:45:09.790" end="00:45:14.830" style="s2">answer the question is honestly and</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.470" end="00:45:19.630" style="s2">thoroughly as I can so for me I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.830" end="00:45:22.200" style="s2">tried to take what seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.630" end="00:45:26.650" style="s2">well evidenced plausible accounts of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.200" end="00:45:30.280" style="s2">creatures that do not show it that do</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.650" end="00:45:31.870" style="s2">clearly have the intelligence that gives</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.280" end="00:45:35.140" style="s2">them the kind of meaning making that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.870" end="00:45:37.810" style="s2">find inherently valuable and therefore I</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.140" end="00:45:40.360" style="s2">extend our moral privileges to them now</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.810" end="00:45:43.990" style="s2">this is on a continuum right if we if</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.360" end="00:45:46.120" style="s2">human beings if their lives are at risk</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.990" end="00:45:48.730" style="s2">and their only way they could survive or</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.120" end="00:45:51.460" style="s2">to kill mammals like perhaps you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.730" end="00:45:55.180" style="s2">certain indigenous communities then of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.460" end="00:45:58.330" style="s2">course and that&#39;s the only way in which</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.180" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">they can survive and not starve then I</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.330" end="00:46:06.680" style="s2">think that becomes a legitimate thing so</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:09.499" style="s2">I think it&#39;s in poor</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.680" end="00:46:17.059" style="s2">that we figure out how to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.499" end="00:46:20.450" style="s2">this and in a very coherent manner and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.059" end="00:46:22.069" style="s2">this is a place in which I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.450" end="00:46:23.240" style="s2">sound too imperialistic but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.069" end="00:46:25.039" style="s2">place in which cognitive science could</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.240" end="00:46:29.349" style="s2">really help make a difference I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.039" end="00:46:33.109" style="s2">until we get very clear on consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.349" end="00:46:37.009" style="s2">and cognition and intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.109" end="00:46:40.819" style="s2">meaning-making we we should stop making</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.009" end="00:46:43.970" style="s2">absolute claims about how we should make</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.819" end="00:46:45.049" style="s2">Earth undertake our ethical practices I</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.970" end="00:46:47.150" style="s2">think we should do what I&#39;ve tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.049" end="00:46:48.650" style="s2">here I think we should make possible we</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.150" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">should make plausibility arguments and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.650" end="00:46:52.759" style="s2">then try to be consistent around them we</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:54.680" style="s2">have to address this issue we can&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.759" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">it off because not only animals the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.680" end="00:46:58.039" style="s2">emergent artificial general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:46:59.779" style="s2">is eventually going to get to the status</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.039" end="00:47:01.880" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to have to raise this</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.779" end="00:47:05.960" style="s2">question as well for those machines in</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.880" end="00:47:08.660" style="s2">England right and so let&#39;s why not do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.960" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">now so we&#39;ve got really good practice at</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.660" end="00:47:13.910" style="s2">it for when the inevitable machines</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:17.420" style="s2">arrive we&#39;ll have a better repertoire of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.910" end="00:47:19.160" style="s2">skills for addressing it and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.420" end="00:47:22.749" style="s2">for addressing it and along the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.160" end="00:47:28.369" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll treat our fellow organisms</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.749" end="00:47:31.970" style="s2">more appropriately all right so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.369" end="00:47:33.799" style="s2">question from page one Rob thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.970" end="00:47:35.239" style="s2">your support if you were to change one</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.799" end="00:47:36.950" style="s2">or two things about the nature of public</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.239" end="00:47:39.319" style="s2">education or college education or for</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.950" end="00:47:41.390" style="s2">better growth and future fitness again</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.319" end="00:47:43.700" style="s2">people to society what would you do and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.390" end="00:47:45.259" style="s2">why it could be as radically different</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.700" end="00:47:47.539" style="s2">from today&#39;s system of education as you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.259" end="00:47:55.039" style="s2">like thank you for that permission from</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.539" end="00:47:56.660" style="s2">God so if I could change I think I we</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.039" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">need to do we need to bring back what</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.660" end="00:48:01.999" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost we we had a knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:04.599" style="s2">institution and a wisdom institution and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.999" end="00:48:06.619" style="s2">they were coupled together and there was</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.599" end="00:48:08.569" style="s2">cross-pollination cross fertilization</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.619" end="00:48:10.220" style="s2">between them and then the plastic</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.569" end="00:48:12.230" style="s2">Reformation and a bunch of other things</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.220" end="00:48:14.989" style="s2">shut down the monasteries and then the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.230" end="00:48:18.829" style="s2">university attached to the state as</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.989" end="00:48:20.509" style="s2">opposed to the monastery and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.829" end="00:48:24.140" style="s2">that has been very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.509" end="00:48:27.400" style="s2">because we have lost places for which</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.140" end="00:48:31.849" style="s2">people in which people can cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.400" end="00:48:33.319" style="s2">wisdom self-transcendence pursued the</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.849" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">understanding of the knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.319" end="00:48:38.920" style="s2">they&#39;ve acquired figure out how that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:41.269" style="s2">translates into existential modes</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.920" end="00:48:44.150" style="s2">interactional relationships all of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.269" end="00:48:46.460" style="s2">has been lost so if I could do one thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.150" end="00:48:49.339" style="s2">and this is radical we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.460" end="00:48:52.039" style="s2">something back like what the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.339" end="00:48:55.160" style="s2">was now of course because of the plural</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.039" end="00:48:57.289" style="s2">of plural society we&#39;re in and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.160" end="00:48:59.799" style="s2">trying to in any way undermine that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.289" end="00:49:02.539" style="s2">think we need to do something like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.799" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">secular monasteries or maybe like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.539" end="00:49:07.999" style="s2">forest it is do it where you have the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">monastic Academy where it&#39;s not tied to</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.999" end="00:49:13.880" style="s2">a particular religious tradition or</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:15.980" style="s2">religious institution and that gives</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.880" end="00:49:18.680" style="s2">people nevertheless something that they</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.980" end="00:49:19.970" style="s2">could do in conjunction with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.680" end="00:49:21.619" style="s2">acquisition of knowledge that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.970" end="00:49:25.640" style="s2">doing at the university and we might</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.619" end="00:49:28.819" style="s2">want to do you know something even a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.640" end="00:49:30.890" style="s2">preparatory of that I thought at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.819" end="00:49:33.140" style="s2">high school level if we could other</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.890" end="00:49:34.309" style="s2">society it&#39;s like when I say that I know</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.140" end="00:49:37.579" style="s2">lots of people are out there rolling</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.309" end="00:49:41.989" style="s2">their eyes right it&#39;s like other</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.579" end="00:49:44.989" style="s2">cultures have and still do and all our</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.989" end="00:49:48.109" style="s2">culture did for a very long time so</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.989" end="00:49:51.289" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing sort of natural or the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.109" end="00:49:55.069" style="s2">waves has to be about the way we do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.289" end="00:49:58.970" style="s2">now and so it would it would be good if</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.069" end="00:50:00.710" style="s2">we thought about how wisdom could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.970" end="00:50:02.950" style="s2">brought into education I know Robert</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.710" end="00:50:06.650" style="s2">Sternberg has done a lot of work on this</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.950" end="00:50:08.839" style="s2">about how to bring wisdom into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.650" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">educational situation and he also has I</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.839" end="00:50:12.680" style="s2">think a recent book on how to apply</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:14.539" style="s2">wisdom to the world&#39;s problems to try</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.680" end="00:50:16.910" style="s2">and show the value that such an</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.539" end="00:50:19.609" style="s2">education could bring like to people as</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.910" end="00:50:21.619" style="s2">being citizens good citizens of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.609" end="00:50:24.109" style="s2">world not just sort of efficacious</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.619" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">agents within their own life so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.109" end="00:50:29.799" style="s2">that was a that would be something</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:29.799" style="s2">change I would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.099" end="00:50:36.849" style="s2">so now I want to move to a question from</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:40.599" style="s2">a patron Carter thank you for your</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.849" end="00:50:42.609" style="s2">support Carter what do you make of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.599" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">apparent find over Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.609" end="00:50:46.749" style="s2">in the art world of shifting from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:48.489" style="s2">genre of tragedy to that of horror aside</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.749" end="00:50:49.779" style="s2">from the increased visceral potential of</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.489" end="00:50:51.849" style="s2">modern artistic mediums</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.779" end="00:50:53.650" style="s2">how would you exploit the cultural and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.849" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">psychological shifts in emphasis here</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.650" end="00:50:58.809" style="s2">especially as it relates to alienation</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:51:02.339" style="s2">agency in the mean crisis so I already</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.809" end="00:51:05.819" style="s2">alluded to some of this when the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.339" end="00:51:09.130" style="s2">discussion I had about shudder and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.819" end="00:51:12.910" style="s2">because the Joker of course sits right</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.130" end="00:51:14.470" style="s2">on horror I don&#39;t think this is any</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.910" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">spoilers because it&#39;s abstract enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.470" end="00:51:19.089" style="s2">but no there&#39;s there&#39;s the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.950" end="00:51:22.239" style="s2">dramatic irony when you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.089" end="00:51:24.849" style="s2">Joker like him you don&#39;t know in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.239" end="00:51:26.650" style="s2">movie what&#39;s real and that&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.849" end="00:51:29.739" style="s2">when you things start to get stabilized</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.650" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">the movie shuffles them and you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.739" end="00:51:33.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got sort of oh that&#39;s the correct</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:35.710" style="s2">political labeling for that or this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.880" end="00:51:37.869" style="s2">really happening and then the movie</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.710" end="00:51:41.349" style="s2">shuffles it around and it puts you in</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.869" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">this constantly right tenuous grasp of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.349" end="00:51:46.210" style="s2">yourself of the main character which of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:47.940" style="s2">course with whom you of course it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.210" end="00:51:51.309" style="s2">movie you&#39;re identifying to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.940" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">and then the world of them if so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.309" end="00:51:55.299" style="s2">this horrific element in it not and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:51:57.579" style="s2">don&#39;t mean just the violence I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.299" end="00:52:00.519" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s real here and that this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.579" end="00:52:02.289" style="s2">is so unstable yet it&#39;s compelling and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.519" end="00:52:04.989" style="s2">the drawn-in it&#39;s it&#39;s very muddy it has</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.289" end="00:52:08.349" style="s2">some of that numinous aspect of horror</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.989" end="00:52:11.289" style="s2">to it and I think why horror is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.349" end="00:52:16.349" style="s2">more prevalent is precisely because it</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.289" end="00:52:22.779" style="s2">indicates as I&#39;ve said it indicates that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.349" end="00:52:26.410" style="s2">the the loss of a sense of contact and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.779" end="00:52:31.420" style="s2">connection has gone from being a dull</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.410" end="00:52:35.650" style="s2">ache to being a throbbing pain and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.420" end="00:52:41.380" style="s2">think what you see in Joker for example</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.650" end="00:52:44.010" style="s2">is pain that is not ameliorated but</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.380" end="00:52:47.730" style="s2">eventually identified with as</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.010" end="00:52:51.540" style="s2">the only last possible motivation which</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.730" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">is I&#39;m going to burn the world because</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.540" end="00:52:59.550" style="s2">then my pain and the world once again</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:53:04.320" style="s2">are connected and so that I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.550" end="00:53:08.450" style="s2">very worrying trend that we&#39;re seeing I</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.320" end="00:53:12.869" style="s2">think the horror is also an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.450" end="00:53:14.330" style="s2">intensify that sense of absurdity and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.869" end="00:53:18.570" style="s2">alienation</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.330" end="00:53:23.580" style="s2">because our culture in general tries to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.570" end="00:53:27.510" style="s2">retrieve significance being significant</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.580" end="00:53:29.940" style="s2">with carving intensity our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.510" end="00:53:31.920" style="s2">beset by there&#39;s no depth to this so</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.940" end="00:53:35.250" style="s2">what I&#39;ll do is make it as intense as</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.920" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">possible so they can overstimulate you</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.250" end="00:53:41.700" style="s2">and overwhelm you that is the last</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:43.590" style="s2">gasping shadow right of God it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.700" end="00:53:47.190" style="s2">it&#39;s but you used to be something which</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.590" end="00:53:50.490" style="s2">filled you with awe and overwhelmed you</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.190" end="00:53:52.470" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing of that so what</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.490" end="00:53:56.250" style="s2">we can do though is we can just make it</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.470" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">so intense so literal so stimulating</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.250" end="00:54:03.260" style="s2">that that intensity at least momentarily</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">gives you a surrogate for the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.260" end="00:54:11.550" style="s2">significance but notice notice the that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:12.990" style="s2">you know the hallmark you find in people</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.550" end="00:54:15.210" style="s2">like Jesus and Buddha where they talk</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.990" end="00:54:18.510" style="s2">about the peace that passes all</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.210" end="00:54:20.430" style="s2">understanding Jesus is where Buddha the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.510" end="00:54:23.750" style="s2">Buddha says very similar thing as the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.430" end="00:54:26.970" style="s2">hallmark of the genuine experience of</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.750" end="00:54:28.890" style="s2">significance and depth there is no such</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.970" end="00:54:31.700" style="s2">piece of understanding the peace that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.890" end="00:54:34.410" style="s2">passes understanding in these horror</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.700" end="00:54:36.930" style="s2">genres and the fact that we could no</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.410" end="00:54:39.180" style="s2">longer find peace and that we can no</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.930" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">longer find significance and all we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.180" end="00:54:48.869" style="s2">pursue is the intensity that math masks</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:50.970" style="s2">the lack of peace and pretends so</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.869" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">pretentious to be the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.970" end="00:54:57.930" style="s2">significance I think points to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:55:00.960" style="s2">that the meaning crisis is accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.930" end="00:55:07.470" style="s2">not just in its pervasiveness but in its</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:14.339" style="s2">profundity in terms of the pain its</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.470" end="00:55:17.880" style="s2">inflicting on people so this is the last</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.339" end="00:55:22.460" style="s2">question so this is from patrons for</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.880" end="00:55:25.950" style="s2">private subscriber mohali a board Olli</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.460" end="00:55:27.869" style="s2">thank you for your support do you think</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.950" end="00:55:30.270" style="s2">peer coaching or peer mentorship could</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.869" end="00:55:32.339" style="s2">be part of the ecology practices needed</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.270" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">to address the meeting crisis buta their</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.339" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">scalability yes very much this this came</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:43.500" style="s2">up explicitly as some of you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">been engaging in circling practices with</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.500" end="00:55:50.369" style="s2">other people particularly in Parkman</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:54.299" style="s2">sort of ethnographic a partnership with</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.369" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">Peter Lindbergh and Peter pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.299" end="00:55:57.510" style="s2">something that he found that I had said</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:56:01.230" style="s2">and one of the circling practices as</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.510" end="00:56:03.390" style="s2">we&#39;re very sort of helpful I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.230" end="00:56:05.549" style="s2">that in circling what you&#39;re creating is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.390" end="00:56:07.589" style="s2">peers and then I was like I said you do</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.549" end="00:56:09.210" style="s2">sort of want to play on the word peer</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.589" end="00:56:15.270" style="s2">because it also mean peer also needs to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.210" end="00:56:19.289" style="s2">look deeply into it and I think creating</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.270" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">peerage is a way to get distributed</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.289" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">cognition to generate a flow state that</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:32.490" style="s2">exams are the collective intelligence we</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:37.170" style="s2">need in order for addressing the project</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.490" end="00:56:38.849" style="s2">as Jordan Hall said of trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.170" end="00:56:42.750" style="s2">in both the top-down and bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.849" end="00:56:46.170" style="s2">fashion and Shepherd and husbandry of an</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.750" end="00:56:48.390" style="s2">ecology of practices for addressing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.170" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">ameliorating the meeting crisis so I I</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.390" end="00:56:53.130" style="s2">think yes and and their scalability is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:57.299" style="s2">very important precisely because I take</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.130" end="00:57:00.930" style="s2">our poly and it pays criticism that any</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.299" end="00:57:02.670" style="s2">attempt to I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see myself is</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.930" end="00:57:04.440" style="s2">trying to replace but I&#39;ll just use that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.670" end="00:57:06.390" style="s2">term for now you need to attempt to try</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.440" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">and replace religion with sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.390" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">secular alternative faces the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:15.750" style="s2">the religions have figured out</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:18.810" style="s2">how to be scalable in a very profound</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.750" end="00:57:21.630" style="s2">way and so finding I think scalability</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.810" end="00:57:24.840" style="s2">is an important normative standard that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.630" end="00:57:28.910" style="s2">we should hold any purported ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.840" end="00:57:32.970" style="s2">practices to if we wanted to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.910" end="00:57:35.250" style="s2">address another meeting crisis so I want</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.970" end="00:57:39.540" style="s2">to thank you all for joining me on and</p>
