<p begin="00:00:06.200" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">Jordan Peterson has become hugely</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.940" end="00:00:13.290" style="s2">successful what do you make of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:18.199" style="s2">phenomena why do you think he&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.290" end="00:00:23.880" style="s2">so successful now there is a drought of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.199" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">authenticity and courage and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.880" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">has found that hunger and he&#39;s tapped</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">into it and I&#39;m I admire his ability to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">detect it and to speak to it plainly in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">a way that it resonates with I did we</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.410" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">were on a panel together in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.770" end="00:00:52.980" style="s2">and I watched his talk and he described</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">his own surprise at how effective his</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.980" end="00:00:59.250" style="s2">message had been and he basically said</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">that if he had outlined his message as</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.250" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">the core of a business model that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">would have looked laughable to him and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:10.310" style="s2">that he was as shocked as anybody that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">people are resonating with it but when</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.310" end="00:01:16.200" style="s2">when you live in a world that is as full</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">of crap as the world we live in where</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.200" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">people are advertising bullshit to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">from the moment you get up to the moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">you go to sleep and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">finally tells you some truth that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">need to hear it&#39;s a relief it&#39;s a relief</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:33.110" style="s2">just to know that there&#39;s some channel</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">that isn&#39;t compromised by nonsense and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.110" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">he I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the only one</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">speaking truthfully but I think he is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">speaking from the heart</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">and people know it I think that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">grasps directly the fact that human</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">beings can only actually make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">the world by virtue of communication</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">with other human beings and this is all</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">about the notion of admixture that one</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">must have a mixture of of love I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">uses the mythopoetic to make sense the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">order order and chaos the way or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:11.640" style="s2">Daoist way is the alchemical admixture</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">of order and chaos and that&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.640" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s how you do it</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:17.100" style="s2">and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:20.990" style="s2">you biased towards orderliness you find</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.100" end="00:02:24.410" style="s2">yourself in a rigid non-adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.990" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">non creative non exploratory framework</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.410" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">which will die because the world changes</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.330" end="00:02:33.630" style="s2">if you bias towards chaos you you eat</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:36.360" style="s2">your young and evaporate which also</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.630" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">theis for obvious reasons and the key is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">to actually enable these things to be in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">relationship with each other and vital</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">healthy relationship with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:45.390" style="s2">I think that&#39;s in some sense the essence</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">of what he&#39;s focusing on and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.390" end="00:02:49.770" style="s2">the core what he&#39;s acting about he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:51.710" style="s2">very easy to work with as his voice is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:55.190" style="s2">an instrument because he speaks very</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.710" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">deliberately and sonorous ly and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.190" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">rhythmically anyway he actually speaks</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:03.530" style="s2">in in a kind of form of rhythmic poetry</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">sometimes he is actually rapid</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.530" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s words plus low Phi hip-hop</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">equals jbp way</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.920" end="00:03:18.260" style="s2">at first it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s a novelty</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:19.430" style="s2">thing and then I kind of listen to him</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.260" end="00:03:21.230" style="s2">is like no it&#39;s not a novelty thing this</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.430" end="00:03:23.750" style="s2">is actually really good yeah that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.230" end="00:03:26.690" style="s2">that&#39;s been the reaction all over I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.750" end="00:03:28.250" style="s2">think that was Peterson&#39;s reaction he</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.690" end="00:03:29.600" style="s2">was instantly like thought this was</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.250" end="00:03:32.630" style="s2">gonna be silly and was amusing it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.600" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">like oh this is actually awful and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.630" end="00:03:44.240" style="s2">were now essentially proving useful and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">that&#39;s generally interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.240" end="00:03:51.500" style="s2">say as well that Peterson has a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:53.420" style="s2">musical or a very performative aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.500" end="00:03:56.420" style="s2">his speech because he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.420" end="00:03:58.430" style="s2">performing that performance or aligning</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.420" end="00:03:59.930" style="s2">yourself with the truth and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.430" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">aligning yourself with the logos of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.930" end="00:04:05.209" style="s2">creative principle you would expect to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">be for that to have an effect on your</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.209" end="00:04:09.980" style="s2">actual performance but he feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:12.620" style="s2">very embodied speaker when he&#39;s onstage</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.980" end="00:04:14.690" style="s2">like he&#39;s fully inhabiting the stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.620" end="00:04:17.720" style="s2">that he&#39;s that he&#39;s telling and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.690" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">that performative aspect of it is seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.720" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">to me at least also related to what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:22.250" style="s2">talking about the logo of something</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:24.380" style="s2">incarnated more in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.250" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">incarnate and more in your in your being</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.380" end="00:04:29.630" style="s2">yes and watching him become that over</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:33.560" style="s2">the years because he was not always as</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.630" end="00:04:35.050" style="s2">as confident and able to just now you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.560" end="00:04:38.270" style="s2">know you free stars right</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.050" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">he&#39;s his whole career yes all careers</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.270" end="00:04:46.690" style="s2">really reminded me of it&#39;s very $0.50</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:50.990" style="s2">for example got big off the back of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.690" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">drama there was created drama you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.990" end="00:04:55.160" style="s2">beefs with other rappers and being shot</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:56.450" style="s2">13 times and all this stuff which draws</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.160" end="00:04:58.040" style="s2">people into the story</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.450" end="00:05:01.550" style="s2">but then he had this huge body of work</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.040" end="00:05:04.100" style="s2">and that kept people there Peterson did</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.550" end="00:05:05.540" style="s2">this Peterson had these public dramas</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.100" end="00:05:07.669" style="s2">and that brought people to him but then</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.540" end="00:05:09.770" style="s2">when they got to him they there was this</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.669" end="00:05:12.229" style="s2">huge body of work for them to get sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.770" end="00:05:13.790" style="s2">of lost and immersed in it Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.229" end="00:05:15.140" style="s2">some kind of drama like every week at</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.790" end="00:05:16.669" style="s2">this point he&#39;s like the ultimate sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.140" end="00:05:17.990" style="s2">of contemporary battle rapper he&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.669" end="00:05:19.729" style="s2">war with all sorts of people at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.990" end="00:05:20.930" style="s2">times and it&#39;s brilliant very</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.729" end="00:05:22.370" style="s2">interesting and if you&#39;re inside you</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.930" end="00:05:23.889" style="s2">know if you&#39;re a rap fan or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.370" end="00:05:26.150" style="s2">what would you call if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.889" end="00:05:27.980" style="s2">intellectual dark whatever the hell it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.150" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">is fat it&#39;s like this guy&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.980" end="00:05:32.300" style="s2">incredible beefs every week right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:34.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a new sort of supervillain to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.300" end="00:05:35.690" style="s2">root against every week three guards to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.100" end="00:05:37.100" style="s2">him or if you&#39;re on his site or not you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.690" end="00:05:38.389" style="s2">know it&#39;s the whole thing&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.100" end="00:05:40.130" style="s2">entertaining but then he pulls you in</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.389" end="00:05:43.419" style="s2">and then there&#39;s all this meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.130" end="00:05:43.419" style="s2">this huge body of work</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:58.180" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.020" end="00:06:01.630" style="s2">but he&#39;s quite new on this light if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.180" end="00:06:03.730" style="s2">watch him like 15 years ago it was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.630" end="00:06:05.850" style="s2">awkward and sort of he was very charming</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.730" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">and he knew what he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.850" end="00:06:11.410" style="s2">but the absolute fucking beast that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">has become as a performance creature who</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.410" end="00:06:15.450" style="s2">can now just rock up at an amphitheater</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:17.650" style="s2">and just like freestyle the new to our</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.450" end="00:06:19.660" style="s2">lecture off the top of his head and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.650" end="00:06:21.550" style="s2">very into not repeating himself too much</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.660" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">in his lake you go see a standard</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.550" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">comedian you&#39;ll see pretty much the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:27.340" style="s2">set every week for like a year or</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:30.250" style="s2">something right he won&#39;t do that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.340" end="00:06:31.990" style="s2">more like a very good DJ you know he has</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.250" end="00:06:33.250" style="s2">all these yes like a fistful of things</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.990" end="00:06:34.600" style="s2">that you know his works together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.250" end="00:06:36.100" style="s2">they&#39;re linked and he can take on these</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.600" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">different journeys but depending on</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.100" end="00:06:41.440" style="s2">who&#39;s in the room and where he is he</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:44.190" style="s2">will create a new and transformative</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.440" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">always experience where it where is his</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.190" end="00:06:48.010" style="s2">insight coming from and so we talking to</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.010" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">almost sound a little bit like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.570" end="00:06:55.260" style="s2">pieces I mean in the sense of yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.460" end="00:06:58.350" style="s2">mean if I had to describe my worldview</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.260" end="00:07:01.780" style="s2">in a nutshell it would be sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.350" end="00:07:07.960" style="s2">Neoplatonic so there was a Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.780" end="00:07:09.490" style="s2">stoic mystic Chryst agnostic so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.960" end="00:07:10.870" style="s2">of Neoplatonic I believe it I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.490" end="00:07:12.730" style="s2">always just sort of felt like there is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.870" end="00:07:14.950" style="s2">realm of ideal forms</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.730" end="00:07:18.580" style="s2">stoic do the suck it up fat kid and do</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.950" end="00:07:20.500" style="s2">the hard thing 100% Gnostic there is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.580" end="00:07:23.020" style="s2">certain ineffable experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.500" end="00:07:25.600" style="s2">and then the mystic Christic is some</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.020" end="00:07:28.360" style="s2">some reflection on the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.600" end="00:07:29.620" style="s2">Western tradition but nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.360" end="00:07:31.450" style="s2">2,000 years of bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.620" end="00:07:35.230" style="s2">administration and everything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.450" end="00:07:36.940" style="s2">what is nominally the metaphor of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.230" end="00:07:40.060" style="s2">and Chronos the intersection of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.940" end="00:07:42.130" style="s2">sacred and profane time in human form so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.060" end="00:07:46.330" style="s2">in that respect yeah I would track with</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.130" end="00:07:51.040" style="s2">with Peterson my sense is for me my you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:54.340" style="s2">know gnosis or understanding has come</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.040" end="00:07:57.940" style="s2">from ex ptosis has come from peak</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.340" end="00:07:59.410" style="s2">experiences and my sense for him at</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.940" end="00:08:01.600" style="s2">least as he shares what he does of his</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.410" end="00:08:03.090" style="s2">life has come from catharsis has come</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.600" end="00:08:05.169" style="s2">from the suffering it&#39;s come from</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.090" end="00:08:06.820" style="s2">battling depressions come from staring</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.169" end="00:08:08.440" style="s2">the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.820" end="00:08:10.360" style="s2">the face versus the view from the summit</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.440" end="00:08:12.580" style="s2">and those are ideally come full circle</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.360" end="00:08:15.190" style="s2">and reinforce each other but if I had to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.580" end="00:08:17.620" style="s2">sort of delineate maybe where&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.190" end="00:08:19.570" style="s2">transmission anchoring from it&#39;s maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.620" end="00:08:23.290" style="s2">little bit more the staring the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.570" end="00:08:25.090" style="s2">and and and surviving it then then</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.290" end="00:08:27.100" style="s2">calling out coordinates from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.090" end="00:08:30.730" style="s2">mountaintop the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.100" end="00:08:34.960" style="s2">from me quite apart from his work with</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.730" end="00:08:38.380" style="s2">these stories modernist was as you say</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.960" end="00:08:40.120" style="s2">his investigation into the Bible and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.380" end="00:08:42.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been fascinated although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.120" end="00:08:45.400" style="s2">an atheist I&#39;m always been fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.550" end="00:08:48.660" style="s2">the power of the biblical stories I</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.400" end="00:08:51.340" style="s2">often found myself looking at these huge</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.660" end="00:08:55.000" style="s2">cathedrals and churches that sprouted up</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.340" end="00:08:57.100" style="s2">all over Europe you know and and asked</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.000" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">myself well what&#39;s that about you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.100" end="00:09:01.720" style="s2">why was this story so powerful I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:03.550" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the defense against death if</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.720" end="00:09:04.900" style="s2">you want to be cynical but hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.550" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">it could be lots of other stories you</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.900" end="00:09:09.430" style="s2">know why is this one so unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:11.470" style="s2">powerful and what does it mean for it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.430" end="00:09:13.570" style="s2">be so powerful and pieces I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.470" end="00:09:15.970" style="s2">brilliantly answers that question in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.570" end="00:09:18.220" style="s2">biblical lectures he&#39;s done and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.970" end="00:09:20.500" style="s2">really changed me those lectures who</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.220" end="00:09:23.380" style="s2">genuinely did I think changed the way I</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.500" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">lived my life because he came to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.380" end="00:09:27.970" style="s2">very very important conclusion which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">pretty convinced by I don&#39;t think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.970" end="00:09:33.370" style="s2">ever 100% convinced about anything but</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">I&#39;m very convinced by his idea as I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.560" end="00:09:40.420" style="s2">depression is like a crisis of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.290" end="00:09:42.010" style="s2">in your the worst thing about depression</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.420" end="00:09:43.450" style="s2">is not about being miserable being</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.010" end="00:09:45.460" style="s2">having a life that seems utterly</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.450" end="00:09:49.900" style="s2">meaningless and that&#39;s why it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.460" end="00:09:52.120" style="s2">torment and Petersons in a way tries to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.900" end="00:09:55.720" style="s2">answer the question how do we as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.120" end="00:09:59.020" style="s2">individual that&#39;s a bit of a paradox how</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.720" end="00:10:01.060" style="s2">do i as an individual acquire meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.020" end="00:10:03.190" style="s2">because meaning is the most important</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.060" end="00:10:04.990" style="s2">thing any of us could have you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.190" end="00:10:06.700" style="s2">there&#39;s meaning as it you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.990" end="00:10:10.180" style="s2">don&#39;t know and yet no one can quite say</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.700" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">what meaning is which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.180" end="00:10:13.090" style="s2">interesting in itself you know one says</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:19.180" style="s2">well I want a sense of meaning what is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.090" end="00:10:21.490" style="s2">sense of me what is meaning and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.180" end="00:10:24.520" style="s2">I think it knowledge is that mystery but</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.490" end="00:10:27.339" style="s2">also it says well you know if you want a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.520" end="00:10:29.230" style="s2">sense of meaning it&#39;s not about just</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.339" end="00:10:32.890" style="s2">doing what you want it&#39;s not about just</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.230" end="00:10:35.740" style="s2">following your bliss as Joseph Campbell</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.890" end="00:10:42.779" style="s2">would be or having a much fun as</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.740" end="00:10:47.290" style="s2">possible or or even necessarily being</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.779" end="00:10:48.970" style="s2">happy no absolutely no not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.290" end="00:10:50.620" style="s2">being happy it&#39;s there were more</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.970" end="00:10:52.750" style="s2">important things than being happy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.620" end="00:10:55.900" style="s2">and I&#39;ve also found that to be true in</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.750" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">my life when Adam and Matt invited me to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.900" end="00:11:00.550" style="s2">do that podcast we were all someone who</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:03.270" style="s2">similar to the two of you I believe was</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.550" end="00:11:05.080" style="s2">starting to track Peterson and not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.270" end="00:11:07.150" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and what he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.080" end="00:11:09.930" style="s2">but also the ripples he was having a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.150" end="00:11:13.480" style="s2">culture the absolute phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.930" end="00:11:15.150" style="s2">explosion of attention that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.480" end="00:11:18.400" style="s2">happening around him in the media and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.150" end="00:11:20.140" style="s2">started kind of watching him reading him</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.400" end="00:11:21.670" style="s2">with an open mind my experience was an</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.140" end="00:11:23.320" style="s2">open mind like oh I resonate with that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.670" end="00:11:25.300" style="s2">love always bringing Carl Jung and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.320" end="00:11:27.550" style="s2">Joseph Campbell and archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.300" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">dimensions to his thinking like how he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.550" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">kind of kicking the left a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:34.330" style="s2">and calling them on some of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:36.910" style="s2">problematic thinking and then watching</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.330" end="00:11:39.010" style="s2">this kind of phenomenon from the left or</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.910" end="00:11:43.390" style="s2">the far left with people just with</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.010" end="00:11:48.190" style="s2">extraordinary levels of anger and fear</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.390" end="00:11:50.410" style="s2">and distrust and kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.190" end="00:11:52.779" style="s2">difference in that experience of my own</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.410" end="00:11:55.029" style="s2">and some of our experiences of Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.779" end="00:11:56.080" style="s2">and then watching a lot of friends who</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.029" end="00:11:58.450" style="s2">are on the far left</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.080" end="00:11:59.980" style="s2">having radically different experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.450" end="00:12:01.900" style="s2">and perception of who he is and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.980" end="00:12:04.540" style="s2">he&#39;s bringing and was really just</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.900" end="00:12:06.459" style="s2">curious about that and it it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.540" end="00:12:10.270" style="s2">similar to some of the stuff you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.459" end="00:12:12.490" style="s2">doing with rebel wisdom and as a I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.270" end="00:12:14.380" style="s2">you&#39;re training as a psychologist we do</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.490" end="00:12:16.420" style="s2">a lot of work with with psychology as</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.380" end="00:12:17.589" style="s2">well when there&#39;s a huge reactivity to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.420" end="00:12:19.000" style="s2">something there&#39;s always something</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.589" end="00:12:20.709" style="s2">interesting going on behind it and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.000" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">sort of makes you inquire it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.709" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">what is what are people reacting to yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:28.180" style="s2">whether you love them or hate them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">that equal proportion of intensity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.180" end="00:12:32.770" style="s2">whenever that&#39;s there it&#39;s what&#39;s kind</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.770" end="00:12:37.029" style="s2">is a psychological and I think young</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.540" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">would say it like it can be a autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.029" end="00:12:41.410" style="s2">and autonomous complex is it&#39;s not part</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:44.529" style="s2">of the ego it&#39;s so deep-rooted and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.410" end="00:12:46.450" style="s2">my opinion it&#39;s a collective complex in</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.529" end="00:12:48.310" style="s2">the collective unconscious it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.450" end="00:12:49.930" style="s2">everyone on the right thinks everyone on</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.310" end="00:12:51.310" style="s2">the left is a Stalinist and everyone</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.000" end="00:13:03.910" style="s2">like Peterson who are trying to carve</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.149" end="00:13:06.010" style="s2">out I would say not non-political but a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.910" end="00:13:08.020" style="s2">kind of a position that&#39;s lateral to</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.010" end="00:13:09.940" style="s2">politics that&#39;s more in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.020" end="00:13:11.980" style="s2">psychological domain to ask people to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.940" end="00:13:13.420" style="s2">look at themselves as individuals to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.980" end="00:13:14.980" style="s2">question the extent to which they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.980" end="00:13:19.330" style="s2">which until we can resolve issues on</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.010" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">that level it&#39;s gonna be very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.330" end="00:13:23.860" style="s2">to resolve these political disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:25.810" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one of the main reasons</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.860" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">that I&#39;ve found myself so interested in</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.810" end="00:13:29.260" style="s2">what Peterson is saying he&#39;s shifting</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:34.540" style="s2">the level of the conversation of trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.260" end="00:13:38.170" style="s2">to at least I was so excited to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.540" end="00:13:41.320" style="s2">Jordan Peterson erupted onto the stage</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.170" end="00:13:49.230" style="s2">and I know you had particularly part in</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.320" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">that there is a culture war that is in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.230" end="00:13:55.810" style="s2">bright precedence I mean we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:58.930" style="s2">middle of a culture war there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.810" end="00:14:00.940" style="s2">polarization and Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.930" end="00:14:04.209" style="s2">standing in the middle as a lightning</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.940" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">rod taking all the projections from both</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.209" end="00:14:14.350" style="s2">sides he clearly sees the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:17.560" style="s2">ideology and it is an ideology it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.350" end="00:14:21.810" style="s2">system of beliefs and values that will</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.560" end="00:14:25.810" style="s2">not lead us to the promised land it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.810" end="00:14:30.149" style="s2">it is problematic it leads us into a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.810" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">swamp with no exit it is not sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.149" end="00:14:36.250" style="s2">he sees it very clearly and in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:39.910" style="s2">opinion he sees it from a modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.250" end="00:14:44.130" style="s2">perspective very brilliant modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.910" end="00:14:46.810" style="s2">perspective he sees and he has a depth</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.130" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">because of his understanding of Carl</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.810" end="00:14:52.630" style="s2">Jung and his own work in psychology the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">field of psychology that is deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.630" end="00:15:01.150" style="s2">most people so people are drawn to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:04.120" style="s2">depth he sees something much deeper then</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.150" end="00:15:06.520" style="s2">other people are seeing right now we had</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.120" end="00:15:08.260" style="s2">had we&#39;d never met one another um I knew</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.520" end="00:15:10.329" style="s2">actually very little about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.260" end="00:15:14.050" style="s2">Peterson has written work he knew pretty</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.329" end="00:15:17.140" style="s2">little about mine and we were just told</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.050" end="00:15:19.449" style="s2">sit down and shoot and we had no idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.140" end="00:15:19.930" style="s2">where we were going so he just started</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.449" end="00:15:21.459" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.930" end="00:15:23.500" style="s2">so why the most Rinna&#39;s hemisphere and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.459" end="00:15:26.410" style="s2">he just went from there but what I felt</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.500" end="00:15:30.100" style="s2">was here was you know a super</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.410" end="00:15:32.829" style="s2">intelligent man who had wide-ranging</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.100" end="00:15:34.990" style="s2">interests in psychology philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.829" end="00:15:38.170" style="s2">didn&#39;t rule out a spiritual angle to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.990" end="00:15:40.449" style="s2">things and I don&#39;t think that I would an</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.170" end="00:15:42.220" style="s2">end in the film I in that clip I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.449" end="00:15:43.990" style="s2">he probably comes out that there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.220" end="00:15:47.050" style="s2">aspects of what Jordan was saying that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.990" end="00:15:51.550" style="s2">was getting well yes but so I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.050" end="00:15:55.240" style="s2">entirely kind of not a Peter Peter</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.550" end="00:15:58.089" style="s2">Sounion but I do have a huge respect for</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.240" end="00:16:00.760" style="s2">him and we had a great conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.089" end="00:16:03.040" style="s2">we were proposing to do more what do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.760" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">make of the sort of the criticisms as</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.040" end="00:16:06.790" style="s2">often he&#39;s described as a fraud or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">charlatan in some of the the media</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.790" end="00:16:09.370" style="s2">coverage but when you watch the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:11.290" style="s2">interview with yourself I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.370" end="00:16:12.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a very high-level conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.290" end="00:16:14.620" style="s2">the idea of him as a fraud or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.490" end="00:16:19.300" style="s2">charlatan just seems kind of bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.620" end="00:16:22.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s outrageous it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.300" end="00:16:25.529" style="s2">disrespectful its dismissive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.360" end="00:16:28.750" style="s2">entirely typical of blinkered liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.529" end="00:16:30.730" style="s2">he you can disagree with him about many</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.750" end="00:16:34.570" style="s2">things and I would disagree with him</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.730" end="00:16:38.020" style="s2">about a number of things but to say that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.570" end="00:16:43.870" style="s2">is just to show how could you</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.020" end="00:16:43.870" style="s2">he&#39;s clearly an extraordinary man and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.350" end="00:16:50.270" style="s2">never Charlotte what does that mean I</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.630" end="00:16:51.800" style="s2">think what strikes people is that he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.270" end="00:16:54.470" style="s2">relatively unknown and then he became</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.800" end="00:16:56.390" style="s2">known but that&#39;s what life isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.470" end="00:16:58.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t prove for a Sharla&#39;s yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.390" end="00:16:58.430" style="s2">a lot of this sounds quite Jordan Peters</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.010" end="00:17:00.860" style="s2">and esque</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.430" end="00:17:03.140" style="s2">what&#39;s your attitude Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.860" end="00:17:07.070" style="s2">yeah I mean I I&#39;m glad he&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.140" end="00:17:08.449" style="s2">and I think there are you know I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.070" end="00:17:09.860" style="s2">think at a minimum there&#39;s sort of three</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.449" end="00:17:11.900" style="s2">different jordan Peterson&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.860" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">there&#39;s Jordan Peterson the analyst and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.900" end="00:17:15.860" style="s2">academic which virtually nobody ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:18.589" style="s2">heard of there&#39;s Jordan Peterson the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.860" end="00:17:20.120" style="s2">kind of contrary in public intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.589" end="00:17:22.730" style="s2">which sort of you know kicked off in</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.120" end="00:17:25.130" style="s2">2016 and then there&#39;s sort of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.730" end="00:17:27.680" style="s2">Peterson sort of raw shot and blot for</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.130" end="00:17:30.920" style="s2">the culture wars of which both left and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.680" end="00:17:32.810" style="s2">right wildly distort who he is what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.920" end="00:17:35.960" style="s2">saying and what it and what it means for</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.810" end="00:17:37.400" style="s2">them and so we get we get the the second</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.960" end="00:17:38.630" style="s2">and the third ones completely mixed</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.400" end="00:17:40.490" style="s2">although the first one you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.630" end="00:17:41.780" style="s2">University of Toronto and hop near</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.490" end="00:17:43.490" style="s2">former Harvard professors the one that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.780" end="00:17:45.560" style="s2">gives the credibility and the weight to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.490" end="00:17:49.130" style="s2">the other two dialogues so in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.560" end="00:17:51.230" style="s2">respect I think as I what I imagined him</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.130" end="00:17:53.090" style="s2">to be as an actual man is a pretty high</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.230" end="00:17:55.220" style="s2">integrity principled person who likes to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.090" end="00:17:57.530" style="s2">think for himself and likes to speak not</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.220" end="00:18:01.220" style="s2">just truth to power but but also likes</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.530" end="00:18:05.030" style="s2">to remind his audience whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.220" end="00:18:06.530" style="s2">students or broader than that what what</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.030" end="00:18:09.830" style="s2">is you know what is it what is the life</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.530" end="00:18:11.380" style="s2">well a good life well lived and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.830" end="00:18:16.190" style="s2">there I think there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.380" end="00:18:18.500" style="s2">problems in how in the age of soundbites</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.190" end="00:18:20.390" style="s2">and hundreds of hours of footage and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.500" end="00:18:22.670" style="s2">tons of speaking and those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.390" end="00:18:24.980" style="s2">things that become problematic and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.670" end="00:18:26.690" style="s2">not in any way convinced that if I sat</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.980" end="00:18:28.520" style="s2">down with him and said hey mate what</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.690" end="00:18:30.530" style="s2">about this bit that he would actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.520" end="00:18:34.220" style="s2">stand and defend them but impressions I</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.530" end="00:18:36.440" style="s2">get would be that his I think he</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.220" end="00:18:39.230" style="s2">sometimes over catastrophize is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.440" end="00:18:40.910" style="s2">slippery slope to Marxism in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.230" end="00:18:42.800" style="s2">of that that all that you know this way</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.910" end="00:18:46.850" style="s2">lies Stalinist death camps therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.800" end="00:18:50.350" style="s2">cannot give one inch on on concessions</p>

<p begin="00:18:50.350" end="00:18:54.940" style="s2">although having said that I have also</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.790" end="00:19:15.970" style="s2">think it pulls it out just sometimes a</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.850" end="00:20:31.240" style="s2">think first of all I would not have</p>

<p begin="00:20:42.040" end="00:20:48.760" style="s2">I think it&#39;s amazing that an</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.090" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">Peterson on the other two ends of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.070" end="00:21:18.289" style="s2">extreme in terms of somebody who&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:20.450" style="s2">willing to say you know fathers are</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.289" end="00:21:22.809" style="s2">important families are important and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.450" end="00:21:26.419" style="s2">Jordan and I found ourselves in in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.809" end="00:21:28.490" style="s2">hour-and-a-half dialogue in which I</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.419" end="00:21:30.230" style="s2">would give a you know I would talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.490" end="00:21:33.740" style="s2">fathers and roughhousing and he would</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.230" end="00:21:36.440" style="s2">talk about some intellectual Piaget or</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.740" end="00:21:40.490" style="s2">someone else who was you know who was in</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.440" end="00:21:42.019" style="s2">the literature or in Disney movies or or</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.490" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">is something else that related to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.019" end="00:21:46.519" style="s2">and it was just a fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:48.440" style="s2">hour-and-a-half I I think because you</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.519" end="00:21:50.049" style="s2">know I&#39;m usually when I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.440" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">interviewed I don&#39;t learn a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.049" end="00:21:56.470" style="s2">but I certainly learned it was wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:59.539" style="s2">the way we learned from each other and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.470" end="00:22:03.139" style="s2">you&#39;ll you&#39;re from Canada yeah one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.539" end="00:22:05.090" style="s2">the the the biggest phenomenon of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.139" end="00:22:07.519" style="s2">last couple of years has been Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.090" end="00:22:10.039" style="s2">Peterson yeah would it be made of him</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.519" end="00:22:12.139" style="s2">his rise and what it says about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.039" end="00:22:14.110" style="s2">culture that people are so thirsting for</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.139" end="00:22:16.870" style="s2">what he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.110" end="00:22:20.600" style="s2">Peterson first was very bright</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.870" end="00:22:22.850" style="s2">extraordinaire articulate and in some</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.600" end="00:22:24.669" style="s2">ways a compelling speaker so he said</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.850" end="00:22:27.649" style="s2">he&#39;s an attractive figure in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.669" end="00:22:30.649" style="s2">when I read him I sense a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.649" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">suppressed rage in him in fact I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.649" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">his voice is choking with a rage alot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:34.580" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:36.289" style="s2">it&#39;s anything as he talks about rage</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.580" end="00:22:37.549" style="s2">that you have to deal with it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.289" end="00:22:40.129" style="s2">think you&#39;ll understand just how angry</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.549" end="00:22:45.519" style="s2">yet and it&#39;s and and if you look at his</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.129" end="00:22:49.129" style="s2">websites the comments were full of rage</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.519" end="00:22:52.370" style="s2">by his young acolytes well that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.129" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">energetic thing that it&#39;s his energy</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.370" end="00:22:58.399" style="s2">that draws people as much as what he</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:23:02.120" style="s2">actually teaches secondly he teaches a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.399" end="00:23:06.200" style="s2">repression I mean he he very rightly</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.120" end="00:23:07.370" style="s2">takes an issue where somebody mandates a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.200" end="00:23:10.800" style="s2">second language</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.370" end="00:23:12.450" style="s2">very rightly and righteously since the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.800" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">pie will not be dictated to about what</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.450" end="00:23:17.610" style="s2">language I&#39;m gonna use but good for him</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:22.050" style="s2">I&#39;m all in favor of not mandating</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.610" end="00:23:26.840" style="s2">language on the one hand on the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.050" end="00:23:29.460" style="s2">hand he basically advocates repression</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.840" end="00:23:31.560" style="s2">in his book he talks about how an angry</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.460" end="00:23:34.500" style="s2">to your child needs to be sit by</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.560" end="00:23:36.660" style="s2">themselves until they get over it rather</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.500" end="00:23:39.390" style="s2">than understanding why a child would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.660" end="00:23:41.910" style="s2">angry rage - what frustrations are</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.390" end="00:23:44.070" style="s2">having and what human contact they need</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.910" end="00:23:46.770" style="s2">to help them move through that anger he</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.070" end="00:23:48.330" style="s2">says we press the anger so he&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.770" end="00:23:51.000" style="s2">about repressed anger for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.330" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">circuit and it&#39;s very interesting he</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.000" end="00:23:54.120" style="s2">talks about children he talks humble</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">little varmints and little monsters and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.120" end="00:23:58.410" style="s2">so on I know that&#39;s meant to be humorous</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s also certainly you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.410" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">of the young human child so</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:05.820" style="s2">fundamentally I steam as an agent of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:11.160" style="s2">repression he posing as an agent of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.820" end="00:24:13.770" style="s2">libertarianism not to mention he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.160" end="00:24:15.900" style="s2">this big in his bonnet about what he</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.770" end="00:24:19.850" style="s2">considers to be seems to consider to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.900" end="00:24:23.820" style="s2">conspiracies by left-wing intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.850" end="00:24:26.250" style="s2">they seem to be his bete noire being a</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.820" end="00:24:27.630" style="s2">left-wing intellectual myself I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.250" end="00:24:30.020" style="s2">to talk to him so now what were you so</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.630" end="00:24:32.040" style="s2">upset about Jordan were you so afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.020" end="00:24:35.010" style="s2">you know he talks about these bloody</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.040" end="00:24:40.560" style="s2">Marxists and and any any points are very</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.010" end="00:24:43.190" style="s2">accurately all the horror that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.560" end="00:24:45.060" style="s2">under so-called Marxist regimes</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.190" end="00:24:48.120" style="s2">particularly in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.060" end="00:24:50.460" style="s2">he&#39;s absolutely accurate about that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.120" end="00:24:51.960" style="s2">then he promotes Christianity shall I</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.460" end="00:24:52.980" style="s2">tell him about the mass murders that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.960" end="00:24:56.010" style="s2">occurred in the name of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.980" end="00:24:57.510" style="s2">should I tell him about all the millions</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.010" end="00:25:00.570" style="s2">that were slaughtered in the names of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.510" end="00:25:04.680" style="s2">the gentle Jesus in other words let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.570" end="00:25:08.270" style="s2">fair about it he seems to pick</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.680" end="00:25:10.680" style="s2">ideologies to attack and abhor and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.270" end="00:25:14.520" style="s2">embrace other ideologies that are just</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.680" end="00:25:17.160" style="s2">as murderers in practice sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.520" end="00:25:18.660" style="s2">a much more interesting question for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.160" end="00:25:21.750" style="s2">what happened is</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.660" end="00:25:23.700" style="s2">how come underneath Arg I was meant to</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.750" end="00:25:25.560" style="s2">be liberate people so many people were</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.700" end="00:25:26.790" style="s2">oppressed I come from Eastern Europe I</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.560" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">was born in Hungary he doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.790" end="00:25:32.520" style="s2">tell me about what was like but how</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:34.470" style="s2">about asking how come a religious</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.520" end="00:25:38.100" style="s2">philosophy that was meant to promote</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.470" end="00:25:41.730" style="s2">love and acceptance and compassion has</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.100" end="00:25:43.550" style="s2">become such an agent of 2 million a of</p>
