<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:44.190" style="s2">data scientist and a homesteader in</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">Western Massachusetts that right north</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">Hampshire very close to Western Maine</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.489" end="00:00:51.239" style="s2">okay southwestern New Hampshire I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">been there it&#39;s probably a is it near</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.239" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">Mount Monadnock by any chance</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">we&#39;re in the Monadnock Region that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">exactly right yeah when I was in college</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:00:59.090" style="s2">and then we lived in Massachusetts again</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">in the 80s we still go out there</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.090" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">beautiful area I can passionately anyway</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:06.380" style="s2">as we do Julie do on these currents</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:11.220" style="s2">episodes we&#39;re gonna start with a single</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.380" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">bit in this case a tweet by Joe which</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.220" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">caught my eye and you can probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">imagine why my people who listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:21.630" style="s2">show regularly this is what Joe had to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:24.750" style="s2">say with no community we lack both a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.630" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">unit to sacrifice for and a unit to keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.750" end="00:01:30.689" style="s2">assholes in check what did you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:33.619" style="s2">that Joe what did I mean by that well</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.689" end="00:01:36.930" style="s2">let&#39;s see first I&#39;ll say that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.619" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">vet my own tweets very strongly I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">of a off-the-cuff tweeter I like to just</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">get my thoughts out there they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">meant to be refined but I agree in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">case this is that was a in my opinion a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">good tweet and so what did I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">that so so much of the reflections and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">thinking and doing that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:02.729" style="s2">involved in the past few years has</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">revolved around this idea of localism</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:07.320" style="s2">and we can kind of go into what do I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:10.520" style="s2">mean by that what others mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.320" end="00:02:13.370" style="s2">but the essential idea of the tweet is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.520" end="00:02:16.430" style="s2">that biological system</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.370" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">are naturally structured into units at</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.430" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">multiple levels right like so we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:22.310" style="s2">multicellular organisms that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:29.360" style="s2">composed of cells so cells are in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.310" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">sense their own stemming uh bounded they</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.360" end="00:02:33.230" style="s2">interact with the cells around them but</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:34.909" style="s2">there&#39;s clearly another unit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.230" end="00:02:37.810" style="s2">organization overlaying the cells that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.909" end="00:02:41.989" style="s2">is the organism that the cells compose</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.810" end="00:02:44.690" style="s2">similarly when you let humans do their</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.989" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">natural thing we compose into multiple</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.690" end="00:02:50.930" style="s2">layers of units a person can be like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:53.540" style="s2">cell in an organism I say can be because</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.930" end="00:02:55.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily the case when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.540" end="00:02:57.739" style="s2">look at what&#39;s happened over the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.060" end="00:03:01.250" style="s2">where to demarcate I don&#39;t know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.739" end="00:03:03.409" style="s2">just say last 75 years what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.250" end="00:03:05.269" style="s2">specifically in the US but I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.409" end="00:03:08.540" style="s2">globally but but I can speak more</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.269" end="00:03:11.420" style="s2">directly to the u.s. we&#39;ve had this kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.540" end="00:03:14.049" style="s2">of disappearance of what what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.420" end="00:03:17.180" style="s2">referring to as community in that tweet</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.049" end="00:03:19.700" style="s2">which is what I take the sort of next</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.180" end="00:03:22.730" style="s2">layer on top of maybe not individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.700" end="00:03:25.099" style="s2">maybe families too to be so there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.730" end="00:03:27.069" style="s2">of individuals there&#39;s families and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.099" end="00:03:30.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a community that&#39;s composed of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.069" end="00:03:32.750" style="s2">families I I believe that we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.980" end="00:03:34.430" style="s2">widespread way not universally some</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.750" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">people still have it we have the Amish</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.430" end="00:03:38.750" style="s2">and whatnot but in general we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:43.099" style="s2">lacking that community layer of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.750" end="00:03:47.269" style="s2">organization of humans and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.099" end="00:03:49.370" style="s2">consequences of that are that when it</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.269" end="00:03:51.199" style="s2">comes time to make tough decisions for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.370" end="00:03:53.959" style="s2">instance think that you know sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.199" end="00:03:57.169" style="s2">that an individual might make we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.959" end="00:03:59.870" style="s2">lacking actually a certain not abstract</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.169" end="00:04:01.639" style="s2">but concrete unit where we might make</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.870" end="00:04:03.919" style="s2">some sacrifices on the individual or</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.639" end="00:04:07.370" style="s2">even family level in the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.919" end="00:04:09.739" style="s2">that larger unit and when I say larger</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.370" end="00:04:11.989" style="s2">I&#39;m really thinking of something you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.739" end="00:04:13.220" style="s2">know not much bigger than maybe a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.989" end="00:04:16.099" style="s2">thousand people maybe it&#39;s even smaller</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.220" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s more lore Dunbar&#39;s number or</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.099" end="00:04:20.030" style="s2">something like that you know 150 I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:22.700" style="s2">know I don&#39;t claim to know but I do know</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.030" end="00:04:25.580" style="s2">that in the world we exist in right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.700" end="00:04:27.070" style="s2">the sort of next level up from family to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.580" end="00:04:30.380" style="s2">the extent that we have fam</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.070" end="00:04:31.880" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the abstract state often</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.380" end="00:04:34.190" style="s2">even conceived of as the national</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.880" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">government or maybe even sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.190" end="00:04:40.580" style="s2">global state systems so so we have this</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:43.570" style="s2">huge gap between very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.580" end="00:04:45.500" style="s2">small-scale local structures involving</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.570" end="00:04:48.520" style="s2">individuals and groups of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.500" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">and very large-scale abstract</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.520" end="00:04:54.980" style="s2">bureaucratic systems that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.450" style="s2">there&#39;s no in-between and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.980" end="00:04:58.990" style="s2">assholes in Czech bar had at keeping</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.450" end="00:05:02.210" style="s2">assholes in check because those other</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.990" end="00:05:06.200" style="s2">organizational units are so far above in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.210" end="00:05:08.540" style="s2">scale of the the local group when an</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.200" end="00:05:11.570" style="s2">asshole knows had a game those</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.540" end="00:05:13.160" style="s2">bureaucracies say sort of navigate them</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.570" end="00:05:15.770" style="s2">in a savvy way that might not be ethical</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.160" end="00:05:18.790" style="s2">but jives with the rules of the system</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.770" end="00:05:21.650" style="s2">as they stand there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.790" end="00:05:26.210" style="s2">function there&#39;s there&#39;s no mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.650" end="00:05:31.220" style="s2">that skins kind of spot that and root it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.210" end="00:05:33.260" style="s2">out or dampen it that&#39;s other than the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.220" end="00:05:35.690" style="s2">bureaucracy itself which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.260" end="00:05:38.750" style="s2">simply not close enough not personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.690" end="00:05:42.919" style="s2">enough not sensitive enough etc to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.750" end="00:05:45.890" style="s2">actually put individual bad action into</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.919" end="00:05:48.260" style="s2">place very good I like that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.890" end="00:05:50.690" style="s2">actually ties into some things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.260" end="00:05:53.390" style="s2">written an essay I wrote on medium</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.690" end="00:05:55.640" style="s2">called a journey to game B I laid out</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.390" end="00:05:58.580" style="s2">the thesis that one of the chronic</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.640" end="00:06:00.890" style="s2">problems of our time is that what used</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.580" end="00:06:03.050" style="s2">to be handled in extended families</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.890" end="00:06:05.419" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting I have about 65 first</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.050" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">cousins and so if you you know throw in</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.419" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">spouses and a few kids you&#39;re around</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">Dunbar&#39;s numbers right and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:13.729" style="s2">an extended family used to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:16.250" style="s2">business somebody you know went nuts</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.729" end="00:06:18.860" style="s2">became a dipsomaniac of a good old</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.860" end="00:06:23.030" style="s2">family took care of one of my uncles had</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.080" end="00:06:24.950" style="s2">a problem with the bottle and he lived</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.030" end="00:06:27.470" style="s2">in my grandmother&#39;s attic for many years</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.950" end="00:06:30.710" style="s2">and he wasn&#39;t on the street and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.470" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a nuisance and he was good old</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.710" end="00:06:35.630" style="s2">uncle Paul and then the other one was</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.159" end="00:07:08.120" style="s2">that know everybody so you know what at</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.810" end="00:07:09.979" style="s2">noddle distance to I&#39;m connected</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.979" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">fold out the face to face county a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.300" end="00:07:14.509" style="s2">community so that used to be what took</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:17.090" style="s2">care of us our extended family around</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.509" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">the Dunbar number plus or minus and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.090" end="00:07:22.520" style="s2">our face to face community of thousand</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:25.150" style="s2">to five thousand probably but over time</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.520" end="00:07:27.830" style="s2">the extended communities have dissipated</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.150" end="00:07:29.870" style="s2">you know my brothers live various places</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.830" end="00:07:31.969" style="s2">my cousins are here there and yon right</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.870" end="00:07:33.589" style="s2">one lives in Fairbanks Alaska Alaska</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.589" end="00:07:37.430" style="s2">have no idea where they live and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.629" end="00:07:39.889" style="s2">face to face community has as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.430" end="00:07:41.930" style="s2">pointed out has seated more and more of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.889" end="00:07:44.089" style="s2">its responsibility to other domains and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.930" end="00:07:47.180" style="s2">the two domains strike me as having</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.089" end="00:07:49.009" style="s2">filled that gap is first the government</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.180" end="00:07:51.020" style="s2">right as you say some people just think</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.009" end="00:07:52.310" style="s2">of the federal government but even if</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.020" end="00:07:53.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not the federal government it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.310" end="00:07:57.550" style="s2">county government or the state</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.539" end="00:07:59.930" style="s2">government who are by design as</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.550" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">value-free as we can make them in many</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.930" end="00:08:04.449" style="s2">ways right there at least in the United</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:08.300" style="s2">States and in the Enlightenment model</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.449" end="00:08:11.509" style="s2">they should not try to put strong points</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.300" end="00:08:13.699" style="s2">of view on things and their definitions</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.509" end="00:08:16.550" style="s2">of asshole ish Ness have to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.699" end="00:08:19.399" style="s2">essentially operational and formal as</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.550" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">opposed to the local the extended family</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.399" end="00:08:23.960" style="s2">and the face-to-face community you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:26.629" style="s2">it&#39;s like good old Potter Stewart</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.960" end="00:08:29.210" style="s2">definition of pornography I know it when</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.629" end="00:08:31.699" style="s2">I see it exactly right and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.210" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">government very formal and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.699" end="00:08:37.070" style="s2">the market which is much more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:38.620" style="s2">and accommodating to human nature but on</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.070" end="00:08:42.769" style="s2">the other hand it&#39;s by definition</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.620" end="00:08:44.570" style="s2">anonymous and transactional right nobody</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.769" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">cares about your reputation when you go</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.570" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">in to buy a loaf of bread when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">money for the dollar and so the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">that used to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:55.019" style="s2">handled closer at hand are almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:57.480" style="s2">all now handled either by the government</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.019" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">or the market I&#39;ve had my choice between</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.480" end="00:09:01.649" style="s2">the two I choose the market more often</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:04.050" style="s2">than not but there are some social</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.649" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">things that need to be done which are</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.050" end="00:09:08.339" style="s2">just not being done and you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:11.069" style="s2">think you hit on two of them one is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.339" end="00:09:13.110" style="s2">sacrifice you know how many of us are</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.069" end="00:09:15.779" style="s2">prepared to sacrifice for the federal</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.110" end="00:09:17.819" style="s2">government right not too many people</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.779" end="00:09:20.610" style="s2">state of Virginia maybe a little better</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.819" end="00:09:22.170" style="s2">as Highland County but for the people of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.610" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">Highland County yes my face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.170" end="00:09:28.410" style="s2">community but for the three members of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:30.329" style="s2">the Board of Supervisors not really and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.410" end="00:09:33.089" style="s2">how many of us are prepared to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.329" end="00:09:34.860" style="s2">for the market not at all like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.089" end="00:09:38.040" style="s2">not what markets are for markets are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.860" end="00:09:40.380" style="s2">for sacrifice therefore you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.040" end="00:09:42.569" style="s2">anonymous transactions that are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.380" end="00:09:44.459" style="s2">beneficial and that&#39;s good that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.569" end="00:09:48.449" style="s2">important but it but it doesn&#39;t serve</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.459" end="00:09:50.209" style="s2">either of your two things the other one</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.449" end="00:09:52.620" style="s2">that I thought was interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.209" end="00:09:56.100" style="s2">hit on but I&#39;m gonna expand and move it</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.620" end="00:09:58.860" style="s2">on a little bit our assholes and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.100" end="00:10:02.149" style="s2">sort of the premium-grade assholes which</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.860" end="00:10:05.399" style="s2">are sociopaths right when you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.149" end="00:10:08.010" style="s2">anonymous situations like markets and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.399" end="00:10:11.339" style="s2">when you have formal systems of levers</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.010" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">of power like government guess who flies</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.339" end="00:10:19.769" style="s2">to both of those like like flies to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:22.649" style="s2">sociopaths right and to and to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.769" end="00:10:24.600" style="s2">one of the biggest problems of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.649" end="00:10:28.170" style="s2">society and something we don&#39;t fix is</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.600" end="00:10:30.540" style="s2">literally going to kill us is the very</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.170" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">high over-representation of sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.540" end="00:10:34.920" style="s2">in systems of power I have much more</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:38.370" style="s2">experience on the business side than I</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.920" end="00:10:41.250" style="s2">do on the governance side but I say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.370" end="00:10:43.589" style="s2">at the sea level of real companies</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.250" end="00:10:47.459" style="s2">probably 10% of the c-level executives</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.589" end="00:10:49.380" style="s2">are sociopaths up from about 1% in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.459" end="00:10:51.300" style="s2">the general population and if you go</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.380" end="00:10:54.149" style="s2">into finance it&#39;s probably thirty</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.300" end="00:10:57.029" style="s2">percent which is a crazy and scary</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.149" end="00:10:59.009" style="s2">thought and that comes from frankly the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.029" end="00:11:01.139" style="s2">transactional nature nature of market</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.009" end="00:11:02.850" style="s2">share hoards AAA the stock price up I</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.139" end="00:11:05.339" style="s2">don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a rape and pillage</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.850" end="00:11:06.840" style="s2">um sociopath right Lee since</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.339" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">1975 prior</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.840" end="00:11:12.180" style="s2">that business actually had included some</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:15.570" style="s2">community of ethics but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.180" end="00:11:17.010" style="s2">increasingly since 1975 and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.570" end="00:11:19.380" style="s2">for publicly traded companies but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.010" end="00:11:20.970" style="s2">for larger free public companies</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.380" end="00:11:24.090" style="s2">particularly those caught in the vortex</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.970" end="00:11:26.490" style="s2">of venture capital sociopathy actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.090" end="00:11:29.310" style="s2">works what the right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.490" end="00:11:31.530" style="s2">something wrong with that and so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.310" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">know moving more of our life back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.530" end="00:11:37.230" style="s2">scales where you know we actually are</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:39.210" style="s2">prepared to sacrifice and where there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.230" end="00:11:42.030" style="s2">some mechanism for keeping assholes in</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.210" end="00:11:45.450" style="s2">check strikes me is damn close to of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.030" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">essence of how we solve the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.450" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">meta crisis that our society is in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:52.010" style="s2">you know I it&#39;s actually interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:53.730" style="s2">that you sort of define markets as</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.010" end="00:11:58.610" style="s2">transactional I definitely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.730" end="00:12:00.990" style="s2">but anonymous that seems to be to me a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.610" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">consequence of this spreading and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.990" end="00:12:07.430" style="s2">scaling up you know when you repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:11.280" style="s2">went to the same butcher down the street</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.430" end="00:12:13.470" style="s2">for 50 years in a row and not only that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.280" end="00:12:15.630" style="s2">but that guy also lives down the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.470" end="00:12:16.980" style="s2">Street just up the road from you and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.630" end="00:12:19.410" style="s2">you know him also outside of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.980" end="00:12:20.910" style="s2">transactional relationship you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.410" end="00:12:24.930" style="s2">markets that are no longer sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.910" end="00:12:28.470" style="s2">decoupled from from that community soil</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.930" end="00:12:30.510" style="s2">that community ground and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.470" end="00:12:33.660" style="s2">merely the transactions that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.510" end="00:12:35.640" style="s2">actually allowing the markets to the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.660" end="00:12:37.320" style="s2">goods capital to flow through the market</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.640" end="00:12:40.620" style="s2">it&#39;s also the relationships that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.320" end="00:12:42.450" style="s2">layered behind that those transactions</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.620" end="00:12:44.490" style="s2">so it&#39;s not anonymous and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.450" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">part of the problem is that anonymity</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.490" end="00:12:51.930" style="s2">where we&#39;re looking for these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:56.070" style="s2">trustless exchanges and and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.930" end="00:12:59.700" style="s2">one-off exchanges whereas in a local</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.070" end="00:13:01.890" style="s2">setting you get repetitive exchanges you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.700" end="00:13:03.630" style="s2">get different qualities of exchanges I</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.890" end="00:13:06.990" style="s2">mean there&#39;s obviously currency exchange</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.630" end="00:13:08.310" style="s2">there&#39;s bartering that becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.990" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">available because there&#39;s not all this</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.310" end="00:13:13.170" style="s2">sort of distance friction it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:14.520" style="s2">to you know trade some eggs for some</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.170" end="00:13:16.580" style="s2">loaf of bread with your neighbor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.520" end="00:13:20.520" style="s2">not it&#39;s not a difficult transaction to</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.580" end="00:13:23.370" style="s2">facilitate so so I do think that mark</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.520" end="00:13:24.120" style="s2">it&#39;s in a local context become</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.370" end="00:13:25.830" style="s2">non-anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.120" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">so that I I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a sort</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.260" end="00:13:34.110" style="s2">from the current situation we have I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.850" end="00:13:36.180" style="s2">think that&#39;s great I love that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.110" end="00:13:38.940" style="s2">distinction you know cuz let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.180" end="00:13:40.950" style="s2">about what we do business locally you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.940" end="00:13:43.590" style="s2">know famously in a small town including</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.950" end="00:13:46.530" style="s2">this area if you are really in a bad way</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.590" end="00:13:48.270" style="s2">they&#39;ll extend your credit right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.530" end="00:13:50.610" style="s2">that&#39;s just part of their social</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.270" end="00:13:52.110" style="s2">obligation even though they know from an</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.610" end="00:13:54.330" style="s2">economic perspective it makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.110" end="00:13:57.210" style="s2">to lend you money at zero interest that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.330" end="00:13:58.410" style="s2">you may default on right and then of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.210" end="00:14:00.210" style="s2">course the flip side of that is you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.410" end="00:14:02.450" style="s2">better not default if you want your</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.210" end="00:14:05.150" style="s2">standing in the community to remain good</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.450" end="00:14:08.490" style="s2">then so there&#39;s you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.150" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">non-economic forces as opposed to on</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.820" end="00:14:20.070" style="s2">experience right yeah - anonymous</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.070" end="00:14:25.620" style="s2">what humans are really all about and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.400" end="00:14:28.280" style="s2">then the second one is that when we</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.620" end="00:14:30.450" style="s2">react locally in the face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.280" end="00:14:33.660" style="s2">community we make some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.450" end="00:14:36.270" style="s2">qualitative choices for instance let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.660" end="00:14:39.330" style="s2">say there&#39;s two plumbers in our town</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.270" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">right both of them of similar skill and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.330" end="00:14:44.820" style="s2">similar price but one&#39;s an asshole and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:48.060" style="s2">the other is a charming person who you</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.820" end="00:14:50.580" style="s2">enjoy you know chatting with and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.060" end="00:14:53.070" style="s2">enjoy having in your home you know if</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.580" end="00:14:54.930" style="s2">you make the the principle choice let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.070" end="00:14:57.180" style="s2">even say the asshole is slightly cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.930" end="00:14:58.710" style="s2">right you make the principal choice that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.180" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">I&#39;m going to give my business to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.710" end="00:15:02.580" style="s2">good person</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:05.010" style="s2">you know that is a non-economic non</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.580" end="00:15:06.990" style="s2">anonymous kind of way of doing business</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.010" end="00:15:09.260" style="s2">that you know try it as opposed to who</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.990" end="00:15:11.550" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna buy a can of spam from on</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.260" end="00:15:15.000" style="s2">Amazon as you build up your larder for</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.000" end="00:15:18.270" style="s2">it at all and so that comes to your</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:21.390" style="s2">other point which is I think at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.270" end="00:15:25.350" style="s2">broader and extended point which is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.390" end="00:15:28.680" style="s2">idea around localism as a perhaps better</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.350" end="00:15:30.570" style="s2">and more humane way to organize human</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.680" end="00:15:31.530" style="s2">human life I know you&#39;ve thought and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.570" end="00:15:33.930" style="s2">actually you&#39;ve written quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.530" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">about localism you maybe expand on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.930" end="00:15:36.180" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.010" style="s2">theme of localism and what that means to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.180" end="00:15:40.290" style="s2">you and why you think it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.010" end="00:15:42.060" style="s2">improvement over what we have today yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.290" end="00:15:43.710" style="s2">absolutely I mean so so much we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.060" end="00:15:45.480" style="s2">talking about it is in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.710" end="00:15:47.490" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think of localism as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.480" end="00:15:50.100" style="s2">system I kind of think of it as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.490" end="00:15:54.150" style="s2">of meta system it&#39;s a structure that</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.100" end="00:15:56.040" style="s2">allows multiple systems to emerge sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.150" end="00:15:57.780" style="s2">of it&#39;s similar to the way you can think</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:15:59.640" style="s2">of capitalism that way - right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.780" end="00:16:02.940" style="s2">market is not so much a system as it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.640" end="00:16:05.310" style="s2">an ecosystem through which various</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.940" end="00:16:08.010" style="s2">things evolve and go evolve and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.310" end="00:16:09.660" style="s2">so III think of localism in a similar</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.010" end="00:16:12.590" style="s2">way it&#39;s about setting up the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.660" end="00:16:15.090" style="s2">for development and evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.590" end="00:16:17.940" style="s2">particular systems rather than an</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.090" end="00:16:19.860" style="s2">imposition of particular systems with</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.940" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">that kind of preamble out of the way I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.860" end="00:16:26.250" style="s2">think what is crucial about local</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:28.470" style="s2">interaction is what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.250" end="00:16:31.860" style="s2">there&#39;s necessarily in local</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.470" end="00:16:34.080" style="s2">interactions a bundling together of all</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.860" end="00:16:38.100" style="s2">of these different flows of flows of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.080" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">information currency goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.100" end="00:16:46.950" style="s2">and all of the subtle exchanges that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:49.380" style="s2">have as humans that are not easy to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.950" end="00:16:51.900" style="s2">articulate not easy to formalize maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.380" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">impossible in many cases to formalize so</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.900" end="00:16:55.260" style="s2">you do you have a interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:56.820" style="s2">somebody that maybe is going to do some</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.260" end="00:16:59.310" style="s2">plumbing work for something and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.820" end="00:17:02.010" style="s2">either an enjoyable interaction or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.310" end="00:17:04.970" style="s2">not and that&#39;s not something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.010" end="00:17:09.030" style="s2">captured in a dollar value necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.970" end="00:17:11.970" style="s2">so so there&#39;s a density of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.030" end="00:17:13.970" style="s2">that we see in the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.970" end="00:17:18.180" style="s2">things that are close together in space</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.970" end="00:17:20.189" style="s2">tend to have a high occurrence of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.180" end="00:17:21.810" style="s2">interactions within at one another by</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.189" end="00:17:24.689" style="s2">virtue of their closeness to one another</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.810" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">but it&#39;s the it&#39;s the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.689" end="00:17:30.600" style="s2">that density of interaction you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:32.250" style="s2">things like emergent like cycles in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.600" end="00:17:34.410" style="s2">system so you&#39;re having loops in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.250" end="00:17:36.750" style="s2">system you know I&#39;m paying the farmer</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.410" end="00:17:38.550" style="s2">down the street for one of his hogs he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.750" end="00:17:40.740" style="s2">paying the electrician up the road for</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.550" end="00:17:42.780" style="s2">their electric work and that electrician</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.740" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">is coming to me and say buying some eggs</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.780" end="00:17:46.650" style="s2">off of me and now we&#39;re actually having</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:47.730" style="s2">these circular kinds of flows within the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.650" end="00:17:50.580" style="s2">system that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.730" end="00:17:53.070" style="s2">are in essence nourishing the system and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.580" end="00:17:56.280" style="s2">we&#39;re all actually benefiting not only</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.070" end="00:17:57.540" style="s2">from the direct transaction the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.280" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">pairwise transaction that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.540" end="00:18:02.460" style="s2">participated in but all of the positive</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:05.490" style="s2">externalities that come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.460" end="00:18:08.010" style="s2">nourishment being local so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.490" end="00:18:10.290" style="s2">the my friends farm down the street is</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.010" end="00:18:12.270" style="s2">doing really good business guess what</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.290" end="00:18:14.010" style="s2">his property is kept up real nice the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.270" end="00:18:15.630" style="s2">value of the neighborhood is going up so</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.010" end="00:18:18.660" style="s2">now his neighbor is also doing better as</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.630" end="00:18:22.830" style="s2">his house home value goes up etc etc so</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.660" end="00:18:25.470" style="s2">this density of interactions has all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.830" end="00:18:28.590" style="s2">these sort of emergent effects you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.470" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">think of them as side effects but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.590" end="00:18:34.110" style="s2">important part is that it&#39;s not in any</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.440" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">one reducible interaction that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.110" end="00:18:36.870" style="s2">benefit is it&#39;s in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:40.530" style="s2">aggregation of all these actions</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.870" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">existing in a dense spot where even</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.530" end="00:18:45.929" style="s2">without any planning or explicit</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">coordination things end up interact in</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.929" end="00:18:51.059" style="s2">interacting with one another with a high</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:52.890" style="s2">density and and circling around the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.059" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">system and re cycling around the system</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.890" end="00:18:57.809" style="s2">in principle you can imagine this</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">happens at the global scale with global</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.809" end="00:19:01.950" style="s2">trade and thing but but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:05.160" style="s2">there&#39;s nowhere to be to get a handle on</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.950" end="00:19:07.049" style="s2">it to get a sense of it things dissipate</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.160" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">more readily and wider systems they</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.049" end="00:19:11.910" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily come back around in</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:14.059" style="s2">any time scale that&#39;s meaningful I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.910" end="00:19:17.190" style="s2">that that the things coming back around</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.059" end="00:19:19.110" style="s2">in a short time scale a relatively short</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.190" end="00:19:21.990" style="s2">time scale relative to human action</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.110" end="00:19:25.950" style="s2">human behavior is a big part of what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.990" end="00:19:28.169" style="s2">essence of localism offers and again as</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.950" end="00:19:30.510" style="s2">we talked about it one of the beauties</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.169" end="00:19:32.370" style="s2">is what we while the economic signal is</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.140" end="00:19:52.679" style="s2">it actually sort of explains why you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.790" end="00:19:54.600" style="s2">know the quality of human behavior seems</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.679" end="00:19:57.480" style="s2">they&#39;ve been going down for the last 80</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.600" end="00:19:59.549" style="s2">years or thereabouts because how most of</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.220" end="00:20:04.549" style="s2">to mandate identities like the</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.320" end="00:20:15.110" style="s2">a good person and so of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.780" end="00:20:16.520" style="s2">you do less punishment and less less</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:24.350" style="s2">unfortunately so I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.549" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">important portal on the other hand let</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.350" end="00:20:29.900" style="s2">me throw out the other you know Here I</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:32.210" style="s2">am in my very remote mountain farm and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.900" end="00:20:34.340" style="s2">population density as low as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.210" end="00:20:36.409" style="s2">so we could easily support the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.340" end="00:20:38.270" style="s2">population in the county with our local</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.409" end="00:20:41.780" style="s2">agriculture and be able to export quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.270" end="00:20:43.640" style="s2">a bit and that is a very good feeling</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.780" end="00:20:46.070" style="s2">particularly during the mini zombie</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.640" end="00:20:50.150" style="s2">apocalypse right we know we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.070" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">starve here under most circumstances but</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.150" end="00:20:57.620" style="s2">there was a case back in the I think it</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:59.990" style="s2">was in the late 30s where this local</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.620" end="00:21:02.419" style="s2">small county was hit by a devastating</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.990" end="00:21:04.220" style="s2">drought not just a normal drought but a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.419" end="00:21:07.070" style="s2">drought that literally killed everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.220" end="00:21:08.659" style="s2">right and except for one little corner</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.070" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">of County which now has the name of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.659" end="00:21:13.070" style="s2">little Egypt because most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:15.230" style="s2">from the Central Valley had to literally</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.070" end="00:21:17.570" style="s2">migrate down to little Egypt with their</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.230" end="00:21:21.530" style="s2">cattle pigs chickens and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.570" end="00:21:23.570" style="s2">to just survive that horrendous summer</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.530" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">now I don&#39;t think it hit our valley so</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.570" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">bad that over the next Valley over</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:29.809" style="s2">literally they had to go to little Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:32.690" style="s2">and so there is some benefit from expand</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.809" end="00:21:35.450" style="s2">you know local clusters that trade with</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.690" end="00:21:37.309" style="s2">each other right so if we had and this</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.450" end="00:21:38.570" style="s2">was you know when this county I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.309" end="00:21:42.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t have electricity here at this</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.570" end="00:21:44.630" style="s2">farm till 1962 right so this was a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.200" end="00:21:46.760" style="s2">remote place in that day but you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.630" end="00:21:49.880" style="s2">degree it was coupled to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.760" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">next Valley over and you know up the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.880" end="00:21:53.900" style="s2">river to the next County and down and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:55.789" style="s2">over say a you know a four or five</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.900" end="00:21:58.250" style="s2">County area you&#39;re big enough that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.789" end="00:22:00.230" style="s2">have differentiated your risks at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.250" end="00:22:03.350" style="s2">with respect to drought most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.230" end="00:22:05.150" style="s2">and also things like insect pasts and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.350" end="00:22:06.830" style="s2">you know things of that sort so there</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.150" end="00:22:08.890" style="s2">you know as we know in investing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.830" end="00:22:11.990" style="s2">only free run lunch is diversification</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.890" end="00:22:13.700" style="s2">there&#39;s some of that true also with</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.990" end="00:22:16.789" style="s2">respect to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.700" end="00:22:19.010" style="s2">you know to trade so we you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.789" end="00:22:21.019" style="s2">idea of becoming ultra local it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.010" end="00:22:22.820" style="s2">know autarkic at the level of the county</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.019" end="00:22:26.690" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a dangerous idea because</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.820" end="00:22:28.970" style="s2">it&#39;s less robust in some sense then is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.690" end="00:22:30.440" style="s2">more differentiated portfolio on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.970" end="00:22:32.659" style="s2">other hand when we get to a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.440" end="00:22:34.850" style="s2">complicated system like today&#39;s world</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.659" end="00:22:36.649" style="s2">trade you know we can see instantly what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.850" end="00:22:38.570" style="s2">happens oh all the masks are made</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.649" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">in China the Chinese are holding on to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.570" end="00:22:43.490" style="s2">their mass or right all the nose</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:46.159" style="s2">swabs in the world are made outside of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.490" end="00:22:48.620" style="s2">Milan Italy or almost all of them who</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:51.669" style="s2">got hit first by the virus Milan Italy</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.620" end="00:22:55.909" style="s2">ups those swabs you know if we&#39;d had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.669" end="00:22:58.940" style="s2">much more distributed system the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.909" end="00:23:01.130" style="s2">opportunity for robustness in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.940" end="00:23:03.010" style="s2">system would have been increased so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.130" end="00:23:05.990" style="s2">you know you have to think of as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.010" end="00:23:07.880" style="s2">robustness against various ensembles of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.990" end="00:23:11.480" style="s2">risks and what is the law at the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.880" end="00:23:13.580" style="s2">level of localism versus essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.480" end="00:23:15.380" style="s2">diversified portfolio so it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.580" end="00:23:18.649" style="s2">feels to me that when you add it all up</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.380" end="00:23:21.110" style="s2">we&#39;re way to what long range in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.649" end="00:23:23.450" style="s2">relationships today then would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.110" end="00:23:25.490" style="s2">optimal and that you know moving these</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.450" end="00:23:28.490" style="s2">relationships in so that they&#39;re richer</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.490" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">in the face-to-face community and more</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.490" end="00:23:31.940" style="s2">personal even the next county over</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:32.659" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of inter marriages people</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.940" end="00:23:34.909" style="s2">know each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.659" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">there&#39;s rest of long-term opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.909" end="00:23:39.260" style="s2">for long-term reciprocity I think would</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:41.960" style="s2">be a good thing but you know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.260" end="00:23:44.090" style="s2">that is a damn hard question so so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.960" end="00:23:46.909" style="s2">mean I agree with you on everything you</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.090" end="00:23:48.409" style="s2">just said and a lot of times I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.909" end="00:23:50.750" style="s2">received the feedback on quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.409" end="00:23:52.580" style="s2">occasions where it&#39;s sort of hey Joe but</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.750" end="00:23:55.970" style="s2">you can&#39;t just decentralize everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.580" end="00:23:57.559" style="s2">to you know whatever down to atoms and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.970" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">everything&#39;s network of course not of</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.559" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">course not but the the take-home message</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:04.190" style="s2">is that exactly what you said we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:06.830" style="s2">so far in the other direction of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.190" end="00:24:09.740" style="s2">centralization of distance</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.830" end="00:24:12.769" style="s2">specialisation of things like that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.740" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">the movement clearly needs to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.769" end="00:24:17.779" style="s2">local direction and and the ideal is is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.429" style="s2">and when I say ideal I don&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.779" end="00:24:21.590" style="s2">best state I mean sort of the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.429" end="00:24:23.659" style="s2">that you might aim for sort of as local</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.590" end="00:24:25.820" style="s2">as possible but to your point to</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.659" end="00:24:27.170" style="s2">mitigate against certain risks to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:29.150" style="s2">other kinds of benefits</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.170" end="00:24:31.370" style="s2">as local as possible can sometimes mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.150" end="00:24:34.970" style="s2">you know the level of the region the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.370" end="00:24:38.780" style="s2">level of the nation so it&#39;s it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.970" end="00:24:41.510" style="s2">know local is in essence a relational</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.780" end="00:24:43.310" style="s2">concept there&#39;s no one local what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.510" end="00:24:44.600" style="s2">means to be local depends on the context</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.310" end="00:24:47.780" style="s2">depends on what you&#39;re talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.600" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">and to your point about you know one</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.780" end="00:24:52.070" style="s2">County or one area had a drought a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:53.570" style="s2">neighboring region didn&#39;t and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.070" end="00:24:57.710" style="s2">savior of the neighboring region with</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.570" end="00:24:59.900" style="s2">the drought if in that circumstance all</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.710" end="00:25:01.580" style="s2">of the agriculture had been concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.900" end="00:25:03.290" style="s2">in the area that happened to receive the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.580" end="00:25:08.210" style="s2">drought everyone would have been screwed</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.290" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">so actually was on a week or so ago Joel</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.210" end="00:25:13.970" style="s2">Salatin was on the Joe Rogan podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:15.740" style="s2">he articulated very well you know Joe</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.970" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">Rogan asked him how can this scale you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.740" end="00:25:20.900" style="s2">know can it scale and the service of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:23.870" style="s2">course it can but it&#39;s it&#39;s a scaling in</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.900" end="00:25:26.270" style="s2">duplication it&#39;s not bottle scale or</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.870" end="00:25:28.730" style="s2">horizontal scale yeah exactly not not</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.270" end="00:25:31.640" style="s2">the sort of vertical integrative growing</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.730" end="00:25:33.830" style="s2">monstrosity that people sort of often</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.640" end="00:25:36.260" style="s2">naively expect to sort of behave the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.830" end="00:25:38.750" style="s2">same only bigger whereas from system</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.260" end="00:25:41.630" style="s2">science we know very well more is</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.750" end="00:25:43.730" style="s2">different I I&#39;m sort of adopting bigger</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.630" end="00:25:45.230" style="s2">is different language for that because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.730" end="00:25:46.610" style="s2">think that gets more at the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.230" end="00:25:49.400" style="s2">things were experiencing directly bigger</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.610" end="00:25:50.990" style="s2">is different so you know in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.400" end="00:25:53.210" style="s2">duplicate of type of growth that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.990" end="00:25:55.130" style="s2">horizontal growth that&#39;s where you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.210" end="00:25:57.880" style="s2">that robustness in that redundancy that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.130" end="00:26:01.250" style="s2">allows you to mitigate against</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.880" end="00:26:03.710" style="s2">uncorrelated crises so so for each kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.250" end="00:26:07.190" style="s2">of possible you know since our ensembles</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.710" end="00:26:09.110" style="s2">of risk factors there&#39;s a scale at which</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.190" end="00:26:11.210" style="s2">these things correlate and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.110" end="00:26:12.740" style="s2">a larger scale at which they don&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.210" end="00:26:15.260" style="s2">yes absolutely from from a risk</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.740" end="00:26:19.550" style="s2">perspective especially we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.260" end="00:26:21.710" style="s2">open to the fact that when in some for</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.930" end="00:26:29.840" style="s2">there needs to be support and ability to</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.550" end="00:26:38.180" style="s2">happens to be and and and so and so you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.390" end="00:26:40.280" style="s2">know when we talk about localism I often</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.180" end="00:26:40.700" style="s2">throw off any qualifier to talk about</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.700" end="00:26:47.270" style="s2">but really I&#39;m talking about multiscale</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.740" end="00:26:49.670" style="s2">localism so you know is a unit the home</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.270" end="00:26:50.870" style="s2">and family the town is another unit the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.670" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">county is another unit the state is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.870" end="00:26:54.200" style="s2">another unit so it&#39;s this layering of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:56.390" style="s2">units it&#39;s not that one needs to take</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.200" end="00:26:58.280" style="s2">precedence against all others it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.390" end="00:27:00.670" style="s2">in fact that this distribution across</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.280" end="00:27:04.010" style="s2">scales and thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.670" end="00:27:07.970" style="s2">intelligently is what nobody in power is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.010" end="00:27:09.590" style="s2">doing right it&#39;s it&#39;s scandalous that if</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.970" end="00:27:12.050" style="s2">you were to ask the President of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.590" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">United States that you know contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.050" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">the idea of you know fractal</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.550" end="00:27:24.860" style="s2">he&#39;d have not a clue one and how can</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.590" end="00:27:27.140" style="s2">that be here in in 2020 when most of our</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.860" end="00:27:29.150" style="s2">problems going forward are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.140" end="00:27:29.660" style="s2">complex systems problems that&#39;s right</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.660" end="00:27:36.290" style="s2">so I&#39;ve seen strangely when I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.010" end="00:27:37.700" style="s2">localism the term pop up in a couple</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.700" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">is there does seem to be from this</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.930" end="00:27:48.170" style="s2">because they know they haven&#39;t heard it</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.400" end="00:27:49.370" style="s2">and they it rings true a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.170" end="00:27:50.750" style="s2">know there&#39;s something about this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.370" end="00:27:52.850" style="s2">about right and you&#39;re exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.750" end="00:27:55.220" style="s2">that it&#39;s not just the politicians it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.850" end="00:27:58.390" style="s2">our public discourse is mired in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.220" end="00:28:00.950" style="s2">sort of system verse system you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.390" end="00:28:04.040" style="s2">communism versus capitalism left versus</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.950" end="00:28:06.830" style="s2">right these kinds of is it is that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.040" end="00:28:09.590" style="s2">right way to administer the system or is</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.830" end="00:28:11.770" style="s2">that and all of these conversations are</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.590" end="00:28:14.690" style="s2">missing the crucial factor of scale and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.770" end="00:28:16.730" style="s2">for many systems that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.690" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">that&#39;s going to determine more of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.730" end="00:28:21.170" style="s2">way the system behaves than the nominal</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.830" end="00:28:23.270" style="s2">you know the label of the system that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.170" end="00:28:25.640" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to implement so probably a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.270" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">commune of a thousand people looks more</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.640" end="00:28:29.840" style="s2">similar to a small-market of a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:32.450" style="s2">people and either of those look to a</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:34.760" style="s2">market of a billion people or communism</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.450" end="00:28:36.620" style="s2">of a billion people yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.760" end="00:28:38.270" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.620" end="00:28:40.160" style="s2">important for those of us who do see</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.270" end="00:28:41.780" style="s2">this to you know keep the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.160" end="00:28:44.360" style="s2">going right in fact I&#39;m actually working</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.780" end="00:28:46.370" style="s2">on an essay right now I hope to get it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.360" end="00:28:49.430" style="s2">out in a week or two called it&#39;s a call</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.370" end="00:28:52.610" style="s2">for a federal Department of wicked wit</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.430" end="00:28:54.800" style="s2">risks that would have essentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.610" end="00:28:56.450" style="s2">informed the federal government</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.800" end="00:28:58.730" style="s2">it have a group of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.450" end="00:29:03.350" style="s2">scanning and listening and planning and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.730" end="00:29:05.510" style="s2">modeling etc and doing you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.350" end="00:29:07.580" style="s2">mock decision-making to get leaders</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.510" end="00:29:10.370" style="s2">psychologically prepared to make</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.370" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">situations and you know with this recent</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.010" end="00:29:15.680" style="s2">coded things a classic example across</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:17.810" style="s2">the West</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.680" end="00:29:19.670" style="s2">every government essentially failed with</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.810" end="00:29:21.650" style="s2">a couple of exceptions Denmark in</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.670" end="00:29:23.510" style="s2">Austria maybe New Zealand whose</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.650" end="00:29:25.430" style="s2">multi-criteria in Australia a few but</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.510" end="00:29:27.410" style="s2">most failed right and so you can&#39;t point</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.430" end="00:29:29.540" style="s2">to one cloud of misery they all got law</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.410" end="00:29:31.820" style="s2">or clouds of misery and if you look back</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.540" end="00:29:34.190" style="s2">at who did a better job was mostly</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.820" end="00:29:37.070" style="s2">places that had a dry run with SARS</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.190" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">right and so if you could simulate that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.070" end="00:29:39.980" style="s2">in the department of wicked risk say hey</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:42.020" style="s2">you know what we&#39;re gonna have a pan</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.980" end="00:29:44.180" style="s2">there pandemics they got knobs of their</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.020" end="00:29:46.100" style="s2">contagion or lethality or such here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.180" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">our not too implausible and it turned</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.100" end="00:29:50.060" style="s2">out to be sorta like koban nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:51.830" style="s2">let&#39;s run the scenario through and get</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.060" end="00:29:53.750" style="s2">the people to think in terms of coupled</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:29:57.560" style="s2">complex systems does they think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.750" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">that this pandemic has made so clear is</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.560" end="00:30:01.970" style="s2">that you know major shocks to the system</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:04.460" style="s2">aren&#39;t just one system this is not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.970" end="00:30:06.110" style="s2">a health problem right it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.460" end="00:30:07.880" style="s2">educational problem it&#39;s not gone to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.110" end="00:30:09.770" style="s2">school it&#39;s an economic problem at a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.880" end="00:30:11.780" style="s2">massive scale it&#39;s a mental health</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.770" end="00:30:14.600" style="s2">problem I really read some of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.780" end="00:30:16.460" style="s2">statistics you know mental health</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.600" end="00:30:18.200" style="s2">problems are up by a factor of four or</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.460" end="00:30:21.110" style="s2">five perhaps who knows might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.200" end="00:30:23.540" style="s2">horseshit but we&#39;ll soon find out and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.110" end="00:30:26.780" style="s2">yeah the the need for the public sphere</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.540" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">more broadly you know and not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.780" end="00:30:32.300" style="s2">government business as well you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:35.140" style="s2">needs to learn how to take a multi</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.300" end="00:30:39.080" style="s2">system coupled system multi scale</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.140" end="00:30:41.300" style="s2">complex systems view of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.080" end="00:30:43.310" style="s2">start thinking accordingly and if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.300" end="00:30:46.070" style="s2">don&#39;t you know most of the big problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.310" end="00:30:48.290" style="s2">we have confronting us you know climate</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.070" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">change being a classic one but many</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.290" end="00:30:52.040" style="s2">others I don&#39;t know how we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:55.850" style="s2">solve them well you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.040" end="00:30:58.790" style="s2">interesting I think that&#39;s a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.850" end="00:31:00.920" style="s2">idea to have if we&#39;re gonna use these</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.790" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">governing bodies as decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.920" end="00:31:07.070" style="s2">bodies as we are then then setting up a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:08.509" style="s2">way of not waiting till the crisis is in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.070" end="00:31:10.759" style="s2">motion to think about how would we</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.509" end="00:31:12.139" style="s2">react to this is very important it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.759" end="00:31:14.119" style="s2">just the decision-making in the ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.139" end="00:31:16.249" style="s2">crisis though it&#39;s also how we structure</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.119" end="00:31:18.259" style="s2">our systems and and that&#39;s you know for</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.249" end="00:31:19.820" style="s2">these systemic risks what makes</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.259" end="00:31:21.409" style="s2">something a systemic risk is that there</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.820" end="00:31:24.109" style="s2">is that possibility of propagation</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.409" end="00:31:25.909" style="s2">either through a single kind of system</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.109" end="00:31:27.799" style="s2">you know like the pandemic has on health</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.909" end="00:31:29.179" style="s2">you know I get sick I get you sick it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.799" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">kind of moving through individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.179" end="00:31:33.109" style="s2">these coupled sort of heterogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:34.339" style="s2">Cascades I all of a sudden schools are</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.109" end="00:31:36.579" style="s2">closed doors are closing down</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.339" end="00:31:39.199" style="s2">meatpacking facilities aren&#39;t working so</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.579" end="00:31:40.909" style="s2">so much of that needs to be not just the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.199" end="00:31:43.009" style="s2">decisions made in the crisis but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.909" end="00:31:44.690" style="s2">ongoing decisions we make to structure</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.009" end="00:31:47.059" style="s2">the system so that when these things</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.690" end="00:31:48.649" style="s2">start to unfold there&#39;s boundaries in</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.059" end="00:31:51.979" style="s2">the system and circuit breakers and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.649" end="00:31:55.009" style="s2">know back in January I have a lot of as</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.979" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">many people do criticisms about how</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.009" end="00:32:00.469" style="s2">Trump has handled this one criticism I</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:03.349" style="s2">don&#39;t have is his closing of flights</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.469" end="00:32:05.479" style="s2">from China in January that was a good</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.349" end="00:32:07.759" style="s2">decision and the reason it was such a</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.479" end="00:32:09.619" style="s2">politically difficult decision was</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.759" end="00:32:11.569" style="s2">because we&#39;re not thinking enough in</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.619" end="00:32:13.249" style="s2">terms of the structure of the system in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.569" end="00:32:17.359" style="s2">the and the cascades it opens us up to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.249" end="00:32:19.459" style="s2">it should be obvious that if there&#39;s a</p>
