<p begin="00:00:33.949" end="00:00:37.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s gotta be millions of people</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.569" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">by having more engineers so get involved</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.299" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">with solar power wind power you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:39.769" style="s2">stuff like that that will solve problems</p>

<p begin="00:02:49.910" end="00:02:55.250" style="s2">to solve the problems so we need more</p>

<p begin="00:03:07.489" end="00:03:10.510" style="s2">problem with something like Greenpeace</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.569" end="00:03:13.069" style="s2">was that he was also dystopian</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.510" end="00:03:14.569" style="s2">environmentalist just opium meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.069" end="00:03:16.790" style="s2">nobody really got engaged</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.569" end="00:03:18.700" style="s2">that meant Greenpeace involved a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.790" end="00:03:22.250" style="s2">hundred people who got obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.700" end="00:03:24.380" style="s2">whales and seals and which again had</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.250" end="00:03:25.970" style="s2">nothing to do with climate change so if</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.380" end="00:03:28.459" style="s2">you want to take the climate change</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.970" end="00:03:30.500" style="s2">issue seriously you got to understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.459" end="00:03:32.180" style="s2">what climate change is to begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.500" end="00:03:34.099" style="s2">thing to do then when you take things</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.180" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">seriously you want to build a skyscraper</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.099" end="00:03:38.810" style="s2">you know dream well then you first</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:40.519" style="s2">though the proper grounding proper</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.810" end="00:03:41.209" style="s2">basically so you understand what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.519" end="00:03:42.980" style="s2">climate change</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.209" end="00:03:45.290" style="s2">what does climate has been for the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.980" end="00:03:47.780" style="s2">three million years where does that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.290" end="00:03:50.060" style="s2">happen what drive see when this had</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.780" end="00:03:52.299" style="s2">become a problem how do you create a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.060" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">planet that has a sustainable population</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.299" end="00:03:58.040" style="s2">over ten billion units on it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:03:59.180" style="s2">route that means for example even if</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.040" end="00:04:01.069" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna take us another twenty</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.180" end="00:04:02.989" style="s2">thousand years before we have an ice age</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.069" end="00:04:04.280" style="s2">when the next ice age all right we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.989" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">cannot we tell them to be people on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.280" end="00:04:09.620" style="s2">planet so we need to fix those things</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:11.810" style="s2">that means she created mission that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.620" end="00:04:13.940" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna create an e-coat opium</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.810" end="00:04:16.700" style="s2">planet and it could talk it&#39;s a planet</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.940" end="00:04:20.539" style="s2">that are sustainable climate which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.700" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">sustainable for human life on most of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.539" end="00:04:24.020" style="s2">the planet right so you can grow food</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:25.669" style="s2">you can live there you can have your</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.430" end="00:04:34.550" style="s2">having quite a few other animals and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.900" end="00:04:37.669" style="s2">plants around them so we don&#39;t kill all</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.550" end="00:04:39.259" style="s2">of them so you can have this sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.669" end="00:04:41.300" style="s2">planet that anchor topia that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.259" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">vision of a great planet compared to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.300" end="00:04:46.460" style="s2">what we have today that is utopian and</p>

<p begin="00:04:46.460" end="00:04:51.860" style="s2">historically is a date got the engineers</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.770" end="00:04:54.139" style="s2">on the move so a lot of guys wanna you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.860" end="00:04:57.259" style="s2">know get a proper education become</p>

<p begin="00:04:57.259" end="00:05:03.020" style="s2">that&#39;s an infantile desire but go out</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.760" end="00:09:28.910" style="s2">place where we have a documented change</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.500" end="00:09:30.350" style="s2">of climate due to climate change nothing</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.910" end="00:09:31.550" style="s2">is really changed in Africa as things</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.350" end="00:09:32.990" style="s2">all right now actually Africa is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.550" end="00:09:34.660" style="s2">probably gonna be greener and wetter in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.990" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">the future then it&#39;s been so far</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.660" end="00:09:39.139" style="s2">so so these guys who said it stand for</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:42.380" style="s2">rice these papers should be fired</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.139" end="00:09:45.649" style="s2">instantly I mean that&#39;s not real but</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.380" end="00:09:47.660" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s get the facts right if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.649" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have the facts you do not have the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.660" end="00:09:53.149" style="s2">facts you cannot sit there and create a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:55.399" style="s2">mythology about climate change the more</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.149" end="00:09:57.529" style="s2">time in Africa when there is snow climb</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.399" end="00:09:58.699" style="s2">which is registered in that country that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.529" end="00:10:00.139" style="s2">is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.699" end="00:10:02.300" style="s2">and if that&#39;s happening at Western</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.139" end="00:10:04.610" style="s2">universities they&#39;re gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.300" end="00:10:06.550" style="s2">backlash of climate change deniers the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.610" end="00:10:08.300" style="s2">beginning you know that&#39;s only deserve</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.550" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">unfortunately though the climate change</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.300" end="00:10:14.269" style="s2">deniers are also wrong you know they did</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:15.620" style="s2">the wrong to climate change is real the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.269" end="00:10:18.110" style="s2">question is is it good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.620" end="00:10:21.350" style="s2">well it depends on where you go I live</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.110" end="00:10:22.910" style="s2">in Sweden Swedish the country&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.350" end="00:10:24.829" style="s2">from you yeah that&#39;s right Canada too</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.910" end="00:10:27.260" style="s2">right because Canada can support a large</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.829" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">population because it has lots of fresh</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.260" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">water so be great we should be nice for</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:34.610" style="s2">the Russians because Russia is full of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:36.110" style="s2">places where actually more people come</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.610" end="00:10:38.029" style="s2">to because it&#39;s gonna get greener and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.110" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">warmer wetter we&#39;re gonna have enormous</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.029" end="00:10:41.899" style="s2">problems in the western half of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.430" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">big problem see climate change it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.290" end="00:10:55.490" style="s2">next three to four years most climate</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:57.290" style="s2">scientists agree on that probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.490" end="00:10:58.790" style="s2">Australia&#39;s kind of a bad time to but</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.290" end="00:11:00.709" style="s2">just Charlie doesn&#39;t really have any</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:35.510" style="s2">then hmm that&#39;s a good tokenism I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.500" end="00:11:37.340" style="s2">ever hear environmentalists talk like</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.510" end="00:11:39.260" style="s2">that they&#39;re just like no it&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.340" end="00:11:41.000" style="s2">if anybody else to move no people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.260" end="00:11:42.650" style="s2">always moved and well there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.000" end="00:11:43.940" style="s2">a like what I&#39;m hearing from you now is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.650" end="00:11:46.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a confusion between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.940" end="00:11:49.250" style="s2">spiritual issue and the actual you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.790" end="00:11:52.700" style="s2">actual real facts you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.250" end="00:11:54.200" style="s2">confusing those two things yeah in other</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.700" end="00:11:57.830" style="s2">words people have people have taken this</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.200" end="00:12:02.740" style="s2">on as a spiritual almost personal issue</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.830" end="00:12:04.700" style="s2">right okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.740" end="00:12:07.640" style="s2">mixes we know where I live we get</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.700" end="00:12:09.970" style="s2">Germany mm-hmm Germany so full of car</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.640" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">factory started churning out leg 2 cars</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.970" end="00:12:15.020" style="s2">yeah these electric cars have lithium</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:17.030" style="s2">ion battery symptoms that takes about</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.020" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">seven years for a car like that to be on</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.030" end="00:12:22.130" style="s2">the road to be better for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:23.840" style="s2">environment than a diesel car cause</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.130" end="00:12:25.190" style="s2">that&#39;s how much damage you do to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.840" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">environment by creating a lithium ion</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.190" end="00:12:29.810" style="s2">battery and you put it inside a Mercedes</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:31.010" style="s2">okay not only that but these are active</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.810" end="00:12:34.220" style="s2">cars and they&#39;re rolling around on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.010" end="00:12:38.210" style="s2">streets of Germany driven by electricity</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.220" end="00:12:40.610" style="s2">that comes from coal plants that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.210" end="00:12:42.230" style="s2">worse than diesel today it&#39;s again the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.610" end="00:12:45.710" style="s2">fashion problem isn&#39;t it it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.230" end="00:12:49.280" style="s2">marketing nuclear power plants okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.710" end="00:12:50.840" style="s2">nuclear power is absolutely essential if</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.280" end="00:12:52.640" style="s2">you&#39;re Nico Tokyo because without</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.840" end="00:12:55.190" style="s2">nuclear power would not have reliable</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.640" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">affordable electricity and we need tons</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.190" end="00:12:59.150" style="s2">and tons of electricity for electricity</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:01.220" style="s2">cars and everything else would do they</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.150" end="00:13:03.080" style="s2">have centricity for example all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.220" end="00:13:04.640" style="s2">world&#39;s laptops or smartphones and data</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.080" end="00:13:06.110" style="s2">centers and all that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.640" end="00:13:08.960" style="s2">well all the stuff needs electricity</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.110" end="00:13:11.510" style="s2">we&#39;re going electronic now the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.960" end="00:13:13.880" style="s2">become an electronic also the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.510" end="00:13:15.470" style="s2">to the problems they could toe pian</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.880" end="00:13:17.900" style="s2">solutions to the environment problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.470" end="00:13:19.550" style="s2">with climate problems are all down to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.900" end="00:13:22.100" style="s2">cheap or reliable it twisted</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.550" end="00:13:23.900" style="s2">not make cheap and reliable electricity</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.100" end="00:13:26.990" style="s2">out of solar wind power</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.900" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">that won&#39;t happen but a biggest hope for</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.990" end="00:13:30.350" style="s2">that to happen is fusion energy and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:32.180" style="s2">she needs that efficient energy coming</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.350" end="00:13:34.220" style="s2">in nuclear power plants but the next two</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.180" end="00:13:36.530" style="s2">generations the Falcons are gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.220" end="00:13:39.410" style="s2">the old few will reuse it again</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.530" end="00:13:41.060" style="s2">so you recycle the you know the material</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.410" end="00:13:43.100" style="s2">from the nuclear power plants meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.060" end="00:13:47.150" style="s2">more affordable remove your weapons also</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.100" end="00:13:48.470" style="s2">right yeah but you don&#39;t gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.150" end="00:13:50.870" style="s2">problems you use telling nuclear power</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.470" end="00:13:52.460" style="s2">so you can&#39;t realistically solve the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.870" end="00:13:55.250" style="s2">current problems in the world without</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.460" end="00:13:58.010" style="s2">tons of nuclear power now the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.250" end="00:14:00.620" style="s2">and the Indians get this so the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.010" end="00:14:02.660" style="s2">are building nuclear power plants the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.620" end="00:14:04.640" style="s2">English I even build in thorium plants</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.660" end="00:14:06.350" style="s2">in addition to the Iranian plants so in</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.640" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">there will also tons on your nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.350" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">power plants the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:11.390" style="s2">Chinese and Indian people are a quart</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.190" style="s2">opium they&#39;re not environmentalist they</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.390" end="00:14:15.770" style="s2">picked opium because they realized oh my</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.190" end="00:14:17.750" style="s2">god the Tibet is gonna melt and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.770" end="00:14:19.790" style="s2">Himalayas gonna melt and if the Tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.750" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">Himalaya melt China and India would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.790" end="00:14:23.030" style="s2">wiped out so you need Tibet with snow in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:25.700" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.030" end="00:14:27.620" style="s2">Terron China you need him alive and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.700" end="00:14:30.500" style="s2">in it Tehran India otherwise there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.620" end="00:14:33.530" style="s2">Ganga put tron dance again the one who</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.500" end="00:14:35.510" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have the rivers that make</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.530" end="00:14:37.910" style="s2">China need you do what they are which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.510" end="00:14:39.080" style="s2">countries of a billion people each then</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.910" end="00:14:42.200" style="s2">you need to keep the snow in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.080" end="00:14:44.300" style="s2">mountains that motivates these guys to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.200" end="00:14:45.890" style="s2">build tons of nuclear power plants is</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.300" end="00:14:48.530" style="s2">anything like that happening in North</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.890" end="00:14:50.180" style="s2">America and Europe no because we got the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.530" end="00:14:53.600" style="s2">damn environmentalists in the way and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.180" end="00:14:55.910" style="s2">they say no nuclear power well then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:14:57.860" style="s2">have coal power instead and then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.910" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">burn trongsa fossil fuel which is what</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.860" end="00:14:59.750" style="s2">American German you&#39;re doing at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:02.210" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.750" end="00:15:04.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s not gonna helps if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.210" end="00:15:07.640" style="s2">if you take the diesel bus out you get</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.970" end="00:15:11.000" style="s2">an electric car instead an electric car</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.640" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">has you know really damaging lithium-ion</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.000" end="00:15:14.390" style="s2">batteries in it and is then gonna run</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:15.950" style="s2">electricity coming out of coal power</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.390" end="00:15:18.410" style="s2">plants for the next seven years</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.410" end="00:15:22.430" style="s2">change things for the better how do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.790" end="00:15:24.650" style="s2">know you made things worse that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.430" end="00:15:28.110" style="s2">European environmentalism today and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.650" end="00:15:31.140" style="s2">the same America okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.110" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">I&#39;ll make a token precisely because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.140" end="00:15:37.020" style="s2">considered a spiritual issue the people</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:38.280" style="s2">propose ideas like nuclear powers evil -</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.020" end="00:15:38.820" style="s2">you cannot have that as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.280" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.820" end="00:15:42.390" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:44.160" style="s2">sentimental spiritual issue that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.390" end="00:15:45.900" style="s2">because it&#39;s a real spiritual issue what</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.160" end="00:15:48.390" style="s2">are you gonna use the spirituality for</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.900" end="00:15:50.670" style="s2">then spirituality is concern with</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.390" end="00:15:52.050" style="s2">existential questions it&#39;s concerned we</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.670" end="00:15:54.120" style="s2">do you have a purpose of the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.050" end="00:15:55.710" style="s2">your life well if you&#39;re a damn soul in</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.120" end="00:15:57.510" style="s2">the wind power engineer you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.710" end="00:15:59.220" style="s2">have tons of meaning in life if you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:16:01.140" end="00:16:05.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something to live for so as far</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.680" end="00:16:07.800" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.760" end="00:16:09.390" style="s2">spirituality yes but I&#39;m much more</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.800" end="00:16:11.700" style="s2">interested like you and I&#39;ve talked a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.390" end="00:16:13.770" style="s2">lot about I&#39;m interested in Tantra I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:15.810" style="s2">interested Uniting religion is very</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.770" end="00:16:17.160" style="s2">child and again and on equitability so</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.810" end="00:16:18.540" style="s2">which is a term that we need to spread</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.160" end="00:16:20.790" style="s2">to people so they understand this</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.540" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">alternative to environmentalism meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.790" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">that if you are for technological</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:25.860" style="s2">solutions and you want to create an army</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:27.660" style="s2">of Engineers out there who solved these</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.860" end="00:16:30.300" style="s2">problems and really work with solutions</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.660" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">that work maybe a few little things with</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.300" end="00:16:33.870" style="s2">the atmosphere could we make all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:36.960" style="s2">difference with me we could come up with</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.870" end="00:16:38.760" style="s2">some genius solutions what about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.960" end="00:16:40.430" style="s2">next 10 years but that needs an echo</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.760" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">token approach which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.430" end="00:16:44.640" style="s2">technological and based on engineering</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:48.570" style="s2">and that&#39;s nothing to do with religious</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.640" end="00:16:49.700" style="s2">theology itself nothing what about let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:17:17.630" end="00:17:24.510" style="s2">engineering it&#39;s a top technological</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.699" end="00:17:26.370" style="s2">area no the engineers do great work five</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.510" end="00:17:28.890" style="s2">six days a week and it&#39;ll go in church</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.890" end="00:17:32.610" style="s2">us can make you that but the engineering</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.570" end="00:17:35.610" style="s2">work is soft it&#39;s deeply mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.610" end="00:17:37.380" style="s2">technological physical it has nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.610" end="00:17:40.020" style="s2">do with spirituality in itself it could</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.380" end="00:17:41.460" style="s2">be don&#39;t you don&#39;t think people&#39;s minds</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.020" end="00:17:43.409" style="s2">the state of their be</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:46.440" style="s2">affects like how buildings look and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.409" end="00:17:48.510" style="s2">you know I mean I look at I look around</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.440" end="00:17:50.309" style="s2">the French village and I see that these</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.510" end="00:17:52.110" style="s2">people at one point we&#39;re a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.309" end="00:17:55.649" style="s2">spiritual and you can see it in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.110" end="00:17:56.940" style="s2">stones right people have you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.649" end="00:17:59.789" style="s2">it&#39;s engineering but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.940" end="00:18:03.539" style="s2">engineering with this incredible you</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.789" end="00:18:05.549" style="s2">know a collective sort of sort of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.539" end="00:18:08.100" style="s2">say faith right now I guess I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.549" end="00:18:10.110" style="s2">thing we do now is make rockets listen</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.100" end="00:18:12.779" style="s2">if all of your faith it&#39;s no good in</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.110" end="00:18:14.490" style="s2">itself remember we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.779" end="00:18:17.669" style="s2">original religion how to religion our</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.490" end="00:18:20.309" style="s2">friends later it&#39;s about an effect so</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.669" end="00:18:21.720" style="s2">mythologies about that effects religion</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.309" end="00:18:24.029" style="s2">is essentially telling the people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.720" end="00:18:25.559" style="s2">well we&#39;ve got this fairy tale going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.029" end="00:18:27.480" style="s2">and everybody if you believe in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.559" end="00:18:29.549" style="s2">fairy tale we&#39;re gonna get handle stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.480" end="00:18:31.529" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to get out of here you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.549" end="00:18:33.419" style="s2">a silver sauce and all of you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.529" end="00:18:35.880" style="s2">able to move the next day but at the end</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.419" end="00:18:38.159" style="s2">of the day the priest gets his points it</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.880" end="00:18:39.630" style="s2">gets his likes from God if it tells</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.159" end="00:18:42.029" style="s2">people the story that puts them on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.630" end="00:18:46.110" style="s2">move the next step priests are about</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.029" end="00:18:47.669" style="s2">peace move the McRaney peace at least</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.110" end="00:18:52.500" style="s2">temporary periods of peace if people</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.669" end="00:18:54.390" style="s2">don&#39;t kill each other and adopt change</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.500" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">those are the two priestly commitments</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.390" end="00:18:59.789" style="s2">versus two people right so that means</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:02.010" style="s2">that spirituality itself is just a waste</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.789" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">of time but if people do spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.010" end="00:19:05.640" style="s2">exercise I spend a lot of time be</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:07.890" style="s2">spiritual so they didn&#39;t God and do the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.640" end="00:19:11.549" style="s2">right thing then yes it&#39;s yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.890" end="00:19:15.059" style="s2">might become better engineers exactly</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.549" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">yeah yeah okay that&#39;s why study Kristen</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.059" end="00:19:18.659" style="s2">are working we definitely working with</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:20.070" style="s2">the Akito Commission it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.659" end="00:19:21.419" style="s2">synthesis of book and it&#39;s not an adage</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.070" end="00:19:22.950" style="s2">to limit evoke so that&#39;s definitely got</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.419" end="00:19:26.250" style="s2">a part of the next book but its inherent</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.950" end="00:19:28.500" style="s2">in the ideology were presented so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.250" end="00:19:31.320" style="s2">would say a co tokenism was there from</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.500" end="00:19:33.299" style="s2">day one and the story was sociology</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.320" end="00:19:35.130" style="s2">started the original nomadic tribe has</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.299" end="00:19:37.140" style="s2">been there all along we&#39;re saving those</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.130" end="00:19:39.390" style="s2">Turner&#39;s for the third book but in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.140" end="00:19:41.190" style="s2">synthesis book get the full perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.390" end="00:19:46.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all inherent to their ideology</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.190" end="00:19:47.909" style="s2">working ok so you know we also said your</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.020" end="00:19:49.710" style="s2">am honest right so so can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.909" end="00:19:51.929" style="s2">explain that a little bit and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.710" end="00:19:53.940" style="s2">that would make everything you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.929" end="00:19:55.140" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.940" end="00:19:57.480" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to move</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.140" end="00:20:00.270" style="s2">towards this sort of idea of monism like</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.480" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">it&#39;s all one sort of thing engineering</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.270" end="00:20:07.049" style="s2">and spirituality and and the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">and and so if you&#39;re just separating</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.049" end="00:20:11.040" style="s2">these things in different compartments</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:13.530" style="s2">then maybe you don&#39;t have a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.040" end="00:20:23.429" style="s2">vision enough even though you know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.530" end="00:20:24.870" style="s2">might be a when you&#39;re born the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.429" end="00:20:29.429" style="s2">thing you&#39;re registered that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.870" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">world okay then you try to crawl up to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.429" end="00:20:32.700" style="s2">your mother&#39;s to suck the tits you</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:35.040" style="s2">unifying without world so you know how</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.700" end="00:20:36.870" style="s2">to be your own separate entity about</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.040" end="00:20:39.720" style="s2">twelve to eighteen months into your life</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.870" end="00:20:41.309" style="s2">you start to realize you are an isolated</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.720" end="00:20:44.190" style="s2">autonomous entity from your mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.309" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">body that that&#39;s when the sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.190" end="00:20:48.840" style="s2">appears for the first time that means to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:50.280" style="s2">come to de carton dead wrong no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.840" end="00:20:56.910" style="s2">that you think therefore you are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.280" end="00:20:58.470" style="s2">more you are you&#39;re their brain think</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.910" end="00:21:00.330" style="s2">rather than I think therefore hammers</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.470" end="00:21:01.950" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good way looking or</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.330" end="00:21:04.549" style="s2">started there was something there</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.950" end="00:21:07.380" style="s2">there&#39;s some big thought it existed so</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.549" end="00:21:10.350" style="s2">it&#39;s the other way around so the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.380" end="00:21:11.790" style="s2">is primary so the first thing you need</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.350" end="00:21:13.730" style="s2">to do what you do philosophies just</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.790" end="00:21:16.950" style="s2">accept that there&#39;s the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.730" end="00:21:19.429" style="s2">it&#39;s called universe universe means in</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.950" end="00:21:22.440" style="s2">Latin means everything that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.429" end="00:21:25.980" style="s2">unique bursts everything you know so any</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.440" end="00:21:28.620" style="s2">physics the work for that is gravity so</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.980" end="00:21:31.590" style="s2">everything has an effect will absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.620" end="00:21:34.770" style="s2">everything else man if we don&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.590" end="00:21:36.990" style="s2">the world say while working with now in</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.770" end="00:21:40.040" style="s2">philosophies like a return actually to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.990" end="00:21:43.350" style="s2">the old division between cosmic scales</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.040" end="00:21:45.179" style="s2">there is a primordial cause chaos or</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.350" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">some kind and then we can build some</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.179" end="00:21:50.429" style="s2">kind of cosmic order based on that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.940" end="00:21:52.770" style="s2">that&#39;s fundamental to cosmology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.429" end="00:21:54.540" style="s2">actually it&#39;s works to that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.770" end="00:21:56.100" style="s2">why I proposed this idea in work with</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.540" end="00:21:57.720" style="s2">physicists right now and I do two</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.100" end="00:21:59.429" style="s2">different time and it&#39;s just they hate</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.720" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">that I use the word I&#39;ll inches we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.429" end="00:22:03.690" style="s2">call an attribute sometimes so high for</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">time can mathematically just be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.690" end="00:22:07.230" style="s2">summary of all time measured by all</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">clocks in the entire universe</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.230" end="00:22:11.340" style="s2">and then put an average</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:13.170" style="s2">you take that sum and divide it with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.340" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">number of you get hired for time</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.170" end="00:22:15.960" style="s2">that&#39;s like the average split time of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:19.740" style="s2">the universe as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.960" end="00:22:22.620" style="s2">you can slow down here you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.740" end="00:22:24.510" style="s2">explain Hypertime a little bit okay you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.620" end="00:22:31.620" style="s2">know more in a way that I could</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.510" end="00:22:33.210" style="s2">understand today space-time yeah hi</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.620" end="00:22:37.110" style="s2">oh you&#39;re switching it around the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.210" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">time-space rather I&#39;m Steines use of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.110" end="00:22:41.370" style="s2">three dimensions and adds a fourth</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:43.350" style="s2">dimension that he calls time maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.370" end="00:22:46.470" style="s2">allows for mathematics to expand it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.350" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">meaning that time is there relative to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.470" end="00:22:50.490" style="s2">the space so they intertwine with each</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:53.250" style="s2">other and that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.490" end="00:22:56.970" style="s2">you know Einstein in time undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.250" end="00:22:59.250" style="s2">works so that means depending on where</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.970" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">you put a clock it&#39;s like no man the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.250" end="00:23:03.300" style="s2">weather stand still it will measure time</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:05.340" style="s2">giving me it will follow the arable time</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.300" end="00:23:07.950" style="s2">but if if I took a little trip out on</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.340" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">the planter space in the return here to</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.950" end="00:23:11.880" style="s2">this planet I will have aged differently</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:13.830" style="s2">from you if you stay there at the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.880" end="00:23:16.050" style="s2">time so that that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.830" end="00:23:20.130" style="s2">but that I&#39;m standing in time or we call</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.050" end="00:23:22.500" style="s2">it local time physics okay but if you if</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.130" end="00:23:24.660" style="s2">you decide that time is the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.500" end="00:23:26.820" style="s2">everything and then space comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.660" end="00:23:29.490" style="s2">time he&#39;s just not taking - just about</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.820" end="00:23:30.990" style="s2">the maddox and taking you&#39;re moving it</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.490" end="00:23:32.220" style="s2">around to the other way they discovered</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.990" end="00:23:33.420" style="s2">why would you just have one time</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.220" end="00:23:35.910" style="s2">dimension you could just have two</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.420" end="00:23:38.430" style="s2">temperatures or two different versions</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.910" end="00:23:41.070" style="s2">of time so you would at Hypertime in</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.430" end="00:23:43.170" style="s2">time you weren&#39;t the same with space</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.070" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">because if you for example work with</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.170" end="00:23:47.640" style="s2">parallel universe theory take zoom that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:48.930" style="s2">could be different universes no they</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.640" end="00:23:50.400" style="s2">could operate independently of each</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.930" end="00:23:53.460" style="s2">other you have to assume that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:55.650" style="s2">some kind of a hyperspace within which</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:23:57.510" style="s2">these universes operate independently</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.650" end="00:23:59.220" style="s2">who can hyper space can be spooky</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.510" end="00:23:59.970" style="s2">wearing all kinds of things but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.220" end="00:24:01.950" style="s2">called hyperspace</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.970" end="00:24:03.930" style="s2">you can do the same thing with time so</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.950" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">be a little time there has to be hyper</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.930" end="00:24:07.980" style="s2">time as well am I getting it well the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:10.590" style="s2">interesting thing is once you start</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.980" end="00:24:13.410" style="s2">thinking what hyper ton could be a big</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.590" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">but song calls just duration you just</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.410" end="00:24:18.030" style="s2">assume there&#39;s a pure duration they just</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:20.600" style="s2">moves at the same pace throughout</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.030" end="00:24:22.850" style="s2">history and then local time can move</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.600" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">stirring slow it or whatever okay this</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.850" end="00:24:27.650" style="s2">global time you&#39;d be to Tom damages we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:30.260" style="s2">have a flood sure you have a fluctuating</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.650" end="00:24:33.410" style="s2">time and you have a regular time like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.260" end="00:24:35.240" style="s2">clock time so you say exactly yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.410" end="00:24:38.030" style="s2">okay we can&#39;t call it absolute time</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.240" end="00:24:41.780" style="s2">because new to me that word dirty the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.030" end="00:24:43.820" style="s2">way environment listen today so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.780" end="00:24:46.040" style="s2">keep well let&#39;s go back to that but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.820" end="00:24:47.690" style="s2">thing is that once you start looking off</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.040" end="00:24:49.280" style="s2">that kind of hyper time could be for</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.690" end="00:24:52.250" style="s2">example you could have time before the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.280" end="00:24:55.820" style="s2">big bad if you&#39;re gonna do mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.250" end="00:24:57.110" style="s2">models on a possible Big Crunch that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.820" end="00:24:59.150" style="s2">predates the Big Bang</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.110" end="00:25:00.590" style="s2">you can suddenly do that because you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.150" end="00:25:02.300" style="s2">can&#39;t do them with our starting time a</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.590" end="00:25:04.430" style="s2">tiny town it&#39;s a stop at the Big Bang</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.300" end="00:25:06.830" style="s2">it starts there okay now you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.430" end="00:25:08.450" style="s2">another time that actually is older than</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.830" end="00:25:11.480" style="s2">the Big Bang itself so if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.450" end="00:25:13.130" style="s2">just work with theories like that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.480" end="00:25:14.540" style="s2">could call the virtual time too but if</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.130" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">you want good theories like that you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.540" end="00:25:17.630" style="s2">assume there&#39;s a hyper time now then do</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">something why don&#39;t you just start</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.630" end="00:25:23.030" style="s2">discussing hyper time versus global time</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:25.550" style="s2">versus local time you also discover that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.030" end="00:25:27.710" style="s2">wait a second we also have this problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.550" end="00:25:30.860" style="s2">physics that either the world is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.710" end="00:25:35.270" style="s2">continuous or analog or the word is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.860" end="00:25:38.180" style="s2">fundamentally discrete okay it&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.270" end="00:25:40.370" style="s2">issue okay right got it yeah okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.180" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">okay we know that if we go all the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.370" end="00:25:44.270" style="s2">down to the Planck length which is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:47.180" style="s2">smallest unit we know of where anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.270" end="00:25:48.800" style="s2">makes sentence below the Planck length</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.180" end="00:25:49.730" style="s2">if it&#39;s even smaller that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.800" end="00:25:51.770" style="s2">called pure chaos</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.730" end="00:25:54.950" style="s2">mmm that the Planck length something</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.770" end="00:25:57.920" style="s2">weird happens suddenly the spins become</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.950" end="00:25:59.960" style="s2">on or off so the zeros are ones that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.920" end="00:26:01.940" style="s2">we&#39;re familiar with from mathematics I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.960" end="00:26:03.860" style="s2">mean we call the information zero one</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.940" end="00:26:05.810" style="s2">right they start already at the Planck</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.860" end="00:26:07.310" style="s2">length and that seems to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.810" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">with just about everything we have in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.310" end="00:26:11.870" style="s2">our current expanding universe where</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">nothing is ever destroyed meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.870" end="00:26:15.470" style="s2">information is never destroyed not even</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:17.480" style="s2">in black holes meaning the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.470" end="00:26:19.300" style="s2">the universe is expanding is because the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.480" end="00:26:23.660" style="s2">information of the universe is expand</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.300" end="00:26:25.910" style="s2">all right trechie</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.660" end="00:26:30.290" style="s2">why this information theory a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.910" end="00:26:33.530" style="s2">like this is all called quantum</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.290" end="00:26:34.370" style="s2">information theory yeah a whole new area</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.530" end="00:26:36.679" style="s2">of physics</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.370" end="00:26:38.510" style="s2">but if you heard about Holograms and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.679" end="00:26:41.059" style="s2">things like that that&#39;s all part of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.510" end="00:26:43.580" style="s2">whole new domain and guys like so skin</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.059" end="00:26:45.169" style="s2">and small in and get sick and all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.580" end="00:26:46.850" style="s2">most brilliant this is the South they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.169" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">working a stuff at the moment they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.850" end="00:26:50.299" style="s2">really far ahead of the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.490" style="s2">they&#39;re doing now quantum information</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.299" end="00:26:54.710" style="s2">theory and they try to see if that to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.490" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">work within loop quantum gravity theory</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.710" end="00:26:59.090" style="s2">maybe you would strength your eventually</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:27:00.529" style="s2">so all the different traces business has</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.090" end="00:27:02.779" style="s2">been working on for the past 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.529" end="00:27:05.750" style="s2">maybe could be different versions of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.779" end="00:27:07.700" style="s2">same thing which which is quite likely</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.750" end="00:27:10.760" style="s2">if you start talking digging really deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.700" end="00:27:13.070" style="s2">into it but but the great thing with</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.760" end="00:27:15.620" style="s2">hyper time is that hyper time would then</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.070" end="00:27:17.720" style="s2">be some kind of a void some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.620" end="00:27:19.549" style="s2">chaos meaning you could also solve the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.720" end="00:27:21.770" style="s2">problem whether the world is continuous</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.549" end="00:27:26.570" style="s2">where the world is discrete by saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.770" end="00:27:29.330" style="s2">it&#39;s probably both right so it&#39;s a wave</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.570" end="00:27:31.750" style="s2">and a particle again the obvious cliché</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.330" end="00:27:34.490" style="s2">well well even more than that even we</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.750" end="00:27:36.470" style="s2">wait particle yeah I would say physics</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.490" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">we proven by now that the field is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.470" end="00:27:40.130" style="s2">primary to the particle because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:42.679" style="s2">particle only occurs when there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.130" end="00:27:44.960" style="s2">absurdly involved otherwise it&#39;s a field</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.679" end="00:27:47.029" style="s2">you call that field intensities so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.960" end="00:27:48.470" style="s2">field intensities are primary to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.029" end="00:27:50.120" style="s2">particles so that&#39;s not an even</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.470" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">situation no but this is more about</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.120" end="00:27:54.260" style="s2">these great discretion because as fields</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:57.409" style="s2">can also be discrete to deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.260" end="00:27:59.779" style="s2">deeper than the particle and the field</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.409" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">all that taught us how to think in two</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.779" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">realms at the same time but in which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:07.159" style="s2">great but I&#39;m beginning to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:08.990" style="s2">we could probably get a Hypertime as</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.159" end="00:28:11.690" style="s2">realized that&#39;s like it continued use</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.990" end="00:28:14.200" style="s2">void of some kind on waits you then</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.690" end="00:28:16.700" style="s2">build the current discrete universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.200" end="00:28:18.679" style="s2">we&#39;ll see when we arrived with a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.700" end="00:28:22.970" style="s2">mathematics well what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.679" end="00:28:26.029" style="s2">like as a philosopher I&#39;m perfectly loud</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.970" end="00:28:28.220" style="s2">and I&#39;m even encouraged to further</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.029" end="00:28:30.909" style="s2">pursue this idea and see what we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.220" end="00:28:33.380" style="s2">derive okay so that&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.909" end="00:28:36.860" style="s2">reminds me of the heart sutra says form</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.380" end="00:28:41.029" style="s2">is emptiness emptiness is form there</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.860" end="00:28:48.100" style="s2">there there and then it says again form</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.029" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">is form it&#39;s not like what void</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.100" end="00:28:51.429" style="s2">you said that a continuous void or</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:53.739" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.429" end="00:28:55.359" style="s2">well I used the void maybe maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.739" end="00:28:56.739" style="s2">a bad term like environmentalist I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.359" end="00:28:59.080" style="s2">gonna have to skip it as we work further</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.739" end="00:29:05.409" style="s2">with this I say to anyone looking at</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.080" end="00:29:07.389" style="s2">cosmos and chaos but so the chaos is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.409" end="00:29:09.340" style="s2">continues at the cost of this case is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.389" end="00:29:11.350" style="s2">discrete meaning even the words cost</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.340" end="00:29:13.899" style="s2">wasn&#39;t chaos a kind of limited please</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.350" end="00:29:17.649" style="s2">note however but this is just one</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.899" end="00:29:21.099" style="s2">universe so that means the hypertunnel</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.649" end="00:29:23.979" style="s2">working on it&#39;s just a foundation it has</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.099" end="00:29:26.919" style="s2">to infinity it has no void in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.979" end="00:29:28.840" style="s2">of anything empty no it has smallest</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.919" end="00:29:32.950" style="s2">possible units and most enormous</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.840" end="00:29:36.220" style="s2">possible units but it can contain those</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.950" end="00:29:37.929" style="s2">two things but the Hypertime if you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.220" end="00:29:39.549" style="s2">work on it and get it right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.929" end="00:29:42.460" style="s2">actually something which we can then</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.549" end="00:29:44.440" style="s2">build the current Einstein in space-time</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.460" end="00:29:46.629" style="s2">which apparently season valid for our</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.440" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">universe but that means that current</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.629" end="00:29:51.099" style="s2">understanding in space-time is probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:54.009" style="s2">not the end of the day and the glue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.099" end="00:29:56.590" style="s2">nested within Hypertime is how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.009" end="00:29:59.109" style="s2">saying it&#39;s it&#39;s all we could say</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.590" end="00:30:00.369" style="s2">Hypertime is that on which the rest is</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.109" end="00:30:03.369" style="s2">built okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.369" end="00:30:05.019" style="s2">the great thing with these theories is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.369" end="00:30:06.609" style="s2">that if you can solve Hypertime</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.019" end="00:30:09.539" style="s2">isolation the quantum information theory</p>

<p begin="00:30:17.769" end="00:30:21.519" style="s2">meaning that means you also solve the</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.639" end="00:30:39.129" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought bravely enough yet it</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.979" end="00:30:42.039" style="s2">wasn&#39;t we enough yet mhm and this both</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.129" end="00:30:44.409" style="s2">more complexity more simplicity to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.039" end="00:30:47.619" style="s2">better physics so you have to be both</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.409" end="00:30:49.299" style="s2">capable of simplifying things and also</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.619" end="00:30:52.450" style="s2">making them more complex at the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.299" end="00:30:55.419" style="s2">time that&#39;s our physics is so difficult</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.450" end="00:30:57.970" style="s2">oh that&#39;s great yeah yeah but but math</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.419" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">math mathematics alone cannot solve that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.970" end="00:31:01.570" style="s2">problem and the problem informatics is</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:03.700" style="s2">like it can you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.570" end="00:31:05.980" style="s2">in loops like string theory did and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.700" end="00:31:08.290" style="s2">certainly anybody does infinities and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.980" end="00:31:09.700" style="s2">transfers mathematics and alpha Lewis</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.290" end="00:31:11.980" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to in reality because</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.700" end="00:31:13.540" style="s2">there is no infinity in that&#39;s my next</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.980" end="00:31:15.730" style="s2">question really is how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.540" end="00:31:20.740" style="s2">how do you translate all this to reality</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.730" end="00:31:22.870" style="s2">and oh you do I mean I prefer not to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.740" end="00:31:25.150" style="s2">work with anything in mathematics that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.870" end="00:31:27.040" style="s2">is not connected to reality because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.150" end="00:31:29.530" style="s2">interested in mathematics being a proper</p>

<p begin="00:31:32.950" end="00:31:38.200" style="s2">represented I see okay that was the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.610" end="00:31:40.180" style="s2">point with mathematics until we</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.200" end="00:31:42.580" style="s2">introduced the zero and we introduced</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.180" end="00:31:45.160" style="s2">infinity son now the serie song was</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.580" end="00:31:47.650" style="s2">popular mathematics because it made</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.160" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">counting so easy for capitalists we</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.650" end="00:31:52.030" style="s2">could not have built capitalism unless</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:53.590" style="s2">you first accepted the zero in economics</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.030" end="00:31:56.920" style="s2">that changed everything because we</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.590" end="00:32:00.070" style="s2">suddenly had 10 in 100 but please know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.920" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">that the zero in itself does not exist</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.070" end="00:32:09.400" style="s2">in nature there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:09.910" style="s2">nothing why is there something rather</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.400" end="00:32:12.460" style="s2">than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.910" end="00:32:15.460" style="s2">is it wrong they ask questions there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.460" end="00:32:17.290" style="s2">nothing there&#39;s only infinite play can</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.460" end="00:32:19.180" style="s2">be not they cannot be nothing we just</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.290" end="00:32:21.700" style="s2">have to get you steady that something is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.180" end="00:32:25.870" style="s2">something period there is no option</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.700" end="00:32:28.270" style="s2">called nothingness hmm yeah we think</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.870" end="00:32:30.310" style="s2">nothing that is because we did not exist</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.270" end="00:32:32.650" style="s2">before a certain date we think nothing</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.310" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">less because we because we die one day</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.650" end="00:32:36.850" style="s2">and again would be into anthropocentric</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.980" style="s2">because obsessed with ourselves be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.850" end="00:32:41.950" style="s2">narcissistic another hundred then we</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.980" end="00:32:45.460" style="s2">think that the most no there is history</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.950" end="00:32:46.990" style="s2">before us this history after us well the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.460" end="00:32:49.960" style="s2">Buddhist position would be like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.990" end="00:32:53.500" style="s2">no substance there&#39;s no such there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.960" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">no thing like there&#39;s no actual thing</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:33:01.090" style="s2">just there&#39;s just one there there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.300" end="00:33:04.780" style="s2">thing there&#39;s no sense of underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.090" end="00:33:07.060" style="s2">thing that what they mean by emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.780" end="00:33:09.700" style="s2">they don&#39;t mean a sort of blank void</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.060" end="00:33:11.060" style="s2">they mean they mean kind of Union of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.700" end="00:33:14.180" style="s2">plenitude and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.060" end="00:33:15.710" style="s2">than zero or that&#39;s just because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.180" end="00:33:17.930" style="s2">missing out on the next important thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.710" end="00:33:19.940" style="s2">in metaphysics and that once accepted</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.930" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">there&#39;s one world that&#39;s the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.940" end="00:33:27.050" style="s2">that&#39;s one like nature says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:29.390" style="s2">nothing less than two nature meaning the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.050" end="00:33:33.170" style="s2">world is full of attributes of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.390" end="00:33:35.750" style="s2">difference mm-hmm so when when used</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.170" end="00:33:38.330" style="s2">start registering a thing when you sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.750" end="00:33:40.130" style="s2">of raise it a phenomenon even object in</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.330" end="00:33:42.680" style="s2">the content sense that means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.130" end="00:33:45.020" style="s2">difference in fields of intensities</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.680" end="00:33:47.330" style="s2">there&#39;s more intensity in one place than</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.020" end="00:33:49.730" style="s2">there is in another for example I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.330" end="00:33:52.040" style="s2">sitting there at a table okay the table</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.730" end="00:33:54.290" style="s2">itself is more dense than the air around</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.040" end="00:33:55.820" style="s2">the tape that&#39;s a difference in</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.290" end="00:33:57.770" style="s2">intensity between but the table is</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.820" end="00:33:59.480" style="s2">supposed to be more full of space right</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.770" end="00:34:06.280" style="s2">then the air which is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.480" end="00:34:09.050" style="s2">more so okay that&#39;s that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.280" end="00:34:13.370" style="s2">there&#39;s no substance to it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.050" end="00:34:15.169" style="s2">forces so if you look at an electron for</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.370" end="00:34:17.419" style="s2">example the power of the electron is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.169" end="00:34:21.020" style="s2">amazing because any turn itself there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.419" end="00:34:22.880" style="s2">anything it&#39;s incredibly small but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.020" end="00:34:28.060" style="s2">power field surrounding the electron is</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.880" end="00:34:30.320" style="s2">amazing so these fields or forces</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.060" end="00:34:32.260" style="s2">essentially what what creates a</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.320" end="00:34:36.380" style="s2">substance that we perceive as being</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.260" end="00:34:37.880" style="s2">substance and so now we know that from</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.380" end="00:34:39.710" style="s2">physics and that&#39;s not even you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.880" end="00:34:41.419" style="s2">disputable but that&#39;s how it works so</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.710" end="00:34:43.909" style="s2">that&#39;s a trick of the mind but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.419" end="00:34:46.250" style="s2">certainly something there and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.909" end="00:34:49.100" style="s2">much a philosophical realist there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.250" end="00:34:51.530" style="s2">real world if you don&#39;t believe in it</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.100" end="00:34:53.330" style="s2">just get blown fold it and walk around</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.530" end="00:34:55.580" style="s2">and hit the wall a few times you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.330" end="00:34:57.310" style="s2">certainly God says knock yourself in the</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.310" end="00:35:01.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a worldly dependent of your</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.640" end="00:35:08.240" style="s2">constantly if that&#39;s the case so should</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:10.970" style="s2">we move on to religion perhaps then</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">since we&#39;ve we&#39;ve judged that with what</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.970" end="00:35:15.530" style="s2">monism and all that we also wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:17.810" style="s2">also wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.530" end="00:35:20.780" style="s2">Zoroastrian and I kind of put a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.810" end="00:35:22.180" style="s2">Buddhism in there so okay where does</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.780" end="00:35:24.819" style="s2">dualism come from</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.460" end="00:35:35.530" style="s2">the Christians the Muslims decided that</p>

<p begin="00:42:41.470" end="00:42:44.950" style="s2">you&#39;re basically dealing with these two</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.300" end="00:42:47.140" style="s2">guys and how you&#39;re gonna figure out</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.950" end="00:42:49.150" style="s2">whether you&#39;re gonna see differences</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.140" end="00:42:51.010" style="s2">primary whether you gonna see services</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.150" end="00:42:53.500" style="s2">are primary it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.010" end="00:42:55.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit like you can either work from</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.500" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">physics as an emergence and understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.690" end="00:42:59.500" style="s2">physics well you can work for say</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:02.110" style="s2">biology and understand biologists and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.500" end="00:43:04.030" style="s2">merges with its own lost its own habits</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.110" end="00:43:06.010" style="s2">and then work and understand biology and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.030" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">biological evolution so you can start it</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.010" end="00:43:09.730" style="s2">that way like now to me I&#39;m neutral John</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.760" style="s2">Hagelin Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.730" end="00:43:14.530" style="s2">I love spittle sort of bits I would say</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.760" end="00:43:17.260" style="s2">that my worldviews fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.530" end="00:43:20.740" style="s2">illnesses and I&#39;m using Hegel to think</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.260" end="00:43:24.310" style="s2">meaning as a thinker I&#39;m incredibly hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.740" end="00:43:27.640" style="s2">Julia so that&#39;s dialect I&#39;m not doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.310" end="00:43:32.820" style="s2">list at all I&#39;m honest and dialectics is</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.640" end="00:43:32.820" style="s2">essentially the road towards understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.810" end="00:43:40.750" style="s2">this modest universe better it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.120" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">logical procedure for you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.750" end="00:43:45.460" style="s2">at the truth of things so weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:46.990" style="s2">we&#39;re living in the shadows of Hegel and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.460" end="00:43:50.230" style="s2">Spinoza and that is with Western</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.990" end="00:43:52.060" style="s2">thinking is now there is though that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.230" end="00:43:53.950" style="s2">just got used to monism</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.060" end="00:43:57.340" style="s2">meaning monism is either Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.950" end="00:44:00.460" style="s2">dialectics or it&#39;s spinosus monist</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.340" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">pound faced worldview Morrison was</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.460" end="00:44:08.710" style="s2">always the thing in in the east</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:13.210" style="s2">Towson yeah Buddhism so rest in ISM and</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.710" end="00:44:16.490" style="s2">him Euston well say we talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.210" end="00:44:18.200" style="s2">disarray literal monist religions okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.490" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">I&#39;m not really sure Hinduism is - to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.200" end="00:44:21.230" style="s2">honest about all kinds of weird ideas</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:23.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve been carnation that don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.230" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">fit into monitor but with Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.570" end="00:44:28.100" style="s2">we know in some ways or asterism you are</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:31.580" style="s2">really dealing with this world news</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.100" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">maybe the universe is one is huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.580" end="00:44:35.960" style="s2">of attributes of this universe and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">ourselves are expressions of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.960" end="00:44:41.060" style="s2">universe that is always a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:43.190" style="s2">looking in the world because it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.060" end="00:44:45.260" style="s2">correct you don&#39;t run into the problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.190" end="00:44:47.540" style="s2">with two different substances finding</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.260" end="00:44:49.100" style="s2">you know and then you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.540" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">clue how they communicate with each</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.100" end="00:44:52.550" style="s2">other because that requires a third</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:53.950" style="s2">substance and then you lost it rather</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.550" end="00:44:56.690" style="s2">you look at the universe is just one</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.950" end="00:45:02.570" style="s2">substance period and to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.690" end="00:45:04.700" style="s2">substance functions physics right and on</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.570" end="00:45:06.619" style="s2">that substance you can double that to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.700" end="00:45:09.590" style="s2">means for example the world of biology</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.619" end="00:45:12.440" style="s2">which is an emergent property on that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.590" end="00:45:15.830" style="s2">substance so biology becomes out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.440" end="00:45:17.300" style="s2">physics and some they just occurs and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.830" end="00:45:21.140" style="s2">because it&#39;s something just occurred it</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.300" end="00:45:26.330" style="s2">operates according to tone rules so do</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.140" end="00:45:28.790" style="s2">you so do I now with Morrison you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.330" end="00:45:30.850" style="s2">run into problems with science got throw</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.790" end="00:45:33.859" style="s2">down with you can step right into</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.850" end="00:45:35.960" style="s2">eastern thinking and you can get it you</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.859" end="00:45:38.390" style="s2">can immerse yourself in it and you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.960" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">also get into 19th century Western</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.390" end="00:45:42.920" style="s2">philosophy but he took until the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:45.020" style="s2">century and the recognition of Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.920" end="00:45:47.390" style="s2">by both Hegel and Nietzsche until you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.020" end="00:45:49.310" style="s2">finally got around to understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.390" end="00:45:51.020" style="s2">world from a monist worldview in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.310" end="00:45:52.670" style="s2">West that might be called the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.020" end="00:45:54.200" style="s2">materialist world you I don&#39;t care when</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.670" end="00:45:56.450" style="s2">it&#39;s material on it&#39;s just one damn</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.200" end="00:45:59.270" style="s2">substance as far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.450" end="00:46:01.790" style="s2">pretty material okay so so you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.270" end="00:46:03.980" style="s2">pretty anti-christian and all this but</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.790" end="00:46:05.290" style="s2">one thing I said at one point was that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.980" end="00:46:07.820" style="s2">you thought that the Catholic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.290" end="00:46:12.410" style="s2">introduced something called mercy and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.820" end="00:46:15.530" style="s2">this was important the idea of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.410" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">of the idea of mercy right yeah but that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.530" end="00:46:20.540" style="s2">is nothing do we do even is it may be</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:22.670" style="s2">may be required do we listen</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.540" end="00:46:24.440" style="s2">to get started you know like life</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.670" end="00:46:25.940" style="s2">originally started on the very special</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.440" end="00:46:28.020" style="s2">circumstances we don&#39;t need those</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.940" end="00:46:31.170" style="s2">special circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.020" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">so maybe dualism was a reason why you</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.170" end="00:46:35.310" style="s2">could develop concepts like grace and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:37.290" style="s2">mercy because to be a beautiful spirit</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.310" end="00:46:38.730" style="s2">you had to you know you did save me with</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.290" end="00:46:40.619" style="s2">your body and then you went somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.730" end="00:46:42.510" style="s2">and somebody was grateful to say we</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.619" end="00:46:44.400" style="s2">forgive you persons because you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.510" end="00:46:46.920" style="s2">body because you were just got a body</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">and we although embody sound like so we</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.920" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">can forgive you for that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:51.510" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:53.400" style="s2">because grace and mercy will probably be</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.510" end="00:46:55.080" style="s2">required what they did it have told</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.400" end="00:46:56.730" style="s2">tsunami hits us in the next 10 to 50</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.080" end="00:46:58.230" style="s2">years because everything will now be</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.730" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">memorized and if you don&#39;t have great a</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.230" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">summer say we cannot stand each other so</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:04.920" style="s2">point taken but it doesn&#39;t mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:08.130" style="s2">can accept dualism because doing is is</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.920" end="00:47:09.900" style="s2">wrong and what the zone Aster&#39;s did when</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.130" end="00:47:12.480" style="s2">I converted to racism was that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.900" end="00:47:15.150" style="s2">considered all the dualism Manicheans</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.480" end="00:47:17.880" style="s2">Gnostics the masochist there were a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.150" end="00:47:20.460" style="s2">of dualist religious coming at a person</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.880" end="00:47:22.380" style="s2">Babylon especially in the early part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.460" end="00:47:24.060" style="s2">our you know after after Christ about</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.380" end="00:47:25.710" style="s2">the period those first four hundred</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.060" end="00:47:27.750" style="s2">years and they&#39;re all considered</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.710" end="00:47:29.640" style="s2">heretics by the surest really funny</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.750" end="00:47:32.580" style="s2">moments and I find that interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.640" end="00:47:34.680" style="s2">Aston administer aggressively Manas</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.580" end="00:47:36.840" style="s2">religion there&#39;s only one in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.680" end="00:47:39.050" style="s2">universe period it also essentially it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.840" end="00:47:41.670" style="s2">a sauce tree</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.050" end="00:47:43.980" style="s2">so what do you do is is a raster in I</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.670" end="00:47:46.890" style="s2">mean what do you practice what is your</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.980" end="00:47:48.600" style="s2">praxis like you know in Buddhism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.890" end="00:47:50.910" style="s2">all these series of things you do right</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.600" end="00:47:52.740" style="s2">and and I guess not most religions</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.910" end="00:47:57.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things that you do</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.740" end="00:47:59.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a cup of coffee meditation</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.840" end="00:48:02.130" style="s2">called the awesome rule so that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.640" end="00:48:04.260" style="s2">of the meditation okay I mean I focus on</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.130" end="00:48:06.359" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna do that day and I can</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.260" end="00:48:08.340" style="s2">focus on having a constructive mindset</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.359" end="00:48:09.810" style="s2">and setting our clear goals that I want</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.340" end="00:48:12.410" style="s2">to achieve that day there you found it</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.810" end="00:48:15.510" style="s2">great and then I do those things and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.410" end="00:48:17.220" style="s2">amortize those things and I don&#39;t wear</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.510" end="00:48:19.590" style="s2">it around like thinking what else am I</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.220" end="00:48:22.200" style="s2">gonna do I stay focused we do what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.590" end="00:48:24.150" style="s2">supposed to do and that is all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.200" end="00:48:30.930" style="s2">dripping down for my overall purpose</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.150" end="00:48:33.630" style="s2">with my life what I find before it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.930" end="00:48:35.850" style="s2">very ethical semester this is just not</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.630" end="00:48:37.560" style="s2">have any morality is it purely ethical</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.850" end="00:48:40.650" style="s2">really didn&#39;t mean he&#39;s only interested</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.560" end="00:48:41.700" style="s2">in cause and effect so do this little</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.650" end="00:48:44.400" style="s2">thing in the morning this</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.700" end="00:48:48.750" style="s2">thing means the wave you do that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.400" end="00:48:50.850" style="s2">equivalent to the way you like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.750" end="00:48:53.610" style="s2">you think he&#39;s probably gonna be what</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.850" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">you say and we&#39;ll just say it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.610" end="00:48:59.460" style="s2">produce the act commit and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:03.090" style="s2">commit with the starting point for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.460" end="00:49:05.310" style="s2">next thought so this is like a circle do</p>

<p begin="00:50:34.950" end="00:50:38.190" style="s2">we could be pretty tolerant</p>

<p begin="00:50:38.190" end="00:50:42.000" style="s2">and things like that no sir asterism is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.110" end="00:50:44.790" style="s2">actually fundamentally very liberal</p>

<p begin="00:52:29.070" end="00:52:41.100" style="s2">mean there&#39;s no the ball yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:42.660" style="s2">problem yeah I don&#39;t like I caught my</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.100" end="00:52:44.310" style="s2">calls harassing some towers of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.660" end="00:52:46.230" style="s2">I call the silk group to try it</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.310" end="00:52:47.570" style="s2">we&#39;ve enrolled leaders along the Silk</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.230" end="00:52:50.940" style="s2">Road yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.570" end="00:52:52.590" style="s2">Hindus didn&#39;t spread the same way and</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.940" end="00:52:54.740" style="s2">that&#39;s because it is really compatible</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.590" end="00:52:57.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not one path there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.740" end="00:52:59.580" style="s2">teaching you could actually take Wade</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.210" end="00:53:02.190" style="s2">along the trade routes because Hindus is</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.580" end="00:53:05.900" style="s2">facing with just acceptance in Indian</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.190" end="00:53:08.490" style="s2">culture all the rich variety or beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.900" end="00:53:10.140" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s where you can worship an L</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.490" end="00:53:12.060" style="s2">called one day and then you worship</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.140" end="00:53:15.330" style="s2">Brahm on the next day and you worship</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.060" end="00:53:17.369" style="s2">Shiva and calling the next day Hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.330" end="00:53:21.420" style="s2">is incredibly interesting to study the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.369" end="00:53:23.640" style="s2">original mythology it is a lot of Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.420" end="00:53:26.730" style="s2">mystics are dealing with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.640" end="00:53:27.750" style="s2">maybe time is an illusion you know all</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.730" end="00:53:30.200" style="s2">of these things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.750" end="00:53:32.130" style="s2">around us are just like a ephemeral</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.200" end="00:53:33.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of him to miss just to</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.130" end="00:53:35.730" style="s2">deal with that and they come from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.570" end="00:53:37.820" style="s2">Dravidian tradition in southern India</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.730" end="00:53:41.490" style="s2">really and that&#39;s also why the homicide</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.820" end="00:53:43.650" style="s2">young reincarnation okay reincarnation</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.490" end="00:53:46.320" style="s2">requires the separation of spirit ambani</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.650" end="00:53:50.040" style="s2">so you run into the problem dualism</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.320" end="00:53:51.570" style="s2">again and I would say most of Hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.040" end="00:53:53.580" style="s2">has a problem with doing this in their</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.570" end="00:53:56.580" style="s2">heart they were dealing they call it non</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.580" end="00:53:59.790" style="s2">dual you should have kind of make it</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.580" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2">suspection it why is it non dual if it</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.790" end="00:54:05.369" style="s2">isn&#39;t just most well I&#39;ve heard one</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:07.230" style="s2">explanation I can tell you you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.369" end="00:54:09.330" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no there&#39;s not one and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.230" end="00:54:12.210" style="s2">not two so no you know because if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.330" end="00:54:13.710" style="s2">say - you&#39;re wrong but if also if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.210" end="00:54:18.980" style="s2">say one you&#39;re denying you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.710" end="00:54:24.200" style="s2">diversity or so so okay so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.980" end="00:54:24.200" style="s2">neti neti not one not to us that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.130" end="00:54:30.599" style="s2">Cardinal whatever but it isn&#39;t and this</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.050" end="00:54:33.150" style="s2">you know there lot about should be going</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.599" end="00:54:34.410" style="s2">in somebody&#39;s will note that but you say</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.150" end="00:54:37.320" style="s2">you&#39;re not something haven&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.410" end="00:54:39.599" style="s2">find what you are so I would say that in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.320" end="00:54:42.330" style="s2">itself certainly brings the alarm bells</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.599" end="00:54:44.490" style="s2">to me I&#39;m a radical modest and when you</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.330" end="00:54:47.010" style="s2">look at non dual teachings coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.490" end="00:54:48.750" style="s2">India they are often make that last</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.010" end="00:54:52.410" style="s2">little turn down that could really say</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.750" end="00:54:55.050" style="s2">well the reality are the 1s itself is</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.410" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">also dilution so there&#39;s like time--as</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.050" end="00:55:00.060" style="s2">solutions it&#39;s like this is one sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:55:02.760" style="s2">massive being the brahma and then you</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.060" end="00:55:06.390" style="s2">say well there is change difference</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.760" end="00:55:11.000" style="s2">obviously no universe is expanding right</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.390" end="00:55:13.830" style="s2">so we live we die evolution or Nexus so</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.000" end="00:55:17.070" style="s2">there&#39;s the Kali Yuga and all the cycles</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.830" end="00:55:19.400" style="s2">of time that they describe it yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.070" end="00:55:22.350" style="s2">that&#39;s changed so it changed Eastern if</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.400" end="00:55:24.180" style="s2">change is an illusion then whose</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.350" end="00:55:27.360" style="s2">set up this whole theater and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.180" end="00:55:29.400" style="s2">arrive with the idea the world is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.360" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">originally some kind of a theatre he set</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.400" end="00:55:32.790" style="s2">up wasn&#39;t kind of God playing around</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:35.640" style="s2">with us that&#39;s always very around we do</p>

<p begin="01:10:01.680" end="01:10:06.780" style="s2">your mind for today that was that was my</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.710" end="01:10:08.550" style="s2">list I actually I had well one thing I</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.780" end="01:10:09.810" style="s2">had here I wrote down logos versus</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.550" end="01:10:13.050" style="s2">mythos because I was trying to think</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.810" end="01:10:17.130" style="s2">about oh yeah okay for the difference</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.050" end="01:10:19.770" style="s2">between well we actually have six words</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.130" end="01:10:22.250" style="s2">in Greek so why don&#39;t we involve other</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.770" end="01:10:24.450" style="s2">guys to have a conversation with us okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.250" end="01:10:26.100" style="s2">fundamentally storytelling is through</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.450" end="01:10:26.940" style="s2">different types of storytelling it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.100" end="01:10:29.040" style="s2">battlefield</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.940" end="01:10:33.060" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s father and son</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.040" end="01:10:35.340" style="s2">relationship that&#39;s logos there is there</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.060" end="01:10:37.140" style="s2">is the the ritual just sexual in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.340" end="01:10:38.970" style="s2">tribe of course it&#39;s pagan so the ritual</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.140" end="01:10:42.870" style="s2">is for sexuality and religion II that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.970" end="01:10:46.230" style="s2">man versus woman and that is pathos and</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.870" end="01:10:47.970" style="s2">the third one is mythos which is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.230" end="01:10:49.679" style="s2">campfire at night with children our</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.970" end="01:10:52.050" style="s2">pathos and</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.679" end="01:10:54.059" style="s2">yeah and myth mythology like Yoda pieces</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.050" end="01:10:56.369" style="s2">has a story about we&#39;re gonna get moving</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.059" end="01:10:57.780" style="s2">tomorrow we respect the metro we respect</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.369" end="01:11:00.659" style="s2">the patriarchy the whole tribe has to</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.780" end="01:11:02.340" style="s2">blue so the mythos and the logos in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.659" end="01:11:05.039" style="s2">palace are all this year but then you</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.340" end="01:11:09.510" style="s2">got these words ethos and you got Kairos</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.039" end="01:11:11.219" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got totals in it okay so in</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.510" end="01:11:14.130" style="s2">the world of rhetoric these terms are</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.219" end="01:11:16.530" style="s2">important now the question is could</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.130" end="01:11:18.869" style="s2">these possibly be the in-betweens</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.530" end="01:11:21.239" style="s2">between on three could it be quite</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.869" end="01:11:25.709" style="s2">beautiful if you could have a map or you</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.239" end="01:11:29.489" style="s2">could have all six question is then what</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.709" end="01:11:32.489" style="s2">would connect the battlefield with a</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.489" end="01:11:35.400" style="s2">ritual that would be like the masculine</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.489" end="01:11:38.459" style="s2">real where like you deliver the battle</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.400" end="01:11:41.749" style="s2">for clinical every what are a</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.459" end="01:11:41.749" style="s2">lot of women during the ritual right</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.050" end="01:11:48.360" style="s2"> so what would that be now what</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.019" end="01:11:51.059" style="s2">would the connection between battlefield</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.360" end="01:11:53.010" style="s2">and campfire because that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.059" end="01:11:55.530" style="s2">father comes home and he sees their</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.010" end="01:11:57.420" style="s2">mother&#39;s child you know the idealist oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.530" end="01:11:59.489" style="s2">well I&#39;m here to deliver to you guys and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.420" end="01:12:02.639" style="s2">to protect you so you like the center of</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.489" end="01:12:04.380" style="s2">the tribe and you you are the scale self</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.639" end="01:12:06.059" style="s2">that you have to provide me some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.380" end="01:12:08.789" style="s2">order because this is where I gain</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.059" end="01:12:10.800" style="s2">spiration from to the family so the cost</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.789" end="01:12:13.409" style="s2">was chaos relationship is here changed</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.800" end="01:12:15.539" style="s2">around women and children represent the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.409" end="01:12:16.949" style="s2">cosmos and it&#39;s the man of the world all</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.539" end="01:12:18.749" style="s2">the world out there represents the chaos</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.949" end="01:12:21.679" style="s2">because they&#39;re gonna be ordering even</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.749" end="01:12:24.449" style="s2">the cows to deliver trade order inside</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.679" end="01:12:26.909" style="s2">that traffic that takes one of these</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.449" end="01:12:28.619" style="s2">turns - and the third one would be what</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.909" end="01:12:31.199" style="s2">would then be between pathos and</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.619" end="01:12:33.179" style="s2">missiles will be the connection between</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.199" end="01:12:35.099" style="s2">the mother and child relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.179" end="01:12:36.869" style="s2">with a woman that works off to get stuck</p>

<p begin="01:12:44.010" end="01:12:48.119" style="s2">give her or mother will get something</p>

<p begin="01:12:54.599" end="01:12:58.320" style="s2">really up you don&#39;t put children</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.189" end="01:12:59.909" style="s2">in a sexual environment for a good</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.320" end="01:13:00.449" style="s2">reason because they&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.909" end="01:13:02.340" style="s2">be there</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.449" end="01:13:03.659" style="s2">so the powerful happens at night</p>

<p begin="01:13:07.350" end="01:13:11.730" style="s2">because he&#39;s a story for the entire</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.699" end="01:13:13.889" style="s2">tribe so mythology must must also be</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.730" end="01:13:15.750" style="s2">mixed up with pathology or traffic with</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.889" end="01:13:17.190" style="s2">mythic should not be mixed up now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.750" end="01:13:19.560" style="s2">interesting because you can then</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.190" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2">probably and I&#39;m not finished with it</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.560" end="01:13:21.989" style="s2">you can probably put topples and Kairos</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:23.510" style="s2">and Athos</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.989" end="01:13:27.210" style="s2">did you want to each one of these three</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.510" end="01:13:28.590" style="s2">mm-hmm this I think this could be</p>
