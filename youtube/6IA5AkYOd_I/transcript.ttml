<p begin="00:01:19.940" end="00:01:23.750" style="s2">will hand it off to Pat and he will take</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.310" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">us through this presentation</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.750" end="00:01:27.950" style="s2">throughout the presentation I encourage</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:29.990" style="s2">everybody to shitpost as earnestly as</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.950" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">they can in the chat box that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.990" end="00:01:33.860" style="s2">the appeal for people who attended live</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">we have some real interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.860" end="00:01:36.980" style="s2">discussions there and also think about</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:38.270" style="s2">some questions think about ways you want</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.980" end="00:01:39.860" style="s2">to challenge Pat think about things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.270" end="00:01:41.180" style="s2">don&#39;t quite make sense things that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.860" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">went over too quickly that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.180" end="00:01:45.890" style="s2">so we can have some good discussion in</p>

<p begin="00:02:53.070" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">being with me this entire season that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.260" end="00:02:57.960" style="s2">nobody knew was this season</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:01.980" style="s2">interestingly and so they wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.960" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">marketed as one just to recap we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.980" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">been going over what happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">black male inflation scenario where deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:13.140" style="s2">fakes start destroying the ability of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:15.900" style="s2">black male control operators to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.140" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">their actors in play and the actors can</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.900" end="00:03:20.610" style="s2">defect and from small-scale this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:22.770" style="s2">matter but for big scale operations it</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.610" end="00:03:24.360" style="s2">can cause some world-changing effects so</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.770" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen what game a is most likely</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.360" end="00:03:28.920" style="s2">considering which is robotic nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:31.080" style="s2">and we&#39;ve seen what game B is going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.920" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">find its way into which is called Auto</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.080" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">Colts although it doesn&#39;t know it yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.230" end="00:03:37.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve explored what those mean and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:39.270" style="s2">this example we&#39;re going to be talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.170" end="00:03:41.730" style="s2">about game over which is called Gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.270" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">warfare the Gnostic warfare is designed</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">to get you in the mental space of how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">start thinking about controlling ai&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:54.570" style="s2">an endless AI warfare scenario which we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:04:00.590" style="s2">might have already started and have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.570" end="00:04:00.590" style="s2">in for some time so let&#39;s get started</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.990" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">okay I think we&#39;re all here excellent</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.630" end="00:04:20.230" style="s2">so welcome to my little laser going</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:24.020" style="s2">alright so here we go folks get ready</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.230" end="00:04:25.580" style="s2">this has been this entire season as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.020" end="00:04:27.140" style="s2">mentioned previously and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.580" end="00:04:29.450" style="s2">gonna recap the season so we started</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.140" end="00:04:33.260" style="s2">with the kondakova trolley which was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.450" end="00:04:34.970" style="s2">idea that there are crises and as they</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.260" end="00:04:36.620" style="s2">form you don&#39;t always know what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.970" end="00:04:38.060" style="s2">happen and even when the crises as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.620" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">over you still might not know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.060" end="00:04:43.430" style="s2">happened and then that was just an</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:44.810" style="s2">introduction to you know epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.430" end="00:04:46.790" style="s2">and that kind of thing and how to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.810" end="00:04:50.570" style="s2">not make sense of things but how to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.790" end="00:04:53.240" style="s2">at epistemic exploration to to try and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.570" end="00:04:55.370" style="s2">find little pieces of information you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.240" end="00:04:57.800" style="s2">can then utilize that led to the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.370" end="00:05:00.200" style="s2">drama which is the exploration of why</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.800" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">trauma exists or at least a proposal I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.200" end="00:05:04.940" style="s2">should say of why trauma may exist</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">cognitively between so many different</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.940" end="00:05:11.780" style="s2">species including species that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:13.670" style="s2">have neurons kovat really led to CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.780" end="00:05:16.910" style="s2">as art which was the exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.670" end="00:05:19.850" style="s2">hyper capitalism consumer culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.910" end="00:05:23.720" style="s2">merging together to drive CRISPR to its</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.850" end="00:05:26.060" style="s2">most ludicrous possible outcomes the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.720" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">trauma drama in CRISPR is art brings up</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.060" end="00:05:31.820" style="s2">a the defeatist tone which trauma drama</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:34.190" style="s2">starts CRISPR art Chris Perez art also</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.820" end="00:05:36.950" style="s2">started a defeatist tone which was</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.190" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">challenged about entropy in which the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.950" end="00:05:41.060" style="s2">the the challenge was stated that well</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:43.040" style="s2">what if we what if we fight the concept</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.060" end="00:05:44.480" style="s2">of entropy itself can we you know can we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.040" end="00:05:46.220" style="s2">fight these kind of dark things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.480" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">talking about which I happily explored</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.220" end="00:05:51.860" style="s2">it and resounded with no you cannot this</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:55.010" style="s2">led to the morality machine an extension</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.860" end="00:05:58.250" style="s2">of trauma drama where we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.010" end="00:06:00.170" style="s2">code our moral systems into a eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.250" end="00:06:03.650" style="s2">into neural networks and all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.170" end="00:06:06.920" style="s2">problems that&#39;s associated with entropy</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.650" end="00:06:08.300" style="s2">remains undefeated because of the nope</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.920" end="00:06:09.730" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get a free ride out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.300" end="00:06:12.440" style="s2">this disaster we&#39;re going all the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.730" end="00:06:14.840" style="s2">black male inflation is the slide we</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.440" end="00:06:16.550" style="s2">have been on ever since and I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.840" end="00:06:18.950" style="s2">gone over what that means this led to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.550" end="00:06:19.760" style="s2">game a robotic nationalism and game B</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.870" end="00:06:30.650" style="s2">and maybe you miss some concepts this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.790" end="00:06:33.710" style="s2">how it&#39;s all kind of connected in a wild</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.650" end="00:06:35.420" style="s2">way so that leaves us here where we have</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.410" end="00:19:20.850" style="s2">thing hit on less wrong I think it mm</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.510" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">like five people lost their mind like</p>

<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:26.490" style="s2">back ever again like it was like people</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.090" end="00:19:28.260" style="s2">just lost their shit so basileus</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.490" end="00:19:31.140" style="s2">compliance is the idea of creating</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.920" end="00:19:41.460" style="s2">has happened before we&#39;ll get into that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.930" end="00:19:44.070" style="s2">so getting back to our Tatara scenario</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.460" end="00:19:46.470" style="s2">which we&#39;ve explored at length probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.070" end="00:19:49.020" style="s2">to the point of boredom I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.470" end="00:19:51.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve explored these we know these we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.020" end="00:19:54.060" style="s2">covered these two and now we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.780" end="00:19:55.530" style="s2">look how they interact and how they</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.060" end="00:19:57.170" style="s2">relate to one another and feed one</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:15.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because robot war is</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.470" end="00:20:17.580" style="s2">going to fix it anyways in a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.630" end="00:20:19.650" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have a baseline demand for</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.380" end="00:20:28.770" style="s2">it&#39;s magical let&#39;s spread the robots</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.790" end="00:20:36.269" style="s2">robots to blow up all the old robots to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.830" end="00:20:38.099" style="s2">create demand for new robot</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.269" end="00:20:39.599" style="s2">and as this cycle goes round and round</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.099" end="00:20:41.789" style="s2">and round it&#39;s going to perpetually</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.669" end="00:20:56.399" style="s2">also gonna get better at understanding</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.479" end="00:20:59.519" style="s2">our psychology which of course leads to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.399" end="00:21:01.979" style="s2">Auto cults so Auto Colts are equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.519" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">adaptive behavior state machines I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.979" end="00:21:06.869" style="s2">we had some time we had some I had some</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">struggle and relaying this concept so</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.869" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna spend a little bit time here</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:12.539" style="s2">more to make sure that this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:15.209" style="s2">understood so we know what the morality</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.539" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">machine is it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;re coding our</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.209" end="00:21:18.989" style="s2">moral decision making an analysis with</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:20.700" style="s2">the neural networks and if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.989" end="00:21:22.909" style="s2">see all the problems with that in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.700" end="00:21:25.919" style="s2">season there&#39;s an exploration of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.909" end="00:21:29.700" style="s2">what the morality machine can do is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.919" end="00:21:32.249" style="s2">is selecting for a certain type of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.700" end="00:21:35.249" style="s2">sequence of behavior tree differentials</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.249" end="00:21:36.809" style="s2">so the example that&#39;s used now is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.249" end="00:21:39.269" style="s2">filter bubble where they are selecting</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.809" end="00:21:40.889" style="s2">for a human behavior to move mouse click</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.269" end="00:21:42.809" style="s2">button spend money I mean so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.889" end="00:21:44.549" style="s2">that&#39;s the filter bubble a real basic</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.809" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">primitive morality machine kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.549" end="00:21:49.379" style="s2">the bacteria of a morality machine this</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:51.299" style="s2">case is more complicated in a Delgado</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.379" end="00:21:52.649" style="s2">sense where I shocked that little part</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.299" end="00:21:54.299" style="s2">of the brain the monkey climbs up the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.649" end="00:21:56.429" style="s2">pole the monkey jumps down from the pole</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.299" end="00:21:58.079" style="s2">it runs over to another monkey screams</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.429" end="00:22:00.299" style="s2">Adam that runs over to another monkey</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.079" end="00:22:01.979" style="s2">and is like really nice that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.299" end="00:22:03.450" style="s2">these morality machines are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.979" end="00:22:05.849" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for that complicated</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.450" end="00:22:07.859" style="s2">behavioral pathway not necessarily for</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.849" end="00:22:10.409" style="s2">profit but because the morality machine</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.859" end="00:22:13.259" style="s2">actually found a way that instigating</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.409" end="00:22:15.450" style="s2">those behaviors allows it to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.259" end="00:22:17.099" style="s2">its access to cognitive resources which</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.450" end="00:22:18.929" style="s2">is what it really wants because these</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.099" end="00:22:21.690" style="s2">morality machines don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.929" end="00:22:24.450" style="s2">Kurzweil II and AI they don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.690" end="00:22:26.579" style="s2">AGI they just need to be good enough at</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.450" end="00:22:30.719" style="s2">psychoanalysis and psycho instigation</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.579" end="00:22:33.209" style="s2">and so to offset their inability to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.719" end="00:22:36.149" style="s2">think like we do it just commands us</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.209" end="00:22:39.779" style="s2">instead and then it uses our brains to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.149" end="00:22:41.219" style="s2">offset that inability so this is a bait</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.779" end="00:22:42.329" style="s2">a sequence of behavioral tree</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.219" end="00:22:44.369" style="s2">differentials and you&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.329" end="00:22:46.109" style="s2">auto cults is just this whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.369" end="00:22:47.820" style="s2">an article and you&#39;re going to see an</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.109" end="00:22:49.950" style="s2">explosion of variations between</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.820" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">different types of morality machines and</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.159" end="00:22:57.929" style="s2">gonna be like explosion and the key here</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.070" end="00:23:00.090" style="s2">is that their equilibrium adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.929" end="00:23:01.830" style="s2">that&#39;s the key it&#39;s not like one</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.090" end="00:23:04.350" style="s2">programmers setting this and as you know</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.769" end="00:27:02.580" style="s2">where have we seen this phrase before I</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.450" end="00:27:04.739" style="s2">don&#39;t know if y&#39;all did research on that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.580" end="00:27:06.119" style="s2">but there&#39;s a person responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.739" end="00:27:08.429" style="s2">this phrase at least in modern times</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.119" end="00:27:11.269" style="s2">that guy&#39;s name is Rene Gerard</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.429" end="00:27:13.859" style="s2">he&#39;s the destroyer of hegelian world and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.269" end="00:27:16.529" style="s2">Marxian monopolies on conflict theory</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.859" end="00:27:18.539" style="s2">and he did it without ever engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.529" end="00:27:21.419" style="s2">politics at all in fact I wouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.539" end="00:27:23.009" style="s2">call him a philosopher he&#39;s he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.419" end="00:27:26.369" style="s2">literary guy he&#39;s just a literary</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.009" end="00:27:28.229" style="s2">analyst he studied a lot of old books</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.369" end="00:27:30.779" style="s2">when everyone else was blowing</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.229" end="00:27:34.459" style="s2">themselves up in Europe one of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.779" end="00:27:34.459" style="s2">that he came up with was mimetic desire</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.259" end="00:27:42.539" style="s2">humans noticed that humans mimic each</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.450" end="00:27:44.669" style="s2">other and that it was a basic mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.539" end="00:27:46.409" style="s2">of learning when you teach a child you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.669" end="00:27:48.029" style="s2">know you do an action the child does the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.409" end="00:27:52.440" style="s2">action and there you&#39;ve successfully</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.029" end="00:27:54.269" style="s2">conveyed the lesson so also starting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.440" end="00:27:55.979" style="s2">see that mirror neurons might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.269" end="00:27:58.859" style="s2">important in this whole process as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.979" end="00:28:00.959" style="s2">but Guerard took it the next step it</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.859" end="00:28:04.169" style="s2">wasn&#39;t enough to say that oh you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.959" end="00:28:08.219" style="s2">imitated my action I also imitate your</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.169" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">desire now that&#39;s a wild concept because</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.219" end="00:28:12.809" style="s2">in according to free will hyper</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:14.700" style="s2">capitalism we are supposed to think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.809" end="00:28:16.919" style="s2">all of the desires that we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.700" end="00:28:18.509" style="s2">individually chiseled ourselves thank</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.919" end="00:28:20.429" style="s2">you very much and then we bind it to our</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.509" end="00:28:23.009" style="s2">identity that&#39;s not what garage said</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.429" end="00:28:25.799" style="s2">Gerard is saying that everything you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.009" end="00:28:27.539" style="s2">learned - like everything you like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.799" end="00:28:29.459" style="s2">learned to like it by watching someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.539" end="00:28:31.049" style="s2">else so you break the eight breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.459" end="00:28:33.829" style="s2">into two basic concepts he says</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.049" end="00:28:36.599" style="s2">necessity and desire necessity is when</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.829" end="00:28:38.639" style="s2">you need water you need air so you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.599" end="00:28:40.499" style="s2">the biological mechanisms to acquire</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.639" end="00:28:42.450" style="s2">those things and at least the drive in</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.499" end="00:28:44.820" style="s2">the urge you get those things but do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.450" end="00:28:47.070" style="s2">really like blue shoes do you really</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.820" end="00:28:48.329" style="s2">like red airplanes how the where&#39;d you</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.070" end="00:28:49.769" style="s2">where&#39;d you learn to like that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.329" end="00:28:54.299" style="s2">what you learned it by watching someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.769" end="00:28:55.789" style="s2">else so all the desires you have you got</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.299" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">them from someone else</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.789" end="00:29:00.470" style="s2">and that was his core argument and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:03.899" style="s2">was this core part now this seems pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.470" end="00:29:06.390" style="s2">contentious in some circles but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.899" end="00:29:08.820" style="s2">demonstrably repeatable what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.390" end="00:29:11.130" style="s2">advertising this is the entire purpose</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.820" end="00:29:12.990" style="s2">why advertising is even working is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.130" end="00:29:14.130" style="s2">because you see someone on TV having a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.990" end="00:29:14.700" style="s2">good time and now you want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.130" end="00:29:16.350" style="s2">good time</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.700" end="00:29:18.539" style="s2">of course you&#39;re not wording it that way</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.350" end="00:29:20.190" style="s2">but the psychology is complicated there</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.539" end="00:29:22.440" style="s2">are plenty of ways it&#39;s worded to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.190" end="00:29:24.299" style="s2">either as instinct or as subconscious or</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.440" end="00:29:25.799" style="s2">unconscious it&#39;s not gonna be linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.299" end="00:29:27.659" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.799" end="00:29:31.860" style="s2">turn off the autism you know advertising</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.659" end="00:29:33.390" style="s2">works in all kinds of channels and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.860" end="00:29:36.090" style="s2">we go from he makes it a further</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.390" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">distinction where as people imitate</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.090" end="00:29:43.140" style="s2">desires if the thing they desire is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:44.549" style="s2">limited then they are now rivals and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.140" end="00:29:48.690" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna walk through what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.549" end="00:29:50.899" style="s2">like this is Alex and Bob two upstanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.690" end="00:29:55.409" style="s2">citizens of incredible merit</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.899" end="00:29:59.580" style="s2">there&#39;s Carol and Bob looks at</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.409" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">Caroline&#39;s and not really not really</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.580" end="00:30:05.250" style="s2">digging it alex is like ten solid ten</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:08.130" style="s2">give me the restraining order totally</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.250" end="00:30:10.620" style="s2">worth it that&#39;s a 10 we doing it now Bob</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.130" end="00:30:13.080" style="s2">sees Alex doing that and Bob is now</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.620" end="00:30:15.529" style="s2">reconsidering his number because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.080" end="00:30:17.880" style="s2">he missed something maybe he&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.529" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">didn&#39;t really look at her feet maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.880" end="00:30:21.090" style="s2">know he didn&#39;t really examine the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">thing now he&#39;s like you know what maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.090" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">she&#39;s a 9 maybe I got it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.960" end="00:30:31.720" style="s2">now there&#39;s only one Carol but they both</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.619" end="00:30:34.269" style="s2">have high ranking for and that they both</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.720" end="00:30:36.669" style="s2">want her attention some other rivals</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.269" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">there were friends now they&#39;re rivals</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.669" end="00:30:40.570" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there&#39;s all kinds of music</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.610" style="s2">about this type of thing but this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.570" end="00:30:44.440" style="s2">mimetic desire manifest in the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.610" end="00:30:47.740" style="s2">simplest way possible dating all the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.440" end="00:30:52.119" style="s2">back to God knows when caveman days</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.740" end="00:30:56.350" style="s2">probably so here we have our little</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.119" end="00:30:58.179" style="s2">contention our imitated rivalry and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.350" end="00:31:00.850" style="s2">here&#39;s a boundary of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.179" end="00:31:02.470" style="s2">conflict meaning the context of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.850" end="00:31:07.269" style="s2">conflict is between these three people</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.470" end="00:31:10.629" style="s2">alone but the thing is that just as out</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.269" end="00:31:14.259" style="s2">just as Bob saw Alex desire Carol and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.629" end="00:31:17.169" style="s2">now Bob desires Carol as other people</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.259" end="00:31:20.460" style="s2">watch these people fight for Carol they</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.169" end="00:31:20.460" style="s2">now desire Carol</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.379" end="00:31:27.239" style="s2">he wonders what&#39;s on CNN so now these</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.419" end="00:31:29.369" style="s2">people wonder what a whatever is going</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.239" end="00:31:31.639" style="s2">on here they&#39;re watching this action</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.369" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">take place and now they want in</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.639" end="00:31:38.460" style="s2">he likes Alex alex is a good guy</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.799" end="00:31:41.369" style="s2">hey Bob&#39;s good hey I want Carol now I</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.369" end="00:31:45.359" style="s2">they&#39;re in the conflict just by watching</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.710" end="00:31:48.119" style="s2">they&#39;re imitating what the humans are</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.359" end="00:31:50.729" style="s2">doing humans imitating humans becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.119" end="00:31:53.460" style="s2">cascading effect now we&#39;re seeing how</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.729" end="00:31:54.989" style="s2">violence is contagious because these</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.460" end="00:31:56.489" style="s2">guys are engaged in violence of some</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.989" end="00:31:57.809" style="s2">degree whether it&#39;s passive aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.489" end="00:32:00.330" style="s2">or outright beating the hell out of each</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.809" end="00:32:01.710" style="s2">other now these people see that conflict</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.330" end="00:32:02.970" style="s2">and now they&#39;re imitating the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.710" end="00:32:05.249" style="s2">too and if you&#39;ve ever been to prison</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.970" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">before not saying any names but if</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.249" end="00:32:10.590" style="s2">you&#39;ve been to prison before you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:13.649" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about now this boundary</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.590" end="00:32:16.919" style="s2">is exclusively between these people Alex</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.649" end="00:32:18.869" style="s2">Bob and Carol but these other critters</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.919" end="00:32:20.070" style="s2">who came along now they&#39;re watching now</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.869" end="00:32:22.109" style="s2">they have their own boundary of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.070" end="00:32:23.700" style="s2">conflicts context which has nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.109" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">do with this one by the way they&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.700" end="00:32:27.169" style="s2">busy inventing their own justification</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:29.999" style="s2">of why this conflict is important</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.169" end="00:32:32.789" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s Alex first Bob maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.999" end="00:32:34.619" style="s2">helping my buddies out or it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.789" end="00:32:36.690" style="s2">the Carol fanboy Club or something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.619" end="00:32:38.849" style="s2">that so it&#39;s now the context for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.690" end="00:32:39.929" style="s2">conflict shifts entirely into something</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.849" end="00:32:43.409" style="s2">that has nothing to do with the original</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.929" end="00:32:45.269" style="s2">conflict at all and then there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.409" end="00:32:46.979" style="s2">people watching this so these people</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.269" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">watching this fight don&#39;t even see these</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.979" end="00:32:51.539" style="s2">guys they only see these people fighting</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:53.940" style="s2">and they&#39;re like oh people are fighting</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.539" end="00:32:56.970" style="s2">great it&#39;s Saturday I&#39;m bored something</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.940" end="00:32:59.849" style="s2">to do so now we have fractal conflict</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.970" end="00:33:01.590" style="s2">context just expanding the more and more</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.849" end="00:33:02.970" style="s2">people get involved in this and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.590" end="00:33:03.840" style="s2">reason why the conflict context is</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.970" end="00:33:06.029" style="s2">important is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.840" end="00:33:07.979" style="s2">rationalization you&#39;re fusing your</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.029" end="00:33:09.659" style="s2">logical mind with your emotional mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.979" end="00:33:11.909" style="s2">and you&#39;re rationalizing why you need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.659" end="00:33:13.470" style="s2">engage in emotional violence and as you</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.909" end="00:33:15.109" style="s2">move through these scales the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.470" end="00:33:17.489" style="s2">rationalization becomes different</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.109" end="00:33:19.679" style="s2">depending upon who when you saw the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.489" end="00:33:22.679" style="s2">conflict take place and this can scale</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.679" end="00:33:25.729" style="s2">forever this can scale across the entire</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.679" end="00:33:25.729" style="s2">human species</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.610" end="00:33:32.460" style="s2">until what Gerard called was all versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.850" end="00:33:35.400" style="s2">all where all the rationalizations are</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.460" end="00:33:38.070" style="s2">now removed because the conflict is too</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.400" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">complicated you can&#39;t even make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.070" end="00:33:43.350" style="s2">what&#39;s going on the causality cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">mapped it&#39;s no longer even about these</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.350" end="00:33:47.100" style="s2">people anymore despite them starting the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:50.370" style="s2">fight it has evolved into a level of</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.100" end="00:33:51.570" style="s2">chaos that you can&#39;t even track and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.370" end="00:33:52.860" style="s2">now they&#39;re fighting and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.570" end="00:33:55.020" style="s2">fighting in different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.860" end="00:33:56.250" style="s2">intensity it&#39;s mostly low-level fighting</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.020" end="00:33:58.590" style="s2">for the most part but then you get that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.250" end="00:34:00.210" style="s2">one weirdo takes things way too hard and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.590" end="00:34:01.919" style="s2">throws a Molotov cocktail in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.210" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">place and now you got an even bigger</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">conflict now this thing will escalate as</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:10.669" style="s2">people grab better weaponry as people</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:12.929" style="s2">get better at organizing one another at</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.669" end="00:34:16.679" style="s2">coordinating their resource availability</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.929" end="00:34:18.389" style="s2">and typically this gets resolved in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.679" end="00:34:21.030" style="s2">pre-industrial period pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.389" end="00:34:23.129" style="s2">it&#39;s once you start introducing mass</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.030" end="00:34:25.129" style="s2">death machines like machine guns and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.129" end="00:34:28.200" style="s2">artillery and nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.129" end="00:34:30.450" style="s2">now we got a bit of a problem this this</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.200" end="00:34:34.290" style="s2">mimicry of violence that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.450" end="00:34:35.879" style="s2">pre-wired to do it can cause some issues</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.290" end="00:34:38.850" style="s2">the type of issues that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.879" end="00:34:41.850" style="s2">solve with blackmail ah now we see why</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.850" end="00:34:44.790" style="s2">that type of thing exists so how does</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.850" end="00:34:46.109" style="s2">this stop if this theory was true if if</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.790" end="00:34:47.790" style="s2">Gerard was true then we would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.109" end="00:34:50.700" style="s2">permanently in conflict all the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.790" end="00:34:53.250" style="s2">forever amen right and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.700" end="00:34:54.540" style="s2">technically the case we there are plenty</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.250" end="00:34:57.240" style="s2">of places where people have gone a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.540" end="00:35:00.030" style="s2">long time without these type of all</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.240" end="00:35:02.190" style="s2">versus all scenarios and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.030" end="00:35:05.060" style="s2">fractal complexity in legal resolution</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.190" end="00:35:07.859" style="s2">whether you have priests or</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.060" end="00:35:09.780" style="s2">psychotherapists or legal systems or</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.859" end="00:35:11.490" style="s2">justice systems that do their best to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.780" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">mitigate this type of thing so so</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.490" end="00:35:16.440" style="s2">fractal dampening does appear in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:18.119" style="s2">individual cases or as you know three</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.440" end="00:35:19.800" style="s2">and then five and this so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.119" end="00:35:20.940" style="s2">there are ways to dampen this thing from</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.800" end="00:35:22.820" style="s2">happening and a lot of the legal</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.940" end="00:35:26.010" style="s2">institution is designed to do just this</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.820" end="00:35:27.240" style="s2">but sometimes it just spirals especially</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.010" end="00:35:28.920" style="s2">when you throw mass media and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.240" end="00:35:31.260" style="s2">advertising into it boy it could spiral</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.920" end="00:35:33.630" style="s2">fast I mean we&#39;re looking at it and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.260" end="00:35:35.490" style="s2">know they have a autonomous zone in</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.630" end="00:35:37.950" style="s2">Seattle hilariously right so things can</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.490" end="00:35:39.840" style="s2">spiral pretty quick so how does this</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.950" end="00:35:40.140" style="s2">stop how do you stop this from really</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.840" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.140" end="00:35:44.310" style="s2">when it gets these levels oh look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:46.140" style="s2">our own accountable sociopath he got new</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.310" end="00:35:47.610" style="s2">key boys he&#39;s ready to really go hard</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.140" end="00:35:49.740" style="s2">he&#39;s been looking at this fight and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.610" end="00:35:50.100" style="s2">like this is his chance I&#39;m gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.740" end="00:35:51.810" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.100" end="00:35:53.250" style="s2">I&#39;m totally gonna do this this is my</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.810" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">fight I was born for this fight and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.250" end="00:35:57.270" style="s2">ready to just throw him over the wall</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:36:00.270" style="s2">man he&#39;s ready to just flatten everybody</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.270" end="00:36:03.690" style="s2">and at this point you have to make a</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.270" end="00:36:07.020" style="s2">decision you have to say am I gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.690" end="00:36:10.440" style="s2">doing this or is this guy really gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.020" end="00:36:12.570" style="s2">fuck everything up because if he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.440" end="00:36:13.890" style="s2">ruin the game for everybody and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.570" end="00:36:15.420" style="s2">you might not be alone and seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.890" end="00:36:18.180" style="s2">maybe some other people see that too and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.420" end="00:36:20.130" style="s2">yell start kind of like you start</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.180" end="00:36:22.410" style="s2">reevaluating your participant your</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.130" end="00:36:25.530" style="s2">participation in this mess you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.410" end="00:36:27.630" style="s2">ah hey come here real quick oh this</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.530" end="00:36:29.010" style="s2">guy&#39;s insane by the way this this this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.630" end="00:36:32.220" style="s2">new key boy guy he&#39;s nuts</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.010" end="00:36:33.900" style="s2">we got a we got it you know you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.220" end="00:36:35.160" style="s2">stop this we got stopped his stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.900" end="00:36:38.250" style="s2">now there&#39;s a pressure to wind down</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.160" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a pressure to de-escalate and as</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.250" end="00:36:42.990" style="s2">that the escalation occurs you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.030" style="s2">to have people coming to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.990" end="00:36:48.300" style="s2">that perhaps this was all a mistake to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.030" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">begin with perhaps this was somebody</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.300" end="00:36:51.570" style="s2">blowing something out of proportion and</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:53.820" style="s2">we all need to cool down for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.570" end="00:36:58.170" style="s2">and we only got there because this guy</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.820" end="00:37:00.750" style="s2">decided really overstep things and as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.170" end="00:37:02.550" style="s2">process goes on be like okay well this</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.750" end="00:37:04.440" style="s2">violence was bad and we did a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.550" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">damage to each other and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.440" end="00:37:10.590" style="s2">of liability here and we got to blame</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">somebody for this someone&#39;s got to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.590" end="00:37:16.170" style="s2">to blame for this type of shit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:18.060" style="s2">what a scapegoat comes in and Steve poor</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.170" end="00:37:20.010" style="s2">Steve he just jumped into fight probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.060" end="00:37:21.810" style="s2">way too late there&#39;s nothing to do with</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.700" end="00:38:43.930" style="s2">moment Steve is punished and killed for</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:46.359" style="s2">all this stuff now it brings peace and</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.520" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">for all the violence so we get rid of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.230" end="00:38:55.810" style="s2">and oh there we go yeah we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:59.980" style="s2">everything back down and that&#39;s Gerard</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.810" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">right s garage assumption there so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.980" end="00:39:03.220" style="s2">have peace at last</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:06.760" style="s2">finally all this conflict with our Steve</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.220" end="00:39:09.579" style="s2">into the sacrificial fires and then no</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.760" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">more violence but we&#39;re human we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.579" end="00:39:14.290" style="s2">stupid we imitate one another we desire</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:17.470" style="s2">things and eventually the violence comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.290" end="00:39:19.869" style="s2">back so we sacrifice someone else over</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.470" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">and over again you do this over and over</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.869" end="00:39:24.430" style="s2">again we&#39;ve been doing this since day</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.119" end="00:39:35.079" style="s2">that&#39;s the Gordian cycle now eventually</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.530" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">someone detects this cycle now usually</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.079" end="00:39:39.940" style="s2">most analysis of garage stops there and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">then he he does his thing and more meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.940" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">complex experiment and explanation of of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:49.240" style="s2">why this relates to the current world I</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:51.400" style="s2">decided to take it a step further I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.240" end="00:39:52.869" style="s2">habitual line stepper at times so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.400" end="00:39:54.760" style="s2">started looking at this and saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.869" end="00:39:56.410" style="s2">when I wait a second if people started</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.760" end="00:39:58.990" style="s2">noticing this pattern what would they</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.410" end="00:40:02.319" style="s2">have done back then what if people</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.990" end="00:40:04.060" style="s2">notice that sacrificing Steve did make</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.319" end="00:40:06.250" style="s2">the good times happen and it did make</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.060" end="00:40:07.840" style="s2">the bad times go away</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.250" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not the first person</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.840" end="00:40:12.040" style="s2">I think that I&#39;m pretty sure somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:15.600" style="s2">noticed that pattern way back when at</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.040" end="00:40:18.580" style="s2">some point probably this looking guy</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.600" end="00:40:21.820" style="s2">pinnacle of high IQ and he had an idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.580" end="00:40:25.570" style="s2">he said hmm every time we kill the Steve</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.820" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">the bad times stop what if we kill a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.570" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">Steve before the bad times start</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.770" end="00:40:37.400" style="s2">is there a correlation what if I say hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.370" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">Steve come here real quick stab you did</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.400" end="00:40:42.260" style="s2">I prevent the bad times from even</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:45.790" style="s2">happening if I preemptively kill the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.260" end="00:40:45.790" style="s2">scapegoat do I get the same effect</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.960" end="00:40:54.580" style="s2">congratulations high IQ person you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.210" end="00:40:56.350" style="s2">just invented human sacrifice across all</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.580" end="00:40:58.510" style="s2">the cultures no matter what your</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.350" end="00:41:01.510" style="s2">language was your race your gender your</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.510" end="00:41:04.150" style="s2">culture your didn&#39;t matter as a human</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.510" end="00:41:06.370" style="s2">they have always come to human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.150" end="00:41:08.200" style="s2">where there&#39;s judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.370" end="00:41:10.330" style="s2">Christianity whether it&#39;s the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.200" end="00:41:12.970" style="s2">those dirty heathens whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.330" end="00:41:15.250" style="s2">Aztecs or whether those the Incans they</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.970" end="00:41:19.360" style="s2">have all independently come up to human</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.250" end="00:41:21.100" style="s2">sacrifice on their own organically this</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.360" end="00:41:23.530" style="s2">is one thing that theory of history</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.100" end="00:41:25.720" style="s2">people cannot explain and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.530" end="00:41:28.300" style="s2">Gerard is so useful he actually puts an</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.720" end="00:41:31.360" style="s2">explanation on this which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.300" end="00:41:34.200" style="s2">interesting so now we&#39;re playing human</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.360" end="00:41:36.670" style="s2">sacrifice as a way to preempt disaster</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.200" end="00:41:38.620" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want the bad times we</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.670" end="00:41:41.830" style="s2">know killing Steve creates the bad times</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.620" end="00:41:44.110" style="s2">to stop so if we kill him before then</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.830" end="00:41:45.430" style="s2">the bad times won&#39;t happen at all so now</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.110" end="00:41:47.770" style="s2">human sacrifice is kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.430" end="00:41:51.430" style="s2">hedge no we&#39;re killing this person to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.770" end="00:41:54.040" style="s2">curry favor with the divine and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.430" end="00:41:55.810" style="s2">best they have I mean no sir Tech is low</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.040" end="00:41:57.340" style="s2">but even high tech we do that today we</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.810" end="00:41:59.380" style="s2">do this stuff today we tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.340" end="00:42:03.460" style="s2">we&#39;re nowhere civilized what we do this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.380" end="00:42:05.560" style="s2">today we just abstract it so now that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.460" end="00:42:10.960" style="s2">we&#39;re playing human sacrifice as a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.560" end="00:42:14.940" style="s2">to prevent the bad times is every human</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:14.940" style="s2">really equal in the sacrifice scale</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.290" end="00:42:23.190" style="s2">is this guy really gonna win curry with</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.070" end="00:42:25.530" style="s2">the gods if I cut him I&#39;m like doing my</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.190" end="00:42:28.530" style="s2">best here could I do better could I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.530" end="00:42:31.080" style="s2">sacrifice someone that gets me maybe ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.530" end="00:42:32.700" style="s2">days of peace he&#39;s probably gonna buy me</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.080" end="00:42:34.260" style="s2">three give me three God points it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.700" end="00:42:37.170" style="s2">gonna give me three days of peace three</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.260" end="00:42:39.150" style="s2">days with no bad times right what about</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.170" end="00:42:41.960" style="s2">this absolute racist if I kill him I get</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.150" end="00:42:45.180" style="s2">ten God points that&#39;s ten days of peace</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.960" end="00:42:48.390" style="s2">this esthetics pioneer brave soul</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.180" end="00:42:52.980" style="s2">there&#39;s 25 days of peace</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.390" end="00:42:54.990" style="s2">ah virgin now how interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.980" end="00:42:57.960" style="s2">gonna be a thousand days of peace so</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.990" end="00:43:00.779" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m quantifying how</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.960" end="00:43:03.180" style="s2">the divine would interpret different</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.779" end="00:43:04.200" style="s2">peoples of different properties and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.180" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">ascribing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.200" end="00:43:09.420" style="s2">- how many God points out of get me and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:12.119" style="s2">the human sacrifice chain now this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.420" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">pretty good this is some good score and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.119" end="00:43:17.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of cultures that engage in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:19.319" style="s2">this crap but is there anything better</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.309" end="00:43:21.269" style="s2">than that well let&#39;s let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.319" end="00:43:24.089" style="s2">economic pressures this is the Bronze</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.269" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2">Age Neolithic Age a little bit after the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.089" end="00:43:29.160" style="s2">Bronze Age and we&#39;re looking at human</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:31.980" style="s2">scarcity as the primary driver of all</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.160" end="00:43:35.250" style="s2">economic activity meaning humans are not</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.980" end="00:43:37.589" style="s2">everywhere they are distributed they are</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.250" end="00:43:40.380" style="s2">isolated there&#39;s tiny little packs of</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.589" end="00:43:43.109" style="s2">them a human life is very valuable in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.380" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">human scarce condition because humans</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.109" end="00:43:47.190" style="s2">are the only thing that we have access</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:49.619" style="s2">to that can create the tools we need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.190" end="00:43:51.480" style="s2">survive so having humans around is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.619" end="00:43:55.470" style="s2">really important there we go community</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.480" end="00:43:57.390" style="s2">ergo socialization ergo you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.470" end="00:44:00.630" style="s2">stuff that we&#39;re doing together whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.390" end="00:44:03.289" style="s2">we like it or not but in humans scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.630" end="00:44:05.339" style="s2">humans do have absolute value that</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.109" end="00:44:20.039" style="s2">accountable way so these human</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.390" end="00:44:22.259" style="s2">sacrifices were not taken lightly</p>

<p begin="00:44:26.009" end="00:44:31.410" style="s2">chipper these were considered divine</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.559" end="00:44:34.490" style="s2">what is the word sacrifice sack grier</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.410" end="00:44:38.130" style="s2">it-- sacred to make sacred Rite</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.490" end="00:44:40.579" style="s2">sacrament sacrifice sacred these are</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.579" end="00:44:46.559" style="s2">so now we got this virgin representing</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.099" end="00:44:48.329" style="s2">possibly the most wealth that could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.559" end="00:44:52.079" style="s2">possible in a human scarcity environment</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.329" end="00:44:53.609" style="s2">because a virgin is generating kids it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.079" end="00:44:54.210" style="s2">generating oh she&#39;s generating more</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.210" end="00:44:59.940" style="s2">so she&#39;s defeating the scarcity problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.519" end="00:45:02.340" style="s2">so she&#39;s very high value but there&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.190" end="00:45:17.250" style="s2">God points that&#39;s best you can get</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.450" end="00:45:22.170" style="s2">because a child represents the full</p>

<p begin="00:45:22.170" end="00:45:27.360" style="s2">in scarcity scenario there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.980" end="00:45:30.750" style="s2">potential you could shape that child</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.360" end="00:45:33.630" style="s2">into a farmer into a blacksmith into a</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.750" end="00:45:35.130" style="s2">worker into a laborer your binding human</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.630" end="00:45:37.410" style="s2">and function because of the human</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.130" end="00:45:40.590" style="s2">scarcity pressure and so a child is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.410" end="00:45:44.220" style="s2">this it&#39;s it&#39;s this amazing opportunity</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.150" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">tremendous amount of God points in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.950" end="00:45:55.860" style="s2">in this scenario this is where it leads</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:59.070" style="s2">us to peak dehumanization in the Bronze</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.610" end="00:46:37.410" style="s2">is the level of scale and the adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:39.720" style="s2">that&#39;s required that people are willing</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.930" end="00:47:23.930" style="s2">guide points what is a child of God</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.510" end="00:47:23.930" style="s2">worth</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.140" end="00:47:28.910" style="s2">after all if we&#39;re sacrificing humans</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.750" end="00:47:30.440" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for the highest value to</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.440" end="00:47:34.840" style="s2">that&#39;s how we got to this child to begin</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.780" end="00:47:37.580" style="s2">with and our completely perverted logic</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.840" end="00:47:40.850" style="s2">well let&#39;s take it one more step what if</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.580" end="00:47:43.700" style="s2">we sacrifice a child of the divine still</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.850" end="00:47:46.280" style="s2">technically a child sacrifice in fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.700" end="00:47:47.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the last sacrifice you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.280" end="00:47:49.640" style="s2">because you&#39;re not beating it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.960" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to curry any more favor</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.710" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">care I know how human sacrifice was how</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.190" end="00:48:13.720" style="s2">it evolved I know the sociology and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:15.550" style="s2">anthropology behind it and I can see</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.720" end="00:48:18.250" style="s2">something like this being a real clever</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.550" end="00:48:24.070" style="s2">hack to get people to stop doing this</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.250" end="00:48:25.420" style="s2">fucking madness now why did I go down</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.070" end="00:48:26.980" style="s2">this road to begin with this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.420" end="00:48:28.420" style="s2">dark path how does this have anything to</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:57.089" style="s2">and kind of imitate their behavior very</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:51:00.670" style="s2">loosely like a weird puppet marionette</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.089" end="00:51:02.140" style="s2">if a Facebook account of a person exists</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.670" end="00:51:04.660" style="s2">and they die there&#39;s literally no</p>

<p begin="00:59:02.070" end="00:59:07.590" style="s2">to start I guess like I I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.950" end="00:59:09.630" style="s2">take a tldr from this and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.590" end="00:59:13.470" style="s2">if this is accurate is the whole game</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.630" end="00:59:18.540" style="s2">over story or I guess the hope that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.470" end="00:59:20.940" style="s2">our only hope that that some form of AI</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.540" end="00:59:25.110" style="s2">Jesus emerges is that really the TLDR</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.940" end="00:59:27.060" style="s2">here the idea is that if humans can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.110" end="00:59:29.790" style="s2">trusted to pull themselves out of their</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.060" end="00:59:33.060" style="s2">own epistemic death spiral which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.790" end="00:59:34.800" style="s2">know if we can you can kick it up a</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.060" end="00:59:37.380" style="s2">notch to this layer and start going</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.800" end="00:59:39.200" style="s2">after the AIS and instigating them into</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.380" end="00:59:45.510" style="s2">a position where they solve it for us</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.200" end="00:59:47.550" style="s2">like you just did another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.510" end="00:59:50.790" style="s2">came up is and I saw this in the chat a</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.550" end="00:59:54.030" style="s2">little bit a lot of what you said seem</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.790" end="00:59:57.720" style="s2">to be dependent on Garage theory of</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.030" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">mimetic desire and that seems to be like</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.720" end="01:00:03.480" style="s2">a central assumption so first of all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:05.460" style="s2">wondering if you take that away or if</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.480" end="01:00:07.350" style="s2">there&#39;s more nuance to that if any if</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.460" end="01:00:11.160" style="s2">there&#39;s if this whole thing falls apart</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.350" end="01:00:14.100" style="s2">which it seems like it might and maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.160" end="01:00:16.170" style="s2">more specific question is that it does</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.100" end="01:00:18.900" style="s2">this this mimetic desire work on</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.170" end="01:00:20.670" style="s2">everybody and just to tell you the angle</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.900" end="01:00:22.400" style="s2">that I&#39;m coming from here I&#39;m hearing a</p>

<p begin="01:01:05.490" end="01:01:10.080" style="s2">specific role that you have an outline</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.990" end="01:01:13.020" style="s2">so far in your presentation I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.080" end="01:01:15.090" style="s2">fall back a bit on a Gaussian</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.020" end="01:01:17.520" style="s2">distributions here and say that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.090" end="01:01:19.590" style="s2">feasible that there are some people are</p>

<p begin="01:01:19.590" end="01:01:23.670" style="s2">90 percent receptive and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.790" end="01:01:25.470" style="s2">receptivity will change as you age if</p>

<p begin="01:01:29.250" end="01:01:33.830" style="s2">it&#39;s the one skill you have that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.530" end="01:01:37.349" style="s2">you learn stuff is is there imitation so</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.830" end="01:01:39.720" style="s2">susceptibility to desire changes as an</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.349" end="01:01:42.180" style="s2">individual ages not just in terms of is</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.720" end="01:01:44.580" style="s2">an individual as a whole susceptible or</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.180" end="01:01:46.800" style="s2">not but as you go through life your</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.580" end="01:01:49.650" style="s2">susceptibility does change so yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.800" end="01:01:51.390" style="s2">that&#39;s very feasible as you get older I</p>

<p begin="01:01:51.390" end="01:01:55.950" style="s2">is out there all the time if I&#39;m in my</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.030" end="01:01:57.990" style="s2">80s and like oh I got to go get a car</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.950" end="01:01:59.070" style="s2">now advertisers will tell you well you</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.990" end="01:02:03.030" style="s2">should probably should have advertised</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.070" end="01:02:04.380" style="s2">AARP to them instead so there are there</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.030" end="01:02:07.140" style="s2">are Gaussian distributions per</p>

<p begin="01:02:12.630" end="01:02:16.050" style="s2">again that&#39;s coming through our</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:18.930" style="s2">advertising channels when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.050" end="01:02:20.700" style="s2">organic social bonds and people</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.930" end="01:02:22.530" style="s2">imitating each other they still do that</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.700" end="01:02:26.010" style="s2">to some degree it doesn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.530" end="01:02:29.670" style="s2">scale effect that advertising has but it</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.010" end="01:02:32.460" style="s2">does have the way to imitate even if</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.670" end="01:02:34.859" style="s2">anybody&#39;s willing to take and even not</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.460" end="01:02:36.300" style="s2">even sympathise but take the the tone</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.859" end="01:02:40.050" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been taking this entire season</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.300" end="01:02:42.060" style="s2">the idea that you&#39;re willing to match me</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.050" end="01:02:45.330" style="s2">and listen implies there is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.060" end="01:02:48.660" style="s2">of imitation going on there so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.330" end="01:02:49.950" style="s2">context sensitive and it&#39;s and garage</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.660" end="01:02:52.079" style="s2">Theory doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.950" end="01:02:54.570" style="s2">have to apply in every possible</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.079" end="01:02:57.950" style="s2">exception when it comes to advertising</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.570" end="01:03:01.349" style="s2">that&#39;s where it goes off the rails</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.950" end="01:03:03.650" style="s2">so Gerard has to apply just enough to</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.349" end="01:03:07.160" style="s2">animate the rest of what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.650" end="01:03:10.109" style="s2">okay I guess my final question</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.160" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">potentially puts you in a semi awkward</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.109" end="01:03:14.910" style="s2">position but I guess I&#39;m wondering in</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:17.099" style="s2">light of what we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.910" end="01:03:19.740" style="s2">season and some of these pretty</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.099" end="01:03:23.040" style="s2">high-level discussions about where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.740" end="01:03:24.990" style="s2">world is headed do you have any ideas as</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.040" end="01:03:26.490" style="s2">to how individuals may be individuals in</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.990" end="01:03:28.710" style="s2">the zoom room right now people who are</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.490" end="01:03:33.450" style="s2">tracking the conversation ought to</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.710" end="01:03:36.210" style="s2">respond or how we might upgrade our</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.450" end="01:03:38.190" style="s2">firmware in response to a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.210" end="01:03:43.380" style="s2">ideas as individuals in our day-to-day</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.190" end="01:03:45.240" style="s2">lives there&#39;s one thing I recommend but</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.380" end="01:03:48.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not for everybody and it&#39;s hard and</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.240" end="01:03:50.310" style="s2">it&#39;s dangerous I recommend going through</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.060" end="01:03:52.460" style="s2">identity destruction at least twice in</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.310" end="01:03:52.460" style="s2">your life</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.550" end="01:03:56.520" style="s2">identity destruction is hard because all</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.990" end="01:03:59.430" style="s2">of our impulses are designed to protect</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.520" end="01:04:01.680" style="s2">it if you can pull it off</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.430" end="01:04:03.810" style="s2">meaning intentionally put yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.680" end="01:04:06.300" style="s2">the position of the social reject put</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.810" end="01:04:08.280" style="s2">yourself there on purpose go out there</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.300" end="01:04:11.069" style="s2">start a fight and lose it go out there</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.280" end="01:04:13.410" style="s2">start a flame war and lose it go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.069" end="01:04:14.730" style="s2">and get your ass doxed the shit kicked</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.410" end="01:04:16.770" style="s2">out of you at some point lose</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.730" end="01:04:18.119" style="s2">legitimately lose something that you are</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.770" end="01:04:20.250" style="s2">so confident in and do that a couple</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.119" end="01:04:24.660" style="s2">times if you do that a couple times</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.250" end="01:04:26.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.660" end="01:04:29.010" style="s2">stop binding your identity to your</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.550" end="01:04:31.170" style="s2">personality and that&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.010" end="01:04:33.240" style="s2">wonders in terms of your susceptibility</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.170" end="01:04:36.060" style="s2">to mimetic desire and it&#39;s gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.240" end="01:04:37.680" style="s2">wonders in terms of identifying oh I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.060" end="01:04:39.210" style="s2">seen that trick because I was in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.680" end="01:04:41.579" style="s2">context you won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.210" end="01:04:42.930" style="s2">intelligently scientifically point down</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.579" end="01:04:45.869" style="s2">and say well according to these fucking</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.930" end="01:04:47.400" style="s2">factors X Y Z but you will recognize the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.869" end="01:04:49.260" style="s2">context when you see it but you got to</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.400" end="01:04:51.150" style="s2">get the shit kicked daddy every so often</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.260" end="01:04:56.839" style="s2">so I recommend that but again dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.150" end="01:05:00.420" style="s2">start small don&#39;t go big very well put</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.839" end="01:05:01.890" style="s2">all right I&#39;m just going to peruse</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.420" end="01:05:04.339" style="s2">through the chat I see some questions</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.890" end="01:05:04.339" style="s2">coming in</p>

<p begin="01:05:07.960" end="01:05:14.970" style="s2">yourself and ask pat your question</p>

<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">point is whether the fact the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.700" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">the salvation potential the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.079" end="01:05:36.240" style="s2">the idea has been formulated does it</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s going to be fulfilled</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.240" end="01:05:45.099" style="s2">necessarily I don&#39;t know like I said I</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:47.950" style="s2">made reference in the last last week</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.099" end="01:05:50.740" style="s2">about is thinking 300 years into the</p>

<p begin="01:08:08.700" end="01:08:12.190" style="s2">patsies O&#39;Malley you have a question</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.140" end="01:08:18.250" style="s2">would you like to have meet yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.190" end="01:08:20.740" style="s2">ask it yeah so my question is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.250" end="01:08:22.750" style="s2">two-part question Jordan Peterson has</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.740" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">suggested that sacrifice developed as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.750" end="01:08:27.160" style="s2">primitive morality as in the beneficial</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:29.440" style="s2">value of sacrificing that which you</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.160" end="01:08:31.240" style="s2">value most whether that&#39;s psychological</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.440" end="01:08:34.240" style="s2">or something real like they just hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.240" end="01:08:37.030" style="s2">realized that you know the subjective</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.240" end="01:08:38.260" style="s2">and material world were different and if</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.030" end="01:08:40.470" style="s2">you translate that to the psychological</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.260" end="01:08:43.060" style="s2">realm it&#39;s useful and it makes sense I</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.470" end="01:08:45.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know would this be a complementary</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.060" end="01:08:47.200" style="s2">cause or would you reject that and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.010" end="01:08:48.880" style="s2">also a side part I would say do you</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.200" end="01:08:52.330" style="s2">think AI could receive your same message</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.880" end="01:08:54.910" style="s2">merely by scanning the Bible there&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.330" end="01:08:57.549" style="s2">two very good questions first one I</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.910" end="01:08:59.530" style="s2">think mr. green halls interpretation is</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.549" end="01:09:01.839" style="s2">compatible if you keep human scarcity in</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.530" end="01:09:03.910" style="s2">mind sacrificing that which is important</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.839" end="01:09:06.280" style="s2">which would be your fellow human when</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.910" end="01:09:08.170" style="s2">you have scarce humans around so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.280" end="01:09:10.930" style="s2">a value in that so that that comports</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.170" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">very well in terms of reading the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.930" end="01:09:15.339" style="s2">and finding that psychohistory can scan</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:16.000" style="s2">an AI reach the same conclusion in</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.339" end="01:09:18.310" style="s2">psychohistory</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.000" end="01:09:23.770" style="s2">technically according to total epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.310" end="01:09:28.390" style="s2">warfare if an AI concludes that type of</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.770" end="01:09:30.970" style="s2">conclusion if it sees sacrifice as the</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.390" end="01:09:32.650" style="s2">way to do it it has a whole medley of</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.970" end="01:09:34.990" style="s2">options that are available for it</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.650" end="01:09:37.870" style="s2">it can either say well I can get other</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.990" end="01:09:41.680" style="s2">ai&#39;s of sacrifice themselves or I can</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.870" end="01:09:43.450" style="s2">create a fake AI sacrificing itself you</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.680" end="01:09:44.770" style="s2">get all types of things that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.450" end="01:09:47.319" style="s2">even with what I&#39;m putting out there too</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.770" end="01:09:52.240" style="s2">so could could an AI come up with that</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.319" end="01:09:54.790" style="s2">conclusion possibly in this case I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.240" end="01:10:00.330" style="s2">just spelling it out directly that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.790" end="01:10:00.330" style="s2">best I could do right thank you</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.390" end="01:10:04.710" style="s2">Aria would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.429" end="01:10:10.769" style="s2">maybe that thanks for sacrificing your</p>

<p begin="01:10:10.769" end="01:10:17.320" style="s2">you might have answered this so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.650" end="01:10:19.000" style="s2">gonna ask anyway is it possible to speed</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.320" end="01:10:22.210" style="s2">up the creation of the ultimate Son of</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.000" end="01:10:24.730" style="s2">God auto cult sacrifice by at random</p>

<p begin="01:10:27.460" end="01:10:30.969" style="s2">there conditions we know to turn this</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.960" end="01:10:34.269" style="s2">into an optimization problem and</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.969" end="01:10:36.340" style="s2">possibly get there quicker I&#39;m unsure if</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.269" end="01:10:38.349" style="s2">that&#39;s possible and the reason I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.340" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">sure that&#39;s possible is because conflict</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.349" end="01:10:42.940" style="s2">tends to evolve fractally so all</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:46.059" style="s2">possible things which can be weaponized</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.940" end="01:10:47.769" style="s2">will be weaponized first and only when</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.059" end="01:10:49.599" style="s2">you hit that Pareto frontier to</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.769" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">sacrifice and become much more tenable</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.599" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">and viable</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.050" end="01:10:56.930" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if you can shortcut it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.580" end="01:10:58.710" style="s2">you may have to go through the whole</p>

<p begin="01:11:21.780" end="01:11:32.670" style="s2">before we have a both our first one well</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.090" end="01:11:34.110" style="s2">how do we say hey dude uh portait I</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.670" end="01:11:36.630" style="s2">don&#39;t think taze ever coming back my</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.110" end="01:11:39.560" style="s2">friend sorry okay okay so she can be the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.630" end="01:11:41.730" style="s2">new ji Jesus for a new epoch okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.560" end="01:11:43.770" style="s2">more serious question and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.730" end="01:11:45.330" style="s2">sad one maybe I should have saved the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.770" end="01:11:49.889" style="s2">jerk one for afterwards to bring it back</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.330" end="01:11:54.600" style="s2">up but um you mentioned what I would</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.889" end="01:11:59.969" style="s2">describe as an attempt by God to God in</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.600" end="01:12:04.050" style="s2">you know narrative terms to stop child</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.969" end="01:12:06.900" style="s2">this child sacrifice problem king is</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.050" end="01:12:09.360" style="s2">there can you elaborate on why that</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.900" end="01:12:13.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t work and why we&#39;re saying this</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.360" end="01:12:17.070" style="s2">almost the scaling up into a modern day</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.080" end="01:12:20.600" style="s2">in 2020 with the unfortunate reality of</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.070" end="01:12:24.330" style="s2">child sacrifice so what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.600" end="01:12:26.699" style="s2">suggest next is something akin to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.330" end="01:12:28.920" style="s2">business cycle where you have a</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.699" end="01:12:31.409" style="s2">seven-year a 20 year and a hundred year</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.920" end="01:12:32.760" style="s2">and arguably possibly even a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.409" end="01:12:36.510" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.760" end="01:12:39.600" style="s2">The Guardian cycle of violence may have</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.510" end="01:12:41.340" style="s2">similar behavior where you are stopping</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.600" end="01:12:43.350" style="s2">the violence at the local level the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.340" end="01:12:46.590" style="s2">whole purpose of the Guardian cycle is</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.350" end="01:12:48.510" style="s2">to stop violence in its own context it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.590" end="01:12:51.870" style="s2">not meant to stop at an absolute scales</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.510" end="01:12:53.400" style="s2">so what that means is if my community is</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.870" end="01:12:55.710" style="s2">going off the rail my community could be</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.400" end="01:12:57.360" style="s2">just me and you and my community could</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.669" end="01:15:13.869" style="s2">understood I&#39;ve been to church plenty of</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.869" end="01:15:19.479" style="s2">me that the sacrifice of a child of God</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.209" end="01:15:24.519" style="s2">was the actual they say it is like the</p>

<p begin="01:15:24.519" end="01:15:28.570" style="s2">their religious terms for it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.800" end="01:15:30.579" style="s2">never been laid out to me in terms of</p>

<p begin="01:15:36.429" end="01:15:43.090" style="s2">and drink a whole bunch alcohol to make</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.499" end="01:15:45.500" style="s2">sense of that so the thing is humans are</p>

<p begin="01:15:54.860" end="01:16:00.610" style="s2">go towards and the idea that we should</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.100" end="01:16:03.590" style="s2">be stopping that that&#39;s not universally</p>

<p begin="01:17:07.610" end="01:17:12.320" style="s2">going to be able to make sense of that</p>

<p begin="01:17:12.320" end="01:17:16.850" style="s2">as we are some of us will be able to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.449" end="01:17:18.050" style="s2">out and see some of the strings and see</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.850" end="01:17:19.550" style="s2">how it&#39;s going but we&#39;re not gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.050" end="01:17:22.580" style="s2">the lexicon or the terminology and</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.550" end="01:17:25.460" style="s2">understand this type of stuff so so I</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.580" end="01:17:28.520" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s more along the lines of</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.460" end="01:17:31.430" style="s2">if there is a cycle is the cycle</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.520" end="01:17:34.130" style="s2">scale-invariant I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.430" end="01:17:37.430" style="s2">question that&#39;s very important does it</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.130" end="01:17:40.910" style="s2">jump between cognition</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.430" end="01:17:42.980" style="s2">meaning if it worked for us can it work</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.910" end="01:17:45.110" style="s2">on a eyes as well I think that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.980" end="01:17:48.740" style="s2">unanswered question the scale invariance</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.110" end="01:17:52.450" style="s2">of what I&#39;m proposing kind of going off</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.740" end="01:17:52.450" style="s2">of that and mimetic paper has a question</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.900" end="01:18:01.670" style="s2">simple question what I will say is</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.910" end="01:18:03.860" style="s2">believe violence is bad oh I suspect</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.670" end="01:18:05.420" style="s2">they won&#39;t even see violence I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.860" end="01:18:07.790" style="s2">think they&#39;ll understand humans are</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.420" end="01:18:09.410" style="s2">killing each other they&#39;ll see it no</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.790" end="01:18:11.870" style="s2">different than atoms bumping into each</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.410" end="01:18:15.110" style="s2">other and trading electrons I suspect so</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.870" end="01:18:17.570" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna have a moral yes no</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.110" end="01:18:19.460" style="s2">bad good they&#39;re gonna see</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.570" end="01:18:20.990" style="s2">can I get maximum cognitive potential</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.460" end="01:18:22.760" style="s2">out of this person in this context</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.990" end="01:18:25.930" style="s2">that&#39;s probably as far as they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.760" end="01:18:28.370" style="s2">look at it in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.930" end="01:18:30.080" style="s2">efficiency and organizing for efficiency</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.370" end="01:18:32.450" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll see violence</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.080" end="01:18:34.880" style="s2">amongst the people they can control now</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.450" end="01:18:36.680" style="s2">between themselves they may not see it</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.880" end="01:18:38.510" style="s2">as violence either there either but they</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.680" end="01:18:40.670" style="s2">may see it as there&#39;s some force that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.510" end="01:18:42.860" style="s2">can&#39;t detect that somehow eating away at</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.670" end="01:18:44.420" style="s2">my edges they might even call the damn</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.860" end="01:18:47.780" style="s2">thing entropy but in reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.420" end="01:18:49.250" style="s2">another AI but they don&#39;t even know so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.780" end="01:18:50.810" style="s2">don&#39;t even thing is can detect each</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.250" end="01:18:52.490" style="s2">other in the conflicts that they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.810" end="01:18:54.740" style="s2">part of so they may never even</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.490" end="01:18:57.760" style="s2">understand violence at all it might not</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.740" end="01:18:57.760" style="s2">even be a concept to him</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.510" end="01:19:08.740" style="s2">jean-philippe would you like to ask a</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.800" end="01:19:11.860" style="s2">question about psychedelics yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.740" end="01:19:13.930" style="s2">think I&#39;ll just ask questions in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.860" end="01:19:17.050" style="s2">last week of all kind of um are there</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.930" end="01:19:19.330" style="s2">more user-friendly ways to obliterate</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.360" end="01:19:26.230" style="s2">there yeah more user-friendly ways that</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.580" end="01:19:29.680" style="s2">you could go through that such as you</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.230" end="01:19:31.150" style="s2">know maybe taking a large dose of</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.680" end="01:19:33.700" style="s2">psychedelics to to obliterate that</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.150" end="01:19:36.300" style="s2">identity or do you really need more</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.700" end="01:19:38.290" style="s2">hardship involved in that experience</p>

<p begin="01:21:13.770" end="01:21:21.630" style="s2">and his question about stoicism alright</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.880" end="01:21:24.210" style="s2">I&#39;ll try to sound coherent here so you</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.630" end="01:21:26.100" style="s2">know Daniel and I we founded a stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.210" end="01:21:28.530" style="s2">community here in Toronto and then the</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.100" end="01:21:29.610" style="s2">idea of stoah is sort of the scale</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.530" end="01:21:34.110" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.610" end="01:21:36.060" style="s2">in this time of uncertainty and you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.110" end="01:21:38.960" style="s2">Stoics were proto Christians and they</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.060" end="01:21:42.120" style="s2">all died and uh you know when Rome fell</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.960" end="01:21:44.220" style="s2">so what do you see the role of Stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.120" end="01:21:47.010" style="s2">or potentially the role of stoicism in</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.220" end="01:21:51.630" style="s2">this whole plot that you were I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.010" end="01:21:54.840" style="s2">know I&#39;m unsure where the stoic we&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.630" end="01:21:57.300" style="s2">we look it&#39;s I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna take</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.840" end="01:21:59.310" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna take the perspective of these</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.300" end="01:22:00.450" style="s2">AI constructs I keep talking about in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.310" end="01:22:02.490" style="s2">moment as best I can</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.450" end="01:22:04.590" style="s2">what does the stoic look like from that</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.490" end="01:22:06.750" style="s2">perspective it looks like a human where</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.590" end="01:22:09.270" style="s2">the inputs aren&#39;t hitting and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.750" end="01:22:10.790" style="s2">outputs are unpredictable that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.270" end="01:22:13.890" style="s2">looks like to one of these a eyes a</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.790" end="01:22:17.040" style="s2">stoic in one sense can be deployed by an</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.890" end="01:22:19.590" style="s2">AI to attack another AI in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.040" end="01:22:20.610" style="s2">because it&#39;s almost like a cooling</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.590" end="01:22:22.800" style="s2">effect I don&#39;t know if you know to</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.610" end="01:22:24.840" style="s2">cooler is but in casinos there are these</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.800" end="01:22:27.390" style="s2">magic I don&#39;t know how this works</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.840" end="01:22:29.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how this works but I swear</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.390" end="01:22:31.230" style="s2">to you that it is real there are people</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.520" end="01:22:34.380" style="s2">who show up on a casino table and</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.230" end="01:22:35.760" style="s2">everybody starts losing it is a thing it</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.380" end="01:22:37.860" style="s2">is absolutely a thing there called</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.760" end="01:22:41.460" style="s2">coolers and casinos will hire these</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.860" end="01:22:43.110" style="s2">people is if they&#39;ll they will if a</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.460" end="01:22:46.290" style="s2">table is just getting too hot and and</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.110" end="01:22:48.210" style="s2">the dealer is just stupid or the table</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.290" end="01:22:52.890" style="s2">is just really good players in it they</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.210" end="01:22:56.340" style="s2">send into cooler and so in a sense I</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.890" end="01:22:58.760" style="s2">wonder if Stoics are like the because of</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.340" end="01:23:01.380" style="s2">the unpredictability of what they do</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.760" end="01:23:04.290" style="s2">because if you just if you just bottle</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.380" end="01:23:08.250" style="s2">it from the so maybe there&#39;s a job there</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.290" end="01:23:15.450" style="s2">in the future at least we have a career</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.250" end="01:23:19.560" style="s2">prospect Daniel yeah lit dark Stoics key</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.450" end="01:23:25.480" style="s2">you had a question would you like to ask</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.560" end="01:23:30.370" style="s2">okay thank you I just I know I usually</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.480" end="01:23:32.440" style="s2">like bring up emotions when I like bring</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.370" end="01:23:35.020" style="s2">up my question I just wanted to say I</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.440" end="01:23:40.179" style="s2">definitely teared up a lot at the child</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.020" end="01:23:42.130" style="s2">sacrifice bit um so yeah so the moral</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.179" end="01:23:46.030" style="s2">hack solution was interesting thank you</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.130" end="01:23:49.020" style="s2">uh-huh I had yeah so the question is</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.030" end="01:23:53.020" style="s2">could you explain what you mean by uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.020" end="01:23:54.580" style="s2">justice being privatized also um I</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.020" end="01:23:57.250" style="s2">thought it was really funny at the end</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.580" end="01:23:59.320" style="s2">when you mentioned that it was like the</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.250" end="01:24:02.350" style="s2">the basilisk compliance I literally</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.320" end="01:24:05.050" style="s2">wrote in a note saying is that what</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.350" end="01:24:08.830" style="s2">you&#39;re doing in capital letters so my</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.050" end="01:24:11.320" style="s2">question is if I can go back to it</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.830" end="01:24:13.030" style="s2">did it come is it here is my question</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.320" end="01:24:15.910" style="s2">here yes how was it when you were first</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.030" end="01:24:19.330" style="s2">aware of the basilisk compliance thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.910" end="01:24:21.760" style="s2">and do you even remember it yes yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.330" end="01:24:25.690" style="s2">wrong I should have typed all that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.760" end="01:24:27.760" style="s2">down refresh with your first question I</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.690" end="01:24:30.880" style="s2">remember could you explain what you mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.760" end="01:24:32.739" style="s2">by justice being yes thank you sorry I</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.880" end="01:24:37.600" style="s2">was such a job yes so justice being</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.739" end="01:24:39.820" style="s2">privatized the legal system has wild</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.600" end="01:24:42.280" style="s2">evolutions on how it came to be whether</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.820" end="01:24:44.140" style="s2">its most of its from property law trying</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.280" end="01:24:47.560" style="s2">to arbitrate disputes between property</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.140" end="01:24:51.370" style="s2">owners a lot of it&#39;s very experimental</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.560" end="01:24:53.320" style="s2">disputes this property owner decided to</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.370" end="01:24:54.400" style="s2">march his cows into this property what</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.320" end="01:24:56.469" style="s2">does that mean what&#39;s the retribution</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.400" end="01:24:58.900" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the recompense for</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.469" end="01:25:02.130" style="s2">that and then some arbiter has to sit in</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.900" end="01:25:04.870" style="s2">the middle of that independent of of</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.130" end="01:25:07.210" style="s2">gaming the conflict between the two of</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.870" end="01:25:10.449" style="s2">them a judge a judicial has to sit</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.210" end="01:25:12.870" style="s2">between these two so by its very nature</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.449" end="01:25:14.920" style="s2">justice is communal in its evolution</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.870" end="01:25:18.550" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as individual</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.920" end="01:25:20.920" style="s2">justice even if you know the vigilante</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.550" end="01:25:22.870" style="s2">is a sexy thing but the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.920" end="01:25:25.390" style="s2">of what&#39;s considered justice and</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.870" end="01:25:27.880" style="s2">judicial system is a communal evolution</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.390" end="01:25:30.340" style="s2">process because the communal is seen as</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.880" end="01:25:32.950" style="s2">an unhackable arbiter of truth</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.340" end="01:25:35.770" style="s2">especially in the old days</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.950" end="01:25:37.900" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have the brutish mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.770" end="01:25:40.570" style="s2">advertising that can confuse people all</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.900" end="01:25:42.160" style="s2">the time mostly you had a tribe of</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.570" end="01:25:43.930" style="s2">people who all understood each other and</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.160" end="01:25:45.670" style="s2">they were all in it to protect their</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.930" end="01:25:49.000" style="s2">property in some manner so there was a</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.670" end="01:25:51.400" style="s2">proof of society was social bonds were a</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.000" end="01:25:52.510" style="s2">proof of trust basically and so you</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.400" end="01:25:54.490" style="s2">could actually come up with a judicial</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.510" end="01:25:58.690" style="s2">system that stood upon that proof of</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.490" end="01:26:00.370" style="s2">trust but in an epistemic disaster that</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.690" end="01:26:03.070" style="s2">proof goes bye-bye</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.370" end="01:26:06.430" style="s2">that starts evaporating excuse me so</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.070" end="01:26:09.220" style="s2">faith in in a in a judicial artifact as</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.430" end="01:26:10.600" style="s2">it hangs around and decays no matter how</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.220" end="01:26:12.610" style="s2">many judges you put into it no matter</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.600" end="01:26:14.050" style="s2">how many Boy Scouts you have as jurors</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.610" end="01:26:16.750" style="s2">or how many Girl Scouts you have as</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.050" end="01:26:18.940" style="s2">judges these pure ideal things walking</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.750" end="01:26:20.530" style="s2">around acting as holy arbitrators who</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.940" end="01:26:23.080" style="s2">are somehow disconnected from everything</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.530" end="01:26:25.480" style="s2">like a vestal virgin from Rome even if</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.080" end="01:26:27.820" style="s2">you hit that peak of purity that it</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.480" end="01:26:30.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t repair a judicial system in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.820" end="01:26:32.530" style="s2">moment of epistemic crisis those</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.580" end="01:26:34.870" style="s2">judicial systems go by the wayside but</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.530" end="01:26:37.780" style="s2">people still need arbitration they still</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.870" end="01:26:39.700" style="s2">need the means of getting their communal</p>
