<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">sharing some ideas with John and giving</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:37.710" style="s2">his feedback on them so what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">working on is a kind of a map of of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.710" end="00:00:42.239" style="s2">evolved play is all about and right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.530" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve talked about this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">the ecology of practices before very</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:48.050" style="s2">much we&#39;ve been trying to break down</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:52.320" style="s2">like what what is it that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.050" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">what are all these pieces and you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.320" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve come up with essentially there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:58.469" style="s2">set of body practices like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">practices within the body and how the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.469" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">body relates to things okay right</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">practice that&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">meditation that&#39;s internal that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:09.420" style="s2">the body right you know body integrity</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">practice like how do I make sure this</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.420" end="00:01:14.430" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m in or this thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">me is sustained and functions and as</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.430" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">good a relationship between all those</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">component pizzas as possible right and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">then how do I then then there&#39;s the body</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:31.470" style="s2">to environment practice how do i how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">I make more sophisticated more</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.470" end="00:01:35.850" style="s2">differentiated more confident my</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">relationship to the environment around</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.850" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">me the stacking from Moroni there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">body to object practice right where to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">you know the environment is the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">that we move ourselves on and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">objects of the things that we can move</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:51.329" style="s2">right that&#39;s the way people then move</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">things that becomes a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.329" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">place where there&#39;s lots of stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">practice and then there&#39;s ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">other bodies body to bodies right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">the center of our or our physical</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">practices and what we do is really at</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">that point right like we&#39;re that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">body people like um you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">enjoying listening to your turning to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:14.269" style="s2">your podcast series or your</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:16.129" style="s2">your lecture series I&#39;ve been enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.269" end="00:02:17.720" style="s2">interested in your talks with guys hang</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.129" end="00:02:19.519" style="s2">stock and Jordan Hall and all these guys</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.720" end="00:02:21.709" style="s2">but the one thing that I&#39;m always asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.519" end="00:02:24.769" style="s2">is where is the body in this store sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.709" end="00:02:26.450" style="s2">well I do I do I do constantly say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.769" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">body practices have to be in the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.450" end="00:02:33.769" style="s2">practices and and and I often point to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">your work in fact as exemplifying a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.769" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">community of practice that it&#39;s creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:42.110" style="s2">an ecology practices so yeah very much I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">agree with that and and I you know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.110" end="00:02:48.769" style="s2">at some point with my talk about some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:51.459" style="s2">the some of the phenomena that earmark</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.769" end="00:02:54.079" style="s2">that like when you for example a body</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.459" end="00:02:55.549" style="s2">environment relationship if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.079" end="00:02:56.629" style="s2">coupled very well for the environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.549" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">you probably going to get into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.629" end="00:03:01.069" style="s2">state and what does that look like and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:03.049" style="s2">things like that so but yes I very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.069" end="00:03:04.220" style="s2">agree with what you&#39;ve said and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.049" end="00:03:06.129" style="s2">there&#39;s another way in which my work</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.220" end="00:03:08.930" style="s2">converges with it because as you know I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.129" end="00:03:11.480" style="s2">advocate for for ecard of science and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.930" end="00:03:15.410" style="s2">for understanding cognition as you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.480" end="00:03:18.950" style="s2">embodied embedded you know extended etc</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.410" end="00:03:20.780" style="s2">and so well I don&#39;t often talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.950" end="00:03:22.609" style="s2">as concretely as you do I think what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.780" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is very convergent though</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.609" end="00:03:29.739" style="s2">the work I&#39;m doing with guy and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:31.639" style="s2">is and you know it we do talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.739" end="00:03:33.889" style="s2">embodied aspects for the reasons I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.639" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">just articulated but right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.889" end="00:03:40.849" style="s2">really focused on trying to get trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:43.430" style="s2">to get a cyclo technology for dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.849" end="00:03:45.459" style="s2">that&#39;s analogous to what the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.430" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">practice of dialectic was so that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.459" end="00:03:50.060" style="s2">learn how to activate collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:51.769" style="s2">intelligence with industry within</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.060" end="00:03:53.389" style="s2">distributed cognition and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.769" end="00:03:54.889" style="s2">that&#39;s analogous to individual cognition</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.389" end="00:03:57.230" style="s2">the way individual intelligence can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.889" end="00:03:59.840" style="s2">bootstrapped in to rationality and into</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.230" end="00:04:02.349" style="s2">wisdom I&#39;m trying to figure out can we</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:05.709" style="s2">create can we create a psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.349" end="00:04:07.819" style="s2">dialectic that activates dialogue within</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.709" end="00:04:09.079" style="s2">collective intelligence so it can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.819" end="00:04:11.660" style="s2">bootstrapped into collective rationality</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.079" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">and collective wisdom so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.660" end="00:04:16.489" style="s2">that&#39;s thanks well that&#39;s why that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.190" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">granted right now because I think is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.489" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">that that is to use Jordan strim that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:23.510" style="s2">a meta psycho technology that all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:25.909" style="s2">groups like your group will need that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.510" end="00:04:27.010" style="s2">too because part of what like I see you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.909" end="00:04:29.110" style="s2">doing right</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.010" end="00:04:30.940" style="s2">you&#39;re also getting into dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.110" end="00:04:33.400" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it right now and so how can</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.940" end="00:04:36.490" style="s2">we optimize that dialogue so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.400" end="00:04:38.950" style="s2">dissemination and the cultivation for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.490" end="00:04:41.290" style="s2">you of the embodied ecology practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.950" end="00:04:43.090" style="s2">could be can happen much more fluently</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.290" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">much more effectively in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.090" end="00:04:49.390" style="s2">flowing manner yeah yeah so so actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">I am so movement is at the center what</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.390" end="00:04:51.790" style="s2">we do and we want to like be really</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:54.820" style="s2">clear about that but what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.790" end="00:04:56.920" style="s2">recognized is that our orientation</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.820" end="00:05:00.040" style="s2">around movement is how it transforms</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.920" end="00:05:02.200" style="s2">people right X others do we notice that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.040" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">movement does this thing to people then</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.200" end="00:05:06.280" style="s2">we can look at these these other streams</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:08.470" style="s2">these other ecologies these other</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.280" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">practices and how they can assist in</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.470" end="00:05:13.260" style="s2">them we want to excellentest on where</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:15.850" style="s2">where our expertise is you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.260" end="00:05:17.470" style="s2">kind of like no no what are centrist</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.850" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not everyone&#39;s Center it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.470" end="00:05:21.430" style="s2">center that myth necessary is essential</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:22.990" style="s2">for that&#39;s our Center but with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.430" end="00:05:26.140" style="s2">movement then there&#39;s a mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.990" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">piece yes a community piece and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.140" end="00:05:30.280" style="s2">what yes I believe that you were you</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:32.140" style="s2">were challenging me on this the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.280" end="00:05:35.980" style="s2">time I&#39;m calling your somewhere yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.140" end="00:05:38.070" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;ve written that in now and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.980" end="00:05:42.610" style="s2">then there&#39;s the nature piece right a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.070" end="00:05:44.050" style="s2">relationship yeah so you know I&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.610" end="00:05:46.090" style="s2">the distinction that I learned from you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.050" end="00:05:48.550" style="s2">of meditation contemplation and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.090" end="00:05:51.130" style="s2">actually been using so what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.550" end="00:05:52.540" style="s2">doing is a combination of focused</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.130" end="00:05:55.990" style="s2">practice that I learned from rice from</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.540" end="00:05:58.360" style="s2">Simon Fackler or toggler sorry you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.990" end="00:05:59.980" style="s2">I do either was obviously just the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.360" end="00:06:01.870" style="s2">breath but I like to focus on a single</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.980" end="00:06:04.540" style="s2">point and try to collapse yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.870" end="00:06:05.470" style="s2">point right to to learn to control</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.540" end="00:06:07.930" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.470" end="00:06:09.910" style="s2">I find that practice is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.930" end="00:06:12.250" style="s2">disembodied though yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.910" end="00:06:15.970" style="s2">yeah I like to couple that with a body</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.250" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">scan meditation and then I will</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.970" end="00:06:21.640" style="s2">transition from that once I have I feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:25.570" style="s2">like I&#39;ve attuned and improved my</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.640" end="00:06:28.060" style="s2">ability to to control attention then I</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.570" end="00:06:29.560" style="s2">do a meta meditation excellence I</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.060" end="00:06:33.730" style="s2">actually taught to me by our mutual</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.560" end="00:06:35.530" style="s2">friend Mark Walsh ah excellent and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.730" end="00:06:36.850" style="s2">that&#39;s but that&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.530" end="00:06:39.100" style="s2">profound effects it&#39;s quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.850" end="00:06:39.910" style="s2">okay that&#39;s that&#39;s the core approach</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.100" end="00:06:42.370" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.910" end="00:06:44.440" style="s2">let me go to go deep in and then deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.370" end="00:06:45.730" style="s2">out and then learning how to flow</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.440" end="00:06:48.280" style="s2">between them that&#39;s why the movement</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.730" end="00:06:50.320" style="s2">practices also tie in right because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.280" end="00:06:52.630" style="s2">movement practices give your brain that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.320" end="00:06:55.180" style="s2">interactive schema of how to move in and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.630" end="00:06:56.350" style="s2">out so I see like when I&#39;m doing Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.180" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">Chuan you&#39;re literally doing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.350" end="00:07:00.130" style="s2">in-and-out movement but that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:01.420" style="s2">overlapping with the eating out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.130" end="00:07:03.250" style="s2">attention that you&#39;re doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.420" end="00:07:05.140" style="s2">private practices so the movement</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.250" end="00:07:06.670" style="s2">mindfulness and the sit-in mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.140" end="00:07:08.380" style="s2">can talk deeply to each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.670" end="00:07:12.250" style="s2">yeah and I think it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.380" end="00:07:14.680" style="s2">because the you know I always like to at</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.250" end="00:07:16.030" style="s2">least return to like my base frame right</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.680" end="00:07:18.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like if I&#39;m gonna teach martial</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.030" end="00:07:19.570" style="s2">arts I need to at least know that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.340" end="00:07:22.900" style="s2">things that I&#39;m teaching or helping</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.570" end="00:07:25.510" style="s2">people fight right yes yeah yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.900" end="00:07:28.570" style="s2">everything else that I claim has to sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.510" end="00:07:29.620" style="s2">of not ignore this most basic principle</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.570" end="00:07:31.210" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.620" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">so when I think about meditation I also</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.210" end="00:07:39.010" style="s2">recognize that it actually it the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:40.510" style="s2">meditation trains my ability to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.010" end="00:07:42.700" style="s2">the thing that I need to focus in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.510" end="00:07:45.430" style="s2">moment when I&#39;m actually moving and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.700" end="00:07:47.770" style="s2">without that I&#39;m a bird</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.430" end="00:07:50.500" style="s2">that that&#39;s one of the biggest dangers</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.770" end="00:07:51.370" style="s2">that we face is our attention being on</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.500" end="00:07:55.030" style="s2">the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.370" end="00:07:58.090" style="s2">like most of our movements it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:08:01.270" style="s2">your attention has shifted too early</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.090" end="00:08:03.220" style="s2">right right so you&#39;re you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.270" end="00:08:05.320" style="s2">ahead in the sequence or it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.220" end="00:08:07.900" style="s2">shifted completely out of the frame</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.320" end="00:08:09.720" style="s2">right after you&#39;re moving and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.900" end="00:08:13.300" style="s2">you have a thought about your girlfriend</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.720" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">fall down all right but and so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.300" end="00:08:17.590" style="s2">ability to attune and train the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:20.170" style="s2">attention is actually incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.590" end="00:08:21.760" style="s2">critical to successfully completing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.170" end="00:08:25.060" style="s2">movements and of course that all it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.760" end="00:08:27.340" style="s2">connects in in flow state and then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.060" end="00:08:31.150" style="s2">guess it goes the other way too right as</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.340" end="00:08:33.490" style="s2">I learned in the park or informed by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.150" end="00:08:35.710" style="s2">mindfulness to more appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.490" end="00:08:38.200" style="s2">distribute my attention that should then</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.710" end="00:08:39.219" style="s2">ramify out into my life in general right</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.200" end="00:08:42.940" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.219" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">so so like why do parkour in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.940" end="00:08:46.600" style="s2">meditation might be the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:49.270" style="s2">question right yeah yeah one question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.600" end="00:08:51.850" style="s2">why do why would a parkour athlete want</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.270" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">to do meditation but the second question</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.850" end="00:08:53.620" style="s2">would be like why would a meditator want</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:55.270" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.620" end="00:08:57.640" style="s2">our core and those are both good</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.270" end="00:09:00.040" style="s2">questions yeah and and the reason that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.640" end="00:09:01.870" style="s2">might recommend that parque loro</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.040" end="00:09:04.230" style="s2">meditator is kind of what you just</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.870" end="00:09:06.610" style="s2">mentioned which is this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.230" end="00:09:08.200" style="s2">essentially we&#39;re making physical the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.610" end="00:09:11.230" style="s2">processes that people are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.200" end="00:09:14.940" style="s2">apply in their mind yeah this is where</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.230" end="00:09:18.910" style="s2">like I really love the embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.940" end="00:09:22.300" style="s2">embodied and embedded right yeah very</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.910" end="00:09:24.520" style="s2">much where it&#39;s like you can train the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.300" end="00:09:27.070" style="s2">mind but if it isn&#39;t in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.520" end="00:09:29.830" style="s2">the body it&#39;s missing this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.070" end="00:09:31.060" style="s2">aspect because you know this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.830" end="00:09:33.960" style="s2">things I love about your work you make</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.060" end="00:09:37.630" style="s2">so clear that how we think is</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.960" end="00:09:40.120" style="s2">extraordinarily conditioned on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.630" end="00:09:42.820" style="s2">that we have bodies right over our</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.120" end="00:09:46.120" style="s2">bodies we are bodies yeah how much of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.820" end="00:09:49.150" style="s2">our how much of our thinking is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.120" end="00:09:52.120" style="s2">framed in analogies of the body to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.150" end="00:09:53.500" style="s2">understand to have it on something yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.120" end="00:09:56.770" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.500" end="00:09:58.870" style="s2">and so I think it&#39;s very easy on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.770" end="00:10:02.589" style="s2">culture to lose sight of this but when</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.870" end="00:10:04.839" style="s2">we make a more erudite body oh I like</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.589" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">that that&#39;s a nice turn of phrase yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.839" end="00:10:11.709" style="s2">I just I was actually um I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:12.700" style="s2">uh I was trying to find this quote that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.709" end="00:10:16.089" style="s2">I thought I had heard from like</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.700" end="00:10:18.310" style="s2">epictetus about wrestling being the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.089" end="00:10:19.330" style="s2">foundation of physical culture and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.310" end="00:10:21.700" style="s2">couldn&#39;t find it maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.330" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">misattribution but I started reading</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.700" end="00:10:28.690" style="s2">about how Plato was a wrestler I&#39;m guys</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:31.660" style="s2">from wrestling what does that very much</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.690" end="00:10:34.029" style="s2">and so yeah gymnastic and athletic</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.660" end="00:10:36.790" style="s2">metaphors are pervasive through Plato</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.029" end="00:10:38.650" style="s2">wrestling with philosophy yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.790" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">which i think is quite interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.650" end="00:10:42.990" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:45.490" style="s2">a association now one does not expect a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.990" end="00:10:49.300" style="s2">philosopher to be a physical</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.490" end="00:10:51.910" style="s2">practitioner no and that&#39;s unfortunate I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.300" end="00:10:54.010" style="s2">mean I think that&#39;s more the case if</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.910" end="00:10:57.160" style="s2">you&#39;ll all have a desire to kids in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.010" end="00:11:01.780" style="s2">Western philosophy and what you might</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.160" end="00:11:04.089" style="s2">find in in AZ attic philosophy yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.780" end="00:11:06.420" style="s2">and then the contemplation is also</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.089" end="00:11:09.210" style="s2">really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.420" end="00:11:13.260" style="s2">I think that when you start having that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.210" end="00:11:19.500" style="s2">orientation towards towards wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.260" end="00:11:21.960" style="s2">bring good into the world right it helps</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.500" end="00:11:24.530" style="s2">regulate in motion and regulation of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.960" end="00:11:26.490" style="s2">emotion is actually super key to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.530" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">athletic performance as well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.490" end="00:11:32.370" style="s2">something I think is it&#39;s massively</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:36.630" style="s2">under understood is how much people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.370" end="00:11:37.740" style="s2">frustration fear sadness anger etc is</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.630" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">actually the thing that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.740" end="00:11:42.780" style="s2">addressed and work from them to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:46.200" style="s2">progress yeah I think that&#39;s very well</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.780" end="00:11:51.990" style="s2">said it&#39;s very well said III think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.200" end="00:11:53.220" style="s2">I mean come from what I know within like</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.990" end="00:11:55.230" style="s2">Tai Chi Chuan</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.220" end="00:11:58.890" style="s2">and but also what I&#39;ve read about in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.230" end="00:12:01.310" style="s2">gymnastics in ancient Greece I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.890" end="00:12:04.350" style="s2">of the functions of the athletic</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.310" end="00:12:09.980" style="s2">endeavors was to afford people exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.350" end="00:12:13.290" style="s2">that kind of training learning you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.980" end="00:12:15.270" style="s2">very very much in the power of an</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.290" end="00:12:17.280" style="s2">exigent moment to exercise self</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.270" end="00:12:22.200" style="s2">regulation of emotion I think is one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.280" end="00:12:24.300" style="s2">the key things yeah and I think that so</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.200" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">yes we have that that interaction again</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.300" end="00:12:29.190" style="s2">where where the the mindfulness gives us</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:32.400" style="s2">something as an athletic tool but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.190" end="00:12:34.250" style="s2">the athletic practice gives us a window</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.400" end="00:12:37.410" style="s2">into and a place to build</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.250" end="00:12:38.970" style="s2">characteristics this is exactly what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.410" end="00:12:40.470" style="s2">one of the features because I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.970" end="00:12:42.540" style="s2">to do this meta thing right now when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.470" end="00:12:44.190" style="s2">trying to get at you know what are we</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.540" end="00:12:45.270" style="s2">looking for an ecology of practice and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.190" end="00:12:46.290" style="s2">one of them one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.270" end="00:12:48.210" style="s2">talked about is the checks and balances</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.290" end="00:12:50.420" style="s2">but also this other thing you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.210" end="00:12:52.410" style="s2">the way they they mutually</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.410" end="00:12:56.190" style="s2">other right that&#39;s also a really</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.110" end="00:12:58.140" style="s2">important thing that you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.190" end="00:13:01.020" style="s2">looking for I would argue in an oncology</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.140" end="00:13:03.450" style="s2">practices you because if they don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.020" end="00:13:05.280" style="s2">this if they don&#39;t sort of impregnate</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.450" end="00:13:06.660" style="s2">each other with transformation then</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.280" end="00:13:07.580" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to have a very you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.910" end="00:13:18.529" style="s2">comes up in my head then is this is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:21.289" style="s2">general question that I have about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.529" end="00:13:24.139" style="s2">emergence of dynamical systems as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.289" end="00:13:26.299" style="s2">as a reframing from an excessive</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.139" end="00:13:27.979" style="s2">reductionism so I want to get into that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.299" end="00:13:30.379" style="s2">with you I think maybe a really deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.979" end="00:13:31.639" style="s2">line of inquiry but I want to just go</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.379" end="00:13:33.889" style="s2">through this this this little boys</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.499" end="00:13:44.419" style="s2">please do I am I&#39;m this is a little new</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.799" end="00:13:47.379" style="s2">because I&#39;m used to when I interview</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.419" end="00:13:49.309" style="s2">people having my interviewer persona and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.379" end="00:13:50.899" style="s2">balance that between like how would I</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.309" end="00:13:53.509" style="s2">talk to John if it was just me and John</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.899" end="00:13:55.189" style="s2">talking well see if this is also helping</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.509" end="00:13:58.819" style="s2">me because this is exemplifying this</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.189" end="00:14:01.309" style="s2">process of dialogue and trying to get an</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.819" end="00:14:03.169" style="s2">emergence like of the logos in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.309" end="00:14:05.119" style="s2">dialogue so that it starts to take a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.169" end="00:14:07.729" style="s2">shape of its own and leads us into</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.119" end="00:14:10.219" style="s2">places that are insightful and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.729" end="00:14:12.169" style="s2">transformative for us sweet so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.219" end="00:14:13.999" style="s2">an extra dear is I just I was I&#39;m Anna</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.169" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">staphon I - I didn&#39;t know if I had done</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.999" end="00:14:18.109" style="s2">this but I I saved this this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:23.809" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at and I can share it with</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.109" end="00:14:28.519" style="s2">you okay so I&#39;m going to share this and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.809" end="00:14:31.309" style="s2">now you can see it right yes yes I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.519" end="00:14:35.569" style="s2">so this is what we do right mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.309" end="00:14:37.999" style="s2">community nature and yes and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.569" end="00:14:43.249" style="s2">there&#39;s something really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.999" end="00:14:44.599" style="s2">here so so yeah so we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.249" end="00:14:46.249" style="s2">meditation contemplation then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.599" end="00:14:50.629" style="s2">dialogue we&#39;re just in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.249" end="00:14:54.459" style="s2">conversation about dialogue but so what</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.629" end="00:14:57.349" style="s2">we&#39;ve noticed that what people can</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.459" end="00:14:58.749" style="s2">comment on about our workshops more than</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.349" end="00:15:04.249" style="s2">anything else is the sense of community</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.749" end="00:15:05.329" style="s2">yeah yeah you you you asked me this</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.249" end="00:15:08.599" style="s2">question last time we talked to like</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.329" end="00:15:11.119" style="s2">what is the community practice right but</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.599" end="00:15:12.859" style="s2">I hadn&#39;t done that explicitly but it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.119" end="00:15:15.229" style="s2">implicitly or was becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.859" end="00:15:18.139" style="s2">explicitly part of what we were doing so</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.229" end="00:15:21.249" style="s2">one of the things is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.139" end="00:15:24.109" style="s2">dialoguing practice and this has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.249" end="00:15:25.999" style="s2">quite interesting as a development so</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.109" end="00:15:28.339" style="s2">traditionally in my workshops I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.999" end="00:15:32.089" style="s2">tell a lot of sort I would do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.339" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">kind of lecture about the theory and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.089" end="00:15:33.980" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">in the practice right so people could</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.980" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">put it in in context and gain the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:41.059" style="s2">insight out of the physical practice so</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:43.579" style="s2">now I went to train with Mark Walsh in</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.059" end="00:15:45.799" style="s2">June and he had this practice of just</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.579" end="00:15:48.379" style="s2">having people after a drill have one</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.799" end="00:15:50.359" style="s2">minute to share their insights and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.379" end="00:15:54.199" style="s2">he&#39;d ask a few leading questions to help</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.359" end="00:16:00.410" style="s2">people do that right so we adopted this</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.199" end="00:16:02.359" style="s2">when we when we cool when we taught this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.410" end="00:16:04.129" style="s2">summer and it was really interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.359" end="00:16:06.259" style="s2">the Amplatz that I used to feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.129" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">had to share with people herself but</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.259" end="00:16:11.269" style="s2">there was Jerry by the group and I got</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:13.489" style="s2">everyone talking so we drove a real</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.269" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">interest in dialogue the other aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.489" end="00:16:18.799" style="s2">these community things is we found this</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:20.839" style="s2">storytelling has this enormous power as</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.799" end="00:16:22.459" style="s2">a teacher as I&#39;ve soared stories in</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.839" end="00:16:24.169" style="s2">myself and then once i encountered</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.459" end="00:16:26.059" style="s2">jordan Peterson&#39;s work actually telling</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.169" end="00:16:28.609" style="s2">old mythological stories and can</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.059" end="00:16:30.049" style="s2">actually work</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.609" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">and then I&#39;ve got retreat down here</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.049" end="00:16:33.379" style="s2">itself because like I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:35.149" style="s2">describe the whole container of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.379" end="00:16:37.160" style="s2">things but when you go away with people</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.149" end="00:16:38.389" style="s2">and you make food and you and you do the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.160" end="00:16:41.419" style="s2">dishes together and you go</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.389" end="00:16:43.009" style="s2">Sano&#39;s whatever it is oh yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.419" end="00:16:44.629" style="s2">getting sick yeah your synchronized it</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.009" end="00:16:46.459" style="s2">up in the powerful waves yeah I get that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.629" end="00:16:48.109" style="s2">that&#39;s very good and then the body to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.459" end="00:16:50.989" style="s2">body practices of course fit as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.109" end="00:16:55.220" style="s2">community development tool as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.989" end="00:16:56.660" style="s2">and then this one is something that new</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.220" end="00:16:58.579" style="s2">and kind of breaking things down but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.660" end="00:17:00.699" style="s2">wrote down here your four ways of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.579" end="00:17:04.309" style="s2">knowing right propositional Oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.699" end="00:17:05.899" style="s2">respectable and participatory and I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.309" end="00:17:09.110" style="s2">just looking through how I&#39;ve helped</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.899" end="00:17:10.760" style="s2">people understand nature in in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.110" end="00:17:15.559" style="s2">workshops that we did and then also how</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.760" end="00:17:18.110" style="s2">my my my colleague Kyle Cox Oh Kyle is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.559" end="00:17:19.610" style="s2">one of our teachers so he&#39;s been one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.110" end="00:17:22.010" style="s2">my students for many years now but he is</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.610" end="00:17:24.380" style="s2">also a trained teacher under the will</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.010" end="00:17:26.120" style="s2">nurse awareness school method from Enoch</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.380" end="00:17:28.429" style="s2">a wilderness awareness school so he</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.120" end="00:17:29.539" style="s2">teaches so I noticed that what I do a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.429" end="00:17:31.960" style="s2">lot is what I would call nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.539" end="00:17:34.340" style="s2">knowledge so it&#39;s propositional so</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.960" end="00:17:35.960" style="s2">propositional knowledge about here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.340" end="00:17:38.210" style="s2">what to look for so that a tree branch</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.960" end="00:17:39.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t break here&#39;s you know what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.210" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">local ecology is like here&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.980" end="00:17:45.450" style="s2">stuff right and then what Kyle brings is</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:47.340" style="s2">things like sits</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.450" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">which is awareness training like</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.340" end="00:17:53.820" style="s2">meditation ah in orientation toward</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:55.860" style="s2">nature how do I recognize what is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.820" end="00:17:58.530" style="s2">like the furthest sound of a bird that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.860" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">can hear right what are the birds saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.530" end="00:18:03.810" style="s2">and you know what is what type of water</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">sounds are happening all those things</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.810" end="00:18:09.180" style="s2">learning to move zoom that awareness</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:10.710" style="s2">skin and out beside what&#39;s it called</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.180" end="00:18:12.120" style="s2">again oh if I can&#39;t quite read it what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.710" end="00:18:15.270" style="s2">it called it&#39;s it&#39;s something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.120" end="00:18:17.220" style="s2">spotting sit spotted I&#39;m cool oh and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.270" end="00:18:18.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a play on the word spotting I</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.220" end="00:18:20.820" style="s2">get that oh that&#39;s very good I like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.990" end="00:18:23.010" style="s2">that&#39;s very clever well sorry I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.820" end="00:18:25.500" style="s2">that is a complimentary fashion it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.010" end="00:18:27.540" style="s2">mine I think it may come from a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.500" end="00:18:30.300" style="s2">named John Junger may proceed yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.540" end="00:18:33.180" style="s2">learned this from my friend Simon tapper</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.300" end="00:18:35.550" style="s2">I mentioned before and Kyle and they you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.180" end="00:18:38.490" style="s2">can have a walking meditation practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.550" end="00:18:41.160" style="s2">where you&#39;re where yeah I thought people</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.490" end="00:18:41.610" style="s2">walking that hunting-gathering right</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.160" end="00:18:43.410" style="s2">wait</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.610" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">I&#39;m also connecting to these problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.410" end="00:18:47.940" style="s2">these things and and and you need like</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:50.160" style="s2">fire-making and primitive stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.940" end="00:18:52.980" style="s2">that&#39;s where we&#39;re we bring the nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.160" end="00:18:54.990" style="s2">in specifically wow that&#39;s very good I</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.980" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">like that that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.990" end="00:18:58.650" style="s2">so here&#39;s I wanted to tell you this</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:01.290" style="s2">interesting story about like the power</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.650" end="00:19:04.650" style="s2">of the it&#39;s called the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.290" end="00:19:07.070" style="s2">perspectival which is also something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.650" end="00:19:10.830" style="s2">just starting to understand but um so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.070" end="00:19:12.420" style="s2">asked Kyle to teach bird languages and I</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.420" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">with the students and describe to them</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.850" end="00:19:21.090" style="s2">what type of songs birds sing and help</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:22.620" style="s2">them recognize this and he sets up this</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.090" end="00:19:23.700" style="s2">game where everyone pretends to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.620" end="00:19:25.530" style="s2">bird in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.700" end="00:19:27.000" style="s2">oh there&#39;s demonic that&#39;s very cool</p>

<p begin="00:19:33.480" end="00:19:37.410" style="s2">wilderness awareness and so I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:38.730" style="s2">like go take a nap sometimes so I&#39;m like</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.730" end="00:19:43.170" style="s2">pretending to be a bird but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.670" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">birds and there&#39;s weasels and there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:49.290" style="s2">structure of the game so then I go and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.070" end="00:19:51.420" style="s2">sleep and I come back and ask people</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.290" end="00:19:53.070" style="s2">like okay you know how was it then like</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.169" end="00:20:50.299" style="s2">knowing and then essentially all of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.320" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">is oriented towards creating meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.299" end="00:20:54.020" style="s2">people&#39;s life and I look at and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:55.640" style="s2">an interesting thing that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.020" end="00:20:57.110" style="s2">wanting to discuss with you I I just</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.640" end="00:20:58.279" style="s2">came across I came across this actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.110" end="00:21:00.590" style="s2">in a conversation with another of our</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.279" end="00:21:02.929" style="s2">friends Erin who&#39;s one of my apprentices</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.590" end="00:21:04.399" style="s2">with evolved with play but he made the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.929" end="00:21:06.529" style="s2">distinction between being and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.399" end="00:21:08.330" style="s2">and you&#39;ve talked about the having mode</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.529" end="00:21:10.039" style="s2">and the being mode and it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.330" end="00:21:13.250" style="s2">there&#39;s some distinction here between</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.039" end="00:21:16.399" style="s2">being and becoming as well well I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.250" end="00:21:17.929" style="s2">actually say that I think the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.399" end="00:21:20.210" style="s2">should be better understood as the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.929" end="00:21:22.700" style="s2">becoming mode it&#39;s the mode in which</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.210" end="00:21:24.440" style="s2">you&#39;re trying new you these are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.700" end="00:21:25.580" style="s2">needs that are met by developing by</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.440" end="00:21:28.250" style="s2">going through a process of self</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.580" end="00:21:30.679" style="s2">transformation and it&#39;s where aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.250" end="00:21:33.350" style="s2">and appreciation are playing much more</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.679" end="00:21:39.130" style="s2">important roles than you know control</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.350" end="00:21:42.289" style="s2">and manipulation so yeah III I think why</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.130" end="00:21:44.570" style="s2">my from and others wanted to use the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.289" end="00:21:46.669" style="s2">being mode it&#39;s because of the way in</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.570" end="00:21:48.850" style="s2">which and this overlaps with hided or</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.669" end="00:21:52.549" style="s2">who had an influence on from of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.850" end="00:21:54.830" style="s2">the idea that we recover our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.549" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">being and if we could bring if we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.830" end="00:22:02.210" style="s2">bring back the being as you know as the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:04.340" style="s2">the gerund the active not being as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.210" end="00:22:05.779" style="s2">static thing but being all I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.340" end="00:22:07.669" style="s2">to say processes because it&#39;s deeper</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.779" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">than a process but you understand what</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.669" end="00:22:11.870" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to convey is something much</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:15.230" style="s2">more dynamic and so when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.870" end="00:22:16.670" style="s2">developmental modes we have to we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.230" end="00:22:21.800" style="s2">to we have to learn how to disclose</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.670" end="00:22:24.710" style="s2">aspects of our being so that the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.800" end="00:22:27.680" style="s2">can dispose more deeply disclose aspects</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.710" end="00:22:29.690" style="s2">of its being so the being in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.680" end="00:22:30.860" style="s2">becoming are very deeply intertwined in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.690" end="00:22:35.180" style="s2">that way I hope that made some sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.860" end="00:22:37.730" style="s2">yeah yeah so I wanted to rephrase in</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.180" end="00:22:42.410" style="s2">like I think I can use your language and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.730" end="00:22:43.970" style="s2">tell me if this makes sense so it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.410" end="00:22:46.670" style="s2">if the way that we think about being</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.970" end="00:22:50.300" style="s2">like ontology has become purely a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.670" end="00:22:52.220" style="s2">propositional yes and what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.300" end="00:22:55.100" style="s2">is that to like truly engage in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.220" end="00:22:59.660" style="s2">philosophy a-- we have young cover the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.100" end="00:23:02.030" style="s2">participatory and perspectival being so</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.660" end="00:23:05.179" style="s2">that we are engaged in it not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.030" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">observing it exactly i mean that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.179" end="00:23:09.410" style="s2">that was very well put I completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:10.910" style="s2">agree with what you just said and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.410" end="00:23:15.470" style="s2">think that I think that&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.910" end="00:23:16.970" style="s2">exactly exactly right yes so this being</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.470" end="00:23:19.490" style="s2">and becoming distinction that we make</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.970" end="00:23:24.620" style="s2">there&#39;s an observation in why there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.490" end="00:23:26.360" style="s2">distinction so the first thing is when</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.620" end="00:23:29.030" style="s2">you&#39;re training there&#39;s the there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.360" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">experience of the training and how it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.030" end="00:23:36.440" style="s2">right so I am in a state right and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:40.160" style="s2">there&#39;s how it transforms me over time</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.440" end="00:23:42.980" style="s2">yes now if I become hyper focused on</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.160" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">being in the state that I am in now then</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.980" end="00:23:47.780" style="s2">I don&#39;t for myself transformation</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:50.330" style="s2">effectively in the future yeah i hyper</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.780" end="00:23:52.660" style="s2">focus on the transformation then I never</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.330" end="00:23:55.400" style="s2">get to enjoy what I&#39;m trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.660" end="00:23:57.380" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.400" end="00:23:59.480" style="s2">talk about the symbolic aspect of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.380" end="00:24:02.330" style="s2">the relationship between your current</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.480" end="00:24:03.950" style="s2">self and the divine double to to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.330" end="00:24:05.510" style="s2">more traditional language yeah you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.950" end="00:24:07.610" style="s2">to have that you have to have that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.510" end="00:24:09.890" style="s2">symbolic relationship between the two</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.610" end="00:24:12.620" style="s2">selves if you&#39;ll allow me that language</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.890" end="00:24:14.179" style="s2">now I haven&#39;t questioned the latest one</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.620" end="00:24:16.220" style="s2">I&#39;m like forty minutes into it I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.179" end="00:24:18.110" style="s2">but you were talking about this you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.220" end="00:24:19.790" style="s2">about literally like basically being</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.110" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">coming the idea of the divine double</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.790" end="00:24:23.090" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">most recently listening to so it what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.090" end="00:24:28.740" style="s2">feels like to me is</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:33.330" style="s2">people I think people need an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.740" end="00:24:37.080" style="s2">aim right this is sort of what your your</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.330" end="00:24:38.279" style="s2">- yeah I think well I think yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.080" end="00:24:40.470" style="s2">would just hesitated because I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.279" end="00:24:42.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a genus species thing I think the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.470" end="00:24:44.549" style="s2">Union notion of the archetypes is one</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.630" end="00:24:46.740" style="s2">species of ways in which people have</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.549" end="00:24:51.149" style="s2">crafted symbolism around the divine</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.740" end="00:24:54.870" style="s2">double yeah so I mean the thing is your</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.149" end="00:24:56.789" style="s2">current self causes the future self but</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.870" end="00:24:59.370" style="s2">your future self has normative authority</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.789" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">over your occurrence itself and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.370" end="00:25:04.440" style="s2">getting those getting the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">appropriate respect for each side of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.440" end="00:25:09.149" style="s2">that is it is the virtue that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:10.620" style="s2">trying to cultivate in people when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.149" end="00:25:13.649" style="s2">trying to teach the proper exploration</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.620" end="00:25:15.210" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;ll share a little story ed</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.649" end="00:25:16.860" style="s2">this will be a familiar with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.210" end="00:25:21.020" style="s2">the viewers but it will help ground the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.860" end="00:25:23.429" style="s2">conversation so I came into parkour and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.020" end="00:25:25.710" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.429" end="00:25:28.049" style="s2">I found something in parkour that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.710" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">very meaningful to me and there was this</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.049" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">idea of a philosophy of Concord that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:39.330" style="s2">that that I seized on but I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:41.549" style="s2">quite fully grasp it didn&#39;t quite go</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.330" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">here completely and so I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.549" end="00:25:47.880" style="s2">I did was I ended up essentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">reframing parkour in the sport frame</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.880" end="00:25:51.630" style="s2">right in this frame that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:54.659" style="s2">were talking about maybe descends from</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.630" end="00:25:56.840" style="s2">the national Roman ash list and romantic</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.659" end="00:26:01.169" style="s2">you know period of of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.840" end="00:26:04.350" style="s2">yeah but in that frame you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.169" end="00:26:05.659" style="s2">very you know well perhaps not so</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.350" end="00:26:09.720" style="s2">romantic it&#39;s very it&#39;s very much like</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.659" end="00:26:11.730" style="s2">goals right we&#39;re going here and and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.720" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">it became all about SMART goals specific</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.730" end="00:26:16.020" style="s2">measurable actionable realistic time</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:18.510" style="s2">sensitive right and and so I set up all</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.020" end="00:26:21.179" style="s2">these goals and then there was this</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.510" end="00:26:23.070" style="s2">conflict because the thing that I want</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.179" end="00:26:25.159" style="s2">that was I was truly motivated to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.070" end="00:26:28.380" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the thing that I had set out to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.159" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">write write write all of my goals were</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.380" end="00:26:32.340" style="s2">best served by like training in the gym</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:35.549" style="s2">so I could go compete in other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.340" end="00:26:37.850" style="s2">students but when I was deeply motivated</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.549" end="00:26:40.039" style="s2">by was going to play in the woods</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.850" end="00:26:42.049" style="s2">right and so I followed my motivation</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.039" end="00:26:45.049" style="s2">out of the woods I went deep into play</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.049" end="00:26:47.629" style="s2">as my kind of primary thing and it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.049" end="00:26:49.820" style="s2">really transformational I made a massive</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.629" end="00:26:55.999" style="s2">progress but at a certain point it</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.820" end="00:26:57.739" style="s2">became it became stagnant and and I also</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.999" end="00:26:59.509" style="s2">started getting injured and I started</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.739" end="00:27:02.529" style="s2">feeling like I needed this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.509" end="00:27:04.549" style="s2">where I was going again that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.529" end="00:27:07.549" style="s2">basically when I encountered Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.549" end="00:27:09.169" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work or whose I actually had</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.549" end="00:27:11.169" style="s2">started to articulate very similar ideas</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.169" end="00:27:13.249" style="s2">I remember I wrote this essay called the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.169" end="00:27:15.799" style="s2">self-worth of steaming you can check out</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.249" end="00:27:17.359" style="s2">the video on my youtube page which was</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.799" end="00:27:20.659" style="s2">all about the idea that that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.359" end="00:27:23.149" style="s2">self-esteem is kind of the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.659" end="00:27:26.090" style="s2">to aim at we have to remit creating a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.149" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">self that we would yeah yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.090" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">aspirational self of Socrates rather</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">than the true self that you&#39;re born with</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:36.950" style="s2">from in romantist in standard models of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:39.619" style="s2">Romanticism exactly very much so so so</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.950" end="00:27:41.359" style="s2">we started saying okay we need you we</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.619" end="00:27:46.279" style="s2">need to be akin at something and then it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.359" end="00:27:48.679" style="s2">was like well winning at sport or having</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.279" end="00:27:51.259" style="s2">a specific skill is actually too narrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.679" end="00:27:53.570" style="s2">of an 18 it doesn&#39;t really doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.259" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">really encompass what the person it has</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.570" end="00:27:56.629" style="s2">to be about how those things transform</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:28:01.820" style="s2">you and what are they transforming you</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.629" end="00:28:05.659" style="s2">into and well that&#39;s that&#39;s what this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.820" end="00:28:06.950" style="s2">this this thing is about so uh so so</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.659" end="00:28:09.099" style="s2">yeah so I became very interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.950" end="00:28:11.359" style="s2">idea the hero&#39;s journey and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.099" end="00:28:15.169" style="s2">confrontationally us and how that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.359" end="00:28:16.849" style="s2">that aim gives us meaning so uh so so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.169" end="00:28:18.109" style="s2">don&#39;t want to them to have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.849" end="00:28:21.139" style="s2">this forever so I need to go through</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.109" end="00:28:22.639" style="s2">this a little bit quicker okay sorry no</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.139" end="00:28:26.059" style="s2">no no it&#39;s great and it&#39;s been wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.639" end="00:28:28.129" style="s2">so so okay so we have the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.059" end="00:28:30.710" style="s2">right or what&#39;s more being oriented here</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.129" end="00:28:33.049" style="s2">ease immediately when you engage in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.710" end="00:28:35.059" style="s2">these practices it affords something</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.049" end="00:28:38.109" style="s2">Ford&#39;s a deep connection to things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.059" end="00:28:40.009" style="s2">are meaningful to us ya know play is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.109" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">intrinsically meaningful and motivating</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.009" end="00:28:44.749" style="s2">right movement has a meaning being in</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:46.609" style="s2">nature is meaningful being with a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.749" end="00:28:50.419" style="s2">of like-minded people engaging something</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.609" end="00:28:53.669" style="s2">all of that is powerful in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.419" end="00:28:57.330" style="s2">but then it changes you because it gives</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.669" end="00:29:00.510" style="s2">you awareness of self right yes then we</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.330" end="00:29:02.789" style="s2">learn our own personality come to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.510" end="00:29:05.010" style="s2">recognize what deeply motivates us we</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.789" end="00:29:06.600" style="s2">improve our embodiment right and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.010" end="00:29:08.010" style="s2">develop a positive relationship with our</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.600" end="00:29:09.990" style="s2">body which is something so many people</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.010" end="00:29:12.779" style="s2">are missing in our culture right review</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.990" end="00:29:14.130" style="s2">our bodies through the lens of something</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.779" end="00:29:18.270" style="s2">else right it&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.130" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">yes I think very deeply can be very</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.270" end="00:29:22.799" style="s2">deeply alienated if your body matters</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:24.330" style="s2">mostly to you because of how other</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:27.419" style="s2">people see it you&#39;re essentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.330" end="00:29:29.159" style="s2">alienated from the most from you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.419" end="00:29:33.299" style="s2">the most fundamental aspect of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.159" end="00:29:36.090" style="s2">yes yes so so this is where being is</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.299" end="00:29:37.590" style="s2">becoming becoming and then over time we</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.090" end="00:29:39.659" style="s2">have this idea that we&#39;re transforming</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.590" end="00:29:41.490" style="s2">our character right so we consider own</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.659" end="00:29:42.870" style="s2">character strands for me you can call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.490" end="00:29:45.330" style="s2">self transcendence so we can call this</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.870" end="00:29:47.850" style="s2">the development of the heroic self right</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.330" end="00:29:49.740" style="s2">right these practices we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.850" end="00:29:53.490" style="s2">afford ourselves these connections and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.740" end="00:29:54.690" style="s2">this transformation that&#39;s great I agree</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.490" end="00:29:56.909" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.690" end="00:29:58.350" style="s2">so we talked about something also an</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.909" end="00:30:00.750" style="s2">ally gets to that the work I did with</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.350" end="00:30:03.840" style="s2">Leo about internalizing the sage and now</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.750" end="00:30:05.190" style="s2">there was a lot of these wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:08.850" style="s2">traditions like stoicism where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.190" end="00:30:12.570" style="s2">trying to internalize Socrates as so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.850" end="00:30:16.409" style="s2">Socrates serves as a internalized symbol</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.570" end="00:30:18.600" style="s2">of the of the future self of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.409" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">second self or the divine double but</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.600" end="00:30:21.899" style="s2">because Socrates also has a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:24.809" style="s2">semi-independent existence</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.899" end="00:30:26.100" style="s2">Socrates can challenge you and and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.809" end="00:30:29.309" style="s2">motivate you</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.100" end="00:30:31.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not just an egocentric mirror sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.309" end="00:30:34.049" style="s2">of narcissistically reflecting back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.260" end="00:30:38.520" style="s2">yourself kind of thing Socrates that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.049" end="00:30:41.909" style="s2">Damon right so yes yes yes very much so</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.520" end="00:30:43.350" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna put this back up then because</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.909" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">that was a perfect segue into what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.350" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">talking about next which is so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:48.809" style="s2">reason that I actually reached out to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:52.740" style="s2">you to specifically talk right now was</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.809" end="00:30:55.350" style="s2">that I was I was working with folks on</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.740" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">our online course and they were asking</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.350" end="00:30:58.679" style="s2">me questions like why can&#39;t I do X scale</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:00.270" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t have any video of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.679" end="00:31:03.890" style="s2">doing the scale so I started saying well</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.270" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like a lack of skill so</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.890" end="00:31:10.520" style="s2">of physical ability or it&#39;s a emotional</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:12.770" style="s2">psycho-emotional issue right and then I</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.520" end="00:31:15.350" style="s2">noticed that that had mapped this idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.770" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">of what are the archetypal attributes of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.350" end="00:31:18.440" style="s2">the archetypal representations of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:22.370" style="s2">heroic character that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.440" end="00:31:24.050" style="s2">develop so I had you know a switch from</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.370" end="00:31:27.020" style="s2">the source the last few years we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.050" end="00:31:29.000" style="s2">told these heroic narratives right</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.020" end="00:31:31.220" style="s2">they&#39;ve told these stories and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.000" end="00:31:32.990" style="s2">mapped the idea of the movement practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.220" end="00:31:34.430" style="s2">towards like it&#39;s like the confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.990" end="00:31:37.670" style="s2">with the dragon in the heroic literature</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.430" end="00:31:40.520" style="s2">that was cool but then people were like</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.670" end="00:31:42.500" style="s2">what what what is it in more depth what</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.520" end="00:31:45.320" style="s2">is it that that gives you that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.500" end="00:31:46.460" style="s2">to confront the hook figure and so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.320" end="00:31:49.550" style="s2">started looking at what are the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.460" end="00:31:51.290" style="s2">different archetypes of the hero so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.550" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">started seeing that there was this</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.290" end="00:31:55.430" style="s2">combination here because we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:58.700" style="s2">for heroic archetypes at the autumn</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.430" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">retreat now that I am then I had come</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.700" end="00:32:02.090" style="s2">study them that gave me an inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:04.460" style="s2">for where we were going then I saw that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.090" end="00:32:06.740" style="s2">this was kind of a line and the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.460" end="00:32:08.210" style="s2">I I reached out to you that was because</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.740" end="00:32:09.280" style="s2">it didn&#39;t align perfectly and I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.210" end="00:32:13.460" style="s2">trying to figure out how it aligned</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.280" end="00:32:18.560" style="s2">right so I but but what we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.460" end="00:32:20.660" style="s2">doing so we started saying if we think</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.560" end="00:32:23.000" style="s2">of Horace as an archetype of vision</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.660" end="00:32:25.940" style="s2">where does vision sit in our struggle</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.000" end="00:32:29.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s like well before if we think</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.940" end="00:32:33.530" style="s2">of we think of a movement practice as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.000" end="00:32:36.620" style="s2">as a way of embodying and cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.530" end="00:32:39.920" style="s2">the capacity of the self in general to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.620" end="00:32:41.860" style="s2">address a problem right first the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.920" end="00:32:45.590" style="s2">problem that you have with a problem is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.860" end="00:32:47.210" style="s2">can you see that it&#39;s there yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.590" end="00:32:49.280" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of more like at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.210" end="00:32:51.770" style="s2">level of like relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.280" end="00:32:54.830" style="s2">Horace is often represented as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.770" end="00:32:57.260" style="s2">capacity for attention of many other</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.830" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">things as well of course and it&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.260" end="00:33:01.520" style="s2">for assistive course capable of flight</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:07.850" style="s2">which in the overview but also zooming</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.520" end="00:33:11.750" style="s2">in so yeah yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.850" end="00:33:16.400" style="s2">figures that have that role yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.750" end="00:33:21.590" style="s2">yeah the the the capacity with the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.400" end="00:33:23.540" style="s2">- - as you said to develop that honing</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.590" end="00:33:25.790" style="s2">relevance realization so you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.540" end="00:33:29.780" style="s2">insight so you see into the situation</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.790" end="00:33:31.340" style="s2">well and powerfully yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.780" end="00:33:34.309" style="s2">crucial yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.340" end="00:33:36.140" style="s2">so in in the parkour we have this</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.309" end="00:33:39.350" style="s2">problem division right and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.140" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">the thing that that that is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.350" end="00:33:42.890" style="s2">many people are facing but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:44.750" style="s2">recognised it right in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.890" end="00:33:46.730" style="s2">which is when you decide that you want</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.750" end="00:33:49.309" style="s2">to practice parkour you start looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.730" end="00:33:51.110" style="s2">around you and you can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.309" end="00:33:52.270" style="s2">necessarily things that look like what</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.110" end="00:33:56.450" style="s2">you saw in the video</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.270" end="00:33:58.580" style="s2">all right and so so over time you</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.450" end="00:34:01.400" style="s2">cultivate this ability to see how the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.580" end="00:34:04.640" style="s2">spaces around you afford you moving</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.400" end="00:34:05.950" style="s2">potentials oh I see that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.640" end="00:34:09.610" style="s2">interesting so you&#39;re doing this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.950" end="00:34:12.050" style="s2">respectable transformation where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.610" end="00:34:14.030" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.050" end="00:34:16.820" style="s2">trying to train yourself to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.030" end="00:34:18.169" style="s2">affordances that you originally can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.820" end="00:34:20.840" style="s2">pick up on that&#39;s what you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.169" end="00:34:23.810" style="s2">saying and and what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.840" end="00:34:25.669" style="s2">this too is that like I found urban</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.810" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">provision developed very quickly even</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.669" end="00:34:30.440" style="s2">though I go into the woods the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:32.929" style="s2">environment is relatively not complex</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.440" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">right you can see it&#39;s a highly</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.929" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">predictable highly predictable moving</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:42.710" style="s2">the nature is actually to this day even</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:44.450" style="s2">after you know ten years of being</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.710" end="00:34:47.360" style="s2">focused on nature eight years whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.450" end="00:34:49.610" style="s2">it is it&#39;s harder for me to see what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.360" end="00:34:53.210" style="s2">afforded by a new tree or a new set of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.610" end="00:34:55.669" style="s2">rocks than concrete obstacles I have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.210" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">go and physically embed myself in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.669" end="00:35:02.420" style="s2">environment in order to create the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:06.110" style="s2">vision to reimagine the space right</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.420" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool and so yeah so we you</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.110" end="00:35:13.070" style="s2">know there&#39;s this um I&#39;ll be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:15.230" style="s2">with a new doll loop no no you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.070" end="00:35:17.750" style="s2">to it yeah it took me to perform yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.230" end="00:35:19.550" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ll go over that again I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.750" end="00:35:21.290" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s interested me because I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.550" end="00:35:22.490" style="s2">see these these common patterns showing</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.290" end="00:35:23.420" style="s2">up and all these to replace them really</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.490" end="00:35:28.070" style="s2">interesting and how they all come</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.420" end="00:35:30.010" style="s2">together but the loop is the insight of</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.070" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">a military strategist john-boy</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.010" end="00:35:35.650" style="s2">we used the Air Force and he basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.840" style="s2">recognized like every combative</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.650" end="00:35:39.190" style="s2">situation in every come out of situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.840" end="00:35:41.619" style="s2">you face the problem of incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.190" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">information this is truth everywhere in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.619" end="00:35:45.850" style="s2">life and he even broke this down to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:48.010" style="s2">basically Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.850" end="00:35:53.550" style="s2">principle goggles incompleteness theorem</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.010" end="00:35:57.540" style="s2">and and what was the other one oh the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.550" end="00:36:00.310" style="s2">thing is the second law of entropy right</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.540" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">basically on these we we you will always</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.310" end="00:36:03.340" style="s2">have incomplete information right as</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:05.470" style="s2">soon as the information gets to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.340" end="00:36:08.290" style="s2">already decrypted its model says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.470" end="00:36:09.490" style="s2">already degraded you know and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.290" end="00:36:14.470" style="s2">see everything from within whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.490" end="00:36:17.080" style="s2">frame you adopt so so but the big thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.470" end="00:36:18.520" style="s2">was that in order to continuously solve</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.080" end="00:36:20.650" style="s2">problems first you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.520" end="00:36:23.140" style="s2">observe accurately what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.650" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">vision second you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.140" end="00:36:27.520" style="s2">orient effectively to it a problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">formulation then you have to make clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.520" end="00:36:32.920" style="s2">decisions and act so whether we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:35.890" style="s2">to side act interestingly within the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.920" end="00:36:38.470" style="s2">parkour community we evolved essentially</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.890" end="00:36:41.380" style="s2">a similar sequence which we call feeling</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.470" end="00:36:45.010" style="s2">the call of the jump so you observe that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.380" end="00:36:47.350" style="s2">a jump is possible you then assess the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.010" end="00:36:48.820" style="s2">jump and then either before or after</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.350" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">assessment depending on the gentleman</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.820" end="00:36:53.260" style="s2">you begin to feel fear mmm and then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:56.040" style="s2">have a process that allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.260" end="00:36:59.410" style="s2">overcome fear which is generally</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.040" end="00:37:01.660" style="s2">visualization breathing shaking some</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.410" end="00:37:03.100" style="s2">sort of ritualized behavior that allows</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.660" end="00:37:07.240" style="s2">you to shift out of that fear state</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.100" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">everybody you act and so if Emily you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.240" end="00:37:13.690" style="s2">could say well the first thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">observation right and then essentially</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.690" end="00:37:18.700" style="s2">all the rest is like how you overcome</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.140" style="s2">the problem and get to the signal okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.700" end="00:37:23.290" style="s2">find that really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.140" end="00:37:26.410" style="s2">and then like there&#39;s almost a problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.290" end="00:37:27.880" style="s2">before that which is how to see the per</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.410" end="00:37:29.050" style="s2">call of the jumps that could call to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.880" end="00:37:31.420" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.050" end="00:37:34.119" style="s2">it&#39;s going to say yeah and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.420" end="00:37:37.660" style="s2">this is where we&#39;re the archetype of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.119" end="00:37:40.390" style="s2">vision is right and then yes the next</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.660" end="00:37:43.290" style="s2">would be like understanding the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.390" end="00:37:45.270" style="s2">right like I can see that this jump</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.290" end="00:37:46.590" style="s2">this calls to me but how would it be</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.270" end="00:37:48.810" style="s2">done right right</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.590" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">and there&#39;s the skillfulness to over to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.810" end="00:37:52.620" style="s2">actually do it and then it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how perfect a jump you</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.620" end="00:37:56.130" style="s2">have if the jump is just way too large</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.510" end="00:37:58.710" style="s2">either the legs can&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.130" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">you just don&#39;t happen but the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.710" end="00:38:03.390" style="s2">is you&#39;re you know you can see it you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:04.950" style="s2">understand what needs to be done you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.390" end="00:38:08.370" style="s2">have the skill to know how to do it you</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.950" end="00:38:10.140" style="s2">have the physical capacity to do it can</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.370" end="00:38:13.230" style="s2">you psycho-emotional regulate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.140" end="00:38:14.940" style="s2">to be able right but and so on</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.230" end="00:38:18.660" style="s2">interestingly we had talked about for</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.940" end="00:38:22.860" style="s2">heroic archetypes at at the retreat as</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.660" end="00:38:27.690" style="s2">horace of his vision socrates was logos</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.860" end="00:38:30.020" style="s2">and then lou celtic hero celtic god was</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.690" end="00:38:33.810" style="s2">the embodiment of skillfulness right but</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.020" end="00:38:38.250" style="s2">no in an irish mythology and what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.810" end="00:38:40.170" style="s2">the book of the invasions Luke is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.250" end="00:38:42.060" style="s2">sort of a young hero up-and-coming he</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.170" end="00:38:44.310" style="s2">goes to taro which is the capital of</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.060" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">that of the toy and he asked for</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.310" end="00:38:48.360" style="s2">entrance and they asked him well in</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.850" style="s2">order to come in here you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.360" end="00:38:52.710" style="s2">really good at something and so he</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.850" end="00:38:54.510" style="s2">starts listing off his skills and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.710" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">lifts off all of the skills that were</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.510" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">like pertinent in early medieval Ireland</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:00.510" style="s2">and they keep telling him oh we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:03.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a carpenter we&#39;ve got a Smith</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.510" end="00:39:05.370" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a soldier you got a soothsayer</p>

<p begin="00:39:05.370" end="00:39:09.060" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a chess player or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.250" end="00:39:12.210" style="s2">at the end of it he says do you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.060" end="00:39:16.710" style="s2">anyone who can do all of these oh no you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.210" end="00:39:18.150" style="s2">can come in and they&#39;re like to lead the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.710" end="00:39:19.530" style="s2">battle and then he confronts what turns</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:28.790" style="s2">our idea of skillfulness and then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.830" end="00:39:32.130" style="s2">talked about Christ as a figure of Agape</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.790" end="00:39:34.530" style="s2">and and so initially I was like this</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.130" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">Christ map to this emotional regulation</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.530" end="00:39:42.150" style="s2">piece right and it didn&#39;t feel quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:44.250" style="s2">right well I have something to say about</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.150" end="00:39:46.470" style="s2">that if you want to hear it now can I</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.250" end="00:39:50.190" style="s2">finish what I&#39;m saying I really might uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.470" end="00:39:51.980" style="s2">but what what what occurred to me is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.190" end="00:39:55.770" style="s2">actually if you take this set of heroic</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.980" end="00:39:56.990" style="s2">capacities you can have all of them then</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.770" end="00:39:59.940" style="s2">you can be evil</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.990" end="00:40:02.220" style="s2">mmm-hmm if you&#39;re oriented to do the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.940" end="00:40:03.960" style="s2">wrong things than being able to see to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.220" end="00:40:06.779" style="s2">see a problem understand the problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.960" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">effectively solve the problem have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.779" end="00:40:09.660" style="s2">strength to do that and have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:11.369" style="s2">emotional regulation to do it can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.660" end="00:40:14.519" style="s2">applied to the most horrific horrific</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.369" end="00:40:16.200" style="s2">things I mean but then the idea was that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.519" end="00:40:17.970" style="s2">you know essentially what we came up</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.200" end="00:40:19.829" style="s2">with was you know Socrates is actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.970" end="00:40:21.269" style="s2">kind of a combination figure for us he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.829" end="00:40:23.579" style="s2">the emotional regulation and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.269" end="00:40:25.740" style="s2">understanding Horace&#39;s vision Luke is</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.579" end="00:40:27.509" style="s2">coordination skill you could use</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.740" end="00:40:29.400" style="s2">Hercules or Thor as representations of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.509" end="00:40:31.500" style="s2">strength and obviously you know heroes</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.400" end="00:40:33.599" style="s2">contain different elements but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.500" end="00:40:36.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the story that we can tell to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.599" end="00:40:38.039" style="s2">contain this insight for people and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.119" end="00:40:43.349" style="s2">at the highest end it&#39;s like if this</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.039" end="00:40:45.329" style="s2">isn&#39;t in service of Agape then then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.349" end="00:40:48.420" style="s2">not ultimately leading us towards heroic</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.329" end="00:40:50.099" style="s2">character good night you know for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.420" end="00:40:52.410" style="s2">audience this isn&#39;t me telling them that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.099" end="00:40:54.299" style="s2">they need to go join the church and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.410" end="00:40:58.049" style="s2">become you know about Christians I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.299" end="00:40:59.609" style="s2">I&#39;m non-theist as you are but I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.049" end="00:41:01.049" style="s2">this is true and I also think that like</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.609" end="00:41:02.130" style="s2">Metta meditation which we learned</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.049" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">earlier which we talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.130" end="00:41:07.380" style="s2">it&#39;s actually one of the powerful</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:09.809" style="s2">pathways to to cultivating this specific</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.380" end="00:41:11.130" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s this map that I created</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.809" end="00:41:12.809" style="s2">this is what I wanted to share with you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.130" end="00:41:14.549" style="s2">and get you thought that money oh I like</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.809" end="00:41:16.289" style="s2">that I like that I like that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.549" end="00:41:18.329" style="s2">basically anticipated what I was going</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.289" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">to say so that&#39;s good I was going to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.329" end="00:41:23.460" style="s2">that you know agape sort of bleeds</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">between you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.460" end="00:41:26.789" style="s2">soft force and first of all what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.230" style="s2">want with sever your self-regulation you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.789" end="00:41:30.329" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to be in cranek you want</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.230" end="00:41:32.279" style="s2">it to be soft force on it right you you</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.329" end="00:41:33.450" style="s2">and and the way I describe that if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.279" end="00:41:35.700" style="s2">want to come to a place where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.450" end="00:41:37.109" style="s2">tempted by the good right that your</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.700" end="00:41:38.369" style="s2">salience landscape is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.109" end="00:41:40.980" style="s2">tempting you to work is the good and</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.369" end="00:41:45.480" style="s2">then and then Paul presents agape as</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.980" end="00:41:46.680" style="s2">exactly the transform st. Paul is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.480" end="00:41:48.809" style="s2">best form of software so because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.680" end="00:41:51.269" style="s2">constantly being tempted towards the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.809" end="00:41:53.970" style="s2">good of trying to create as much meaning</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.269" end="00:41:56.460" style="s2">and as many meaning makers as we</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.970" end="00:41:58.529" style="s2">possibly can and so that&#39;s how exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.460" end="00:41:59.579" style="s2">yeah I think you you articulated what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.529" end="00:42:01.650" style="s2">was gonna say quite well actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.579" end="00:42:03.180" style="s2">beautiful yeah I love that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.650" end="00:42:05.609" style="s2">softer sin there you have been tempted</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.180" end="00:42:08.130" style="s2">to the good and I was thinking about him</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.609" end="00:42:10.080" style="s2">we actually thought it was interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.130" end="00:42:12.840" style="s2">in line with like flow</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.080" end="00:42:14.070" style="s2">the idea yes it is I mean you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.840" end="00:42:15.840" style="s2">a lot about this Sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.070" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">transcendent and sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.840" end="00:42:19.830" style="s2">transformation and but you&#39;re right you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:22.230" style="s2">have to have something that organizes it</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.830" end="00:42:23.880" style="s2">all together in that aspiration yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.230" end="00:42:26.010" style="s2">what are we aspiring to well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.880" end="00:42:28.140" style="s2">altima aspiring to meaning making and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.010" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">the cultivation of meaning makers that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.140" end="00:42:31.860" style="s2">what we&#39;re altima this is how this whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:33.450" style="s2">thing right right</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.860" end="00:42:35.070" style="s2">grounds itself because there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.450" end="00:42:40.830" style="s2">else beyond that that&#39;s grounding it</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.070" end="00:42:42.930" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s like--that&#39;s logos the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.830" end="00:42:45.300" style="s2">thing that yeah way that we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.930" end="00:42:47.190" style="s2">articulate and give rise to order and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.300" end="00:42:49.890" style="s2">agape which guides us towards order that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.190" end="00:42:51.780" style="s2">is actually to the good against you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.890" end="00:42:55.350" style="s2">that faith that everyone we interact</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.780" end="00:42:57.960" style="s2">with has the capacity to come into an</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.350" end="00:43:01.020" style="s2">order that is better yes I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.960" end="00:43:08.010" style="s2">well said and and and if we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.020" end="00:43:09.960" style="s2">if if if if we were not already grounded</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.010" end="00:43:13.320" style="s2">in logos and agape we couldn&#39;t do any of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.960" end="00:43:16.590" style="s2">this in any ways part of you know part</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.320" end="00:43:18.660" style="s2">of the ancient notion of pride or hubris</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.590" end="00:43:22.080" style="s2">as a sin is a refusal to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.660" end="00:43:23.970" style="s2">that we are already beholding to logos</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.080" end="00:43:27.510" style="s2">and agaves and we should acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.970" end="00:43:29.640" style="s2">that and then put ourselves right</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.510" end="00:43:32.760" style="s2">into a participatory relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.640" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">it rather than pretending that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.760" end="00:43:37.380" style="s2">need logo Sena got that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:44.670" style="s2">that&#39;s fundamentally important so one</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.380" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">one thing that occurs to me I have but</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.670" end="00:43:50.750" style="s2">he talks about the aspect of the heroic</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:54.360" style="s2">the heroic person and he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.750" end="00:43:56.520" style="s2">the logos right and that&#39;s represented</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.360" end="00:44:00.120" style="s2">by the mouth and the tongue right vision</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.520" end="00:44:04.140" style="s2">is represented by the eyes and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.120" end="00:44:06.960" style="s2">about those as you know if you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.140" end="00:44:08.190" style="s2">homunculus of the body this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:11.070" style="s2">most represented the other thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.190" end="00:44:13.110" style="s2">hand understanding the hand grasping</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.070" end="00:44:15.900" style="s2">yeah but for me that&#39;s the body too</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.110" end="00:44:17.460" style="s2">right yes very much very much yes and</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.900" end="00:44:19.770" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see is missing so often</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.460" end="00:44:22.980" style="s2">these conversations about meaning is how</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.770" end="00:44:23.850" style="s2">it gets grounded in the body oh you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.980" end="00:44:26.010" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.850" end="00:44:28.140" style="s2">emphasize the contact epistemology so</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.010" end="00:44:30.840" style="s2">much because the contact epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.140" end="00:44:32.760" style="s2">reminds us about the embodied embedded</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.840" end="00:44:35.000" style="s2">map as well as opposed to the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.760" end="00:44:37.350" style="s2">sort of spectating yak toriel</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.000" end="00:44:38.250" style="s2">epistemology I&#39;m not sure how to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.350" end="00:44:42.150" style="s2">you about this we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.250" end="00:44:45.810" style="s2">nature like how does natural movement</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.150" end="00:44:50.070" style="s2">Natural Park or Chi create connection</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.810" end="00:44:55.560" style="s2">with nature and and Peterson has this</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.070" end="00:44:58.200" style="s2">analogy of of resolution right imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.560" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">that you have high pixels or low pixels</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.200" end="00:45:03.870" style="s2">right like the morphix elated your thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.200" end="00:45:06.510" style="s2">is and since some the more meaning you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.870" end="00:45:09.000" style="s2">have extracted from I&#39;m singing like</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.510" end="00:45:12.030" style="s2">imagine the experience of a tree right</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.000" end="00:45:13.170" style="s2">you have me showing you the picture of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.030" end="00:45:16.290" style="s2">the tree and you can say oh that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.170" end="00:45:19.020" style="s2">beautiful tree right I I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.290" end="00:45:21.600" style="s2">see that truth walking through the park</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.020" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">and see that tree and that would be more</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.600" end="00:45:25.410" style="s2">meaningful it would be more real having</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:29.490" style="s2">had that experience participated in</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.410" end="00:45:32.490" style="s2">being near the tree doing more real but</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.490" end="00:45:34.710" style="s2">when you move in the tree when you map</p>

<p begin="00:45:34.710" end="00:45:39.090" style="s2">affords your body moving from space to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.690" end="00:45:42.150" style="s2">space this creates a layer of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.090" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">that has greater depth and you can go in</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.150" end="00:45:46.650" style="s2">another even more but it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:48.900" style="s2">know what animals live that what yep</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.650" end="00:45:51.480" style="s2">that proposed you know how it&#39;s used you</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.900" end="00:45:53.850" style="s2">know what kind of timber it makes but</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.480" end="00:45:57.330" style="s2">all of these things are are built up</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.850" end="00:46:01.800" style="s2">into meaning and it&#39;s like it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.330" end="00:46:03.900" style="s2">we we have become divorced from this</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.800" end="00:46:05.610" style="s2">incredible world of meaning that exists</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.900" end="00:46:08.370" style="s2">all around us that were simply blind to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.610" end="00:46:11.430" style="s2">yes I agree that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.370" end="00:46:14.040" style="s2">to articulate this notion of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.430" end="00:46:17.160" style="s2">as a deep kind of connectedness to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.040" end="00:46:18.990" style="s2">inexhaustible as opposed to older models</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.160" end="00:46:21.810" style="s2">of completion and perfection which</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.990" end="00:46:23.910" style="s2">tended to be very static and tended to</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.810" end="00:46:28.890" style="s2">give us the idea that there was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.910" end="00:46:30.750" style="s2">a a final state that we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.890" end="00:46:32.670" style="s2">get to an achieved but if we can I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.750" end="00:46:34.110" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing if you&#39;ll allow me is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.670" end="00:46:37.430" style="s2">I think you&#39;re trying to re articulate</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.110" end="00:46:39.410" style="s2">this notion of sacredness as this</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.430" end="00:46:41.240" style="s2">right there&#39;s this fount of just more</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.410" end="00:46:43.100" style="s2">and more intelligibility more and more</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.240" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">meaning more and more connectedness what</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.100" end="00:46:46.070" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is of course not just</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:47.900" style="s2">intellectual connectiveness it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.070" end="00:46:50.240" style="s2">embodied in embedded connectedness and</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.900" end="00:46:52.820" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly it they&#39;re like can we</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.240" end="00:46:57.890" style="s2">get back to right</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.820" end="00:47:00.770" style="s2">that sense of that are our ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.890" end="00:47:01.250" style="s2">capacity to evolve our connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.770" end="00:47:03.110" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.250" end="00:47:06.440" style="s2">can be coupled to the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.110" end="00:47:08.930" style="s2">world can continually generate new</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.440" end="00:47:10.940" style="s2">connections for us it&#39;s inexhaustible in</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.930" end="00:47:12.950" style="s2">that way and to understand sacredness in</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.940" end="00:47:15.290" style="s2">that fashion that&#39;s that&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.950" end="00:47:20.510" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to articulate that idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.290" end="00:47:22.130" style="s2">I see what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.510" end="00:47:25.100" style="s2">nature and I don&#39;t mean in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.130" end="00:47:26.810" style="s2">you know you know pantheistic paganism</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.100" end="00:47:29.450" style="s2">or something like that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.810" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">reintroduce nature as something that can</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.450" end="00:47:35.600" style="s2">be experienced as sacred as a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:38.030" style="s2">experience for people and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.600" end="00:47:41.780" style="s2">very important and and the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.030" end="00:47:44.330" style="s2">see it it doesn&#39;t involve people having</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.780" end="00:47:46.040" style="s2">to sort of commit to a Creed it has to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.330" end="00:47:47.600" style="s2">involves them committing to a code of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.040" end="00:47:48.770" style="s2">conduct well because if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.600" end="00:47:51.770" style="s2">commit to a code of conduct they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.770" end="00:47:54.080" style="s2">gonna hurt themselves right but but but</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.770" end="00:47:56.750" style="s2">but it involves it involves a different</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.080" end="00:47:59.390" style="s2">way it involves a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.750" end="00:48:01.970" style="s2">getting people to we inhabit sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.390" end="00:48:04.220" style="s2">as opposed to just argue about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.970" end="00:48:06.050" style="s2">propositions that have been referring to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.220" end="00:48:06.500" style="s2">sacredness does that make any sense what</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.050" end="00:48:08.180" style="s2">I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.500" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">when I&#39;m trying to articulate yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.180" end="00:48:11.870" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:14.270" style="s2">interesting I mean so my old business</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.870" end="00:48:15.320" style="s2">partner Tyson when we started our</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.270" end="00:48:18.230" style="s2">parkour gym together</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.320" end="00:48:20.020" style="s2">he um he always joked that we should</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.230" end="00:48:23.170" style="s2">just turn parkour into a church right</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.020" end="00:48:25.250" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.170" end="00:48:26.360" style="s2">but now like people will be like well</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.250" end="00:48:27.320" style="s2">what are you creating you&#39;re creating a</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.360" end="00:48:30.260" style="s2">religion um</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.320" end="00:48:33.320" style="s2">and I was like well no not a credo but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.260" end="00:48:35.000" style="s2">to help people connection religio well</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.320" end="00:48:36.740" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.000" end="00:48:37.720" style="s2">why making that distinction I think is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.740" end="00:48:41.000" style="s2">really important</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.720" end="00:48:43.580" style="s2">and and you know and you you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.000" end="00:48:45.580" style="s2">a very complex myth thought mythos right</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.580" end="00:48:49.100" style="s2">we&#39;re even talking about using</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.580" end="00:48:51.320" style="s2">mythological figures in order to afford</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.100" end="00:48:53.750" style="s2">people coming into a more to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.320" end="00:48:56.000" style="s2">participatory awareness of eligio and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.750" end="00:48:59.090" style="s2">how if they enhance that connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.000" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">they get this experience of it being</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.090" end="00:49:04.810" style="s2">intrinsically meaningful but again in</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:09.380" style="s2">put it in this in this sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.810" end="00:49:10.760" style="s2">it&#39;s III become sort of as you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.380" end="00:49:12.260" style="s2">become hesitant with the word meaning</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.760" end="00:49:14.120" style="s2">because it sounds so subjective and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.260" end="00:49:15.530" style="s2">really want to that&#39;s why I like what</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.120" end="00:49:18.230" style="s2">you&#39;ve been saying this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.530" end="00:49:19.820" style="s2">increasing connectedness and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.230" end="00:49:21.410" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get it it&#39;s the kid and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.820" end="00:49:23.420" style="s2">even though we&#39;re connectedness sound</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.410" end="00:49:25.910" style="s2">static and fixed and but I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.420" end="00:49:27.590" style="s2">it&#39;s more this ongoing mutually</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.910" end="00:49:30.290" style="s2">accelerating disclosure that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.590" end="00:49:32.630" style="s2">more much more like love than it is by</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.290" end="00:49:34.370" style="s2">making a statement yeah you help me</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.630" end="00:49:36.500" style="s2">you&#39;re helping people you have that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.370" end="00:49:37.850" style="s2">right and I don&#39;t mean this romantically</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.500" end="00:49:39.470" style="s2">man we&#39;ve trivialize the word with</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.850" end="00:49:41.690" style="s2">remittances but you&#39;re helping people to</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.470" end="00:49:43.220" style="s2">fall in love with sort of the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.690" end="00:49:45.590" style="s2">connect through the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.220" end="00:49:46.970" style="s2">connectedness that they can find in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.590" end="00:49:49.100" style="s2">natural world they&#39;re they&#39;re falling</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.970" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">back in love with being and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.100" end="00:49:53.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the ultimate way in which we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:55.220" style="s2">to respond to nihilism we can argue and</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.570" end="00:49:56.990" style="s2">we can make philosophical propositions</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.220" end="00:49:59.720" style="s2">but people have to learn how to deeply</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.990" end="00:50:01.670" style="s2">fall back in love with reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.720" end="00:50:04.130" style="s2">what they need and again and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.670" end="00:50:06.290" style="s2">don&#39;t mean this romantically I I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.130" end="00:50:11.540" style="s2">this in in the sense of a sacred kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.290" end="00:50:15.620" style="s2">love it ironically ya know that really</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.540" end="00:50:18.020" style="s2">that like you know that struck home for</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.620" end="00:50:19.760" style="s2">me right like especially because going</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.020" end="00:50:22.610" style="s2">back to the idea that agape is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.760" end="00:50:26.900" style="s2">principle that yes highest access to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.610" end="00:50:30.620" style="s2">good right yes it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.900" end="00:50:32.930" style="s2">like the idea that that the proper</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.620" end="00:50:36.700" style="s2">practice is a practice that bring that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.930" end="00:50:39.380" style="s2">that continually helps you fall in love</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.700" end="00:50:43.480" style="s2">with all of the most important things in</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.380" end="00:50:45.770" style="s2">life yes yes yes that that seems</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.480" end="00:50:48.230" style="s2">extraordinarily powerful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.770" end="00:50:51.290" style="s2">interesting one of the you know let me</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.230" end="00:50:54.620" style="s2">just I want to let that one sink in</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.290" end="00:50:56.990" style="s2">because so after one of my seminars one</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.620" end="00:51:00.980" style="s2">of the students said to me that it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.990" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">it was like having gone for a walk on</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.980" end="00:51:04.360" style="s2">the beach for years and years and years</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:09.220" style="s2">and I&#39;m getting to go surfing</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.360" end="00:51:12.100" style="s2">first time mmm and how the the beach now</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.220" end="00:51:15.850" style="s2">suddenly became so much more me like</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.100" end="00:51:18.220" style="s2">yeah you form a literal way like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.850" end="00:51:20.590" style="s2">know these things about the waves</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.220" end="00:51:22.780" style="s2">that&#39;s propositional but not only do I</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.590" end="00:51:25.120" style="s2">know these things about the waves I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.780" end="00:51:27.670" style="s2">felt what it is to be in those waves I</p>

<p begin="00:51:32.370" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">when when a wave behaves this way yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.770" end="00:51:43.350" style="s2">yes afforded me this thing yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:46.780" style="s2">know then also what that experience is</p>

<p begin="00:52:14.740" end="00:52:20.020" style="s2">men men and then perspectival gives you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.560" end="00:52:22.390" style="s2">roles and I wasn&#39;t wait what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.020" end="00:52:25.360" style="s2">after that but and then it finally came</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.390" end="00:52:27.720" style="s2">together it for me it was like mothers</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.360" end="00:52:34.390" style="s2">should feed their children when they cry</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.720" end="00:52:38.020" style="s2">is is a proposition right knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.390" end="00:52:41.620" style="s2">warm up the milk and put it in the in</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.020" end="00:52:44.050" style="s2">the in the model that&#39;s a procedure</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.620" end="00:52:45.550" style="s2">right right you could understand the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.050" end="00:52:47.110" style="s2">proposition not on how to actually feed</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.550" end="00:52:51.820" style="s2">the baby that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.110" end="00:52:54.970" style="s2">and then a baby crying is a salience</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.820" end="00:52:57.550" style="s2">landscape that becomes especially</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.970" end="00:53:01.390" style="s2">meaningful to anyone who has had a baby</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.550" end="00:53:03.070" style="s2">or they had a baby right and that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.390" end="00:53:05.710" style="s2">is it that is an experience that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.070" end="00:53:08.530" style="s2">shared right that perspective is true of</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.710" end="00:53:12.010" style="s2">all the all the class of mothers but</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.530" end="00:53:15.130" style="s2">what that meant to that individual woman</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.010" end="00:53:17.790" style="s2">at that time is the participatory right</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.130" end="00:53:19.770" style="s2">I actually identify the way she</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.790" end="00:53:22.770" style="s2">changes our identity so she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.770" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">identifying with the child that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.770" end="00:53:29.820" style="s2">the participant every right yep well she</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:31.890" style="s2">her her process of being and the child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.820" end="00:53:33.900" style="s2">process of being become deeply coupled</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.890" end="00:53:35.640" style="s2">and interpenetrating so her knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.900" end="00:53:38.430" style="s2">herself and her knowing of her child are</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.640" end="00:53:40.290" style="s2">not distinguishable from each other they</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.430" end="00:53:44.370" style="s2">mutually interpenetrate and afford each</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.290" end="00:53:47.250" style="s2">other yeah so then to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.370" end="00:53:49.140" style="s2">practice the movement practice right to</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.250" end="00:53:51.180" style="s2">do a jumper revolt or something I can</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.140" end="00:53:53.010" style="s2">tell you in this situation this is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.180" end="00:53:54.920" style="s2">appropriate jump revolt or swing or</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.010" end="00:53:59.340" style="s2">whatever to do that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.920" end="00:54:01.620" style="s2">propositional right knowing in your body</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.340" end="00:54:04.110" style="s2">having the skill to do it is procedure</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.620" end="00:54:06.840" style="s2">procedure right being able to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.110" end="00:54:08.460" style="s2">it within a given base is perspective</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.840" end="00:54:11.370" style="s2">situational awareness that&#39;s respect</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.460" end="00:54:14.370" style="s2">idle yeah but then the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.370" end="00:54:16.140" style="s2">transforms you is the participatory and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.370" end="00:54:18.780" style="s2">let&#39;s we seem afraid and that goes back</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.140" end="00:54:20.850" style="s2">to that underneath and grounding this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.780" end="00:54:23.970" style="s2">your aspiration to your hill role acute</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.850" end="00:54:26.040" style="s2">yourself and you knowing and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.970" end="00:54:28.770" style="s2">because it&#39;s a Socratic self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.040" end="00:54:31.620" style="s2">that that future self is bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.770" end="00:54:34.290" style="s2">you knowing and getting access to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.620" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">depths of the world that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.290" end="00:54:38.190" style="s2">about the depths of you and the depths</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:39.450" style="s2">of the world your knowing of your depths</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.190" end="00:54:41.370" style="s2">and your knowing of the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.450" end="00:54:43.350" style="s2">world are like the mother and the child</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.370" end="00:54:45.000" style="s2">being identified with each other they</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.350" end="00:54:48.750" style="s2">are mutually inter penetrating and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.000" end="00:54:51.300" style="s2">mutually affording yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.750" end="00:54:52.680" style="s2">beautiful so another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.300" end="00:54:57.030" style="s2">occurred to me with the symmetries</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.680" end="00:54:59.310" style="s2">interesting is a while ago I read this</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.030" end="00:55:03.210" style="s2">essay on Jitsu versus Dao we talked</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.310" end="00:55:05.910" style="s2">about this not to me I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.210" end="00:55:09.390" style="s2">the idea was simply that traditionally a</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.910" end="00:55:14.520" style="s2">many martial arts started as essentially</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.390" end="00:55:18.510" style="s2">like trade skills right and you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.520" end="00:55:19.920" style="s2">you know IQ jutsu was was a trade skill</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.510" end="00:55:22.050" style="s2">for someone who had to use a sword in</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.920" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">battle that&#39;s what it meant it meant</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.050" end="00:55:27.180" style="s2">when procedurally when my life is on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:31.970" style="s2">line I can use this thing to try and</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.180" end="00:55:31.970" style="s2">save myself however</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.980" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">there was a point at which and this</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.150" end="00:55:40.310" style="s2">happened in different ways people</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:41.950" style="s2">recognized that the process of of going</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.310" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">through the procedure that Jitsu</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.950" end="00:55:46.340" style="s2">afforded a dough and the dough is a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:49.610" style="s2">I know</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.340" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">dough in Japanese is Dow in Chinese see</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.610" end="00:55:53.540" style="s2">right there</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:56.330" style="s2">and so I catch it soon becomes Aikido</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.540" end="00:55:57.740" style="s2">right and you see the same thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.330" end="00:55:59.840" style="s2">internal martial arts you know you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.740" end="00:56:03.320" style="s2">Tai Chi Chuan practitioner right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.840" end="00:56:04.460" style="s2">you practice things because you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.320" end="00:56:06.230" style="s2">their martial skills</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.460" end="00:56:11.660" style="s2">that&#39;s only one layer of the practice</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.230" end="00:56:13.970" style="s2">and if raid1 and ba gua ing are armed</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.660" end="00:56:15.950" style="s2">Taoist arts right they&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.970" end="00:56:18.020" style="s2">connected with this whole ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.950" end="00:56:20.420" style="s2">practices of specific meditations and</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.020" end="00:56:22.790" style="s2">body and parent practices all the Chi</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.420" end="00:56:25.580" style="s2">kung young you know traditional</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.790" end="00:56:28.460" style="s2">medicines yeah all of that was was sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.580" end="00:56:32.450" style="s2">of part of this this this world and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.460" end="00:56:37.820" style="s2">what I recognized when I read that was</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.450" end="00:56:40.490" style="s2">that parkour in its its initial</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.820" end="00:56:44.210" style="s2">development was actually dough oriented</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.490" end="00:56:47.930" style="s2">and that the dough was not sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.210" end="00:56:50.870" style="s2">articulated well oh I say world so all</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.930" end="00:56:52.490" style="s2">we saw was the Jitsu so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.870" end="00:56:55.070" style="s2">something in vaulting and doing these</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.490" end="00:56:57.530" style="s2">things but we didn&#39;t see was that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.070" end="00:57:00.020" style="s2">young men who started this they were</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.530" end="00:57:03.880" style="s2">immigrant you know mixed-race kids</p>

<p begin="00:57:05.810" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">them having trouble in school they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.790" end="00:57:11.900" style="s2">you know they would do that they could</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.160" end="00:57:13.310" style="s2">have gotten involved in gangs and lots</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.430" end="00:57:24.410" style="s2">aspirational way strong men and that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.800" end="00:57:26.600" style="s2">the purpose of purpose yeah yeah how do</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.410" end="00:57:30.050" style="s2">I test myself and become this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.600" end="00:57:33.260" style="s2">I&#39;m that I want to be the there was you</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.050" end="00:57:35.060" style="s2">know 912 founders of parkour and at a</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.260" end="00:57:37.970" style="s2">certain point David Bell who&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.060" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">famous split with the rest over a circus</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.970" end="00:57:42.950" style="s2">performance but the rest of them then</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:45.359" style="s2">adopted a name for themselves comb which</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.950" end="00:57:47.130" style="s2">is Yama Kazi which is a long haul</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.359" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">which is West African language which</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.130" end="00:57:52.769" style="s2">means strong man strong mind strong</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:55.019" style="s2">spirit strong spiritual body strong we</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.769" end="00:57:57.809" style="s2">had something like that an idea you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.019" end="00:58:00.299" style="s2">see the aspiration the first I let this</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.809" end="00:58:02.459" style="s2">is the transformation of the self right</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.299" end="00:58:04.259" style="s2">very much and so it feels like in many</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.459" end="00:58:07.759" style="s2">ways what I have been creating with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.259" end="00:58:13.380" style="s2">vault is play it is a return to the DAO</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.759" end="00:58:14.609" style="s2">right yes I agree with that and and this</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.380" end="00:58:17.670" style="s2">came up for me because I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.609" end="00:58:21.119" style="s2">about that idea you had of the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.670" end="00:58:25.259" style="s2">sacredness as the inexhaustible mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.119" end="00:58:26.969" style="s2">and like even when I hate fishing when I</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.259" end="00:58:29.160" style="s2">started telling people the Dragons story</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.969" end="00:58:31.650" style="s2">and connecting it to the idea of the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.160" end="00:58:34.650" style="s2">pursuit of the heroic self I always like</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.650" end="00:58:36.089" style="s2">to caveat it by saying but always</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.650" end="00:58:39.479" style="s2">remember the DAO that can be spoken is</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.089" end="00:58:41.489" style="s2">not the internal demo okay right what I</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.479" end="00:58:45.440" style="s2">can reveal to you about the orientation</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.489" end="00:58:47.579" style="s2">of your practice never will will be</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.440" end="00:58:50.009" style="s2">sufficient to contain all of what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.579" end="00:58:54.690" style="s2">practices or can mean to you so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.009" end="00:58:56.459" style="s2">get too attached to it and now I feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.690" end="00:58:57.390" style="s2">like I&#39;m kind of tangentially running in</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.459" end="00:58:59.489" style="s2">many different directions because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.390" end="00:59:02.670" style="s2">you see the squad around and the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.489" end="00:59:07.769" style="s2">that you were describing that that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.670" end="00:59:10.440" style="s2">um the way in which being is sort of is</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.769" end="00:59:13.319" style="s2">both an exhaustible and and withdrawing</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.440" end="00:59:16.249" style="s2">from you and also get or signing in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.319" end="00:59:18.900" style="s2">yeah at the same time that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.249" end="00:59:21.180" style="s2">relationship with being and being able</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.900" end="00:59:23.880" style="s2">to to come more and more into that</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.180" end="00:59:25.289" style="s2">relationship with being is maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.880" end="00:59:30.499" style="s2">orientation of the practice and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.289" end="00:59:33.059" style="s2">why the idea of movement practice as Dao</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.499" end="00:59:35.699" style="s2">came through for me as something that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.059" end="00:59:40.190" style="s2">needed to share with you I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.699" end="00:59:43.729" style="s2">excellent I mean it might be then that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.190" end="00:59:46.680" style="s2">that there&#39;s a higher-order connection</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.729" end="00:59:50.489" style="s2">going on here because I think what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.680" end="00:59:52.739" style="s2">just articulated was excellent but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.489" end="00:59:54.719" style="s2">as you know I brought that language up</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.739" end="00:59:56.699" style="s2">to trying to talk a bit about Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.719" end="00:59:58.229" style="s2">and also the kind of stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.699" end="00:59:58.950" style="s2">happening in the circling practice which</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.229" end="01:00:00.810" style="s2">is this</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.950" end="01:00:02.490" style="s2">your personal dialogue dialogical</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.810" end="01:00:04.589" style="s2">practice and yet there seems to be this</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.490" end="01:00:06.150" style="s2">higher-order point of convergence I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.589" end="01:00:07.710" style="s2">not trying to do I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.150" end="01:00:09.480" style="s2">collapse everything I&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.710" end="01:00:11.250" style="s2">like a small world network there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.480" end="01:00:12.900" style="s2">high reporting convergence that they can</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.250" end="01:00:14.730" style="s2">all talk to each other out and then they</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.900" end="01:00:16.680" style="s2">write I&#39;m get the compression you get</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.730" end="01:00:18.089" style="s2">the compression to what a share and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.680" end="01:00:19.980" style="s2">you get the variation out into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.089" end="01:00:21.990" style="s2">specific practices yeah I&#39;m gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.980" end="01:00:26.400" style="s2">to take a quick break my daughter&#39;s okay</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.650" end="01:01:56.369" style="s2">example of the kind of stuff I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.300" end="01:01:58.710" style="s2">about how it&#39;s been concretize dand</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.369" end="01:02:00.329" style="s2">developed but and how its evolving I</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.710" end="01:02:04.380" style="s2">just wanted to say that because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:02:14.920" end="01:02:19.890" style="s2">the meaning thing in a way that you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.990" end="01:02:23.320" style="s2">still had a huge influence in grammar</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.890" end="01:02:25.690" style="s2">running into your work has given this</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.320" end="01:02:28.119" style="s2">wonderful set of tools I was telling you</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.690" end="01:02:31.359" style="s2">before but I i sat down and started like</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.119" end="01:02:33.580" style="s2">writing absolutely your keys I could</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.359" end="01:02:36.220" style="s2">make you organize where I&#39;m using them</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.580" end="01:02:38.070" style="s2">and how that&#39;s how those those those</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.220" end="01:02:42.670" style="s2">threads and my experience with parkour</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.070" end="01:02:44.920" style="s2">absolutely a research you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.670" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">flow there&#39;s some others so many in</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.920" end="01:02:50.140" style="s2">there but like you know you hold a very</p>

<p begin="01:02:50.140" end="01:02:53.109" style="s2">influences that are giving me the</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.910" end="01:02:55.119" style="s2">insights to create what we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.109" end="01:02:56.349" style="s2">and and also that the example that</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.119" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve given and your friendship has</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.349" end="01:03:00.130" style="s2">been extraordinary</p>

<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:16.030" style="s2">dodge it that people maybe hit my work</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.089" end="01:03:18.670" style="s2">is and it&#39;s often very abstract right</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.030" end="01:03:21.430" style="s2">and it&#39;s a gift but what do I do</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.670" end="01:03:25.300" style="s2">and you know I try to address that as</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.430" end="01:03:27.810" style="s2">best I can but if you&#39;re doing a much</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.300" end="01:03:30.520" style="s2">better job at addressing that then I</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.810" end="01:03:32.550" style="s2">have done a potentially ever could do so</p>

<p begin="01:04:03.609" end="01:04:09.220" style="s2">items as well um it was initially hard</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.890" end="01:04:12.099" style="s2">for me to listen to a guy because I find</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.220" end="01:04:15.310" style="s2">that what is it tractive to me a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.099" end="01:04:18.369" style="s2">the times is that facility with juggling</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.310" end="01:04:20.980" style="s2">propositions or having a clear set of</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.369" end="01:04:23.740" style="s2">propositions that you&#39;re offering and</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.980" end="01:04:25.650" style="s2">when I was listening to talk to you he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.740" end="01:04:29.140" style="s2">not offering so much of his</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.650" end="01:04:32.740" style="s2">so much of his propositions that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.140" end="01:04:36.040" style="s2">that&#39;s for what what what comes through</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.740" end="01:04:39.010" style="s2">is actually the example of participating</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.040" end="01:04:39.190" style="s2">in what he&#39;s trying to create yes very</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.010" end="01:04:41.470" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.190" end="01:04:43.600" style="s2">this is another thing and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.470" end="01:04:45.010" style="s2">listen to my you know it was nice to</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.600" end="01:04:46.510" style="s2">listen to my friend Mark Walsh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.010" end="01:04:48.040" style="s2">interview with God because then you got</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.510" end="01:04:50.350" style="s2">a little bit more of an idea behind</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.040" end="01:04:52.000" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right I also just</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.350" end="01:04:54.580" style="s2">happened to have another few friends</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.000" end="01:04:56.260" style="s2">you&#39;ve also gotten to circling and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.580" end="01:05:00.510" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s been very interesting to take</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.260" end="01:05:03.780" style="s2">on some of the ideas and bring that into</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.510" end="01:05:08.170" style="s2">to my relationship with my wife but also</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.780" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">thinking about how we use dialoguing has</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.170" end="01:05:13.390" style="s2">an immigration enactus because I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:15.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s incredibly valuable and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.390" end="01:05:18.670" style="s2">think if we are if we&#39;re if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.400" end="01:05:20.260" style="s2">letting you know we had this</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.670" end="01:05:23.200" style="s2">conversation before we started to call</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.260" end="01:05:26.050" style="s2">about kind of the grammar of sport and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:27.970" style="s2">physical culture and why it might have</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.050" end="01:05:30.490" style="s2">been like I&#39;ve lost the meaning that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.970" end="01:05:32.200" style="s2">should or how it might have added</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.490" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">meanings embedded in it that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.200" end="01:05:37.330" style="s2">really want to keep embedding it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:38.350" style="s2">right and we can get into that in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.330" end="01:05:40.870" style="s2">future when I show you some more</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.350" end="01:05:43.090" style="s2">research let&#39;em but if we&#39;re if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.870" end="01:05:45.640" style="s2">choosing a new orientation towards</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.090" end="01:05:48.750" style="s2">meaning and it is towards this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.640" end="01:05:50.620" style="s2">the cultivation of the self you</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.750" end="01:05:52.390" style="s2">connecting it to the practice of</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.620" end="01:05:55.710" style="s2">mindfulness connecting to the practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.390" end="01:05:58.210" style="s2">of dialogue becomes incredibly powerful</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.710" end="01:06:00.520" style="s2">so I&#39;m very interested in what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.210" end="01:06:02.950" style="s2">doing with guide and with Jordan Paul</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.520" end="01:06:04.690" style="s2">and you recommend all the the listeners</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.950" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">look into that and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.690" end="01:06:08.580" style="s2">you know I want to know more about and</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">how we can yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.580" end="01:06:13.810" style="s2">facilitating this growth of the dial</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:15.010" style="s2">logos in relation you know like and this</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.810" end="01:06:17.440" style="s2">is this is kind of what I want to offer</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.010" end="01:06:21.040" style="s2">that conversation to it&#39;s like I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.440" end="01:06:23.470" style="s2">that if we can get them the embodiments</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.040" end="01:06:25.450" style="s2">and we can get me embedding into the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.470" end="01:06:27.070" style="s2">environment and we can connect that to</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.450" end="01:06:29.320" style="s2">the dialoguing process so we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.070" end="01:06:30.790" style="s2">that zooming in getting this broader</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.320" end="01:06:32.320" style="s2">perspective we&#39;re having the evolving</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.790" end="01:06:34.360" style="s2">sense like you know I was really good at</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.320" end="01:06:36.470" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t make it to to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.360" end="01:06:42.320" style="s2">Ottoman tree because I want I want</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.470" end="01:06:44.599" style="s2">yeah yeah no idea and I well you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.320" end="01:06:46.670" style="s2">I&#39;m showing that I&#39;m deeply committed to</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.599" end="01:06:48.800" style="s2">participant observation so I very much</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.670" end="01:06:50.570" style="s2">want to do that yeah I thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.800" end="01:06:52.849" style="s2">saying that I recommend especially the</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.570" end="01:06:55.400" style="s2">two videos with the four of us with guy</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.849" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">said stock Jordan all myself and</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.400" end="01:06:59.480" style="s2">Christopher monster Pietro I think those</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:03.560" style="s2">two videos especially with with the four</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.480" end="01:07:05.090" style="s2">of us because we all we it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.560" end="01:07:07.820" style="s2">like what we&#39;re talking about the day</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.090" end="01:07:09.260" style="s2">you get Minnie you get the four kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.820" end="01:07:10.520" style="s2">no and I&#39;m not saying each one of us</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.260" end="01:07:12.349" style="s2">represents one of the kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.520" end="01:07:13.940" style="s2">or anything ridiculous but all the kinds</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.349" end="01:07:16.490" style="s2">of knowing are put into much more</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.940" end="01:07:19.400" style="s2">dynamic interaction in a powerful way</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.490" end="01:07:23.050" style="s2">which I really I like I said if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.400" end="01:07:25.490" style="s2">a there&#39;s a thing there the logos comes</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.050" end="01:07:27.590" style="s2">and it takes everybody you know into a</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.490" end="01:07:30.460" style="s2">place where they can&#39;t get to on its own</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.590" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">and and and knowing how to translate</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.460" end="01:07:35.210" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the right verb between that</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:38.390" style="s2">interpersonal and then the way we talked</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.210" end="01:07:40.490" style="s2">about how you how you get people into</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.390" end="01:07:42.320" style="s2">that kind of dialogic emergence of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.490" end="01:07:44.020" style="s2">logos with respect to nature in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.320" end="01:07:47.540" style="s2">environment and getting those two</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.020" end="01:07:49.190" style="s2">dialogues to dialogue together I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.540" end="01:07:51.710" style="s2">is something that I&#39;m deeply interested</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.190" end="01:07:53.540" style="s2">in understanding more deeply and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.710" end="01:07:56.930" style="s2">communication that comes through the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.540" end="01:08:00.920" style="s2">body right yes you know where variation</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.930" end="01:08:04.940" style="s2">is how like we&#39;ve become divorced from</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.920" end="01:08:06.530" style="s2">meaning again like if you if I say</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.940" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">something to you here and you can see</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.530" end="01:08:09.950" style="s2">and you can hear my tone of voice</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:12.380" style="s2">there&#39;s layers of meanings that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.950" end="01:08:14.480" style="s2">Deloris that if i said the same thing to</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.380" end="01:08:16.460" style="s2">you in text message oh of course</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.480" end="01:08:18.170" style="s2">and so one of the things you&#39;re picking</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.460" end="01:08:19.460" style="s2">up on the circling practices because you</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.170" end="01:08:21.049" style="s2">always have in the stereoscopic vision</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.460" end="01:08:22.850" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing this deep mindful</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.049" end="01:08:25.250" style="s2">awareness inward and then you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.850" end="01:08:27.830" style="s2">deep mindful awareness outward but one</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.250" end="01:08:29.480" style="s2">of the things you&#39;ll often pick up on is</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.830" end="01:08:32.029" style="s2">you&#39;ll pick up on the mediating role of</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.480" end="01:08:34.009" style="s2">gesture between the propositional and</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.029" end="01:08:36.440" style="s2">the perspectival and the way and so very</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.009" end="01:08:37.520" style="s2">often people will you&#39;ll even see it in</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.440" end="01:08:39.319" style="s2">some of the times when I&#39;m talking with</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.520" end="01:08:42.049" style="s2">guy and I&#39;ll say well you just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.319" end="01:08:43.940" style="s2">you stood back you sort of moved back</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.049" end="01:08:46.969" style="s2">and you sort of tilted your head like</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.940" end="01:08:49.790" style="s2">he&#39;ll call out gesture and you know and</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.969" end="01:08:50.299" style="s2">that&#39;s that for me is something I want</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.790" end="01:08:56.020" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.299" end="01:08:58.670" style="s2">and to that though the the that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.020" end="01:09:01.759" style="s2">reappropriation a react septation of</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.670" end="01:09:03.679" style="s2">gesture as a way of bridging between the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.759" end="01:09:06.799" style="s2">propositional aspects of dialogue and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.679" end="01:09:09.949" style="s2">more procedural and the more embodied</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.799" end="01:09:13.609" style="s2">aspects of the dialogue and and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.949" end="01:09:15.980" style="s2">within what we call roughhousing right</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.609" end="01:09:17.329" style="s2">we have the layer of communication that</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.980" end="01:09:19.400" style="s2">comes where we actually are touching</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.329" end="01:09:21.679" style="s2">each other and we learn to a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.400" end="01:09:24.949" style="s2">in contact there and and this I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.679" end="01:09:27.139" style="s2">gives a sensitivity and an awareness you</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.949" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">know the research like as I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.139" end="01:09:30.710" style="s2">writing about this right now</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:33.349" style="s2">but um you know research shows that</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.710" end="01:09:35.420" style="s2">rough-and-tumble play increases capacity</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.349" end="01:09:37.639" style="s2">for empathy essentially scores your</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.420" end="01:09:39.710" style="s2">ability for theory of mind well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.639" end="01:09:42.069" style="s2">because in training the insula to pick</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.710" end="01:09:45.290" style="s2">up on your own interceptive stuff it</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.069" end="01:09:47.869" style="s2">coupled to you&#39;re trying to get a sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.290" end="01:09:49.250" style="s2">of where the other person is expressing</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.869" end="01:09:50.960" style="s2">their intentionality through how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.250" end="01:09:52.159" style="s2">moving yeah that but that makes that</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.960" end="01:09:53.569" style="s2">makes very good sense to me</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.159" end="01:09:55.820" style="s2">and so it&#39;ll be very interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.569" end="01:09:59.659" style="s2">think about how can we get that</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.820" end="01:10:01.130" style="s2">connection from the from let&#39;s embed</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.659" end="01:10:03.500" style="s2">ourselves in the environment let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.130" end="01:10:06.590" style="s2">create our container let&#39;s move with</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.500" end="01:10:09.469" style="s2">each other let&#39;s move and then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.590" end="01:10:14.059" style="s2">create dialogue right and how does that</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.469" end="01:10:15.559" style="s2">that generate the meaning yeah I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.059" end="01:10:18.440" style="s2">that were just about out of time here</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.559" end="01:10:21.860" style="s2">but I deeply appreciate the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.440" end="01:10:23.630" style="s2">well I I really really enjoyed it right</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.860" end="01:10:25.699" style="s2">I mean it was good for me I got to spend</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.630" end="01:10:26.929" style="s2">a lot of time and I I mean this is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.699" end="01:10:29.360" style="s2">good sense I guess it&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.929" end="01:10:32.000" style="s2">time listening cuz I got really deeply</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.360" end="01:10:33.530" style="s2">interested and I said what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.000" end="01:10:36.829" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I provoked that reaction</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.530" end="01:10:37.429" style="s2">and you know that response in me to what</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.829" end="01:10:41.389" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.429" end="01:10:43.190" style="s2">so why I&#39;m thank you but I just wanna I</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.389" end="01:10:44.809" style="s2">don&#39;t know it seems so trite but I just</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.190" end="01:10:47.329" style="s2">want to keep encouraging you to do what</p>

<p begin="01:10:47.329" end="01:11:03.630" style="s2">helps to have people who sing so I think</p>
