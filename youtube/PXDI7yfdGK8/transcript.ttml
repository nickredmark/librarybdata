<p begin="00:02:41.970" end="00:02:49.770" style="s2">summarizing paragraph of the book the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:53.730" style="s2">Corey wrote says as a habit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:58.470" style="s2">passionate responsibility authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.730" end="00:03:02.330" style="s2">is the practice of openness by which we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.470" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">are called to feeding responses</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.330" end="00:03:07.470" style="s2">authenticity</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.140" end="00:03:25.130" style="s2">blissfully seduced obedience more simply</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.840" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">addressed it is a dutiful autonomy one</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.130" end="00:03:35.489" style="s2">liberated by indebtedness so as you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:38.220" style="s2">see with that he really goes deep into</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.489" end="00:03:40.860" style="s2">authenticity but in this book he in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.220" end="00:03:44.670" style="s2">order to really reveal authenticity in</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.860" end="00:03:47.160" style="s2">an original way and authentically he</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.670" end="00:03:49.080" style="s2">really takes on very very deep notions</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.160" end="00:03:51.300" style="s2">perhaps the deepest notions that there</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.080" end="00:03:54.269" style="s2">are for us are very ontology our very</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.300" end="00:03:55.709" style="s2">existence in the world and what I really</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.269" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">like about this book and I really like</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.709" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">about the way that Cory thinks is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:05.220" style="s2">that really get to sense with him that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:07.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a gratitude from which he speaks</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.220" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">from and from which he thinks from</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.230" end="00:04:12.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a line and Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:16.440" style="s2">all often talks about thinking as</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.950" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">thinking thinking and thinking and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.440" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">really get that sense with Cory that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a liberated release meant if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">will of gratitude and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:32.610" style="s2">violent well not even volunteered but</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">grateful indebtedness to having existed</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.610" end="00:04:36.840" style="s2">and it really comes through in his</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:39.510" style="s2">thinking and in that he thinks in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.840" end="00:04:43.770" style="s2">way thinks the way rights and the way he</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.510" end="00:04:48.450" style="s2">was in this interview with me so no</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.770" end="00:04:50.250" style="s2">further ado here&#39;s Corey and me talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">about his book self had not been to City</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.250" end="00:05:01.080" style="s2">link for that is below okay hey Corey we</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:02.970" style="s2">just jump right into his there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.080" end="00:05:07.890" style="s2">of fun so one of the things I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.970" end="00:05:11.460" style="s2">do is is actually take this take this</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.890" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">video and really hone in on your book</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.460" end="00:05:18.660" style="s2">self puttin authenticity and in what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.330" end="00:05:20.310" style="s2">like to do is is do do three videos we</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.660" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">have to be careful because it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.310" end="00:05:24.210" style="s2">think if we go into one section we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.110" end="00:05:29.040" style="s2">go out for ten hours on each section</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.210" end="00:05:31.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s so packed right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.040" end="00:05:34.520" style="s2">lot there but then what I&#39;d love to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.200" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">is do the one your your other book the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.520" end="00:05:41.850" style="s2">what is it the one that significance in</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:43.590" style="s2">it yeah and then yeah and then the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.850" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">after that the the latest one that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.590" end="00:05:59.390" style="s2">have coming up did it come out no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:06:02.910" style="s2">this is why is still in motion right</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.390" end="00:06:08.390" style="s2">right well you know I I would have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.910" end="00:06:12.180" style="s2">say it&#39;s it&#39;s part of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.390" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2">interested in understanding right cuz</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.180" end="00:06:15.750" style="s2">because I have the experience of reading</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.800" end="00:06:18.419" style="s2">your book right and it is quite a I</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.750" end="00:06:20.280" style="s2">actually have had quite an experience of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.419" end="00:06:21.870" style="s2">reading it the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.280" end="00:06:26.370" style="s2">understanding the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.870" end="00:06:29.610" style="s2">writing about has me wonder what it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.370" end="00:06:32.010" style="s2">like to write it right and I and I get</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.610" end="00:06:34.380" style="s2">this sense there&#39;s a lot in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.010" end="00:06:36.599" style="s2">vocabulary that you use the way the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.380" end="00:06:39.960" style="s2">perspectives that you define and come</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.599" end="00:06:40.940" style="s2">from and a lot of the language that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.960" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">do there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.940" end="00:06:46.360" style="s2">lot I have always this feeling of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:48.860" style="s2">kind of stretching long write multiple</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.360" end="00:06:50.690" style="s2">dimensions of like something refraining</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.860" end="00:06:54.260" style="s2">back and it this this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.690" end="00:06:56.570" style="s2">stretching and tethering and long gating</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.260" end="00:06:59.480" style="s2">and a lots of vocabulary like that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.570" end="00:07:06.410" style="s2">it had me wonder about the retaining we</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.480" end="00:07:08.630" style="s2">are waiting yeah and and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.410" end="00:07:11.090" style="s2">interesting because each it was almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.630" end="00:07:13.370" style="s2">when I was going through it and then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.090" end="00:07:14.810" style="s2">know writing different things down and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.370" end="00:07:17.000" style="s2">things I wanted to talk about with you</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.810" end="00:07:20.270" style="s2">from the book wearing there realizes</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.000" end="00:07:22.490" style="s2">like almost we could read we could pick</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.270" end="00:07:23.810" style="s2">a paragraph out and read it and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.490" end="00:07:27.350" style="s2">whole book is contained in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.810" end="00:07:29.060" style="s2">paragraph right in a lot of respects</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.350" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like because I and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.060" end="00:07:34.790" style="s2">revealing of the other of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:38.300" style="s2">perspective that you&#39;re unfolding in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.790" end="00:07:39.950" style="s2">book in about the self and about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.300" end="00:07:43.130" style="s2">connection between the South in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.950" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">world and the world in the earth and of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.130" end="00:07:48.200" style="s2">being there&#39;s a there&#39;s a whole there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:52.700" style="s2">a holistic or you reveal a whole a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.200" end="00:07:55.220" style="s2">holistic miss that I think really flies</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.700" end="00:08:00.890" style="s2">in the well is to fly in the face but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.220" end="00:08:03.140" style="s2">it highlights it highlights certain</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.190" end="00:08:43.280" style="s2">of the universe or a child of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.260" end="00:08:46.220" style="s2">and a somehow part of the earth and you</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.120" end="00:09:02.819" style="s2">just realisation that and that that</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.819" end="00:09:08.699" style="s2">something that&#39;s doing we&#39;ve emerged out</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.740" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">of it and and you pay attention to your</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.699" end="00:09:12.779" style="s2">experience you start to notice the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:14.639" style="s2">different ways that there are features</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.779" end="00:09:17.490" style="s2">of the world they can&#39;t really show</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.639" end="00:09:20.459" style="s2">themselves without your presence without</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.620" end="00:09:29.550" style="s2">everybody say like my hand right here</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.660" end="00:09:30.300" style="s2">you know how much about my hand is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.550" end="00:09:32.759" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.300" end="00:09:34.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not to play the skeptics game like</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.759" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">we&#39;re making it up or like you know I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.309" end="00:09:45.029" style="s2">something it&#39;s that when you do say the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:48.559" style="s2">hand it&#39;s the lane which is allowing us</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.029" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">to focus our attention and to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.559" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">this thing we&#39;re going to call my hand</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:58.110" style="s2">and so rather than the question of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:10:00.540" style="s2">know is there a world beyond experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.110" end="00:10:03.300" style="s2">you should have asked how is the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.540" end="00:10:07.379" style="s2">that we do experience partly what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.300" end="00:10:09.929" style="s2">world is because of us of our capacities</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.379" end="00:10:12.509" style="s2">of our worldly capacities whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.929" end="00:10:14.879" style="s2">they&#39;re a badge nation or in motion or</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.509" end="00:10:17.129" style="s2">the senses you know I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.879" end="00:10:19.079" style="s2">book also will be influenced by people</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.129" end="00:10:25.100" style="s2">like Heidi read Sartre you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.079" end="00:10:26.309" style="s2">for them the the emotions their forms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.100" end="00:10:31.129" style="s2">kazuma</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.309" end="00:10:31.129" style="s2">of an atonement to the world their their</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.309" end="00:10:36.470" style="s2">understanding of one&#39;s situatedness in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.110" end="00:10:38.790" style="s2">certain things and they&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.790" end="00:10:45.089" style="s2">exactly in articulate speech we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.939" end="00:10:49.230" style="s2">to disentangle things but feel a certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.089" end="00:10:50.670" style="s2">way it&#39;s disclosing something about you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.230" end="00:10:54.329" style="s2">and the world in your current</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.670" end="00:10:56.639" style="s2">relatedness situations totally and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.329" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">think what I what I appreciated about</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.639" end="00:11:05.180" style="s2">the book right is</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:08.029" style="s2">is is that it really through reading its</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.180" end="00:11:10.279" style="s2">I dare anyone to read it and then try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.029" end="00:11:12.949" style="s2">think of themselves as an entity like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.279" end="00:11:16.490" style="s2">like a thing in a in a world amongst</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.949" end="00:11:20.089" style="s2">other things it is it you really really</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.490" end="00:11:23.720" style="s2">open that connectedness up with things</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.089" end="00:11:26.329" style="s2">right I mean I think your true leaders</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.720" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">were the absolute body very influential</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.329" end="00:11:31.190" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a wonderful book anyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:33.350" style="s2">wants to the other one you know turning</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.190" end="00:11:35.380" style="s2">stuff and having that in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.350" end="00:11:35.380" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.209" end="00:11:44.899" style="s2">this is our supreme just supreme to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.569" end="00:11:48.110" style="s2">understand how one is integrated all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.899" end="00:11:51.110" style="s2">way in from really not being anything at</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.110" end="00:11:52.220" style="s2">all to just a certain level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.110" end="00:11:58.430" style="s2">a bunch of chemicals and particles</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.220" end="00:12:01.509" style="s2">within a certain one sort of disappears</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.430" end="00:12:04.490" style="s2">into the aggregate known as humanity</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.509" end="00:12:08.149" style="s2">just disappears into something like you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.490" end="00:12:11.420" style="s2">know earth from a distance is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.149" end="00:12:17.540" style="s2">strange and for these workers this is so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.420" end="00:12:22.310" style="s2">fast right like a robust account of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.540" end="00:12:28.040" style="s2">it needs to be or oneself as of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.310" end="00:12:30.259" style="s2">earth tipping I think Watson say just as</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.040" end="00:12:33.439" style="s2">extreme flowers with people&#39;s yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.259" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">come out of the world and then you know</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:41.300" style="s2">the world comes out of us and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:54.800" style="s2">like we&#39;re not really on the planet the</p>

<p begin="00:14:32.310" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">I was at least considering it roughly</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.930" end="00:14:39.210" style="s2">and I&#39;d worked at a monastery for years</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:41.430" style="s2">and a lot of you know interesting people</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.300" end="00:14:59.400" style="s2">came down to this belief in life after</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.400" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t really make sense and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.950" end="00:15:05.970" style="s2">there was just all kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:07.800" style="s2">that I had and I think there were there</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.440" end="00:15:22.260" style="s2">I started to ask you know why did I care</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.339" end="00:15:32.040" style="s2">ended up deepening my my beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.430" end="00:15:34.499" style="s2">other ways just in like the realization</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.040" end="00:15:35.879" style="s2">that it meant something to me to not go</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.320" end="00:18:12.450" style="s2">most giving generous loving thing that a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.169" end="00:18:14.970" style="s2">person could do and so when I went and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.450" end="00:18:17.250" style="s2">met my biological mother</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.970" end="00:18:20.039" style="s2">my parents had put together this huge</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.250" end="00:18:22.890" style="s2">package of stuff from me growing up</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.039" end="00:18:25.799" style="s2">pictures of me riding ponies in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.890" end="00:18:29.640" style="s2">parade and you know pictures of me at</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.799" end="00:18:31.530" style="s2">birthday parties and and they wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.640" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">big letter about how much they loved her</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.530" end="00:18:36.299" style="s2">and how much they want her to know how</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:39.090" style="s2">much her generosity is probably painful</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.299" end="00:18:41.549" style="s2">as it was it&#39;s really appreciated and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.090" end="00:18:43.350" style="s2">mean it was a really heavy moment you</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.549" end="00:18:45.510" style="s2">know I mean I got to meet my biological</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.350" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">mother we went to that we met in Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.510" end="00:18:50.280" style="s2">at the Chicago Art Museum and then we</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:52.409" style="s2">went out to the Russian Tea Room held</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.280" end="00:18:55.230" style="s2">hands and then we talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.409" end="00:18:57.149" style="s2">and I was it don&#39;t really have any</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.230" end="00:19:01.639" style="s2">relationship with her you know I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.149" end="00:19:04.260" style="s2">wanted to say thank you and I did and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.639" end="00:19:07.860" style="s2">must have been wondering about like was</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.260" end="00:19:10.679" style="s2">was it a trip to see likeness in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.860" end="00:19:12.299" style="s2">face the first time I never experienced</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.679" end="00:19:15.630" style="s2">family resembled so it was pretty trippy</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.299" end="00:19:17.730" style="s2">I bet that was you know I think the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.630" end="00:19:20.520" style="s2">other thing is that it it didn&#39;t shatter</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.730" end="00:19:23.210" style="s2">it but it organized some of my self</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.520" end="00:19:25.559" style="s2">fashioning you can do anything with</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.210" end="00:19:27.539" style="s2">self-discipline because I was such a bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.559" end="00:19:30.360" style="s2">grade school student I suppose student</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.539" end="00:19:32.580" style="s2">and we&#39;re so unlike my brother and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.360" end="00:19:34.590" style="s2">rest of my family and you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.580" end="00:19:37.860" style="s2">discovered books on my own I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.590" end="00:19:39.990" style="s2">they&#39;re not really intellectual they</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.860" end="00:19:42.210" style="s2">never question my love their love</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.990" end="00:19:46.049" style="s2">through music beautiful loving again</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.210" end="00:19:47.909" style="s2">about theirs really but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.049" end="00:19:51.929" style="s2">dedicate my book to them to them I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.909" end="00:19:53.399" style="s2">it was but I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.929" end="00:19:55.980" style="s2">just very very different and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.399" end="00:19:58.110" style="s2">discovered it and I think I imagined</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.980" end="00:20:00.210" style="s2">that it was me getting up early and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.110" end="00:20:02.249" style="s2">hitting the books and study and I did I</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.210" end="00:20:05.909" style="s2">studied really hard but when I met my</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.249" end="00:20:08.669" style="s2">biological mother I think I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.909" end="00:20:10.460" style="s2">accepting that I might have had a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.669" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">bit more biological or genetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.460" end="00:20:15.779" style="s2">advantages from the get-go and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:17.369" style="s2">my modeling of look anyone can just get</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.779" end="00:20:18.659" style="s2">up and study and do it all in any</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.369" end="00:20:20.460" style="s2">transform themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.659" end="00:20:22.470" style="s2">it got modified a little bit I still</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.460" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">believe in the transformative power of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.470" end="00:20:28.470" style="s2">study and but I also you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:31.259" style="s2">humbled into you know realizing that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.470" end="00:20:33.029" style="s2">have now I learned about her she was an</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.259" end="00:20:35.220" style="s2">educator and she was you know she was an</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.029" end="00:20:38.580" style="s2">English teacher and I have two</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.220" end="00:20:40.950" style="s2">half-brothers one who has a Harvard PhD</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.580" end="00:20:43.619" style="s2">in musicology and one works for the HUD</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.950" end="00:20:45.539" style="s2">program in DC so you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.619" end="00:20:49.889" style="s2">sense in which I ended up going wow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.539" end="00:20:52.950" style="s2">kind of you know I think we can admit</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.889" end="00:20:55.529" style="s2">that you know there there are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.950" end="00:20:58.830" style="s2">certain kinds of natural aptitudes that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.529" end="00:21:01.619" style="s2">people have and that was humbling for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.830" end="00:21:04.110" style="s2">so I think I wanted to believe in my my</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.619" end="00:21:05.999" style="s2">self-made story up until about age 40</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.110" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">right well I imagine is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.999" end="00:21:12.570" style="s2">athletics a bet I mean I think about I</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:16.889" style="s2">noticed I noticed people who are really</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.570" end="00:21:19.610" style="s2">high IQ right it&#39;s almost like that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.889" end="00:21:22.409" style="s2">can they can grab with their mind right</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.610" end="00:21:24.869" style="s2">whereas it&#39;s but I have a feeling it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.409" end="00:21:26.850" style="s2">pretty it&#39;s pretty similar on some level</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.869" end="00:21:29.970" style="s2">like I you and all that kind of stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.850" end="00:21:31.799" style="s2">pretty similar to court like the ability</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.970" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">to be highly coordinated with your</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.799" end="00:21:39.570" style="s2">little audience sports to stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:42.539" style="s2">that yeah so I think the other thing too</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.570" end="00:21:46.169" style="s2">is like my dad is such an amazing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.539" end="00:21:48.539" style="s2">wasn&#39;t amazing he&#39;s just amazing he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.169" end="00:21:50.279" style="s2">one of those very rare three sport</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.539" end="00:21:53.610" style="s2">collegiate athletes when he went to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.279" end="00:21:55.049" style="s2">college on I think a scholarship for</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.610" end="00:21:58.169" style="s2">baseball but he played college</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.049" end="00:21:59.519" style="s2">basketball and football you ended up one</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.169" end="00:22:01.649" style="s2">point he was in the like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.519" end="00:22:05.159" style="s2">Philadelphia Eagles training family just</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.649" end="00:22:06.989" style="s2">incredible athlete and I know a juggler</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.159" end="00:22:08.789" style="s2">juggle five balls and I think I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.989" end="00:22:12.330" style="s2">good roller skater kind of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.789" end="00:22:18.840" style="s2">was never an athlete I was never ball</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.330" end="00:22:21.539" style="s2">team I was he was great great like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.840" end="00:22:22.739" style="s2">coordination I just sports were just not</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.539" end="00:22:31.320" style="s2">my thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.739" end="00:22:35.159" style="s2">I was horrible a concert kid that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.320" end="00:22:40.529" style="s2">crazy experience and do you remember do</p>

<p begin="00:28:33.330" end="00:28:39.960" style="s2">me into this with the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.270" end="00:28:42.450" style="s2">in the same way that I&#39;m an absent body</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.960" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">largely lost into the horizon of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.450" end="00:28:45.370" style="s2">situations</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:47.920" style="s2">I&#39;m routinely</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.510" end="00:28:53.260" style="s2">themselves instead we just lost an</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.490" end="00:28:54.610" style="s2">immediate horizons in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.260" end="00:28:57.430" style="s2">we&#39;re lost in the landscape of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.610" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">situation&#39;s which itself is an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.430" end="00:29:00.550" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:02.770" style="s2">it disappears for the sake of me in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.550" end="00:29:06.130" style="s2">same way that my body is self effacing</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.770" end="00:29:07.540" style="s2">the sake of the world it makes its old</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.130" end="00:29:10.180" style="s2">one out what I&#39;m hearing is like it</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.540" end="00:29:10.780" style="s2">makes it so you could understand how it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.180" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">could be missed</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.780" end="00:29:16.870" style="s2">right and so the thing that&#39;s most near</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">is what&#39;s most concealed right you go to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.870" end="00:29:20.200" style="s2">look for it describe your existence and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:22.990" style="s2">you would just end up with the product</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.200" end="00:29:24.580" style="s2">of reflection which end is very</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.990" end="00:29:27.280" style="s2">different from the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.580" end="00:29:29.590" style="s2">doing in order to reflect right and be</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.280" end="00:29:31.000" style="s2">you in that position right yeah I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.590" end="00:29:32.890" style="s2">different way to sort of come at some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.000" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">this is to say you know if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.890" end="00:29:39.190" style="s2">give speech stereotype sounds languages</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:40.030" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with like Chinese I</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.020" end="00:29:51.910" style="s2">know but if I try to say you know what</p>

<p begin="00:29:56.740" end="00:30:01.330" style="s2">more incessantly so all day long that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.190" end="00:30:03.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what your own native</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.330" end="00:30:07.350" style="s2">tongue sounds like so you can&#39;t give</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.350" end="00:30:12.010" style="s2">which says so much about perception and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.940" end="00:30:15.790" style="s2">so many things but there&#39;s I think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.010" end="00:30:17.170" style="s2">one of the things I I appreciate him</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.360" end="00:31:48.820" style="s2">sort of like the opposite of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.570" end="00:32:36.160" style="s2">the video cameras and when Donnie and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.150" end="00:32:40.470" style="s2">Kruger heard this they thought that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.160" end="00:32:40.470" style="s2">about the dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever heard</p>

<p begin="00:32:45.370" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">well there&#39;s something and I also think</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.500" end="00:32:52.660" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t isn&#39;t that what hurt like</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:56.890" style="s2">the hermeneutic circle basically is</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.660" end="00:33:00.070" style="s2">right yeah okay so the circle to me this</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.890" end="00:33:02.770" style="s2">so Donna Murr Donna work tools this and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.070" end="00:33:04.600" style="s2">some way out of hiding nerd I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.770" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">the book here but I&#39;m trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.600" end="00:33:09.590" style="s2">it&#39;s like section 17 34 again but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:11.480" style="s2">he says</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.590" end="00:33:14.390" style="s2">this is what Heidegger writes he says</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.480" end="00:33:17.270" style="s2">any interpretation which is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.390" end="00:33:19.130" style="s2">contribute to understanding must have</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.270" end="00:33:22.460" style="s2">already understood what is to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.130" end="00:33:23.410" style="s2">interpreted and the interpretation which</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.460" end="00:33:25.850" style="s2">is to contribute to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.410" end="00:33:28.790" style="s2">must&#39;ve already understood what is to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.850" end="00:33:31.100" style="s2">interpreted and so I think what so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.790" end="00:33:32.920" style="s2">think what happens is many people they</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.100" end="00:33:35.990" style="s2">kind of approach it like this they say</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.920" end="00:33:37.790" style="s2">there&#39;s something out there I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.990" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">it and not what I need to do is I need</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.790" end="00:33:41.330" style="s2">to interpret it in order to get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:43.730" style="s2">encounter with it whereas I think for</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.330" end="00:33:47.390" style="s2">Heidegger know there&#39;s always a for a be</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.730" end="00:33:50.180" style="s2">then I&#39;ve always already been exposed in</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.390" end="00:33:52.190" style="s2">some way to whatever it is I now want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.180" end="00:33:55.340" style="s2">think about the cheek part of it has to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.190" end="00:33:57.740" style="s2">do with when I come to self-awareness by</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.340" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">the time I come to self-awareness I find</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.740" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">that I&#39;ve always already be done sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:04.280" style="s2">what we were giving that like I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:05.780" style="s2">always knowing I was adopted it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.280" end="00:34:07.850" style="s2">parents that we gotta make our you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.780" end="00:34:11.090" style="s2">about that no instead my self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.850" end="00:34:13.160" style="s2">disapprove it in a small way and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.090" end="00:34:15.920" style="s2">kind of merged in that a long David</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.160" end="00:34:20.120" style="s2">stretch and so part of the hermeneutics</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.920" end="00:34:25.090" style="s2">is once you find yourself now I have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.120" end="00:34:28.130" style="s2">do some of that depth back circling into</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.090" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">interesting interesting so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.130" end="00:34:36.890" style="s2">because there is that quality of and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:38.180" style="s2">does seem to me that you know especially</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.890" end="00:34:39.950" style="s2">with the relation you really know this</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.180" end="00:34:41.570" style="s2">with your relationships right if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.950" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">if they&#39;re you know authentic</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.570" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s like you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:47.120" style="s2">along I&#39;m still learning things about my</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:51.610" style="s2">wife that aren&#39;t like they aren&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.120" end="00:34:54.500" style="s2">brand new discoveries they&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.610" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why you say that over and over</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.500" end="00:35:00.020" style="s2">again there&#39;s this whole other dimension</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:03.350" style="s2">that it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t know that or</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:06.500" style="s2">I didn&#39;t see it but the significance of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.350" end="00:35:08.270" style="s2">it like displays this understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.500" end="00:35:11.150" style="s2">this unfoldment right that is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.270" end="00:35:13.580" style="s2">continually a sense that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.150" end="00:35:15.740" style="s2">relating to something in her that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.580" end="00:35:17.810" style="s2">haven&#39;t been quite aware of it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.740" end="00:35:19.640" style="s2">just at the periphery but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.810" end="00:35:22.100" style="s2">oriented around it and then we have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.640" end="00:35:23.210" style="s2">conversation and then BOOM she tells me</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.100" end="00:35:25.700" style="s2">a story she never told her so</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.210" end="00:35:27.670" style="s2">like that all these articles and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.700" end="00:35:31.849" style="s2">there&#39;s a this experience of affinity</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.670" end="00:35:33.050" style="s2">right of intimacy I think this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.849" end="00:35:34.460" style="s2">the things I really appreciated about</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.050" end="00:35:37.400" style="s2">your book about like the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.460" end="00:35:39.950" style="s2">talked about sociality with other right</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.400" end="00:35:44.690" style="s2">this sense the sense in which that fee</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.950" end="00:35:47.000" style="s2">that well one-one you go you really you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.690" end="00:35:49.849" style="s2">take some time in the book to really</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.000" end="00:35:53.080" style="s2">deliberate about the the understandings</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.849" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">and misunderstandings of authenticity is</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.080" end="00:35:58.940" style="s2">really like all of them are banked out</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">of presumption of what itself is right</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.940" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to the grounds of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:06.380" style="s2">that and start to unpack that right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.640" style="s2">you and you unpack it you know just like</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.380" end="00:36:10.369" style="s2">what we were talking about this is why</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.640" end="00:36:22.420" style="s2">this really spoke to me is is a sense to</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.369" end="00:36:25.460" style="s2">be an Randy and I mean you&#39;re a helpless</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.420" end="00:36:27.560" style="s2">completely dependent upon others for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.460" end="00:36:28.820" style="s2">first several years of your life you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.560" end="00:36:31.849" style="s2">come into the world through another</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.980" end="00:36:38.119" style="s2">been beaten and shunned and how you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.140" end="00:36:40.430" style="s2">been interactive at least become</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.119" end="00:36:42.530" style="s2">formative elements of who you are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.430" end="00:36:44.510" style="s2">not as if we&#39;re ourselves yeah I think</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.510" end="00:36:47.900" style="s2">are wonderful in saying you know be</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.900" end="00:36:52.250" style="s2">and what&#39;s not only your control digital</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.300" end="00:36:53.690" style="s2">about all that and that&#39;s true and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.250" end="00:36:55.790" style="s2">is great advice but for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.690" end="00:36:57.470" style="s2">developmental psychologist issues are a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.790" end="00:36:59.000" style="s2">lot more complicated than that because</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.470" end="00:37:01.130" style="s2">as a child you don&#39;t really have the</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.130" end="00:37:06.200" style="s2">even say about you it becomes part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.890" end="00:37:08.119" style="s2">your identity again Artie Lange lays</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.200" end="00:37:10.940" style="s2">this out so beautifully where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.119" end="00:37:13.339" style="s2">about it so somebody says to me you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.940" end="00:37:15.170" style="s2">greedy and I say no I&#39;m not and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.339" end="00:37:15.830" style="s2">they say no you&#39;re greedy and I say no</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.170" end="00:37:19.339" style="s2">I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.830" end="00:37:21.980" style="s2">now I&#39;m not stuck with their belief that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.339" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">I&#39;m greedy but I am stuck with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.980" end="00:37:27.770" style="s2">feeling of being misunderstood as greedy</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:29.330" style="s2">so the disavowed identity becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.770" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">important before paraded into my</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.330" end="00:37:33.830" style="s2">identity so there&#39;s no way out of having</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:35.180" style="s2">to deal with others views even if</p>

<p begin="00:37:37.750" end="00:37:45.320" style="s2">so so in other words there there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.000" end="00:37:47.630" style="s2">this is what I really like I I it helped</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.320" end="00:37:49.700" style="s2">me understand what I understood I like</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.630" end="00:37:51.080" style="s2">in a lot of ways right um and this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.700" end="00:37:52.849" style="s2">what I really liked about this I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.080" end="00:37:54.020" style="s2">oh yeah like going through it again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.849" end="00:37:55.940" style="s2">like oh I had such a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.020" end="00:37:57.589" style="s2">understanding of what I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.940" end="00:38:00.589" style="s2">understanding I understood from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.589" end="00:38:02.599" style="s2">first time I read it right understanding</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.589" end="00:38:04.099" style="s2">this again affair line right to</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.599" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">understand is to be pleased to put one</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.099" end="00:38:07.369" style="s2">knows I mean that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:08.960" style="s2">understanding always happens at layers</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.369" end="00:38:21.109" style="s2">it&#39;s like sometimes we go</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.960" end="00:38:23.050" style="s2">I can&#39;t believe and the others and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.109" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">is what you say is like others are a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.050" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">condition of my existence yes my own</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:31.730" style="s2">existence yes so in other words and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.599" end="00:38:33.410" style="s2">is this is a big part of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.730" end="00:38:36.170" style="s2">talking about when you start to at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.410" end="00:38:38.330" style="s2">the last chapter when you when you</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.710" end="00:39:02.900" style="s2">doing it I really appreciated how you</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.980" end="00:39:04.820" style="s2">how you one of the ways that you got at</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.900" end="00:39:07.730" style="s2">it was looking at some of the views</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.220" end="00:39:50.570" style="s2">spend time you know learning what we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.680" end="00:39:53.150" style="s2">from what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.570" end="00:39:55.340" style="s2">had just sitting people because you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.150" end="00:39:58.310" style="s2">a great import of this you know I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.340" end="00:40:00.860" style="s2">give the exemplars and I I&#39;m not anti</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.310" end="00:40:02.690" style="s2">feminist at all I mean I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.860" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">ask me a my concern with a lot of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.690" end="00:40:04.700" style="s2">know equality rights if they are said</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:07.430" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.700" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">but I saw some people in graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.430" end="00:40:11.150" style="s2">it was a long time ago now 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:13.130" style="s2">right but I still keep in graduate</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.150" end="00:40:15.950" style="s2">school who they would be like young</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.130" end="00:40:18.110" style="s2">feminist scholars everything we would</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.950" end="00:40:20.150" style="s2">need they would give a feminist reading</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.110" end="00:40:22.490" style="s2">on and so you know they were open with</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.150" end="00:40:25.460" style="s2">now this author used the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.490" end="00:40:27.320" style="s2">male pronoun this number of times and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.460" end="00:40:29.360" style="s2">this rate so just and I feel like but</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.320" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">what did you learn from the author but</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.360" end="00:40:33.950" style="s2">what did you meet them on their grounds</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:36.050" style="s2">at all no so there&#39;s this sense of women</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.950" end="00:40:37.820" style="s2">once you have a really good critique</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.050" end="00:40:39.320" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a Marxist critique or a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.820" end="00:40:41.140" style="s2">feminist critique or any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.320" end="00:40:43.490" style="s2">ideologically brawny critique because</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.140" end="00:40:46.010" style="s2">ideologies are through and through you</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.490" end="00:40:48.740" style="s2">can do that to any text and that becomes</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.740" end="00:40:51.530" style="s2">not sure how much growth goes on that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:53.930" style="s2">it&#39;s important to be able to do some of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.530" end="00:40:56.600" style="s2">this and I only have those resources for</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.930" end="00:40:59.330" style="s2">criticizing but yeah I I always tried to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.600" end="00:41:01.220" style="s2">see you know what can I learn from this</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.330" end="00:41:03.980" style="s2">author I&#39;m not interested in taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.220" end="00:41:05.330" style="s2">authors to task because I&#39;m you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.980" end="00:41:09.050" style="s2">gonna I&#39;m going to tell them what they</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.330" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">like there are too many people it might</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.050" end="00:41:15.830" style="s2">be right you don&#39;t you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.830" end="00:41:21.830" style="s2">perspective right and I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.160" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">it sounds like it it sounds like so so</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.830" end="00:41:27.380" style="s2">right there right just what can I learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:30.590" style="s2">from this author right used to just when</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.380" end="00:41:33.140" style="s2">I think about an ideology as an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.590" end="00:41:35.810" style="s2">because you already show up already with</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:37.700" style="s2">like a bunch of presuppositions right</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.810" end="00:41:40.610" style="s2">and beliefs I mean you put things in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.700" end="00:41:44.570" style="s2">terms of that so the learning the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.610" end="00:41:47.090" style="s2">learning is just also a like a like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.570" end="00:41:48.500" style="s2">more of a rigidity great that like self</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.090" end="00:41:50.510" style="s2">confirms itself and that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.500" end="00:41:51.800" style="s2">dangerous about ideologies I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.510" end="00:41:53.840" style="s2">think that&#39;s probably why I got into</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.800" end="00:41:55.790" style="s2">communication you know when I this was</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.840" end="00:41:56.870" style="s2">this was my doctoral dissertation so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.790" end="00:42:01.040" style="s2">mean it was the product of a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.870" end="00:42:02.870" style="s2">focused and when I was on the job</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">interview here at Grand Valley this was</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.410" end="00:43:26.599" style="s2">so basically another like lit professor</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.920" end="00:43:27.950" style="s2">but they are all interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.599" end="00:43:30.230" style="s2">communication and I always looked at</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.950" end="00:43:33.829" style="s2">about communication it&#39;s a meta</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.230" end="00:43:35.390" style="s2">discipline every field has its problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.829" end="00:43:37.579" style="s2">of communication that is how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.390" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">symbolically represent its phenomena of</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.579" end="00:43:40.849" style="s2">inquiry and then they also have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:43.309" style="s2">problem of how to disseminate that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.849" end="00:43:45.290" style="s2">information or knowledge to outsiders</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.309" end="00:43:46.790" style="s2">from that discipline and I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.290" end="00:43:49.730" style="s2">been interested in those intersections</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.790" end="00:43:52.940" style="s2">how are people using symbols using</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.730" end="00:43:54.829" style="s2">language to to study the world to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.940" end="00:43:57.589" style="s2">sense of it but then also how do they</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.829" end="00:43:59.930" style="s2">communicate outside of that in so many</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.589" end="00:44:02.180" style="s2">fields are just siloed and super</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.930" end="00:44:05.150" style="s2">specialized they&#39;re they&#39;re caught in</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.180" end="00:44:08.839" style="s2">little tiny circles and maybe not the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.150" end="00:44:11.030" style="s2">way that you use the term serve like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.839" end="00:44:14.090" style="s2">bubble of just a sign of her genetic</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.030" end="00:44:17.180" style="s2">circle yeah and not there</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.090" end="00:44:19.190" style="s2">something like information tunnel that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.180" end="00:44:21.230" style="s2">prevents them from having a larger</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.190" end="00:44:23.540" style="s2">public intellectual discourse there like</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.339" end="00:52:45.020" style="s2">little bit back when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.720" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">about you know having I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.020" end="00:52:49.640" style="s2">sinking in as you&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:51.470" style="s2">having been adopted right and knowing</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.640" end="00:52:53.330" style="s2">you were adopted but then you said like</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.470" end="00:52:56.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I remember them telling me</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.330" end="00:53:00.260" style="s2">I was adopted I grew up with that notion</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.750" end="00:53:04.430" style="s2">right that background notion yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.260" end="00:53:06.200" style="s2">on some level in some way there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.430" end="00:53:08.750" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.200" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like a horizon it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.750" end="00:53:13.609" style="s2">deep parole phase because it comes up</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:15.349" style="s2">but it would be st. Patrick&#39;s Day and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.609" end="00:53:17.630" style="s2">people would go are you Irish and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.349" end="00:53:19.220" style="s2">would go I don&#39;t know and I would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.630" end="00:53:21.260" style="s2">like well you&#39;re taking tribe or the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.220" end="00:53:23.210" style="s2">fact that you had nothing you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.260" end="00:53:25.220" style="s2">control over this but you&#39;re proud of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.210" end="00:53:27.740" style="s2">you&#39;re weird you know alright times</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.220" end="00:53:29.510" style="s2">where I don&#39;t be in some public place</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.740" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">and so person would be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.510" end="00:53:33.109" style="s2">adoption and they would say something</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:34.790" style="s2">along the lines of like well I could</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.109" end="00:53:38.089" style="s2">never adopt I only want to have one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.790" end="00:53:40.670" style="s2">my own and I&#39;d be like wow that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.089" end="00:53:42.950" style="s2">pretty hurtful I you know there&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.670" end="00:53:45.589" style="s2">think me feel very liberated about</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.950" end="00:53:46.760" style="s2">laying in the pro-life pro-choice I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.589" end="00:53:49.220" style="s2">in some way I feel like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.760" end="00:53:50.300" style="s2">discussion that women if men have babies</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.220" end="00:53:51.619" style="s2">then they could be in on it</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.300" end="00:53:52.670" style="s2">I think women should be able to decide</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.619" end="00:53:54.770" style="s2">what they&#39;re gonna do with their bodies</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.670" end="00:53:57.170" style="s2">but I think you know my own position is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.770" end="00:53:58.670" style="s2">very much of pro-choice partly because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.170" end="00:54:00.320" style="s2">feel like people don&#39;t it worked out</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.670" end="00:54:02.570" style="s2">really well for me and I&#39;m happy that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.320" end="00:54:04.609" style="s2">am and I&#39;m very grateful for my parents</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.570" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">everything it ain&#39;t so great for other</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.609" end="00:54:08.210" style="s2">people you know I mean I was basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">put in a basket and pushed up a river</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.210" end="00:54:12.530" style="s2">and some people you know they end up in</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:13.700" style="s2">every foster care doodlee foster care by</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.530" end="00:54:16.460" style="s2">for you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.700" end="00:54:18.230" style="s2">so I mean your odds of getting out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.460" end="00:54:21.050" style="s2">foster care if you&#39;re not on by age four</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.230" end="00:54:23.420" style="s2">is almost nil you kicked around and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.050" end="00:54:25.280" style="s2">you look at the suicide rates drug</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.420" end="00:54:27.740" style="s2">addiction rates the kind of form rates</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.280" end="00:54:30.079" style="s2">of people who end up served in that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.740" end="00:54:32.359" style="s2">a grim situation right so I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.079" end="00:54:34.609" style="s2">heard like everyday things when people</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.359" end="00:54:39.170" style="s2">say stuff like you know again whether</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.609" end="00:54:40.910" style="s2">it&#39;s national pride or any I used her in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.170" end="00:54:42.380" style="s2">Michigan and when the first things I</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.910" end="00:54:44.930" style="s2">heard and I was like maybe twenty nine</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.380" end="00:54:46.970" style="s2">heroes first got here people say well if</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.930" end="00:54:49.220" style="s2">you&#39;re not Dutch you&#39;re not March and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.970" end="00:54:52.819" style="s2">thought yeah it is Ryan so it must be</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.220" end="00:54:56.060" style="s2">true dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever heard like</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.819" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna take you didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.060" end="00:55:01.099" style="s2">control over what you were born into</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:03.020" style="s2">right so why would you</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.099" end="00:55:05.270" style="s2">you take pride over what you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.020" end="00:55:07.910" style="s2">accomplished what you have done what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.270" end="00:55:10.490" style="s2">have earned with your effort to sit and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.910" end="00:55:14.839" style="s2">take pride will be your ethnicity is</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.490" end="00:55:16.760" style="s2">kind of year yeah yeah as an adopted</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.839" end="00:55:19.069" style="s2">kids I think anybody else is adopted</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.760" end="00:55:22.819" style="s2">they know what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.069" end="00:55:27.910" style="s2">totally and it&#39;s it&#39;s a so John Parvati</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.819" end="00:55:30.619" style="s2">and Christopher who are up in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.910" end="00:55:32.209" style="s2">they just wrote a paper a paper based on</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.619" end="00:55:33.949" style="s2">a lot of our talk well not based on our</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.209" end="00:55:37.249" style="s2">dialogues but inspired by our dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.949" end="00:55:40.249" style="s2">and dialo goes and they were talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.249" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">about a they had they they prefaced the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.249" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">paper with the problem being that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:49.880" style="s2">the post-modernism in a certain way has</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:52.009" style="s2">eliminated the sense of otherness right</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.880" end="00:55:52.999" style="s2">so you only have the first position and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.009" end="00:55:56.420" style="s2">the third position</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.999" end="00:55:58.609" style="s2">right and because because it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.420" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">kind of identity and ethnicity and all</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.609" end="00:56:02.299" style="s2">these things that basically you you</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.559" end="00:56:05.209" style="s2">can&#39;t really take credit for you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.299" end="00:56:07.969" style="s2">kind of thrown into it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.209" end="00:56:10.279" style="s2">starting point which demarcates your</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.969" end="00:56:13.009" style="s2">value and your identity and all that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.279" end="00:56:15.829" style="s2">stuff it totally eliminates the process</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.009" end="00:56:20.059" style="s2">of sociality of inner relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.829" end="00:56:22.190" style="s2">it&#39;s magnified in how low down the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.059" end="00:56:25.880" style="s2">ladder and ineffective dialogue has</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.190" end="00:56:28.009" style="s2">become right is actually made ones up</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.880" end="00:56:30.229" style="s2">well my wife and I did a paper that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.009" end="00:56:32.539" style="s2">published the most probably almost 20</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.229" end="00:56:34.400" style="s2">years or so ago now but news on subject</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.539" end="00:56:36.949" style="s2">position and I think poor they did yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:39.079" style="s2">identity politics is just poison so much</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.949" end="00:56:41.809" style="s2">debate one of the first studies I did</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.079" end="00:56:44.930" style="s2">this was a graduate student handed out</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.809" end="00:56:47.239" style="s2">to people but I wrote the statement race</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.930" end="00:56:48.289" style="s2">relations have been bad in the past but</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.239" end="00:56:50.029" style="s2">I think they&#39;re getting a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.289" end="00:56:52.430" style="s2">better that was a statement and then I</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.029" end="00:56:54.890" style="s2">handed it out to different people but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.430" end="00:56:57.410" style="s2">said differently I said this was said by</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.890" end="00:56:59.690" style="s2">a 38 year old female this was said by a</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.410" end="00:57:01.099" style="s2">17 year old white male you should have</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.690" end="00:57:03.709" style="s2">heard the different reactions just by</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.099" end="00:57:05.749" style="s2">you just that information when you would</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.709" end="00:57:07.430" style="s2">say it was a 38 year old black female</p>
