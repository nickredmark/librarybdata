<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:14.070" style="s2">York Times article kind of announcing</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">the intellectual dialer it&#39;s right in</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">the center of the sort of the culture or</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:20.460" style="s2">the national conversation those things</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">are always in flux and it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.460" end="00:00:27.960" style="s2">most kind of fast-moving part of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">culture and is is the IDW still but</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.960" end="00:00:32.940" style="s2">going concern is it still alive is it</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">dead or where do you see it I mean do</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.940" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">you find my devotion to this ancient</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:40.710" style="s2">religion quaint you know I would ask you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">what I think the Jedi are dead right</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.710" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">because their temple was destroyed maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">just a few stragglers and remnants look</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">people believe whatever they want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">believe I mean that doesn&#39;t really</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s dead maybe it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.510" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">hibernation maybe in fact it actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">got its message out and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.309" style="s2">people are currently carrying the</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.309" end="00:01:02.969" style="s2">know because it was too easy</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.750" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">to pretend that Jordan Peterson wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.969" end="00:01:07.500" style="s2">in forced monogamy that sam harris was</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">in his llama photo that joe rogan was</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.500" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">some sort of a meathead right-winger</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">maybe the idea was that ben shapiro was</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">a closeted nazi who knows it&#39;s too easy</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">to take out individuals what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:23.100" style="s2">is you know wherever there&#39;s someone in</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:25.549" style="s2">danger of losing their job for making an</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">else is claiming or both there and not</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:36.290" style="s2">there at the same time wherever you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:38.280" style="s2">some situation where you need to keep a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.290" end="00:01:40.290" style="s2">facility open that can adjudicate</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.280" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">between fact and fantasy and people</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.290" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be pushed into some sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">of utopian vision that isn&#39;t theirs</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a little piece of IDW</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">there I don&#39;t know but the key issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">isn&#39;t is it alive or dead it&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:54.990" style="s2">it and that&#39;s always been the animating</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">question and I would like to think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.990" end="00:02:00.740" style="s2">just the way you know let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">weavers existed during the McCarthy era</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.740" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">in order to let people know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">something hadn&#39;t died completely I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">we did a pretty good job of keeping a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:12.910" style="s2">flame lit while the winds were blowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">at their strongest</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.910" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">I&#39;d like to think that at some level</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:19.690" style="s2">enough people are now carrying embers</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:21.820" style="s2">from that flame that I&#39;m a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.690" end="00:02:24.850" style="s2">worried about this going out completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.820" end="00:02:28.540" style="s2">but if you look at the run of Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.850" end="00:02:31.870" style="s2">yang which was much better than anyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.540" end="00:02:32.740" style="s2">thought could possibly he did much</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.870" end="00:02:35.080" style="s2">better than anyone thought he could</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.740" end="00:02:37.240" style="s2">possibly do given the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.080" end="00:02:39.790" style="s2">institutional resistance to even</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.240" end="00:02:41.350" style="s2">reporting his successes you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.790" end="00:02:43.240" style="s2">say that this has been a pretty powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.350" end="00:02:46.180" style="s2">movement I would say he would be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.240" end="00:02:48.250" style="s2">quintessential sort of IDW candidate I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.180" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">haven&#39;t said that before but I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.250" end="00:02:52.510" style="s2">it&#39;s fair to say now it wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:54.850" style="s2">necessary at UVI or everything that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.510" end="00:02:56.380" style="s2">wanted to do or say but he was somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.850" end="00:02:59.890" style="s2">who was coming out of the same energy</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.380" end="00:03:02.230" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s too early to say what</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.890" end="00:03:03.820" style="s2">the thing actually is and will be and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.230" end="00:03:05.590" style="s2">we&#39;re looking forward to getting Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.820" end="00:03:07.090" style="s2">Peterson back and maybe having some</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.590" end="00:03:09.850" style="s2">future collisions on some of these shows</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.090" end="00:03:13.270" style="s2">and you had a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.850" end="00:03:15.430" style="s2">conversation with sam harris at a live</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.270" end="00:03:19.030" style="s2">town hall event that he gave you named a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.430" end="00:03:20.440" style="s2">problem that i that i knew i had but i</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.030" end="00:03:23.140" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been thinking about it i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.440" end="00:03:25.990" style="s2">you that was you that was very useful</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.140" end="00:03:29.860" style="s2">for here and it&#39;s now i&#39;m worried so so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.990" end="00:03:33.220" style="s2">yeah well yeah so i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.860" end="00:03:36.160" style="s2">essentially a a year in a day since the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.220" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">IDW article appeared in The New York</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.160" end="00:03:42.820" style="s2">Times which had its own weird effect on</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:46.300" style="s2">the world and I think what we did is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.820" end="00:03:48.790" style="s2">that we created a an immune reaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.300" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">where the people who had jobs as</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.790" end="00:03:55.150" style="s2">professional commentators through</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:57.850" style="s2">institutions realized that there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.150" end="00:03:59.380" style="s2">some sort of a problem relative to their</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.850" end="00:04:01.210" style="s2">business model and they started</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.380" end="00:04:03.670" style="s2">attacking us with very low quality</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.210" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">attacks like you know when you when</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.670" end="00:04:08.650" style="s2">you&#39;re calling ben shapiro the alt-right</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:10.360" style="s2">something has gone wrong it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.650" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">obvious I don&#39;t know whether the kippah</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.360" end="00:04:15.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the effect on them that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.250" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean I think that we are are now</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.130" end="00:04:20.020" style="s2">finding ourselves in a world in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:22.180" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to even understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.020" end="00:04:24.040" style="s2">being said to us and I&#39;m just I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.180" end="00:04:25.780" style="s2">think it&#39;s you I&#39;m getting worse and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.040" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.780" end="00:04:30.670" style="s2">as the lousy terrible critiques that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:32.910" style="s2">motivated by the political economy of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.670" end="00:04:35.980" style="s2">failing business model rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.910" end="00:04:39.970" style="s2">intellectual charity and fairness and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.980" end="00:04:46.270" style="s2">sense of equanimity and comity as those</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.970" end="00:04:48.700" style="s2">attacks pile up I find that I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.270" end="00:04:50.710" style="s2">like playing against a bad tennis player</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.700" end="00:04:54.730" style="s2">and and my tennis game has just gone to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.710" end="00:04:56.410" style="s2">hell right so I have you had this</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.730" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">experience yeah yeah yeah well I I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.410" end="00:05:01.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t I yeah I knew I was I knew</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:03.370" style="s2">something was wrong but I didn&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.270" end="00:05:05.200" style="s2">was the problem he talked about that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.370" end="00:05:06.669" style="s2">from your perspective the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.200" end="00:05:08.890" style="s2">Darwin had created a kind of immune</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.669" end="00:05:12.010" style="s2">reaction from the mainstream media and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.890" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">the critiques have been so poor that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.010" end="00:05:16.330" style="s2">felt they were actually making you worse</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:18.990" style="s2">like a kind of poor tennis player in</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.330" end="00:05:22.120" style="s2">your games getting worse absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.990" end="00:05:25.479" style="s2">could you could you expand on that short</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.120" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">I mean the the big lazy critique is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.479" end="00:05:30.790" style="s2">you just used the word all right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:34.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a series of kill shots that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.790" end="00:05:35.740" style="s2">commentariat attempts to use from</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.360" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">wherever they&#39;re positioned at the</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.289" end="00:06:35.860" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone completely insane and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">where this argument really deranged is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.860" end="00:06:40.790" style="s2">that there have been so many bad lazy</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:45.080" style="s2">teks by people who are trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.790" end="00:06:48.170" style="s2">the commentary at a guild and don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.170" end="00:06:55.250" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s sort of the origin</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.260" end="00:06:56.210" style="s2">of why the conversation stalls out is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.250" end="00:06:58.250" style="s2">that they don&#39;t want to actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.210" end="00:07:00.860" style="s2">critique the ideas they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.250" end="00:07:04.190" style="s2">have a sit-down and and they attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.860" end="00:07:06.050" style="s2">use the penchant for free speech as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.190" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">additional kill shot so the idea is if</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.050" end="00:07:11.750" style="s2">they call you you know a mean white man</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:13.010" style="s2">or something like that and then you say</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.750" end="00:07:14.900" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna listen to this they say oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.010" end="00:07:16.130" style="s2">I thought what about my free speech okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.900" end="00:07:20.060" style="s2">well that&#39;s your argument that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.130" end="00:07:21.110" style="s2">level at which the schoolyard taunt you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.060" end="00:07:23.660" style="s2">know it&#39;s like I&#39;m rubber you&#39;re glue</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.110" end="00:07:27.380" style="s2">whatever you say bounces off me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.660" end="00:07:31.010" style="s2">the me and sticks to you that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.380" end="00:07:33.260" style="s2">retort or no means yes yes means no do</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.010" end="00:07:35.270" style="s2">you want me to hit you and so okay no</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.260" end="00:07:38.450" style="s2">then you get hit yes then you get hit I</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.270" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">get it so I went to third grade I failed</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.450" end="00:07:42.950" style="s2">third grade schoolyard stuff too that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:46.040" style="s2">the level at which the commentary in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.950" end="00:07:47.540" style="s2">general attacks the ideas of others are</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.040" end="00:07:50.480" style="s2">there any critiques that you think would</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.540" end="00:07:55.660" style="s2">have been valuable or been useful very</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.480" end="00:07:55.660" style="s2">few there have been a few but very few</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.260" end="00:07:59.260" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.790" end="00:08:15.950" style="s2">it&#39;s really been pretty slim pickins</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.550" end="00:08:19.760" style="s2">David Pakman at his best I think has</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.950" end="00:08:22.820" style="s2">been a pretty astute and fair observer</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.760" end="00:08:25.490" style="s2">on the harder I don&#39;t want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.820" end="00:08:31.130" style="s2">harder left means he saw sort of weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.490" end="00:08:32.510" style="s2">between the woke in the IDW you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.130" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">then there are people who are very smart</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.510" end="00:08:37.520" style="s2">like for example I think of Sam cedar is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:39.080" style="s2">being very informed on policy terms like</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.520" end="00:08:41.810" style="s2">he&#39;s actually following a particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.080" end="00:08:43.789" style="s2">bill or you know probably knows the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.810" end="00:08:48.260" style="s2">names of staffers on the hill that kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.789" end="00:08:50.360" style="s2">of granular detail the problem with him</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.260" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">is that he&#39;s got a strong trolling game</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.360" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">and kind of a comedic ridicule game that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:57.860" style="s2">is a turn-off to I mean it&#39;s okay as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:02.120" style="s2">wit but it&#39;s not okay as a main course</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.860" end="00:09:06.710" style="s2">and so I think that you could pick</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.120" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">through the Sam cedar stuff and find</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.710" end="00:09:11.060" style="s2">reasonable stuff but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:13.790" style="s2">recommend it because of the reliance on</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.060" end="00:09:16.250" style="s2">ridicule also in the conversation of sam</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.790" end="00:09:17.930" style="s2">harris he talked about that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.250" end="00:09:19.670" style="s2">criticisms of the intellect of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.930" end="00:09:22.460" style="s2">members of the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.670" end="00:09:25.400" style="s2">were made by people in the legacy media</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.460" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">who had kind of inherited their their</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.400" end="00:09:30.290" style="s2">seats what are my responsibilities we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:33.230" style="s2">never worked this out we&#39;ve never had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.290" end="00:09:36.050" style="s2">really good conversation about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.230" end="00:09:38.630" style="s2">that the sam harris platform and the sam</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.050" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">harris human are very different than</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.630" end="00:09:44.060" style="s2">than let&#39;s say the Michelle Goldberg</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">human on the New York Times platform and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.060" end="00:09:48.530" style="s2">a lot of these traditional commentators</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:50.450" style="s2">have lower engagement as individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.530" end="00:09:53.540" style="s2">if you think about the fusion between</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.450" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">the chair and the human the chair has a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.540" end="00:09:57.560" style="s2">lot of the power like anytime the New</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:10:00.140" style="s2">York Times says that person there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.560" end="00:10:01.970" style="s2">worth listening to that person whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.140" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">they have interesting ideas or not or</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.970" end="00:10:06.740" style="s2">good or bad ideas become super important</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:09.290" style="s2">because they inherit power from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.740" end="00:10:11.510" style="s2">chair so now in that sort of set of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.290" end="00:10:13.730" style="s2">responsibilities comes through to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.510" end="00:10:17.180" style="s2">like I don&#39;t have a book I&#39;ve never show</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.730" end="00:10:18.410" style="s2">I got nothing I just I I my wife tells</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.180" end="00:10:20.269" style="s2">me you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.410" end="00:10:21.980" style="s2">your theories go to Twitter and try it</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.269" end="00:10:23.959" style="s2">out with you with your audience you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.980" end="00:10:25.730" style="s2">like that&#39;s my platform and then I hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.959" end="00:10:27.290" style="s2">things like Eric you have a platform you</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.730" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">have a tremendous responsibility it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.290" end="00:10:32.420" style="s2">what platform I just I signed up for</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:35.449" style="s2">Twitter and that that kind of weird new</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.420" end="00:10:37.910" style="s2">problem is super interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.449" end="00:10:39.889" style="s2">I&#39;ve never really had to think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.910" end="00:10:44.629" style="s2">this I built the entire thing completely</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.889" end="00:10:46.279" style="s2">100% by myself you know while I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.629" end="00:10:47.629" style="s2">doing the dishes and I&#39;ll I&#39;ll type</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.279" end="00:10:48.860" style="s2">something and then suddenly you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.629" end="00:10:50.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a thousand people who are angry</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.860" end="00:10:52.519" style="s2">at me or really interested in something</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.600" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">I&#39;ve to say we haven&#39;t had the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.519" end="00:10:56.990" style="s2">discussion about the ethics of what if</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:10:58.850" style="s2">you succeed at what it is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.990" end="00:11:01.310" style="s2">doing on social media we and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.850" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">inheriting these questions from people</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.310" end="00:11:04.459" style="s2">who inherited their platforms and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:06.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t in here in our platforms we built</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.459" end="00:11:10.430" style="s2">our platforms so we&#39;ve never actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.620" end="00:11:12.319" style="s2">had a really good ethics discussion also</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.430" end="00:11:14.269" style="s2">about dining ala carte there are very</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.319" end="00:11:16.519" style="s2">few people who are so horrible that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.269" end="00:11:18.589" style="s2">they&#39;ve never said anything remotely</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.519" end="00:11:21.350" style="s2">interesting or reasonable I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.589" end="00:11:23.870" style="s2">challenge you Jeffrey Dahmer or you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.350" end="00:11:25.699" style="s2">Ted Bundy probably said reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.870" end="00:11:28.939" style="s2">things you know past past the sugar</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.699" end="00:11:31.130" style="s2">please you know not every instance of an</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.939" end="00:11:33.560" style="s2">utterance from a bad person a horrible</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.130" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">person is horrible or without content</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.560" end="00:11:39.139" style="s2">and so a lot of the criticisms were sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:41.480" style="s2">of set of journalistic ethics that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.139" end="00:11:43.639" style="s2">weren&#39;t you thought were were not</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.480" end="00:11:47.389" style="s2">appropriate for some of you built that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.639" end="00:11:50.329" style="s2">plant in my hand absolutely well the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.389" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">idea is if suddenly if you&#39;ve been given</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.329" end="00:11:57.139" style="s2">a position at let&#39;s say the Atlantic or</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:59.750" style="s2">the New York Times your power is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.139" end="00:12:03.559" style="s2">fusion between the chair in which you</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.750" end="00:12:05.630" style="s2">sit and yourself the chair has most of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.559" end="00:12:07.819" style="s2">that power where you to leave that chair</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.630" end="00:12:11.449" style="s2">would anyone even be listening to you or</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.819" end="00:12:13.459" style="s2">how small would your audience be so when</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.449" end="00:12:15.709" style="s2">you have that sort of a situation you</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.459" end="00:12:17.750" style="s2">you you can talk about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.709" end="00:12:20.600" style="s2">somebody is abusing the power of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.750" end="00:12:22.879" style="s2">chair that they have inherited even the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.600" end="00:12:27.410" style="s2">concept of platforming somebody I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.879" end="00:12:29.480" style="s2">this was not a verb that I was aware of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.410" end="00:12:31.309" style="s2">until very recently I&#39;m sure we could do</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.480" end="00:12:32.329" style="s2">a Google Ngram search and find out that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.309" end="00:12:35.389" style="s2">it&#39;s relatively recent</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.329" end="00:12:37.009" style="s2">in origin now when somebody says well</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.389" end="00:12:39.829" style="s2">you have a platform you have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.009" end="00:12:43.339" style="s2">responsibility I think wait what</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.829" end="00:12:44.029" style="s2">I have a youtube channel like you have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.339" end="00:12:45.860" style="s2">YouTube account</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.029" end="00:12:47.089" style="s2">I have a YouTube account well your</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.089" end="00:12:53.239" style="s2">thousand subscribers yes but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.230" end="00:12:56.239" style="s2">because people started subscribing to my</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.459" end="00:13:03.439" style="s2">and then I have the responsibility of</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.439" end="00:13:07.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like screw off what the hell are</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.829" end="00:13:23.239" style="s2">a large platform what are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.600" end="00:13:26.149" style="s2">do it like PewDiePie well who the hell</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.239" end="00:13:29.029" style="s2">is PewDiePie I mean PewDiePie is a guy</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.149" end="00:13:31.790" style="s2">with the channel and whatever he did it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.029" end="00:13:33.410" style="s2">built an incredible followership now</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.790" end="00:13:35.170" style="s2">does he have responsibilities yes but</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.410" end="00:13:37.819" style="s2">really as an individual he has</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.170" end="00:13:39.769" style="s2">responsibilities and I I do agree that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.819" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a little bit daunting that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.769" end="00:13:44.449" style="s2">he&#39;s got this many people listening to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:46.489" style="s2">him but on the other hand it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.449" end="00:13:48.169" style="s2">different than the idea of this has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.489" end="00:13:49.939" style="s2">passed to you and you must pass it to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.169" end="00:13:53.269" style="s2">the next person and that that this</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.939" end="00:13:54.679" style="s2">vehicle effectively came with most of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.269" end="00:13:59.209" style="s2">the interest we chose you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.679" end="00:14:00.379" style="s2">and we gifted you this power so now with</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.209" end="00:14:02.689" style="s2">great power comes great responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.379" end="00:14:05.529" style="s2">that&#39;s very different than somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.689" end="00:14:08.239" style="s2">built something with their own sweat and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.529" end="00:14:10.999" style="s2">people flocked to it that&#39;s the market</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.239" end="00:14:12.850" style="s2">saying okay well I&#39;m gonna forego all</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.999" end="00:14:15.889" style="s2">the pleasures of listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.850" end="00:14:17.869" style="s2">synchronized legacy stuff and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.889" end="00:14:20.449" style="s2">actually dine ala carte off the menu</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.869" end="00:14:22.100" style="s2">because this is really interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.449" end="00:14:24.319" style="s2">because I come from I worked in the</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.230" end="00:14:30.879" style="s2">of those kind of mainstream media values</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.119" end="00:14:33.230" style="s2">and I&#39;m sort of seeing how they apply to</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.230" end="00:14:39.499" style="s2">years and at their best I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:42.110" style="s2">some of the values are good faith</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.499" end="00:14:42.920" style="s2">engagement it&#39;s that you should or if</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.050" end="00:14:52.730" style="s2">seemed like a good a good rule of thumb</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.180" end="00:14:55.490" style="s2">that you would give space for for people</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.730" end="00:14:57.110" style="s2">to respond and you will I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.490" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">fact-checking should be integral to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.110" end="00:14:59.930" style="s2">journalism we can kind of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:01.370" style="s2">that the mainstream media is not</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.959" end="00:15:09.910" style="s2">this other thing a free pass I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:11.959" style="s2">this is where the gonzo critique of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.910" end="00:15:13.730" style="s2">journalism comes in it&#39;s like would you</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.010" end="00:16:31.490" style="s2">very funny that you&#39;ve developed all</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.899" end="00:16:33.350" style="s2">these strong feelings and beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.490" end="00:16:35.750" style="s2">entitlements but it is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.350" end="00:16:37.670" style="s2">I think I completely agree with the rise</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.750" end="00:16:39.050" style="s2">of the alternative media has shown up</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.670" end="00:16:40.430" style="s2">that the mainstream media has it</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.050" end="00:16:43.069" style="s2">perspective like this kind of God&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.430" end="00:16:44.870" style="s2">view affectation is shown more and more</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.069" end="00:16:47.060" style="s2">as an affectation like it&#39;s very obvious</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.870" end="00:16:49.610" style="s2">well look at the mug Twitter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.060" end="00:16:51.230" style="s2">they&#39;re the most biased completely</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.610" end="00:16:54.110" style="s2">activist people you could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.230" end="00:16:55.819" style="s2">pretending that you know I whenever I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.110" end="00:16:56.200" style="s2">get one of these people I would say can</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.819" end="00:16:57.910" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.200" end="00:16:59.170" style="s2">over the journalistic code of ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.910" end="00:17:02.680" style="s2">see which points because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.170" end="00:17:04.839" style="s2">violating three a paragraph two but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.680" end="00:17:05.890" style="s2">would say that you&#39;ve also hinted at</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.839" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">what some of the other failure</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.890" end="00:17:08.890" style="s2">conditions of the new sense making</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">platforms are and they&#39;re very human</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.890" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">failings they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.630" end="00:17:15.370" style="s2">potentially audience capture they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:17.680" style="s2">friendships and human human contact or</p>

<p begin="00:17:21.490" end="00:17:25.209" style="s2">could be but one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.440" end="00:17:27.699" style="s2">like to do I think is to say well so and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.209" end="00:17:29.740" style="s2">so is my friend I have a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.699" end="00:17:31.210" style="s2">private information but like you know I</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.740" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s a secret that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.210" end="00:17:36.040" style="s2">like been Shapiro&#39;s red-meat act and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">call it the red meat act that&#39;s about as</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.040" end="00:17:39.400" style="s2">far as I want to go I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:41.950" style="s2">undermine Ben&#39;s ability to earn a living</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.400" end="00:17:44.350" style="s2">or produce an entertaining news analysis</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.950" end="00:17:49.000" style="s2">product and I&#39;ve taken him to task in</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.350" end="00:17:51.060" style="s2">public but in private when I call him up</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.000" end="00:17:55.990" style="s2">he&#39;s about the most responsive</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.060" end="00:17:57.610" style="s2">reasonable tolerant kind person in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.990" end="00:17:59.590" style="s2">one-on-one now that is a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.610" end="00:18:02.050" style="s2">uncomfortable because I don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.590" end="00:18:04.810" style="s2">same person on the phone as the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.050" end="00:18:06.220" style="s2">firebrand who sits behind the desk are</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.810" end="00:18:08.470" style="s2">those two people connected they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.220" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">absolutely connected Ben and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.470" end="00:18:12.700" style="s2">share the same perspectives on the phone</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">but we probably shared 90 95 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.700" end="00:18:20.020" style="s2">the analysis and then there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:22.780" style="s2">very extreme turn at the end but I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.020" end="00:18:25.090" style="s2">that my people are much more anybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.780" end="00:18:27.610" style="s2">listening to me is much better informed</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.090" end="00:18:29.710" style="s2">about the fact that this dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.610" end="00:18:32.530" style="s2">between public Ben and private Ben even</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.710" end="00:18:34.450" style="s2">exists so I would claim that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.530" end="00:18:36.670" style="s2">actually getting better information from</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.450" end="00:18:38.500" style="s2">me than you are somebody say I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.670" end="00:18:41.380" style="s2">never talk to a person like ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.500" end="00:18:44.740" style="s2">because once in 2009 he said the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.380" end="00:18:46.710" style="s2">following thing yeah and just talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.740" end="00:18:48.520" style="s2">about kind of the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.710" end="00:18:50.260" style="s2">journalistic ethics within the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.520" end="00:18:52.750" style="s2">alternative media but it seems that i</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.260" end="00:18:55.840" style="s2">was looking at and was really interested</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.750" end="00:18:58.270" style="s2">by was Joe Rogan&#39;s interview with Jack</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.840" end="00:19:00.190" style="s2">Dorsey where he got this huge pushback</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.270" end="00:19:02.050" style="s2">from his audience and then in the I</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.190" end="00:19:04.630" style="s2">think the podcast afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.050" end="00:19:06.490" style="s2">so just to recap for people so Jack kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.630" end="00:19:08.590" style="s2">of basically stonewalled didn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.490" end="00:19:09.670" style="s2">particularly kind of complete answers</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.590" end="00:19:11.350" style="s2">and Joe</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.670" end="00:19:13.630" style="s2">maybe didn&#39;t didn&#39;t know enough to kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.350" end="00:19:14.950" style="s2">of push back and kind of it was a as joe</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.630" end="00:19:16.810" style="s2">said it was a kind of crappy interview</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.950" end="00:19:18.790" style="s2">but in the next in the next interview I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.810" end="00:19:20.950" style="s2">think the Sam Harris he went through</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.790" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">that interview and was kind of like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.950" end="00:19:24.730" style="s2">got this responsibility that I never</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:26.680" style="s2">asked for and never knew that I had I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.730" end="00:19:28.360" style="s2">just like talking to people and so be my</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.680" end="00:19:32.620" style="s2">audience has given me all of this crap</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.360" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">for not asking Jack Daugherty to defend</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.620" end="00:19:36.220" style="s2">sort of Twitter&#39;s banning and the way</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:38.200" style="s2">that Twitter censors people in their</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.220" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">platform and companies audience really</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.200" end="00:19:42.070" style="s2">felt like he&#39;d let them down and what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:43.690" style="s2">really respected about Joe is that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.070" end="00:19:45.340" style="s2">saw him go through this process of I</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.690" end="00:19:48.010" style="s2">never asked for this responsibility but</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.340" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">now I realize that I have it I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.010" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do better he got Tim Poole on</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:54.970" style="s2">for one of the future shows to have Jack</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:58.750" style="s2">Dorsey on again but then Jack Dorsey</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.970" end="00:20:01.510" style="s2">came on with a with the lawyer sure but</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.750" end="00:20:02.860" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is that I what I feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.510" end="00:20:05.110" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing with Joe Rogan is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.860" end="00:20:07.510" style="s2">evolution in real time of this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.110" end="00:20:09.310" style="s2">actually and actually taking on some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.510" end="00:20:11.710" style="s2">the responsibilities that he never</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.310" end="00:20:13.990" style="s2">really asked for do you see the same way</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.710" end="00:20:17.170" style="s2">not exactly I mean I think you know at</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.990" end="00:20:19.590" style="s2">some point I think I got a call from Joe</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.170" end="00:20:22.990" style="s2">or a text message I couldn&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.590" end="00:20:24.580" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to reveal the private</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.990" end="00:20:26.050" style="s2">contents but more or less he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.580" end="00:20:27.490" style="s2">like what did I just do I just said</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.050" end="00:20:30.550" style="s2">something about Bernie and suddenly the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.490" end="00:20:32.050" style="s2">Bernie Sanders campaign is running you</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.550" end="00:20:35.080" style="s2">know some sort of ad that says that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.050" end="00:20:37.540" style="s2">towards Tim I was like well sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.080" end="00:20:40.330" style="s2">did in accordance with the new rules of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.540" end="00:20:43.870" style="s2">the world I think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.330" end="00:20:47.980" style="s2">a lot of us are doing is trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.870" end="00:20:51.850" style="s2">these expectations about do you endorse</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.980" end="00:20:55.540" style="s2">do you condemn do you condone you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.850" end="00:20:55.870" style="s2">just like would you shut up I&#39;m a human</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.540" end="00:20:57.670" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.870" end="00:20:59.380" style="s2">I talked to people I don&#39;t check all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.670" end="00:21:01.690" style="s2">their backgrounds all the time I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.380" end="00:21:05.710" style="s2">know if they&#39;ve had a tweet you know in</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.690" end="00:21:07.390" style="s2">2011 that you know looks terrible and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.710" end="00:21:09.310" style="s2">then I start to learn the context and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.390" end="00:21:13.750" style="s2">now I find the whole history it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.310" end="00:21:15.970" style="s2">you can&#39;t move through the world if</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.750" end="00:21:17.620" style="s2">you&#39;re saddled with all so is it great</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.970" end="00:21:19.630" style="s2">that Joe is thinking a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.620" end="00:21:22.390" style="s2">about the responsibilities of being</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.630" end="00:21:24.010" style="s2">effectively the largest show out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.390" end="00:21:25.480" style="s2">yeah I think to an extent and if he</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.010" end="00:21:26.830" style="s2">overthinks that it&#39;s gonna be terrible</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.480" end="00:21:28.060" style="s2">because then you&#39;re not going to have an</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.830" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">authentic person you&#39;re gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.060" end="00:21:33.670" style="s2">same thing creeping in to to Joe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:37.300" style="s2">thought process and will be self</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.670" end="00:21:39.340" style="s2">censorious so I think we should take on</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.300" end="00:21:43.660" style="s2">some amount of ethics and we should also</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.340" end="00:21:46.360" style="s2">give ourselves a budget for ethical</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.660" end="00:21:49.240" style="s2">failings for failures of reason for</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.360" end="00:21:51.220" style="s2">failures of fairness and do I think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.240" end="00:21:53.230" style="s2">institutions should have much lower</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.220" end="00:21:56.080" style="s2">budgets yeah their their institutions</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.230" end="00:21:57.940" style="s2">they&#39;re funded their long-term things</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.080" end="00:22:00.400" style="s2">that were not usually built by any of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.940" end="00:22:02.500" style="s2">the people who were in them so I believe</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.400" end="00:22:05.880" style="s2">the institutional responsibilities are</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.500" end="00:22:08.800" style="s2">far too low and the game is - voiced</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.880" end="00:22:10.570" style="s2">personal responsibility on to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.800" end="00:22:14.200" style="s2">individuals who are outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.570" end="00:22:15.490" style="s2">Citadel so I&#39;m excited about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.200" end="00:22:17.140" style="s2">that Joe wants to take on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.490" end="00:22:18.700" style="s2">responsibility because I think he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.140" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">good guy who wants to do well by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.700" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">world do I believe that he has the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:28.300" style="s2">responsibilities as the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:29.890" style="s2">for fact-checking for you know he says</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.300" end="00:22:32.350" style="s2">things like I voted for Gary Johnson</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.890" end="00:22:35.050" style="s2">because he came on my show or I&#39;ve met</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.350" end="00:22:37.300" style="s2">with people and I really like Tulsi yang</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.050" end="00:22:38.500" style="s2">and Sanders because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.300" end="00:22:41.500" style="s2">corporate people and I&#39;m not a corporate</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.500" end="00:22:44.110" style="s2">comic comedian but that is the level at</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.500" end="00:22:46.450" style="s2">which you&#39;re getting the analysis he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.110" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">speaking as a human being as human being</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.450" end="00:22:51.580" style="s2">speak he&#39;s not speaking the way somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:54.130" style="s2">from a management consulting firm or a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.580" end="00:22:56.530" style="s2">PR agency would coach you to speak I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.130" end="00:22:58.930" style="s2">think that&#39;s very important one thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.530" end="00:23:01.000" style="s2">that I like to talk about is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.930" end="00:23:03.790" style="s2">good faith and bad faith please because</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.000" end="00:23:06.250" style="s2">one of the one of the things that I see</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.790" end="00:23:09.190" style="s2">a lot in the in the news of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.250" end="00:23:11.140" style="s2">media is some kind of gatekeeping based</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.190" end="00:23:12.190" style="s2">on who&#39;s good faith and who&#39;s bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.140" end="00:23:14.650" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.190" end="00:23:17.500" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s a paradox in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.650" end="00:23:19.690" style="s2">because you can have sort of you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.500" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">decide okay this person&#39;s bad faith it</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.690" end="00:23:22.990" style="s2">seems to be a subjective judgment that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:25.030" style="s2">has always kind of laid on someone else</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.990" end="00:23:25.900" style="s2">but I can&#39;t imagine a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.030" end="00:23:27.400" style="s2">you say oh I&#39;m not gonna talk to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.900" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">because you&#39;re bad faith and then a few</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.400" end="00:23:30.670" style="s2">months later they so I come back in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:32.170" style="s2">way you were right actually go back then</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.670" end="00:23:34.930" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t bad faith from now I&#39;m in good</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.170" end="00:23:36.340" style="s2">faith but no one like what does that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.930" end="00:23:37.450" style="s2">actually mean to say that someone isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.340" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">good I think that that&#39;s quite true</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.450" end="00:23:42.820" style="s2">David no I think some people</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:44.110" style="s2">self-identify for examples as trolls mmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.820" end="00:23:46.960" style="s2">like you meet somebody and say yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.110" end="00:23:48.910" style="s2">troll game is strong yeah I just enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.960" end="00:23:51.340" style="s2">dunking on people on the internet like</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.910" end="00:23:53.320" style="s2">that that I&#39;m using the word as they</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.340" end="00:23:55.780" style="s2">would use the word and I&#39;m making fun of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.320" end="00:23:58.210" style="s2">it I think that you know if I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.780" end="00:24:00.010" style="s2">about what sam cedars perspective was on</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.210" end="00:24:02.140" style="s2">dave rubin it was Dave Reubens a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.010" end="00:24:04.810" style="s2">dangerous guy and I wish to neutralize</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.140" end="00:24:06.850" style="s2">the danger through ridicule right so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.810" end="00:24:09.640" style="s2">think people will own that in many</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.850" end="00:24:13.660" style="s2">circumstances and they&#39;ll say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.640" end="00:24:18.160" style="s2">employing a tool for amusement for</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.660" end="00:24:20.020" style="s2">social good and you know when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.160" end="00:24:22.020" style="s2">to like a good faith bad faith I just</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.020" end="00:24:25.290" style="s2">got into a really unpleasant interchange</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.020" end="00:24:28.660" style="s2">with Yasmine Mohammed about his jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.290" end="00:24:30.730" style="s2">she thought I was saying one thing which</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.660" end="00:24:32.140" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t saying and so she was reacting</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.730" end="00:24:34.870" style="s2">to that thing that she thought I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.140" end="00:24:36.460" style="s2">saying and I had the sense of well these</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.870" end="00:24:37.870" style="s2">are really unpleasant arguments you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.460" end="00:24:39.280" style="s2">making back to me you&#39;re treating me</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.870" end="00:24:41.590" style="s2">like a fool and you&#39;re treating me as</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.280" end="00:24:43.240" style="s2">somebody with no experience no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.590" end="00:24:46.050" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about which I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.240" end="00:24:48.250" style="s2">think was true and so the question was</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.050" end="00:24:50.050" style="s2">do I think I&#39;m dealing with somebody of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:51.250" style="s2">good faith and I should place a call or</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.050" end="00:24:53.470" style="s2">do I think I&#39;m dealing with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.250" end="00:24:55.060" style="s2">who&#39;s into a gotcha game who simply</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.470" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">wants to put a trophy head on her wall</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.060" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">and I&#39;d had some interaction with before</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:02.680" style="s2">I thought very highly of her so I said I</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.540" style="s2">bet good faith doesn&#39;t seem like good</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.680" end="00:25:05.500" style="s2">faith at the moment but let&#39;s stick it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.540" end="00:25:08.530" style="s2">out let&#39;s see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.500" end="00:25:10.660" style="s2">sure enough takes about 20 minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.530" end="00:25:14.050" style="s2">sort out oh that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.660" end="00:25:16.300" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying cool yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.050" end="00:25:18.610" style="s2">called each other forget who placed the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.300" end="00:25:22.330" style="s2">final call that connected but the key</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.610" end="00:25:23.800" style="s2">point is I wasn&#39;t out to get her I</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.330" end="00:25:26.470" style="s2">wasn&#39;t out to destroy what she was</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.800" end="00:25:29.020" style="s2">trying to say I would happily signed on</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.470" end="00:25:31.900" style="s2">for every percentage of what she was</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.020" end="00:25:36.160" style="s2">saying that I would agree with and as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.900" end="00:25:38.380" style="s2">result I didn&#39;t think that scoring a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.160" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">point on the person was a part of either</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.380" end="00:25:42.490" style="s2">person&#39;s agenda</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:44.920" style="s2">I think actually you can generally</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.490" end="00:25:47.800" style="s2">ascertain not whether somebody is a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.920" end="00:25:50.380" style="s2">faith person or a bad faith person but</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.800" end="00:25:53.470" style="s2">whether that person is behaving in good</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.380" end="00:25:55.450" style="s2">faith or bad faith towards you like for</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.470" end="00:25:57.820" style="s2">example I&#39;ve seen Michael malleus say a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.450" end="00:26:00.370" style="s2">lot of very intelligent things very</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.820" end="00:26:01.300" style="s2">thoughtful things and I&#39;ve also seen him</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.370" end="00:26:03.370" style="s2">just be a dick</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.300" end="00:26:05.380" style="s2">and so when he encountered me the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.370" end="00:26:07.000" style="s2">day Twitter I was like I wonder which</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.380" end="00:26:09.280" style="s2">Michael malice I&#39;m gonna get and he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.000" end="00:26:11.140" style="s2">just sort of being a dick I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.280" end="00:26:12.520" style="s2">like is this really the modality you</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.140" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">want to choose with me he&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.520" end="00:26:18.160" style="s2">let&#39;s double down okay got it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:20.440" style="s2">unfortunate because I&#39;d seen him make</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.160" end="00:26:22.810" style="s2">some very insightful comments I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.440" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">point is about good faith bad faith is</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.810" end="00:26:28.840" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen it used like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:30.910" style="s2">lot of conversations that are that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.840" end="00:26:35.320" style="s2">almost I&#39;ve always seen it used in a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.910" end="00:26:36.730" style="s2">as kind of on the on the center as a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.320" end="00:26:38.620" style="s2">of sort of not engaging with certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.730" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">people rightly or wrongly it&#39;s not often</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.620" end="00:26:42.220" style="s2">given as a reason for not engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:45.430" style="s2">certain people that almost seems like an</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.220" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">inverse of the no platforming tactics on</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.430" end="00:26:50.740" style="s2">on the Left what I&#39;ve been through this</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:53.620" style="s2">with you it&#39;s very important to exclude</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.740" end="00:26:54.850" style="s2">people from conversation how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.620" end="00:26:56.560" style="s2">that how do you know that those</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.850" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">decisions are being made now how can you</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.560" end="00:27:01.960" style="s2">tell the difference right how can you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:04.300" style="s2">know that it&#39;s a good faith decision of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.960" end="00:27:06.010" style="s2">bad faith or good good faith declaration</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.300" end="00:27:09.280" style="s2">of good faithful but that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.010" end="00:27:12.760" style="s2">problem it&#39;s an issue of skill mmm you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.280" end="00:27:15.130" style="s2">see discernment well it&#39;s yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.760" end="00:27:16.810" style="s2">the dirty secret that nobody really</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.130" end="00:27:20.410" style="s2">wants to discuss that whether or not a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.810" end="00:27:22.900" style="s2">society thrives or dies often can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.410" end="00:27:24.520" style="s2">written into the rules in a precise way</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.900" end="00:27:26.650" style="s2">because everyone will read the rules and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:29.230" style="s2">attempt to game them oh but it says here</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.650" end="00:27:30.220" style="s2">in paragraph 7 that if I do this that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.230" end="00:27:32.440" style="s2">the other thing you can&#39;t say anything</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.220" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">so Manion and yeah okay well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.440" end="00:27:36.340" style="s2">great so you figured out a way around</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:42.300" style="s2">the rules you&#39;ve arbitrage the letter</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.340" end="00:27:44.950" style="s2">against the spirit now in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.300" end="00:27:47.530" style="s2">excluding people from conversations the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.950" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">key question that I usually have is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.530" end="00:27:52.090" style="s2">this person attempting to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:53.500" style="s2">constructive or not are they interested</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.090" end="00:27:56.590" style="s2">in the underlying point</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.500" end="00:27:59.559" style="s2">or are they interested in victories wins</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.590" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">and losses I think that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.559" end="00:28:04.150" style="s2">inside of what you would call the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:06.820" style="s2">some of them are interested</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.150" end="00:28:08.140" style="s2">sometimes in wins and losses and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.820" end="00:28:11.710" style="s2">know I&#39;ve been interested in wins and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.140" end="00:28:14.980" style="s2">losses it&#39;s not a huge part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.710" end="00:28:18.130" style="s2">want to be doing and in general to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.980" end="00:28:19.720" style="s2">somebody give you the chance you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.130" end="00:28:21.730" style="s2">there are rules for fighting you smack</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.720" end="00:28:24.429" style="s2">somebody to the curb hard and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.730" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">decisive victory and you think well of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.429" end="00:28:28.299" style="s2">your opponent you offer that person to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">hand up and then you say wow I thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.299" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">you really had me if you don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:36.909" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of a dick and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:39.610" style="s2">really important to understand that in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.909" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">fighting if your goal is to just hang</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.610" end="00:28:44.289" style="s2">other people&#39;s heads on your trophy wall</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:46.030" style="s2">I would call that not good faith now</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.289" end="00:28:48.610" style="s2">what I engage in that if I thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.030" end="00:28:51.309" style="s2">somebody was a real danger and they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.610" end="00:28:52.990" style="s2">just a terrible faith act or maybe but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.309" end="00:28:57.240" style="s2">I think that a lot of us take a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.990" end="00:28:59.230" style="s2">pains to not back people into corners</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.240" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">unnecessarily to not use gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.230" end="00:29:05.470" style="s2">techniques to not attempt to humiliate</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:07.419" style="s2">people to not come in guns blazing there</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.470" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">are all sorts of devices that kill you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.419" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">off that somebody shouldn&#39;t be taken</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:14.650" style="s2">seriously even if they&#39;re making a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:17.049" style="s2">point it&#39;s like you know if there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.650" end="00:29:20.200" style="s2">much internet speak and what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.049" end="00:29:23.950" style="s2">doing too much haha like very often if I</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.200" end="00:29:25.480" style="s2">see a lot of attempts at ridicule I just</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.950" end="00:29:27.250" style="s2">don&#39;t even talk to the person not</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.480" end="00:29:29.650" style="s2">because ridicule didn&#39;t previously have</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.250" end="00:29:33.640" style="s2">a place but because there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.650" end="00:29:37.210" style="s2">about the internet where the premium on</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.640" end="00:29:39.610" style="s2">ridicule is absolutely metastatic with</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.210" end="00:29:41.650" style="s2">respect to what its effect on</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.610" end="00:29:44.260" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s almost no recovery</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.650" end="00:29:46.840" style="s2">from talking to somebody whose principle</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.260" end="00:29:48.220" style="s2">modality is ridicule and you mentioned I</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.840" end="00:29:52.630" style="s2">mean you mentioned Sam cedar in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.220" end="00:29:54.370" style="s2">context and you taught it about in at</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.630" end="00:29:58.179" style="s2">length with sam harris and one of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.370" end="00:30:00.909" style="s2">recent podcasts yeah because it means</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.179" end="00:30:03.130" style="s2">the sadness yeah because i think sam</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.909" end="00:30:04.299" style="s2">cedar has a lot to offer as does michael</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.130" end="00:30:05.020" style="s2">malice that&#39;s somebody on the left</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.299" end="00:30:09.850" style="s2">somebody on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.020" end="00:30:12.850" style="s2">and they both spend sort of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.850" end="00:30:15.150" style="s2">time just trying to hurt people I I feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.850" end="00:30:17.860" style="s2">personally uncomfortable watching that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.150" end="00:30:21.040" style="s2">talking about him quite at length there</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.860" end="00:30:22.750" style="s2">and not engaging like if that was me</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.040" end="00:30:24.700" style="s2">being talked about by someone else I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.750" end="00:30:26.140" style="s2">feel like hang on why are you not saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.700" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">why are you not having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.140" end="00:30:29.230" style="s2">with me why why oh why are we not having</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:32.320" style="s2">this conversation we don&#39;t agree on what</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.230" end="00:30:35.530" style="s2">the rules are David I mean if you say</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.320" end="00:30:38.100" style="s2">you know that moment when Mike Tyson bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.530" end="00:30:41.560" style="s2">off somebody&#39;s ear that was awesome</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.100" end="00:30:43.300" style="s2">because it&#39;s combat my feeling is okay I</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.560" end="00:30:45.130" style="s2">get it so you have an idea of greater</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.300" end="00:30:47.860" style="s2">combat you probably think that a finger</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.130" end="00:30:49.780" style="s2">in the eye is hilarious and my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.860" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">is those aren&#39;t the rules of boxing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.780" end="00:30:53.860" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in so it&#39;s not that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.230" style="s2">can&#39;t see the uf skill as a boxer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.860" end="00:30:58.300" style="s2">that you have an idea that war is war</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.230" end="00:30:59.950" style="s2">and only you know never give a sucker an</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.300" end="00:31:00.670" style="s2">even break and so if those are your</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.950" end="00:31:03.430" style="s2">rules</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.670" end="00:31:04.660" style="s2">you know why nobody wants to step in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.430" end="00:31:09.100" style="s2">ring with you because you bite people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.660" end="00:31:11.260" style="s2">ears off mmm would you do you not think</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.100" end="00:31:12.820" style="s2">you could engage him and call out those</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.260" end="00:31:14.910" style="s2">tactics I called him up we had a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.820" end="00:31:17.140" style="s2">perfectly reasonable conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.910" end="00:31:18.100" style="s2">understood his perspective I think he</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.140" end="00:31:20.050" style="s2">understood mine</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.100" end="00:31:22.510" style="s2">I think his perspective was that</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.680" end="00:32:40.060" style="s2">frame of the intellectual Darkover at</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.480" end="00:32:44.140" style="s2">the beginning or my hope for it was this</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.060" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">sense of could this be my public</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.140" end="00:32:48.580" style="s2">intellectuals coming together this with</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:50.410" style="s2">very high-profile events and especially</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.580" end="00:32:54.130" style="s2">for example take Sam Harrison Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.410" end="00:32:57.250" style="s2">Pederson they&#39;re very famous discussions</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.130" end="00:33:00.300" style="s2">that they had could that this sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.250" end="00:33:03.100" style="s2">potential synthesis yeah this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.300" end="00:33:05.290" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s Brett&#39;s Bret&#39;s line</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.100" end="00:33:06.790" style="s2">that all true narratives must reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.290" end="00:33:08.890" style="s2">I think he talks about that and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.790" end="00:33:11.410" style="s2">this sense of for example it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.890" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">unity of knowledge point yeah so just to</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.410" end="00:33:16.870" style="s2">give an example something like Brett&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:20.050" style="s2">evolutionary biology frame and Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.870" end="00:33:22.300" style="s2">Jungian psychology frame but for me that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.050" end="00:33:23.740" style="s2">seems they seem to overlap because Union</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.300" end="00:33:25.870" style="s2">psychology says we have this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.740" end="00:33:26.920" style="s2">dark side we have kind of the killer</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.870" end="00:33:29.800" style="s2">within us and it&#39;s like well of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.920" end="00:33:31.510" style="s2">we do because we with the product of an</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.800" end="00:33:33.520" style="s2">unbroken evolutionary chain of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.510" end="00:33:35.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the ability to kill and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.520" end="00:33:36.520" style="s2">you&#39;re describing reality in different</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.020" end="00:33:39.580" style="s2">coordinate systems there has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.520" end="00:33:42.400" style="s2">change of coordinates yeah and my hope I</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.580" end="00:33:44.230" style="s2">guess with the first emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.400" end="00:33:45.640" style="s2">intellectual dark was what was that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.230" end="00:33:48.310" style="s2">might get a sense of this source of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.640" end="00:33:50.170" style="s2">synthesis developing yeah well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.310" end="00:33:51.100" style="s2">think I&#39;ve seen that over the last</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.170" end="00:33:56.410" style="s2">couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.100" end="00:33:59.350" style="s2">with plantation but with whom in other</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.410" end="00:34:02.260" style="s2">words if you asked me yeah I would say</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.350" end="00:34:04.360" style="s2">that Sam Harris has begun to understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.260" end="00:34:07.480" style="s2">a little bit of the religious critique</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.360" end="00:34:10.090" style="s2">that says religion may not be literally</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.480" end="00:34:11.770" style="s2">true but it may be incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.090" end="00:34:14.830" style="s2">to functioning and maybe reason isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.770" end="00:34:17.500" style="s2">the only thing that globalizes and Sam</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.830" end="00:34:19.510" style="s2">has honed his point a little bit more to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.500" end="00:34:20.679" style="s2">say I&#39;m not saying religion has nothing</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.510" end="00:34:23.169" style="s2">to offer</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.679" end="00:34:24.580" style="s2">if you check carefully throughout time</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.169" end="00:34:28.780" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been saying is that I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.580" end="00:34:30.010" style="s2">reason always has a better claim on what</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.780" end="00:34:31.500" style="s2">you might call transcendence or</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.010" end="00:34:33.389" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.500" end="00:34:36.360" style="s2">and I think that to some extent the new</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.389" end="00:34:39.210" style="s2">atheist conversation has kind of moved</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.360" end="00:34:42.179" style="s2">towards one in which fitness in an</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.210" end="00:34:46.200" style="s2">evolutionary sense and truth are seen as</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.179" end="00:34:47.940" style="s2">competing goals at some point that they</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.200" end="00:34:49.740" style="s2">may walk a great deal of the path</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.940" end="00:34:53.550" style="s2">together but at some point fitness and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.740" end="00:34:59.430" style="s2">truth may diverge I think at our best</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.550" end="00:35:01.260" style="s2">there has been a lot of synthesis so</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.430" end="00:35:02.730" style="s2">that new atheism may have moved on I</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.260" end="00:35:06.980" style="s2">would like to think that Richard Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.730" end="00:35:09.240" style="s2">encountering Brett was a more meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.980" end="00:35:11.310" style="s2">conversation where there was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.240" end="00:35:13.860" style="s2">recognition that maybe things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.310" end="00:35:18.090" style="s2">begin and end with random mutation or</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.860" end="00:35:21.030" style="s2">The Selfish Gene so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.090" end="00:35:23.010" style="s2">actually it has been happening but if</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.030" end="00:35:25.950" style="s2">the question is what about a Superbrand</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.010" end="00:35:28.470" style="s2">in which you&#39;ve got seven to ten people</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.950" end="00:35:31.110" style="s2">who everybody knows have conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.470" end="00:35:34.200" style="s2">points of view progressively coming</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.110" end="00:35:37.350" style="s2">together I mean I was there for example</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.200" end="00:35:40.890" style="s2">you know James d&#39;amour and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.350" end="00:35:42.120" style="s2">Peterson met in my kitchen I was the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.890" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">organizer of the dinner where ben</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.120" end="00:35:46.920" style="s2">shapiro and sam harris first encountered</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:49.140" style="s2">each other in the flesh</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.920" end="00:35:51.000" style="s2">you know brett was there when jordan</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:53.570" style="s2">peterson met sam harris for the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.000" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">time i think that there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.570" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">movement now if you ask me it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:05.460" style="s2">hard for this thing to have moved on</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:07.110" style="s2">given the fact that there was no</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.460" end="00:36:10.620" style="s2">institutional support there was just</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.110" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">this constant kind of tax from bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.620" end="00:36:15.780" style="s2">attacks you know with like constantly</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:17.570" style="s2">defending against whether we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.780" end="00:36:19.890" style="s2">right or white supremacist which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.570" end="00:36:22.260" style="s2">every sort of beneath contempt</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.890" end="00:36:24.530" style="s2">it&#39;s just really stupid things from</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.260" end="00:36:27.150" style="s2">people who went to really smart colleges</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.530" end="00:36:31.380" style="s2">defending their guild because that would</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.150" end="00:36:33.120" style="s2">be my my follow up question which is who</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.380" end="00:36:34.770" style="s2">has changed their minds like this set</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.120" end="00:36:36.060" style="s2">the sensor and the framing of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.770" end="00:36:37.590" style="s2">initial frame of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.060" end="00:36:39.300" style="s2">web i think from the interview that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.590" end="00:36:40.530" style="s2">did with you was these are people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.300" end="00:36:43.320" style="s2">are prepared to say you&#39;ve made a better</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.530" end="00:36:44.510" style="s2">point I&#39;ve changed my mind who genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.320" end="00:36:47.000" style="s2">sort of changed them</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.510" end="00:36:48.530" style="s2">during that during the the last two</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.000" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">years I think there is a widespread</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.530" end="00:36:52.369" style="s2">sense that not that much has shifted in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:53.420" style="s2">terms of perspectives well let me wonder</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.369" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">whether that&#39;s because people are very</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.420" end="00:36:56.570" style="s2">identified with certain perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:37:01.820" style="s2">like Sam Harris with the new atheist</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.570" end="00:37:05.480" style="s2">position I think Sam better appreciate I</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.820" end="00:37:07.910" style="s2">think Brett&#39;s metaphoric truth position</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.480" end="00:37:10.250" style="s2">to Sam has probably influenced Sam I</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.910" end="00:37:12.500" style="s2">think that I better appreciate Sam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.250" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">focus on spirituality with an irrational</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.500" end="00:37:18.050" style="s2">context I think people have better</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:20.420" style="s2">understood why Sam doesn&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.050" end="00:37:22.850" style="s2">free will I think that Jordans points</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.420" end="00:37:27.560" style="s2">went from seeming a little bit fanciful</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.850" end="00:37:28.850" style="s2">to starting to really get it some things</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.560" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">that I think I probably hadn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">only archetype and mythology explain why</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.740" end="00:37:41.990" style="s2">a man would go to war that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:44.270" style="s2">hard from an evolutionary perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.990" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">imagine the individuals thought process</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.270" end="00:37:49.160" style="s2">and that it is in fact you know dreams</p>

<p begin="00:37:49.160" end="00:37:55.430" style="s2">that those sorts of things that propel</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.190" end="00:38:01.369" style="s2">us into a very high probability of</p>

<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:57.480" style="s2">had an interview with Dave probably</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.980" end="00:40:03.060" style="s2">started kind of looking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.230" end="00:40:05.490" style="s2">more carefully about what he was doing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.060" end="00:40:06.780" style="s2">night I had some serious I thought if I</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.490" end="00:40:08.250" style="s2">have this interview with Dave there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.780" end="00:40:10.770" style="s2">certain questions I have to ask him and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.250" end="00:40:12.510" style="s2">I was very concerned about the way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.770" end="00:40:14.040" style="s2">he frames his guests I was very</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.510" end="00:40:16.470" style="s2">concerned about whether he was actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.040" end="00:40:18.870" style="s2">being truthful in in terms of the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.470" end="00:40:20.610" style="s2">way that he was interviewing them and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.870" end="00:40:24.060" style="s2">can understand I may not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.610" end="00:40:26.100" style="s2">agree with the Sam cedar perspective</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.060" end="00:40:27.630" style="s2">that Dave Rubin is dangerous but I do</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.100" end="00:40:31.470" style="s2">actually think that there are things</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.630" end="00:40:33.270" style="s2">that he&#39;s doing that are yeah that can</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.470" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">be quite dangerous because I also see</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.270" end="00:40:36.900" style="s2">them on Twitter for example framing</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:39.960" style="s2">everyone who disagrees with him as bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.900" end="00:40:41.910" style="s2">faith and I think that dynamic is very I</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.960" end="00:40:43.770" style="s2">not to say the word problematic because</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.910" end="00:40:46.350" style="s2">that&#39;s very problematic work but but i</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.770" end="00:40:48.600" style="s2">but I do think and I&#39;ve also seen like</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.350" end="00:40:49.860" style="s2">the increased criticism of him I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.600" end="00:40:51.450" style="s2">have also affected the way that people</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.860" end="00:40:55.470" style="s2">see the intellectual dart live over the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.450" end="00:40:57.420" style="s2">last couple of years do you do you agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.470" end="00:40:59.310" style="s2">with that do you agree that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.420" end="00:41:01.100" style="s2">criticisms have taken their toll on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.310" end="00:41:03.480" style="s2">way people see the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.100" end="00:41:05.310" style="s2">because he was so identified with it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.480" end="00:41:09.660" style="s2">from the beginning well I think he</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.310" end="00:41:10.300" style="s2">really embraced the potential for it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.660" end="00:41:15.550" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.300" end="00:41:17.380" style="s2">the potential for it and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.550" end="00:41:18.940" style="s2">think that what you have to realize is I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.380" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">think I made this joke about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.940" end="00:41:22.540" style="s2">original title of Casablanca to get back</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:24.190" style="s2">to that film was something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.540" end="00:41:25.900" style="s2">everybody comes to Rick&#39;s or everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.190" end="00:41:28.090" style="s2">eats at Rick&#39;s I forget what it was and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.900" end="00:41:30.700" style="s2">I felt like well at some point everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.090" end="00:41:33.610" style="s2">came through Dave&#39;s studio because he</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.700" end="00:41:36.340" style="s2">had built a tv-ready studio that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.610" end="00:41:38.250" style="s2">truly professional and he produced an</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.340" end="00:41:40.780" style="s2">engaging product as an engaging</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.250" end="00:41:44.110" style="s2">interviewer and he was talking to just</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.780" end="00:41:46.300" style="s2">about everybody who was sort of in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.110" end="00:41:49.870" style="s2">digital layer and some people who were</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.300" end="00:41:54.690" style="s2">in the legacy layer I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.870" end="00:42:02.700" style="s2">what happened in some sense was that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.690" end="00:42:06.190" style="s2">when the coalescing into a thing into it</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.700" end="00:42:08.230" style="s2">somehow you couldn&#39;t actually watch a</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.230" end="00:42:15.990" style="s2">web the loose amorphous object into the</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.990" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">right or the political party or the</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:28.870" style="s2">because of something about this era it</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.590" end="00:42:31.840" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t work without somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.870" end="00:42:33.400" style="s2">saying I back this with with money so</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.840" end="00:42:35.400" style="s2">pengwern was willing to back it with</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.400" end="00:42:40.930" style="s2">something but it wasn&#39;t like great deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.400" end="00:42:46.440" style="s2">I think that what happened was that Dave</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.930" end="00:42:50.020" style="s2">needed a business model that worked and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.440" end="00:42:54.130" style="s2">in so doing he was trying to pull from</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.020" end="00:42:55.690" style="s2">all sides and eventually and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.130" end="00:42:57.610" style="s2">this is to sort of try to steal me on</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.690" end="00:42:59.890" style="s2">his perspective I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.610" end="00:43:02.440" style="s2">willingness of more right-of-center</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.890" end="00:43:04.330" style="s2">elements than left-of-center elements to</p>

<p begin="00:43:20.320" end="00:43:24.010" style="s2">out of whack with what it really</p>

<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:30.580" style="s2">crazy level of intolerance where if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.930" end="00:43:33.190" style="s2">talked to somebody who talked to</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.650" end="00:44:50.350" style="s2">Dave nor does Dave understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.270" end="00:44:53.020" style="s2">going on with me</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.350" end="00:44:54.940" style="s2">now if the question is why won&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.020" end="00:44:56.500" style="s2">throw Dave Rubin under a bus because you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.940" end="00:44:58.390" style="s2">don&#39;t understand or agree with them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.500" end="00:45:00.310" style="s2">because first of all it may be clear I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.390" end="00:45:01.840" style="s2">not in the habit of throwing my friends</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.310" end="00:45:03.940" style="s2">under a bus for anybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.840" end="00:45:05.560" style="s2">entertainment do I think that some of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.940" end="00:45:07.870" style="s2">the choices he&#39;s made are not the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.560" end="00:45:09.310" style="s2">choices that I would make absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.870" end="00:45:11.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any secret that he</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.310" end="00:45:13.270" style="s2">feels exactly the same way about me</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.410" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">am i worried about some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.270" end="00:45:16.210" style="s2">that may happen on his show yeah the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:17.950" style="s2">I&#39;m worried about some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.210" end="00:45:19.870" style="s2">that happen on ben shapiro show</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.950" end="00:45:22.120" style="s2">however when ben shapiro and i have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.870" end="00:45:24.130" style="s2">disagreement and I call up Ben were able</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.120" end="00:45:26.500" style="s2">to have a meeting of minds with fair</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.130" end="00:45:28.980" style="s2">regularity I guess if you ask me I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.500" end="00:45:32.050" style="s2">that the way in which Dave got hounded</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.980" end="00:45:34.300" style="s2">was anomalous and that that created its</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.050" end="00:45:36.730" style="s2">own feedback loop where in effect Dave</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.300" end="00:45:37.720" style="s2">saw a world in which people were not</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.730" end="00:45:40.030" style="s2">being fair to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.720" end="00:45:41.950" style="s2">and he responded accordingly saying this</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.030" end="00:45:44.170" style="s2">is this shows the true colors of my</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.950" end="00:45:46.390" style="s2">critics is that they&#39;re not interested</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.170" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">in being charitable and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.390" end="00:45:50.260" style="s2">welcomed Dave were probably from farther</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:52.090" style="s2">reaches of the right and they said you</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.260" end="00:45:54.580" style="s2">can bring your wheat smoking your gay</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.090" end="00:45:57.190" style="s2">marriage you can bring all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.580" end="00:45:59.020" style="s2">that you value and we won&#39;t quit</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.190" end="00:46:00.460" style="s2">criticize and judge you and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.020" end="00:46:02.290" style="s2">he made his decision from that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.460" end="00:46:04.599" style="s2">perspective is that he looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.290" end="00:46:07.420" style="s2">intolerance of the left and he looked at</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.599" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">the open arms coming from people farther</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.420" end="00:46:10.930" style="s2">to the right and he said you know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:15.010" style="s2">this is a better world and I&#39;m tired of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.930" end="00:46:17.050" style="s2">pretending that in fact I have a better</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.010" end="00:46:20.050" style="s2">deal from the center which pretends to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.050" end="00:46:21.700" style="s2">be tolerant but is anything but and at</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.050" end="00:46:23.320" style="s2">that level I think Dave&#39;s is really</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.700" end="00:46:24.490" style="s2">reacting the saying I refuse to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.320" end="00:46:27.730" style="s2">Stockholm Syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.490" end="00:46:28.570" style="s2">now who&#39;s responsible for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.730" end="00:46:30.540" style="s2">Dave&#39;s fault</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.570" end="00:46:33.130" style="s2">is that the fault of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.540" end="00:46:35.050" style="s2">hounded him is that the fault of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.130" end="00:46:36.580" style="s2">people who actually embraced the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.050" end="00:46:38.680" style="s2">that even if they didn&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.580" end="00:46:40.570" style="s2">homosexual marriage that they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.680" end="00:46:42.849" style="s2">be tolerant of a fellow soul I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.570" end="00:46:45.460" style="s2">know but the problem that I have is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.849" end="00:46:47.380" style="s2">I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t and do not understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.460" end="00:46:51.310" style="s2">exactly the transition that has occurred</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.380" end="00:46:53.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s why in part I&#39;m not super</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.310" end="00:46:55.660" style="s2">keen to comment I don&#39;t agree with it I</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.800" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">don&#39;t love it but I don&#39;t also</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.660" end="00:46:59.380" style="s2">understand it and I would be pissed off</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">if Dave wanted to comment on me whenever</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.380" end="00:47:04.420" style="s2">he does comment saying that you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:05.800" style="s2">he&#39;s farther in front and don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.420" end="00:47:08.680" style="s2">that he&#39;ll bring me along I always</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.800" end="00:47:11.500" style="s2">resented so is there some</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.680" end="00:47:14.530" style="s2">dissatisfaction sure but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.500" end="00:47:16.510" style="s2">greater bond of friendship and if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.530" end="00:47:19.089" style="s2">don&#39;t mind I&#39;m gonna continue to bet on</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.510" end="00:47:20.740" style="s2">a friend who&#39;s tried to be good to me</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.089" end="00:47:23.770" style="s2">and who I&#39;ve tried to be good to him in</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.740" end="00:47:27.099" style="s2">return rather than necessarily this</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.770" end="00:47:31.300" style="s2">false sense and show a performative</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.099" end="00:47:33.250" style="s2">sense of pretending that I&#39;m so pure</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.300" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">that I can&#39;t tolerate these actions from</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.250" end="00:47:37.420" style="s2">a friend I just don&#39;t understand exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:39.730" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the system so for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.420" end="00:47:42.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a bad version of the criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.730" end="00:47:44.770" style="s2">that are leveled of Dave Rubin which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.160" end="00:47:46.810" style="s2">you platform certain people and Dave</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.770" end="00:47:47.770" style="s2">defenses I&#39;ll talk to whoever I want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.810" end="00:47:49.819" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.770" end="00:47:51.349" style="s2">there&#39;s a more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.819" end="00:47:52.999" style="s2">version of that criticism I think is</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.349" end="00:47:54.650" style="s2">it&#39;s true and you actually have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.999" end="00:47:57.259" style="s2">of look closely at how this happens is</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.650" end="00:47:59.390" style="s2">how you platforming someone or how are</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.259" end="00:48:01.969" style="s2">you what is the interaction but for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.390" end="00:48:03.289" style="s2">the ethical perspective is as a someone</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.969" end="00:48:05.719" style="s2">who comes from the mainstream media it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.289" end="00:48:08.479" style="s2">like you are the position is you are</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.719" end="00:48:10.430" style="s2">standing in for the viewer or you you</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.479" end="00:48:12.410" style="s2">are standing in for someone else who</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.430" end="00:48:14.569" style="s2">could be there asking me the questions</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.410" end="00:48:17.269" style="s2">so you have a responsibility to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.569" end="00:48:20.479" style="s2">questions that you genuinely feel should</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.269" end="00:48:22.459" style="s2">be asked of that person who anyone any</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.479" end="00:48:24.709" style="s2">one sort of a member of the public would</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.459" end="00:48:26.299" style="s2">want to ask or feel should be asked and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.709" end="00:48:27.170" style="s2">that&#39;s an ethical decision as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.299" end="00:48:30.709" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.170" end="00:48:32.299" style="s2">someone who might be very controversial</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.709" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">and Ruben has a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.299" end="00:48:36.140" style="s2">controversial people on my topic Tommy</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:37.969" style="s2">Rob answer normally innopolis and people</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.140" end="00:48:40.789" style="s2">like that so I do think there&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.969" end="00:48:44.299" style="s2">sophisticated version and I do think and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.789" end="00:48:45.529" style="s2">also maybe steel steel laning Dave</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.299" end="00:48:46.940" style="s2">Reubens position is that he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.529" end="00:48:48.109" style="s2">initially he doesn&#39;t come from a</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.940" end="00:48:50.869" style="s2">journalistic background he comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.109" end="00:48:52.789" style="s2">comedic background and has kind of ended</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.869" end="00:48:54.140" style="s2">up in this position but that would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.789" end="00:48:57.170" style="s2">the criticism I think has got some</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.140" end="00:48:58.759" style="s2">validity it&#39;s that he has people on his</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.170" end="00:49:01.219" style="s2">show and then doesn&#39;t ask them the sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.759" end="00:49:03.170" style="s2">of questions that would then allow the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.219" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">audience to make up a complete round a</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.170" end="00:49:08.569" style="s2">picture of that person gets defend</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:10.219" style="s2">things they&#39;ve said or whatever well</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.569" end="00:49:14.539" style="s2">this is a different criticism and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.219" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">think it&#39;s an interesting one I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.539" end="00:49:18.739" style="s2">that the key problem is that dave has a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:21.199" style="s2">theory and the theory is if you give</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.739" end="00:49:23.209" style="s2">anyone enough rope they will hang</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.199" end="00:49:24.920" style="s2">themselves and so Dave&#39;s feeling is is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.209" end="00:49:26.779" style="s2">that giving someone sufficient rope</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.920" end="00:49:29.930" style="s2">allows the public to make up its mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.779" end="00:49:33.529" style="s2">and the key question in that and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.930" end="00:49:35.779" style="s2">think this is anything other than sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.529" end="00:49:37.940" style="s2">of logically following from from from</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.779" end="00:49:41.509" style="s2">that idea the key question is is there</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.940" end="00:49:43.519" style="s2">any one skilled enough to take a large</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.509" end="00:49:46.190" style="s2">expansive rope and never hang themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.519" end="00:49:48.319" style="s2">and I think that that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.190" end="00:49:50.989" style="s2">weakness of that strategy for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.319" end="00:49:53.209" style="s2">it&#39;s a well-known technique in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.989" end="00:49:54.680" style="s2">Middle East that you say things in</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.209" end="00:49:57.199" style="s2">Arabic that are different than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.680" end="00:49:58.819" style="s2">things that you say in English and until</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.199" end="00:50:03.019" style="s2">for example there was a group that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.819" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">cropped up called memory EMRI and what</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.019" end="00:50:08.359" style="s2">they do is they train</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:10.220" style="s2">in Middle Eastern and languages and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.359" end="00:50:12.500" style="s2">Central Asian and languages potentially</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.220" end="00:50:14.299" style="s2">into English so that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.500" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">everything in one language and you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.299" end="00:50:19.339" style="s2">see just how much someone&#39;s speech</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:21.710" style="s2">differs from one presentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.339" end="00:50:23.420" style="s2">self to another and so I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.710" end="00:50:25.970" style="s2">key thing that you&#39;d have to say about</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.420" end="00:50:27.710" style="s2">that is do you have people who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.970" end="00:50:29.630" style="s2">incredibly skilled you brought up Tommy</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.710" end="00:50:32.180" style="s2">Robinson look the charge has been</p>

<p begin="00:51:31.910" end="00:51:35.930" style="s2">your own well I wouldn&#39;t think about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:38.049" style="s2">in those terms I would say that I want</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.930" end="00:51:40.549" style="s2">to measure I mean if the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.049" end="00:51:42.650" style="s2">listenership yeah listenership spen</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.549" end="00:51:44.180" style="s2">great people are incredibly motivated</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.650" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">but I want to measure it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.180" end="00:51:48.980" style="s2">actual changes in the culture and so to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:50.930" style="s2">the extent that we have right now people</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.980" end="00:51:54.109" style="s2">who are working on various projects that</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.930" end="00:51:55.880" style="s2">nobody&#39;s even aware of that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.109" end="00:51:57.319" style="s2">occurring we have a very active group of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.880" end="00:52:01.010" style="s2">people who are discussing these issues</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.319" end="00:52:01.700" style="s2">24/7 using let&#39;s say discord server for</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.010" end="00:52:04.069" style="s2">voice chats</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.700" end="00:52:07.099" style="s2">I think it&#39;s been nothing short of</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.069" end="00:52:08.540" style="s2">amazing the level of dedication that a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.099" end="00:52:10.700" style="s2">lot of people have embraced these</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.540" end="00:52:12.680" style="s2">concepts with I mean it was very weird</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.700" end="00:52:15.020" style="s2">of course the Apple podcast showed this</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.680" end="00:52:16.819" style="s2">is being the portal as being the number</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.020" end="00:52:17.310" style="s2">one show in the world according to their</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.819" end="00:52:19.110" style="s2">charts</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.310" end="00:52:21.390" style="s2">we didn&#39;t even have a single episode out</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.110" end="00:52:22.140" style="s2">showing that their algorithm was of</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.390" end="00:52:24.420" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.140" end="00:52:26.430" style="s2">weirdly gheymeh bull because it</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.420" end="00:52:28.710" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have recorded that a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.430" end="00:52:30.410" style="s2">with no shows was dominant so that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.710" end="00:52:33.060" style="s2">it was very fun and amusing</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.410" end="00:52:35.190" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s if you want to measure by</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.060" end="00:52:36.690" style="s2">standard metrics of success it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.190" end="00:52:37.980" style="s2">it&#39;s been a good ride but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.690" end="00:52:41.400" style="s2">really how we want to measure it I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.980" end="00:52:44.100" style="s2">what we want to measure it by is can we</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.400" end="00:52:47.960" style="s2">take culture to a different level that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.100" end="00:52:52.400" style="s2">is more rooted in reason comity</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.960" end="00:52:56.010" style="s2">accommodation tolerance love creativity</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.400" end="00:52:59.360" style="s2">soul transcendence than simply tearing</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.010" end="00:53:03.150" style="s2">each other down for fun and profit and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.360" end="00:53:04.980" style="s2">your podcast is called the portal and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.150" end="00:53:06.300" style="s2">Bret&#39;s is called the dark horse yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.980" end="00:53:08.550" style="s2">what do you what are you hoping to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.300" end="00:53:10.650" style="s2">with the portal is it related to what</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.550" end="00:53:16.620" style="s2">was what the the mission of the internet</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.650" end="00:53:19.080" style="s2">were dark levels well it&#39;s two grand and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.620" end="00:53:20.340" style="s2">too silly to say but the key issue is if</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.080" end="00:53:22.290" style="s2">you think about do humans have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.340" end="00:53:25.620" style="s2">thousand years left on this planet I</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.290" end="00:53:28.350" style="s2">would guess that we do not our power is</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.620" end="00:53:31.800" style="s2">too great in our wisdom too slight so</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.350" end="00:53:33.630" style="s2">the key is to get people thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.800" end="00:53:36.120" style="s2">if we want if we wish to have a future</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.630" end="00:53:38.820" style="s2">we&#39;ve always inherited a future from our</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.120" end="00:53:42.570" style="s2">biology we&#39;ve now been denied a future</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.820" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">by our power so if you can get people</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.570" end="00:53:46.650" style="s2">trying to figure out if we live in</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:49.410" style="s2">flatland how would we imagine an extra</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.650" end="00:53:51.300" style="s2">dimension in which to escape whether</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.410" end="00:53:52.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a dimension of thought that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.300" end="00:53:54.300" style="s2">never been able to have before a</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.740" end="00:53:57.540" style="s2">dimension of action which we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.300" end="00:54:00.690" style="s2">undertaken or to actual actually change</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.540" end="00:54:02.970" style="s2">the dimensions of the prison that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.690" end="00:54:06.600" style="s2">Einstein left us with with space and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.970" end="00:54:08.400" style="s2">time we&#39;ve got to find a way out of our</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.600" end="00:54:10.320" style="s2">current predicament or we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.400" end="00:54:14.190" style="s2">have a long term future with hydrogen</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.320" end="00:54:16.380" style="s2">devices and biological agents that can</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.190" end="00:54:18.810" style="s2">be weaponized or digital attacks I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.380" end="00:54:22.500" style="s2">it&#39;s the arms race between destruction</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.810" end="00:54:25.140" style="s2">and protection has been lost because of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.500" end="00:54:26.790" style="s2">the power of the destructive objects so</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.140" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know how much power there</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.790" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">would be within the atom or within the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:33.330" style="s2">cell</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">or within code we now know and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.330" end="00:54:38.130" style="s2">been living on good luck for a while the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:40.140" style="s2">portal is an attempt to celebrate the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.130" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">most creative most dynamic and most</p>

<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:46.619" style="s2">found</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.700" end="00:54:49.080" style="s2">so think about Shackleton for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.619" end="00:54:51.060" style="s2">and what Shackleton did when all hope</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.080" end="00:54:52.740" style="s2">was lost was to make sure that he</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.060" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">brought all of his men back alive I</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.740" end="00:54:58.109" style="s2">think it&#39;s an incredibly inspiring tale</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:54:59.910" style="s2">and whenever people have been able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.109" end="00:55:01.230" style="s2">find ways out where ever they thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.910" end="00:55:02.609" style="s2">they were trapped they&#39;re effectively</p>
