<p begin="00:02:17.550" end="00:02:22.710" style="s2">fairly long lesson and then we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.630" end="00:02:26.550" style="s2">okay so we&#39;ve been doing the five</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.710" end="00:02:29.910" style="s2">factors of inquiring mindfulness knows</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.550" end="00:02:33.510" style="s2">our vigilance which is the core one and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.910" end="00:02:36.690" style="s2">the other one&#39;s modified acuity sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.510" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">sensitivity acute acuity noticing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.690" end="00:02:39.990" style="s2">reminder so we&#39;ve been doing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">meditative question hopefully to get a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.990" end="00:02:42.990" style="s2">sense of what vigilance is it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">watchfulness</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.990" end="00:02:48.030" style="s2">it&#39;s that exploratory observation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:51.690" style="s2">trying to get below the surface of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.030" end="00:02:55.740" style="s2">pond for deep insight the past enough so</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.690" end="00:02:58.710" style="s2">we can enhance that by bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.740" end="00:03:00.240" style="s2">other factors into play how do we bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.710" end="00:03:02.790" style="s2">them into plant how do we practice them</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.240" end="00:03:05.220" style="s2">well this is where we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:06.420" style="s2">taking another step forward because what</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.220" end="00:03:08.040" style="s2">you&#39;re now going to do is you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.420" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">to go from you&#39;re going to go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.040" end="00:03:13.020" style="s2">labeling your structions to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:15.150" style="s2">meditating on your destructions okay so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.020" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">first of all a very important principle</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.150" end="00:03:18.990" style="s2">for this it&#39;s very tempting when I teach</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">people this that they start looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.990" end="00:03:22.410" style="s2">their distractions which means they make</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:24.660" style="s2">themselves more distracted it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.410" end="00:03:26.520" style="s2">they give their monkey months and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.660" end="00:03:28.500" style="s2">meth or something so don&#39;t go looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.520" end="00:03:30.270" style="s2">for distractions I know it&#39;s tempting</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.500" end="00:03:31.860" style="s2">and you know don&#39;t beat yourself up</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.270" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">maybe do but this is the important</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.860" end="00:03:36.090" style="s2">principle if you&#39;re not practicing this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:38.490" style="s2">by trying to provoke distractions I</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.090" end="00:03:42.270" style="s2">think it&#39;s very important that you allow</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.490" end="00:03:43.980" style="s2">them to arise spontaneously if they even</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.270" end="00:03:46.740" style="s2">do it all and you really keep your focus</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.980" end="00:03:50.160" style="s2">on unfriending yourself and following</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.740" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">your breath but when a distraction</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.160" end="00:03:55.230" style="s2">arises we apply the five factors of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:57.450" style="s2">alluring mindfulness well let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.230" end="00:04:00.120" style="s2">through them and we&#39;ll do it I&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.450" end="00:04:02.459" style="s2">for three kinds of distractions physical</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.120" end="00:04:04.770" style="s2">distractions emotional distractions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.459" end="00:04:07.350" style="s2">mental destructions okay so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.770" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a physical destruction so one</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.350" end="00:04:12.240" style="s2">that people of course commonly have are</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:15.240" style="s2">all related and anecdote to that about</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.240" end="00:04:20.900" style="s2">this you I think it&#39;s some kind of pain</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.240" end="00:04:23.389" style="s2">in their lives so let&#39;s go through it</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.900" end="00:04:26.600" style="s2">I got a pain in my leg so what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.389" end="00:04:28.759" style="s2">well first of all I don&#39;t stop believin</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.600" end="00:04:32.509" style="s2">I always label I step back and label it</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.759" end="00:04:33.800" style="s2">then ing word painting normally you</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.509" end="00:04:35.900" style="s2">would just here return to your breath</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.800" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">but here&#39;s the idea you&#39;re just you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.900" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">actually put friend your distractions</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">they&#39;re an important arena at which you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:43.100" style="s2">can train mindfulness because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:45.320" style="s2">just fractions often represent very</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.100" end="00:04:48.740" style="s2">automatic and ingrained patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.320" end="00:04:51.800" style="s2">behavior so what I&#39;ll do is after I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.740" end="00:04:53.780" style="s2">labeled it I then do vigilance what does</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.800" end="00:04:56.419" style="s2">that mean I take an attitude towards it</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.780" end="00:04:58.460" style="s2">that I really don&#39;t know what this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.419" end="00:05:01.130" style="s2">completely I don&#39;t except the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.460" end="00:05:03.830" style="s2">familiarity as being a complete</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.130" end="00:05:06.889" style="s2">revelation of the phenomenon I do not</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.830" end="00:05:09.650" style="s2">expect I do not write interpret like I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.889" end="00:05:11.720" style="s2">should say the familiarity I do not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.650" end="00:05:14.389" style="s2">frame it as the familiarity is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.720" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">equivalent to me having an expertise or</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.389" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">a complete understanding of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:20.780" style="s2">phenomena a complete awareness of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:23.960" style="s2">okay it has not been fully disclosed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.780" end="00:05:26.900" style="s2">me just because I find it familiar so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.960" end="00:05:28.760" style="s2">this is the sort of enacted humility</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.900" end="00:05:30.919" style="s2">that&#39;s about right</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.760" end="00:05:33.669" style="s2">trying to get below the familiar face of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.919" end="00:05:36.440" style="s2">your experience you apply vigilance that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.669" end="00:05:37.940" style="s2">exploratory observation into the pain</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.440" end="00:05:41.000" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna say I&#39;m not gonna like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.940" end="00:05:43.159" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.000" end="00:05:47.270" style="s2">right but what you can see is that not</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.159" end="00:05:50.659" style="s2">liking isn&#39;t as devastating as it might</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.270" end="00:05:54.020" style="s2">you know have been habituated in you so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.659" end="00:05:57.590" style="s2">I started to think that platoon of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.020" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">watchfulness of exploration of wanting</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.590" end="00:06:04.550" style="s2">to see more thing to learn and more not</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:07.940" style="s2">wanting to feel good or feel better but</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.550" end="00:06:10.250" style="s2">to learn more to learn more okay so then</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.940" end="00:06:12.610" style="s2">I moved to sensitivity sensitivity is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.250" end="00:06:16.729" style="s2">turn all of the nouns in Europe mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.610" end="00:06:20.210" style="s2">into hers this isn&#39;t pain it&#39;s painting</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.729" end="00:06:23.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a constantly shifting unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.210" end="00:06:24.889" style="s2">process so sensitivity says go from</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.180" end="00:06:26.389" style="s2">taking a snapshot of your experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.889" end="00:06:28.760" style="s2">that you know and you put into your</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.389" end="00:06:32.029" style="s2">memories I picked I know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.760" end="00:06:34.500" style="s2">infinitely little there yes go from that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.029" end="00:06:37.260" style="s2">to an exploratory movie</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.500" end="00:06:45.210" style="s2">it&#39;s unfolding and you&#39;re seeing how</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.260" end="00:06:47.670" style="s2">it&#39;s going to arrest next flowing acuity</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.210" end="00:06:51.960" style="s2">acuity so think when I take my glasses</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.670" end="00:06:52.410" style="s2">off I lose acuity right everything fuses</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.960" end="00:06:55.920" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.410" end="00:06:57.660" style="s2">it&#39;s perceptual con fusion fusing</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.920" end="00:07:00.630" style="s2">together confused right</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.660" end="00:07:03.300" style="s2">everything is confused together and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.630" end="00:07:05.310" style="s2">order to have a more intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.300" end="00:07:07.169" style="s2">understanding of things I have to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.310" end="00:07:09.210" style="s2">able to discern and discriminate</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.169" end="00:07:10.890" style="s2">that&#39;s acuity that&#39;s visual acuity you</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.210" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">want to bring it here so you&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.890" end="00:07:16.860" style="s2">got this blob of an experience it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:19.020" style="s2">fused together acuity is pull it apart</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.860" end="00:07:20.730" style="s2">and you&#39;ve been practicing this you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.020" end="00:07:22.500" style="s2">got the preliminary skill for this</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.730" end="00:07:24.750" style="s2">because you&#39;ve been learning how to find</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.500" end="00:07:26.370" style="s2">your clothes so try to notice all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.750" end="00:07:28.470" style="s2">different kinds of sensations</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.370" end="00:07:30.630" style="s2">so you&#39;ll notice weight what I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.470" end="00:07:33.750" style="s2">lumping together is pain some of that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.630" end="00:07:37.110" style="s2">just tension and then some of that right</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.750" end="00:07:39.300" style="s2">some of that is tightness and some of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.110" end="00:07:41.490" style="s2">that is maybe sort of tingling and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:43.169" style="s2">there&#39;s this sort of felt nastiness but</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.490" end="00:07:45.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not as big as I sort of thought it</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.169" end="00:07:48.150" style="s2">was and it&#39;s really hard to put my mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.090" end="00:07:50.430" style="s2">on that and there&#39;s great a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.150" end="00:07:54.510" style="s2">happening there there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.430" end="00:07:56.669" style="s2">different kinds of sensations acuity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.510" end="00:08:00.120" style="s2">how a lot of things are all fused</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.669" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">together as pain right but once you make</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.120" end="00:08:03.690" style="s2">it painting and let it unfold</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:05.460" style="s2">you can then notice all the different</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.690" end="00:08:07.650" style="s2">things and this is how you start to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.460" end="00:08:10.350" style="s2">bring clarity to your awareness you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.650" end="00:08:13.320" style="s2">start to uh them you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.350" end="00:08:18.030" style="s2">discernment and discrimination okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.320" end="00:08:20.450" style="s2">notice it so vigilance take that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.030" end="00:08:24.150" style="s2">exploratory attitude humility</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.450" end="00:08:30.900" style="s2">sensitivity turn it into a flowing verb</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.150" end="00:08:33.240" style="s2">not a snapshot now acuity defuse it pull</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.900" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">it all apart right notice all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.240" end="00:08:36.750" style="s2">different kinds of sensations are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:41.070" style="s2">way they&#39;re layered and shifting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.750" end="00:08:42.810" style="s2">moving around then notice it noticing is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.070" end="00:08:45.900" style="s2">to try to pay attention to the three</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.810" end="00:08:47.370" style="s2">kinds of reactions your habit what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.900" end="00:08:48.600" style="s2">your physical reaction how is the rest</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.370" end="00:08:52.110" style="s2">of your body your</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.600" end="00:08:53.670" style="s2">energetic felt body reacting to this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.110" end="00:08:55.500" style="s2">it tightening is it do you feel it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.670" end="00:08:57.290" style="s2">trying to pull away if you feel a part</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.500" end="00:09:01.380" style="s2">of it though that&#39;s kind of a rule I</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.310" end="00:09:22.230" style="s2">maybe also yeah I kind of like it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.800" end="00:09:25.649" style="s2">too it sort of gives me a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.230" end="00:09:27.329" style="s2">urgency or connectedness maybe I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.649" end="00:09:29.579" style="s2">know I&#39;m not accusing anybody being a</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.290" end="00:09:37.920" style="s2">a lot of complex emotional reaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.449" end="00:09:39.870" style="s2">going on to this all right sort of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.920" end="00:09:41.910" style="s2">fused and treated it all at once as a I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.870" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">don&#39;t like it but I&#39;m actually it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.910" end="00:09:47.000" style="s2">really complex set of physiological</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:50.009" style="s2">energetic and emotional reactions</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.000" end="00:09:51.930" style="s2">finally mental reaction what&#39;s your mind</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.250" end="00:10:00.569" style="s2">of my will oh I&#39;m going to set this as</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.769" end="00:10:02.850" style="s2">the villain and I&#39;m like what is your</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.569" end="00:10:05.430" style="s2">mind doing how&#39;s it reacting to it so</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.850" end="00:10:06.779" style="s2">moving away moving towards it grasping</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.430" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">at trying to shred it try to make it go</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.779" end="00:10:16.199" style="s2">away trying to attach to it what is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:17.490" style="s2">mind doing vigilance that exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.199" end="00:10:21.990" style="s2">observation that you&#39;ve been trained the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.490" end="00:10:26.519" style="s2">core of it sensitivity unfolding it as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.990" end="00:10:28.220" style="s2">movie acuity pulling it apart into all</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.519" end="00:10:30.740" style="s2">the different kinds of sensations</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.220" end="00:10:33.870" style="s2">noticing noticing the three reactions</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.740" end="00:10:37.319" style="s2">the bodily reaction the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.870" end="00:10:39.540" style="s2">reaction the mental reaction fifth one</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.319" end="00:10:44.970" style="s2">reminding what&#39;s remaining that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.540" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">core sake stay in mindfulness stay in</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.970" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">mindfulness stay in mindfulness because</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.680" style="s2">as you unpack this you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:54.180" style="s2">inferences you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.680" end="00:10:56.279" style="s2">justifications you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.180" end="00:11:00.300" style="s2">explanations you want to tell them</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.279" end="00:11:07.660" style="s2">stories keep going back</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.300" end="00:11:10.690" style="s2">to vigilance sensitivity acuity noticing</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.660" end="00:11:11.830" style="s2">that&#39;s what reminding is okay now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.690" end="00:11:13.990" style="s2">say you&#39;re doing this so let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.830" end="00:11:15.400" style="s2">to my anecdotal example right when I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.990" end="00:11:15.880" style="s2">first taught this I thought oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.400" end="00:11:19.150" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.880" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">because I when I was sitting I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.150" end="00:11:21.430" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:24.100" style="s2">we were sitting for an hour in for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.430" end="00:11:27.010" style="s2">novice that&#39;s a long time right and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.100" end="00:11:29.470" style="s2">it&#39;s really burning in my legs and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.010" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">was really a big challenge I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.470" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">talk when I thought about this oh this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">is great because you know I was held as</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:38.380" style="s2">a novice I&#39;m struggling between monkey</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:40.180" style="s2">mind and you know this turning in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.380" end="00:11:42.430" style="s2">legs it&#39;s like ah this will give me a</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.180" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">focus I&#39;m not a masochist either but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.430" end="00:11:46.390" style="s2">idea that if pain is such a compelling</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:48.220" style="s2">it&#39;s such a Darwinian primitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.390" end="00:11:50.140" style="s2">primordial thing that&#39;ll keep my</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.220" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">attention for sure that&#39;ll keep my</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.140" end="00:11:54.730" style="s2">attention for sure so of course I tried</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:58.420" style="s2">to follow the instructions I didn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.730" end="00:12:00.010" style="s2">for my distraction but eventually it did</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.420" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">come up because I was sitting so long I</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.010" end="00:12:04.810" style="s2">was it I thought I turned and I started</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.220" end="00:12:06.520" style="s2">to apply the five five years of applying</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.810" end="00:12:09.550" style="s2">mindfulness and I thought oh I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.520" end="00:12:11.620" style="s2">to be like a laser concentration surely</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.550" end="00:12:14.050" style="s2">this will hook my mind and hold my</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.620" end="00:12:16.270" style="s2">attention and within about 20 seconds I</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.050" end="00:12:18.610" style="s2">was off into monkey month and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.270" end="00:12:20.380" style="s2">wasn&#39;t minor pain I&#39;m talking about was</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.610" end="00:12:22.510" style="s2">off and I remember it&#39;s such a shocking</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.380" end="00:12:27.910" style="s2">experiences oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.510" end="00:12:30.250" style="s2">even this my monkey mind blow away so</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.910" end="00:12:32.260" style="s2">here&#39;s the first principle if while</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.250" end="00:12:34.900" style="s2">you&#39;re meditating on your distraction</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.260" end="00:12:36.220" style="s2">you&#39;re distracted from it you go back to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.900" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">your breath you just go back to very</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.220" end="00:12:41.560" style="s2">basic the plasma or meta if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:44.050" style="s2">meta at the time okay so the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.560" end="00:12:46.420" style="s2">principle is if you go away you return</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.050" end="00:12:48.040" style="s2">to the breath if you go where you</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.420" end="00:12:49.570" style="s2">returned the breath and then you say</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.040" end="00:12:51.220" style="s2">well then my distraction might get me</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.570" end="00:12:52.750" style="s2">again my pain in my leg yep and then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.220" end="00:12:55.660" style="s2">do this and you go where you return to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.750" end="00:12:59.500" style="s2">your breath okay but that takes me to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.660" end="00:13:03.970" style="s2">the next two principles okay here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.500" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">second one this also happened to me pain</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.970" end="00:13:09.209" style="s2">came up I was able to stay with it</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:12.300" style="s2">longer as a practice</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.209" end="00:13:15.290" style="s2">and then it went away as I meditated on</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.300" end="00:13:21.809" style="s2">it and this is the more tempting thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.290" end="00:13:25.230" style="s2">because it&#39;s like oh oh I could make</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.809" end="00:13:27.720" style="s2">everything unpleasant go away with the</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.700" style="s2">thinking is absent or you&#39;ll turn to try</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.470" end="00:21:12.140" style="s2">meditator and you&#39;ll find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.700" end="00:21:13.940" style="s2">thinking then you&#39;re just in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.140" end="00:21:16.370" style="s2">distraction and then don&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.940" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">else other than return to your breath</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.370" end="00:21:20.210" style="s2">label their thinking go back to your</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:22.550" style="s2">breath but if the first time thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.210" end="00:21:25.460" style="s2">comes up step back there&#39;s two primary</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.550" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">ways of thinking right and they often</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.460" end="00:21:29.510" style="s2">come together but you can separate them</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:32.900" style="s2">at least initially in practice the first</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.510" end="00:21:34.760" style="s2">one is inner speech here&#39;s the thing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.900" end="00:21:38.210" style="s2">do with inner speech you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.760" end="00:21:40.340" style="s2">yourself okay don&#39;t pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.210" end="00:21:42.560" style="s2">what is being said pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.340" end="00:21:44.870" style="s2">quint ease of the voice that is saying</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.720" end="00:21:50.540" style="s2">clear memory of teaching this but just</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.890" end="00:21:52.730" style="s2">to somebody and he was sort of going</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.540" end="00:21:54.290" style="s2">along and he wasn&#39;t getting much but</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.730" end="00:21:55.580" style="s2">then I taught him this and then he came</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.290" end="00:21:57.710" style="s2">back the next week and he was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.580" end="00:21:59.480" style="s2">enthusiastic he said I realized that my</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.480" end="00:22:52.970" style="s2">will happening is very soon the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:56.330" style="s2">will disappear and note that what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.970" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">like when my mind is empty thought and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.330" end="00:23:02.180" style="s2">then returned to the breath what about</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:05.510" style="s2">scenes pictures behave as if you are an</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.940" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">right again you&#39;re trying to step back</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.150" end="00:23:35.900" style="s2">and look at the medium rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.690" end="00:23:37.490" style="s2">meaning of it so there&#39;s and again the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.900" end="00:23:39.230" style="s2">three principles it goes away</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.490" end="00:23:44.780" style="s2">when it goes away though first notice</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.230" end="00:23:45.890" style="s2">that what&#39;s it like you go away like it</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.780" end="00:23:47.330" style="s2">if you&#39;re distracted from your</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.890" end="00:23:51.410" style="s2">distraction you just return to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.330" end="00:23:53.330" style="s2">breath right this one you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.410" end="00:23:54.920" style="s2">get the endurance you might if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.920" end="00:23:58.790" style="s2">then that that&#39;s something where I</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.840" end="00:23:59.830" style="s2">recommend you don&#39;t do this practice to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.790" end="00:24:03.530" style="s2">if you&#39;re caught up in like a really</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.470" end="00:24:16.679" style="s2">things that come up in the practice I</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.090" end="00:24:18.450" style="s2">did say this would be a long lesson this</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.679" end="00:24:20.010" style="s2">is a really important lesson this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.450" end="00:24:22.860" style="s2">transitional lesson we&#39;re moving it to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.010" end="00:24:24.809" style="s2">whole another stage you also need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.860" end="00:24:26.010" style="s2">deal with hindrances hindrances are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.809" end="00:24:28.770" style="s2">things that are sort of preventing you</p>
