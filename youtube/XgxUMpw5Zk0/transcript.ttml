<p begin="00:00:01.820" end="00:00:06.420" style="s2">so what are you gonna ask me tell me</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.110" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">butter Lu what I&#39;m gonna ask is first to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.420" end="00:00:12.690" style="s2">describe what you how would you describe</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:16.850" style="s2">the science of qualities that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.690" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">describe in the Masters yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.850" end="00:00:23.340" style="s2">start with that mm-hmm and we&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:25.890" style="s2">got ten minutes like and then I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.340" end="00:00:28.349" style="s2">hoping to ask you something about where</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.890" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">you see the place of ecovillages in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.349" end="00:00:35.840" style="s2">move towards sustainability it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:38.550" style="s2">different project yeah and then about</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.840" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">how the Masters and ballistic signs came</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.550" end="00:00:44.059" style="s2">about mm-hmm and hopefully they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">time to ask something about good as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.059" end="00:00:50.730" style="s2">yeah okay that&#39;s your fix</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:55.469" style="s2">yeah um okay so could you describe what</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">you on the stand under the oath the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.469" end="00:01:00.930" style="s2">signs of qualities and how it differs</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">from conventional signs yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.930" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">the science of quality is really an</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">extension of conventional science in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">sense that it depends upon consensus and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:18.470" style="s2">agreement and a methodology whereby</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">people come to recognize the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.470" end="00:01:22.740" style="s2">agreement they have for the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:25.500" style="s2">they have about the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.740" end="00:01:27.869" style="s2">experience of other beings and these are</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.500" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">the beings could be other animals they</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.869" end="00:01:34.650" style="s2">can be landscapes they could be an</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">organization a room a building whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">it may be and of course we live our</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">lives in terms of qualities more than</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">quantities quantities have become</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">important but it&#39;s the qualities that</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">really give the texture and the quality</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">to our lives and our relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:52.730" style="s2">research relationship to become primary</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">in the new science</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.730" end="00:01:58.520" style="s2">networks then we have to recover this</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:02:02.540" style="s2">whole area of qualities and there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.520" end="00:02:05.480" style="s2">systematic ways now of demonstrating</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.540" end="00:02:07.340" style="s2">that the people reach consensus very</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.480" end="00:02:09.140" style="s2">effectively about the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.340" end="00:02:11.750" style="s2">experience of form animals about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.140" end="00:02:14.810" style="s2">quality that is expressed in a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.750" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">the quality of a river and so on these</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.810" end="00:02:21.100" style="s2">these are things that people hold done</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:24.530" style="s2">spontaneously at the common sense and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.100" end="00:02:27.590" style="s2">it&#39;s been excluded from science but now</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.530" end="00:02:29.600" style="s2">we need to bring back in as a part of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.590" end="00:02:34.040" style="s2">extension of science and quantities into</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.600" end="00:02:37.670" style="s2">qualities and to what extent did the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.040" end="00:02:40.760" style="s2">work of yan was gone from good and play</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.670" end="00:02:44.270" style="s2">into the science for qualities in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.760" end="00:02:46.310" style="s2">early stage well constantly Gert is such</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.270" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">a wonderful example of a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.310" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">scientist and it&#39;s more than science and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:52.430" style="s2">they begin to eat he obviously was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:56.270" style="s2">holistic human in a sense that he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.430" end="00:03:01.670" style="s2">doing art and servants and he was using</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.270" end="00:03:05.780" style="s2">the the approach of phenomenology to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.670" end="00:03:08.060" style="s2">observe the qualities of beings as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.780" end="00:03:10.820" style="s2">as their quantities he put the two</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.060" end="00:03:13.400" style="s2">together and the systematic way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.820" end="00:03:15.140" style="s2">exploring the natural world I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.400" end="00:03:17.060" style="s2">say natural world I mean everything are</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.140" end="00:03:20.780" style="s2">not distinct for me big distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.060" end="00:03:22.370" style="s2">between nature and culture and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.780" end="00:03:27.080" style="s2">the unification that&#39;s being achieved</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.370" end="00:03:29.600" style="s2">and Gerta is a wonderful example of how</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.080" end="00:03:32.870" style="s2">you can how you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.600" end="00:03:35.980" style="s2">systematically and integrate all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.870" end="00:03:40.520" style="s2">different ways of knowing the intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.980" end="00:03:41.780" style="s2">the sensory the feeling and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.520" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">analytical</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.780" end="00:03:47.060" style="s2">so the thinking and you put all those</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.900" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">together and you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.060" end="00:03:56.060" style="s2">integrated way of knowing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:58.340" style="s2">acting in it considerably and how did</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.060" end="00:04:01.250" style="s2">the idea of setting up the Masters of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.340" end="00:04:02.780" style="s2">holistic science come about and and tell</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.250" end="00:04:07.190" style="s2">a little bit about the story what oh you</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.780" end="00:04:11.810" style="s2">actually and set it up yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.190" end="00:04:14.120" style="s2">I had always ever since my experiences</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.810" end="00:04:18.049" style="s2">at the University of Sussex in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.120" end="00:04:21.019" style="s2">and 70s when you had that a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.049" end="00:04:23.390" style="s2">period of enlightenment I mean the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.019" end="00:04:25.910" style="s2">phenomena was pretty remarkable and at</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.390" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">Sussex it was really very well developed</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.910" end="00:04:33.830" style="s2">and so it it gave me a sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:36.410" style="s2">need to do some stat abolish the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.830" end="00:04:38.390" style="s2">boundaries between traditional subjects</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.410" end="00:04:40.940" style="s2">but not lose any of the rigour</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.390" end="00:04:43.100" style="s2">now that sounds contradictory but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.940" end="00:04:46.250" style="s2">can be very rigorous in your your your</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.100" end="00:04:48.830" style="s2">thinking and your analysis well at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.250" end="00:04:50.930" style="s2">same time you are encompassing the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.830" end="00:04:53.990" style="s2">range of these different ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.930" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">now that&#39;s a bit of a challenge and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.990" end="00:04:57.740" style="s2">something I didn&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:05:00.290" style="s2">solution was to it and I still don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.740" end="00:05:02.150" style="s2">I was exploring that at the University</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.290" end="00:05:04.280" style="s2">of Sussex and then at the Open</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.150" end="00:05:08.690" style="s2">University but there are boundaries to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.280" end="00:05:18.050" style="s2">academic permission and so when I came</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.690" end="00:05:20.540" style="s2">to Schumacher in nineteen in 1996 I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.050" end="00:05:23.660" style="s2">really rather astonished to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.540" end="00:05:27.130" style="s2">it was possible to explore this</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.660" end="00:05:29.450" style="s2">territory of holistic science</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.130" end="00:05:33.460" style="s2">systematically grounding it in chaos</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.450" end="00:05:35.599" style="s2">complexity and Gaia theories and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.460" end="00:05:38.990" style="s2">incorporating all these different</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.599" end="00:05:41.659" style="s2">and of course with Stefan Hani together</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.990" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">we reconstructed this program who was</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.659" end="00:05:50.990" style="s2">accepted by Plymouth and the the bits</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:53.270" style="s2">that have been not adequately developed</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.990" end="00:05:55.219" style="s2">and are still being developed or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.270" end="00:05:58.520" style="s2">areas of experiential learning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.219" end="00:06:03.139" style="s2">practical engagement with the land and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.520" end="00:06:06.469" style="s2">with buildings and this implementation</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.139" end="00:06:10.039" style="s2">of the principles of holistic science in</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.469" end="00:06:12.889" style="s2">holistic living so that&#39;s where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.039" end="00:06:17.300" style="s2">where the Masters has been going for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.889" end="00:06:19.999" style="s2">last four years five years but it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.300" end="00:06:21.639" style="s2">a slow development and now I think this</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.999" end="00:06:24.409" style="s2">need for a real push in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.639" end="00:06:26.749" style="s2">yes we&#39;re getting so do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.409" end="00:06:29.059" style="s2">there&#39;s a and when you say holistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.749" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">living that Lynn&#39;s very strongly into</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.059" end="00:06:35.629" style="s2">the current climate change response and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:39.199" style="s2">the need for increased sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.629" end="00:06:41.479" style="s2">yeah what are the movements where you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.199" end="00:06:44.869" style="s2">see like is permaculture the Eco village</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.479" end="00:06:46.729" style="s2">movement possibly part of a more</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.869" end="00:06:48.339" style="s2">holistic way of living in the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.729" end="00:06:51.319" style="s2">how do you see these grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.339" end="00:06:54.499" style="s2">movements contribute it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.319" end="00:06:57.229" style="s2">central I mean what we are now doing at</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.499" end="00:07:00.879" style="s2">the college is is turning what we call</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.229" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">long culture this monoculture of lawns</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.879" end="00:07:06.289" style="s2">into permaculture agroforestry</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:08.449" style="s2">following Martin Crawford&#39;s inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.289" end="00:07:11.079" style="s2">and other people in the open bill</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.449" end="00:07:13.909" style="s2">Mollison elicits this whole vision of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.079" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2">having something beautiful natural</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.909" end="00:07:20.990" style="s2">productive low-maintenance and so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:22.309" style="s2">is the direction in which the colleges</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.990" end="00:07:24.289" style="s2">moving and we want to move the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.309" end="00:07:26.689" style="s2">estate and of course with transition</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.289" end="00:07:29.509" style="s2">town Totnes we want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.689" end="00:07:33.800" style="s2">cooperative engagement in this whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.509" end="00:07:36.689" style="s2">process of putting into operation as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.800" end="00:07:38.789" style="s2">Nubble holistic community</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.689" end="00:07:41.519" style="s2">and have an example here in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.789" end="00:07:44.999" style="s2">southwest of how this is this is going</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.519" end="00:07:48.869" style="s2">to be achieved and that is beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.999" end="00:07:50.759" style="s2">move in the direction of implementation</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.289" end="00:08:08.069" style="s2">sort of getting on with it and this</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:09.809" style="s2">whole idea of steering into the future</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.809" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">going and is somehow informed by some of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.399" end="00:08:19.169" style="s2">the insights that you gained through a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:20.489" style="s2">long engagement will complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.169" end="00:08:23.579" style="s2">could you say a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.489" end="00:08:26.339" style="s2">them the lessons that complexity the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.579" end="00:08:28.889" style="s2">theory and experiences of the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.339" end="00:08:31.050" style="s2">Institute and your country yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.889" end="00:08:34.680" style="s2">complexity theory that was they it can</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.050" end="00:08:37.050" style="s2">essentially it opened a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.680" end="00:08:39.870" style="s2">window onto this way of knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.050" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">world because it said look we cannot we</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.870" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">can&#39;t predict what happens in complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:49.889" style="s2">systems they&#39;re just that there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:52.410" style="s2">rich a set of interactions and so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.889" end="00:08:55.290" style="s2">we have to do is work with complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.410" end="00:08:59.610" style="s2">systems feel them use your intuition and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.290" end="00:09:01.199" style="s2">your feelings to to get a sense of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.610" end="00:09:03.000" style="s2">things are moving and to move them in</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.199" end="00:09:06.389" style="s2">the right direction this has to be done</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.000" end="00:09:09.649" style="s2">consensus early in the group but at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.389" end="00:09:11.939" style="s2">same time this connects regattas</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.320" end="00:09:41.210" style="s2">now complexity was the root we use to</p>
