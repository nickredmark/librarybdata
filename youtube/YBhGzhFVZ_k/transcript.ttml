<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:09.780" style="s2">oh wait and now as soon as I start I</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.170" end="00:00:11.610" style="s2">have to cuff this cops like the worst</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.780" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">it&#39;s been here for so long it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.610" end="00:00:15.990" style="s2">not bad but it sounds horrible</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:19.230" style="s2">so finally meeting well not in person</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.990" end="00:00:20.970" style="s2">but on video it&#39;s been a while you only</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.230" end="00:00:22.730" style="s2">just join the Facebook group right</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.970" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">you&#39;ve been more involved on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.730" end="00:00:27.800" style="s2">have been more involved in the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:30.750" style="s2">group and now we&#39;re both on both uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.800" end="00:00:35.420" style="s2">really okay so I mean I&#39;ve seen you</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.750" end="00:00:39.600" style="s2">quite active on Twitter already why not</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.420" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">so just I find it hard to get convey</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.600" end="00:00:43.530" style="s2">ideas in Twitter because it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like things the same way as</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">Facebook and I have to keep it within</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">the allotment of characters so I I find</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:56.129" style="s2">very rarely I have succinct ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">tweet I read so I feel it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.129" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">also track things like if Twitter when</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">you put something out there if people</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">don&#39;t see it right away they don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">it right like it doesn&#39;t mmm-hmm they</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.229" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">just have to forget I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">people that I see using Twitter like</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">seriously as a power tool create kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">networks of tweets they make stories and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:24.299" style="s2">then link to their previous stories and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">kind of have their own and of little</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.299" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">knowledge management system on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">so yeah but yeah I mean that&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">interesting topic which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:40.409" style="s2">relevant but I just wanted to say like</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">I&#39;ve been looking forward to talking to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.409" end="00:01:47.729" style="s2">you for a while now it&#39;s um there is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">mystery that I&#39;m I&#39;ve been wondering all</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.729" end="00:01:55.380" style="s2">these months namely you actually wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:57.899" style="s2">comment on one of my videos like a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.380" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">time ago and then when I clicked on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.899" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">notification it was gone so I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">wondering what to happen whether you</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">commented and then like you deleted it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">again so you were kind of like don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">deleted it it was probably YouTube that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.210" style="s2">deleted it if I link to something a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">of time so saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.210" end="00:02:16.230" style="s2">get deleted because they see it as spam</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:18.960" style="s2">what was the comment what did I comment</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.230" end="00:02:21.890" style="s2">you were actually reaching out to me to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.960" end="00:02:25.320" style="s2">have a conversation oh and it wasn&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.890" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">I made a video last February about you</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.320" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">know back when there was not much</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">content about game B I remembered</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.860" style="s2">searching for the hashtag game B on</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:38.490" style="s2">Twitter and it had been used once before</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.860" end="00:02:43.190" style="s2">so really early days at least on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.490" end="00:02:47.340" style="s2">and before the scene is exploded there</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.190" end="00:02:49.170" style="s2">and yeah a few months later you you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.340" end="00:02:52.230" style="s2">reached out to me there some about</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.170" end="00:02:54.630" style="s2">having a conversation and I saw that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.230" end="00:02:58.130" style="s2">then I didn&#39;t find the comment and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.630" end="00:02:58.130" style="s2">thought okay maybe she changed her mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.670" end="00:03:02.790" style="s2">wondering about that since then</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.860" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">interesting I do you remember comment on</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:06.060" style="s2">video and I think he may have been in it</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">there were like four people in it it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.060" end="00:03:09.570" style="s2">a bunch of guys talking about tech in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:10.830" style="s2">the game be when I first entered game B</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.570" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">I was like how do I get in on these</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.830" end="00:03:14.940" style="s2">conversations and I didn&#39;t figure that</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:20.820" style="s2">out but I did figure out how to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.940" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">conversations I know so it&#39;s fitting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.820" end="00:03:23.670" style="s2">conversations in as opposed to try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.220" style="s2">figure out how to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.670" end="00:03:29.730" style="s2">conversations so yeah I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.220" end="00:03:32.490" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing right you know in in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.730" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2">the ante rivals were there is no</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.490" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">scarcity of options right you just make</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">your own and see who joins yeah needs to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:42.510" style="s2">completely in that sense it&#39;s true but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:44.040" style="s2">do have anything organized it like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.510" end="00:03:45.630" style="s2">want to create the tech that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.040" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">easier to find people to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.630" end="00:03:48.600" style="s2">conversation with and to get their like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:52.920" style="s2">information out of those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.600" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">into usable format but I have no problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.920" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">finding the conversation these days are</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:00.960" style="s2">amazing so what are you doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:06.150" style="s2">game be space what is your what is your</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.960" end="00:04:09.300" style="s2">or not like a be space but I pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:13.290" style="s2">is identify my public activity with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.300" end="00:04:14.850" style="s2">space have some friends who I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.290" end="00:04:20.070" style="s2">find it interesting but don&#39;t identify</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.850" end="00:04:22.500" style="s2">too much with with the space but if I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.070" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">had to say name my hobby then it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.500" end="00:04:26.370" style="s2">like participate to participate into</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">game be</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.370" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">and the way I&#39;m approaching this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:36.450" style="s2">a multi-layered effort in a sense like</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to achieve many things at</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.450" end="00:04:44.940" style="s2">once that are all interlinked and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:47.340" style="s2">makes me very slow as a participant but</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.940" end="00:04:50.970" style="s2">I hope that then you know the layering</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.340" end="00:04:56.070" style="s2">of meaning Canavan purifies the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.970" end="00:04:58.980" style="s2">message and so one way I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.070" end="00:05:02.340" style="s2">participating is I&#39;ve looked for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.980" end="00:05:05.460" style="s2">couple of peers and we have been having</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.340" end="00:05:05.910" style="s2">regular calls like weekly every two</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.460" end="00:05:10.740" style="s2">weeks</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.910" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">I still call it informal practice but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.740" end="00:05:17.220" style="s2">tends to be more just discussion and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.210" end="00:05:19.500" style="s2">gossiping about the space and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.220" end="00:05:23.610" style="s2">figure out okay what&#39;s what&#39;s next right</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.500" end="00:05:25.620" style="s2">and the thing is it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.610" end="00:05:27.960" style="s2">quite complex and I would say the course</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.620" end="00:05:32.700" style="s2">still is trying to find coherence within</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.960" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">our little group of three people you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.700" end="00:05:39.990" style="s2">know Wendy right like she is one of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.740" end="00:05:41.820" style="s2">and so this has been one activity then</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.990" end="00:05:43.710" style="s2">the other is I&#39;m a computer scientist so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.820" end="00:05:46.740" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;ve been trying to develop tools</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:48.840" style="s2">that can help me with the group but then</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.740" end="00:05:50.580" style="s2">also for my own kind of thinking sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.840" end="00:05:53.220" style="s2">making note-taking all of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.580" end="00:05:55.830" style="s2">my dream is to have one place where I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.220" end="00:05:59.850" style="s2">just write down things and kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:06:01.860" style="s2">structure structure emerges that helps</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.850" end="00:06:03.990" style="s2">me communicate better that I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.860" end="00:06:08.690" style="s2">actually use or that I can I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.990" end="00:06:11.430" style="s2">built filter views that again that then</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.690" end="00:06:19.020" style="s2">kind of become their own blog post or</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.430" end="00:06:21.630" style="s2">something shareable also and also maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.020" end="00:06:24.780" style="s2">that can interface with other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.630" end="00:06:28.710" style="s2">tools of sense-making then so this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.780" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">kind of my obsession to a degree I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.710" end="00:06:32.250" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:35.250" style="s2">productivity tools and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.250" end="00:06:37.860" style="s2">stuff forever and and maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.250" end="00:06:39.669" style="s2">generally systems you know they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:41.979" style="s2">have to be IT but</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.669" end="00:06:43.719" style="s2">if I think about okay how can I increase</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.979" end="00:06:46.090" style="s2">my willpower then I try to make my own</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.719" end="00:06:49.270" style="s2">little systems they can be physical or</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.090" end="00:06:52.139" style="s2">paper-based yeah this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.270" end="00:06:54.129" style="s2">has been going on for years but now I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.139" end="00:06:56.409" style="s2">think for the first time it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.129" end="00:07:00.300" style="s2">greater than myself in a way like I want</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.409" end="00:07:00.300" style="s2">to link to something that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.449" end="00:07:08.620" style="s2">then there is also linked to that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.759" end="00:07:11.219" style="s2">is the question of the protocol like</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.620" end="00:07:13.509" style="s2">what kind of stack technology stack</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.219" end="00:07:15.750" style="s2">should one develop these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.509" end="00:07:18.279" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve been interested in</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.279" end="00:07:25.180" style="s2">and and interested in the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.090" end="00:07:28.120" style="s2">reasons why why that kind of technology</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.180" end="00:07:30.969" style="s2">is better than you know legacy web and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.120" end="00:07:32.379" style="s2">kind of stuff although my thinking has</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.969" end="00:07:34.349" style="s2">evolved around that I think more than</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.379" end="00:07:38.169" style="s2">peer-to-peer it&#39;s some kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.349" end="00:07:40.389" style="s2">interoperability that is the core I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.169" end="00:07:45.939" style="s2">peer-to-peer affords that but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.389" end="00:07:49.509" style="s2">the only pattern that affords it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.939" end="00:07:51.490" style="s2">then I&#39;m actually trying to okay another</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.509" end="00:07:53.229" style="s2">area that I find interesting is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.490" end="00:07:55.750" style="s2">whole survey aqui Jordan how&#39;d you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.229" end="00:07:58.870" style="s2">that the transformational conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.750" end="00:08:01.060" style="s2">you know thing I find super fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.870" end="00:08:05.500" style="s2">although I haven&#39;t been able to practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.060" end="00:08:08.529" style="s2">much it&#39;s I just veer towards hands-on</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.500" end="00:08:10.300" style="s2">implementing things rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.529" end="00:08:13.180" style="s2">transformational conversations even</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.300" end="00:08:15.789" style="s2">though even there I have some yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.180" end="00:08:17.830" style="s2">have my piece of the puzzle that I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.789" end="00:08:20.439" style="s2">bring in if I were to kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.830" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">join a series circling or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.439" end="00:08:27.849" style="s2">know experimental group but haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:32.409" style="s2">haven&#39;t managed to do that and now the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.849" end="00:08:36.339" style="s2">most recent project or endeavor since I</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.409" end="00:08:38.289" style="s2">joined Facebook I kind of realized that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.339" end="00:08:41.979" style="s2">many people have this angle of okay what</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.289" end="00:08:45.459" style="s2">others can be look like or what does can</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.979" end="00:08:47.949" style="s2">be have to be it&#39;s very theoretical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.459" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">very like far like generations in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.949" end="00:08:52.329" style="s2">future somehow or and then there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:53.290" style="s2">transition be people that think more</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.329" end="00:08:55.779" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.290" end="00:08:58.420" style="s2">how do we kind of keep the world afloat</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.779" end="00:09:01.060" style="s2">all this time until it can be emerges</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.420" end="00:09:03.490" style="s2">and what I&#39;m interested in actually is</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.060" end="00:09:05.589" style="s2">we are already here right there is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.490" end="00:09:08.610" style="s2">network of people there is maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.589" end="00:09:10.990" style="s2">not a network maybe it&#39;s just a cloud of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.610" end="00:09:14.529" style="s2">individual atoms that are not very</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.990" end="00:09:17.110" style="s2">cohesive right and within this network</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.529" end="00:09:19.180" style="s2">there are individual projects and little</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.110" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">groups and it&#39;s actually it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.180" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">two-degree very underground a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">videos that are unlisted you know of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:32.319" style="s2">conversations it&#39;s quite interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:38.230" style="s2">so my question or second I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.319" end="00:09:41.259" style="s2">anything all right my question is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.230" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">could we do if we put that in the focus</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.259" end="00:09:45.490" style="s2">if we put the network itself in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:47.079" style="s2">focus and think okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.490" end="00:09:50.350" style="s2">structure of the network how can the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.079" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">network itself become more of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.350" end="00:09:55.630" style="s2">organism right and so there is this a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:57.819" style="s2">Verve a kiss theory that I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.630" end="00:10:02.260" style="s2">about differentiation and integration</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.819" end="00:10:04.779" style="s2">and small world networks and like his</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.260" end="00:10:07.589" style="s2">theory about relevance realization links</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.779" end="00:10:11.380" style="s2">to cognitive science and neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.589" end="00:10:15.430" style="s2">right and and you can really look at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.380" end="00:10:20.230" style="s2">structure of these networks and yeah by</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.430" end="00:10:22.690" style="s2">analogy what what does our multi like</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.230" end="00:10:25.389" style="s2">what does our network have to look like</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.690" end="00:10:26.500" style="s2">to become more of something that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.389" end="00:10:29.589" style="s2">than the sum of its parts</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.500" end="00:10:32.980" style="s2">I think that that would be a summary of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.589" end="00:10:35.019" style="s2">what I&#39;m looking at all right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.980" end="00:10:38.110" style="s2">think we&#39;re interested in similar stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.019" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t even know how to communicate the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.110" end="00:10:41.470" style="s2">piece that I&#39;m playing and I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:43.540" style="s2">comfortable in that space at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.470" end="00:10:48.250" style="s2">like I&#39;m figuring out how to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.540" end="00:10:50.230" style="s2">a generative conversation how to use the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.250" end="00:10:52.540" style="s2">idea cafe how to create a platform and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.230" end="00:10:55.089" style="s2">it&#39;s more about finding people to video</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.540" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">chat with and finding your group and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.089" end="00:10:58.750" style="s2">being able to actually facilitate that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:00.519" style="s2">process as opposed to just leaving</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.750" end="00:11:01.740" style="s2">enough to chance and allow that to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.519" end="00:11:05.139" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.740" end="00:11:06.550" style="s2">working on like a scheduling tool for</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.139" end="00:11:08.440" style="s2">here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.550" end="00:11:09.850" style="s2">here&#39;s all of our within the network</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.440" end="00:11:11.800" style="s2">right here&#39;s our schedule here are</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.850" end="00:11:15.370" style="s2">people on your schedule who want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.800" end="00:11:16.839" style="s2">about the same information that you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.370" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">to talk about right they&#39;ll make a roll</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.839" end="00:11:24.310" style="s2">on you in or and flame within that space</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:26.829" style="s2">cuz every time I put anything out there</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.310" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t land in the same way I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.829" end="00:11:33.209" style="s2">it&#39;s going to I just something on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">gimme space at the end of last week for</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.209" end="00:11:38.350" style="s2">creating like a food conference with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:42.610" style="s2">understanding to get to like zero slaves</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.350" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">and three tons of carbon and no one</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.610" end="00:11:45.399" style="s2">really Harrison I&#39;ll talk to him this</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:47.769" style="s2">morning about it because he&#39;s within the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.399" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">food space but like I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.769" end="00:11:54.519" style="s2">interested in the existing solutions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:57.730" style="s2">interested in creating them from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.519" end="00:12:00.070" style="s2">ground up including cataloging the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.730" end="00:12:01.959" style="s2">existing solutions and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.070" end="00:12:03.339" style="s2">know which one&#39;s the best and which ones</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.959" end="00:12:04.930" style="s2">in your area and which ones could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.339" end="00:12:06.730" style="s2">start in your area and how do you form a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.930" end="00:12:08.440" style="s2">group around that like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.730" end="00:12:12.040" style="s2">actually make sense together and make</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.440" end="00:12:13.420" style="s2">the sense making tools together and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.040" end="00:12:15.610" style="s2">it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to do those things</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.420" end="00:12:17.890" style="s2">but like how do we bring that together</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.610" end="00:12:21.880" style="s2">and everyone in the game bSpace seems to</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.890" end="00:12:23.230" style="s2">have their own project that they want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.880" end="00:12:24.550" style="s2">keep hold of right they want other</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.230" end="00:12:26.200" style="s2">people to come on board to their project</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.550" end="00:12:27.430" style="s2">but like they said I want it they still</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.200" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">want it to be the way they learned about</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.430" end="00:12:33.250" style="s2">it before on the same way right like</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:35.290" style="s2">it&#39;s projects and what is the meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.250" end="00:12:38.200" style="s2">project for that Network right like what</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.290" end="00:12:40.870" style="s2">is what can what can we create to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.200" end="00:12:42.970" style="s2">facilitate all of them until the point</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.870" end="00:12:45.250" style="s2">we&#39;re all kind of willing and able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.970" end="00:12:49.990" style="s2">let go a little bit more of our projects</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.250" end="00:12:52.660" style="s2">or bring them together how do we have an</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.990" end="00:12:56.890" style="s2">opinion about that and it&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.660" end="00:12:59.050" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard much and actually as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.890" end="00:13:02.680" style="s2">say I see this pattern of I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.050" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">Joe Nell has her platform for projects</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.680" end="00:13:08.050" style="s2">right he lived</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:10.269" style="s2">Phil Phil created the wiki with</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.050" end="00:13:12.190" style="s2">basically one good article which is his</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.269" end="00:13:14.290" style="s2">sense making out but then nobody</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.190" end="00:13:16.120" style="s2">participates in the wiki or maybe now</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.290" end="00:13:18.040" style="s2">something is starting I don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.120" end="00:13:19.870" style="s2">try to check today but there was some</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.040" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">spam issue</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.870" end="00:13:25.930" style="s2">you have your project I have my project</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:27.820" style="s2">and so on and there is his energy of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.930" end="00:13:34.570" style="s2">like please please join my project right</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.820" end="00:13:36.670" style="s2">like otherwise nothing happens I like</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.570" end="00:13:39.430" style="s2">you know like there is a different way</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.670" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">of operating that I think is more</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.430" end="00:13:49.630" style="s2">effective and I&#39;ve come to call it micro</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:54.790" style="s2">contributions at my tias basically it</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.630" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">leans a bit on Bonita Roy&#39;s idea of an</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.790" end="00:13:59.310" style="s2">organisation she has she has like an</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">acronym for it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.310" end="00:14:05.079" style="s2">something like an organization that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:06.699" style="s2">always reach reaches its starting point</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.079" end="00:14:08.380" style="s2">something like that every step brings</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.699" end="00:14:11.790" style="s2">the organization back to the starting</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.380" end="00:14:14.290" style="s2">point right so when you when you say</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.790" end="00:14:17.529" style="s2">please join my thing you start something</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.290" end="00:14:19.480" style="s2">and then there is a big loop that begins</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.529" end="00:14:23.410" style="s2">right like people have to join and so on</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.480" end="00:14:26.260" style="s2">and so forth and unless people join and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.410" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">collaborate and the project comes to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.260" end="00:14:31.269" style="s2">conclusion all the effort was wasted but</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:34.120" style="s2">the micro contribution is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.269" end="00:14:36.819" style="s2">the opposite if you do something that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.120" end="00:14:39.459" style="s2">kind of done immediately as you as you</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.819" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">share it it&#39;s already finished and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.459" end="00:14:47.370" style="s2">you craft it in a way that it is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:50.980" style="s2">infinitely reusable so that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.370" end="00:14:53.709" style="s2">cooperation needed around it or not I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.980" end="00:14:56.769" style="s2">mean no coordination this is another way</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.709" end="00:14:59.380" style="s2">I I frame it like core what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.769" end="00:15:01.870" style="s2">called cooperation without coordination</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.380" end="00:15:03.880" style="s2">right and I think that&#39;s also what</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.870" end="00:15:06.639" style="s2">Jordan Hall means when he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.880" end="00:15:09.190" style="s2">hyper collaboration when you know things</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.639" end="00:15:12.069" style="s2">are happening all the time and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.190" end="00:15:14.050" style="s2">even know and at at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.069" end="00:15:15.940" style="s2">through the kind of the path of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.050" end="00:15:17.800" style="s2">I will meet the right person that has</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.940" end="00:15:22.290" style="s2">the answer when I need it you know like</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.800" end="00:15:25.300" style="s2">kind of synchronicity in that sense and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.290" end="00:15:28.810" style="s2">and so this is the approach that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.300" end="00:15:33.660" style="s2">been trying to follow like on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.810" end="00:15:37.119" style="s2">because with every little</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.660" end="00:15:39.790" style="s2">post that I was putting out there I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.119" end="00:15:43.209" style="s2">not telling I was not saying hey here is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.790" end="00:15:46.629" style="s2">my project please join me I was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.209" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">like okay a little statistic right a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.629" end="00:15:50.559" style="s2">little poll that people can answer and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">everyone will be able to draw their own</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.559" end="00:15:55.540" style="s2">conclusions from that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:57.459" style="s2">Paul the next day I do another poll I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.540" end="00:16:00.309" style="s2">didn&#39;t announce that I would be making</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.459" end="00:16:02.049" style="s2">like a number of faults and but then I</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.309" end="00:16:03.879" style="s2">can link to the previous poll and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.049" end="00:16:06.220" style="s2">like okay each micro contribution is</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.879" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">slowly building up to something but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.220" end="00:16:12.309" style="s2">never announce the project and please</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">join the project you know um I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.309" end="00:16:17.170" style="s2">know it&#39;s just a it also reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:20.649" style="s2">this idea of the swarm right like in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.170" end="00:16:23.290" style="s2">swarm each individual atom just has to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.649" end="00:16:25.959" style="s2">look okay I&#39;m taking care of the guy on</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.290" end="00:16:28.569" style="s2">my right and the guy on my left and try</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.959" end="00:16:30.939" style="s2">to stay in between and there is again</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.569" end="00:16:32.889" style="s2">like this cooperation coordinates or</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.939" end="00:16:34.929" style="s2">cooperation without coordination happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.889" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know this is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.929" end="00:16:41.410" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m trying to sorry I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:44.920" style="s2">to use one last metaphor to describe</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.410" end="00:16:47.679" style="s2">this thing and it has again to do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.920" end="00:16:50.410" style="s2">scarcity versus of these anti rival</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.679" end="00:16:52.869" style="s2">Duras resources right and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.410" end="00:16:56.290" style="s2">there are so many ways that because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.869" end="00:16:59.350" style="s2">are so used to the scarcity mentality we</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.290" end="00:17:01.990" style="s2">create artificial scarcity and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.350" end="00:17:06.819" style="s2">that putting putting boundaries around</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.990" end="00:17:09.970" style="s2">things is is a pattern is that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.819" end="00:17:12.250" style="s2">thing so and and even you know putting a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.970" end="00:17:15.220" style="s2">name naming something or branding</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.250" end="00:17:17.380" style="s2">something creating a community that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.220" end="00:17:19.329" style="s2">people should join you know all of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.380" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">is kind of creating boundaries around</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.329" end="00:17:23.110" style="s2">things that in principle if each</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:25.980" style="s2">individual thing happening within that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.110" end="00:17:29.020" style="s2">boundary was shared as its own thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.980" end="00:17:33.730" style="s2">then it would be more powerful so this</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.020" end="00:17:35.710" style="s2">is yeah my rant sorry I rant as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.730" end="00:17:38.830" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s because there&#39;s a piece</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.710" end="00:17:41.020" style="s2">like I want the coordination and yet I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.830" end="00:17:42.490" style="s2">love the magic of the universe that like</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.020" end="00:17:43.870" style="s2">when the right person like the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.490" end="00:17:46.630" style="s2">person does show up with exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.870" end="00:17:49.540" style="s2">you need when exactly at the right point</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.630" end="00:17:51.550" style="s2">I also want to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.540" end="00:17:53.650" style="s2">technology coordinate that right to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.550" end="00:17:56.530" style="s2">hey I&#39;d like to to have all the micro</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.650" end="00:18:00.100" style="s2">contributions actually lead to the macro</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.530" end="00:18:01.750" style="s2">right to have it be simple and easy to</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.100" end="00:18:03.850" style="s2">contribute you can feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.750" end="00:18:05.380" style="s2">actually did something but have it be</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.850" end="00:18:06.430" style="s2">part of the group with a bigger hole</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.380" end="00:18:07.810" style="s2">because I can see what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.430" end="00:18:11.830" style="s2">about having like a boundary around a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.810" end="00:18:14.290" style="s2">Facebook group but also it&#39;s hard enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.830" end="00:18:16.120" style="s2">to to find those to find those groups</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.290" end="00:18:17.920" style="s2">with without a boundary I&#39;m sorry with</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.120" end="00:18:19.690" style="s2">the boundary taking the boundary way</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.920" end="00:18:21.640" style="s2">actually makes it harder right like how</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.690" end="00:18:23.050" style="s2">do you find your people how it game be</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.640" end="00:18:24.580" style="s2">even have started if there wasn&#39;t a game</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.050" end="00:18:26.800" style="s2">be Facebook group and a game be Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.580" end="00:18:29.670" style="s2">hashtag you know what I mean like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.800" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">can&#39;t just find the game be within cloud</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.670" end="00:18:35.890" style="s2">I think that these two examples are like</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:38.140" style="s2">significantly different or fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.890" end="00:18:40.570" style="s2">different like the Facebook group or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.140" end="00:18:42.100" style="s2">Twitter hashtag right if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.570" end="00:18:44.800" style="s2">it like the hash tag is something that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.100" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">it is not that close group anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.800" end="00:18:49.090" style="s2">use it right and if it becomes too crowd</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:50.890" style="s2">that someone can create a new hashtag</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.090" end="00:18:53.500" style="s2">transition D right because I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.890" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">interested in that and the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.500" end="00:18:58.030" style="s2">group is has this completely different</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">dynamic right now and obviously it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.030" end="00:19:03.580" style="s2">it has to do with the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:05.860" style="s2">like the most authoritative people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.580" end="00:19:08.560" style="s2">there and spend time there and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.860" end="00:19:10.690" style="s2">everyone in a sense would like to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.560" end="00:19:12.490" style="s2">the attention of I don&#39;t know Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.690" end="00:19:14.440" style="s2">Howell Daniels muscular I see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.490" end="00:19:17.320" style="s2">dynamic right there is a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.440" end="00:19:20.470" style="s2">power play that&#39;s happening because of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.320" end="00:19:22.900" style="s2">the nature of the group but probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.470" end="00:19:29.890" style="s2">they will I do know it has its own place</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.900" end="00:19:32.620" style="s2">right yeah I mean right now I see I</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.890" end="00:19:35.670" style="s2">think I I joined in a moment of low</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.620" end="00:19:38.950" style="s2">sovereignty to be honest you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.670" end="00:19:43.690" style="s2">it was like an impulse it was not that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.950" end="00:19:47.650" style="s2">like thinking it through because I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.690" end="00:19:50.590" style="s2">have that that&#39;s the addictive</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.650" end="00:19:54.360" style="s2">relationship to social media in general</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.590" end="00:19:56.620" style="s2">like and the fact last year I deleted</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.360" end="00:19:59.050" style="s2">Facebook I deleted Twitter I deleted</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.620" end="00:20:00.410" style="s2">Instagram I didn&#39;t manage to delete</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.050" end="00:20:02.600" style="s2">YouTube because I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.410" end="00:20:06.590" style="s2">so I spent so much so many hours in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.600" end="00:20:09.220" style="s2">channel but then it has all baby it has</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.590" end="00:20:11.150" style="s2">all come back except the Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.220" end="00:20:14.800" style="s2">Facebook and Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.150" end="00:20:18.620" style="s2">yeah I recreate the new accounts to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.800" end="00:20:21.500" style="s2">participate in the game people own</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.620" end="00:20:25.250" style="s2">conversation and I still feel two ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.500" end="00:20:28.750" style="s2">about it in a way you know like I there</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.250" end="00:20:31.670" style="s2">was a phase in which I had no public</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.750" end="00:20:34.310" style="s2">appearance and I was just enjoying the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.670" end="00:20:36.110" style="s2">happenings of the game be seen from kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.310" end="00:20:38.090" style="s2">of behind the scenes and that was felt</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.110" end="00:20:40.250" style="s2">cool too because we had some you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.090" end="00:20:43.880" style="s2">underground conversations and they had</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.250" end="00:20:46.430" style="s2">impact we saw we saw the impact that</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.880" end="00:20:50.420" style="s2">they were having but kind of from behind</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.430" end="00:20:54.800" style="s2">the scenes powerful to write in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.420" end="00:20:58.040" style="s2">different way yeah yeah it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.800" end="00:21:00.170" style="s2">watching it all come together and not</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.040" end="00:21:03.820" style="s2">come together and it&#39;s like chaotic but</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.170" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">in this weird or mean way I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.820" end="00:21:09.050" style="s2">with together tech it was just me and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:10.580" style="s2">have entered the game be space</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.050" end="00:21:12.350" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like we don&#39;t know how we get</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.580" end="00:21:14.060" style="s2">to game B I&#39;m like I know how we get to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.350" end="00:21:14.540" style="s2">Gainey be like I&#39;m not gonna pretend I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.060" end="00:21:16.250" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.540" end="00:21:18.620" style="s2">I can&#39;t necessarily communicate it in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.250" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">linear way but it&#39;s happening and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.620" end="00:21:22.280" style="s2">don&#39;t think it takes generations I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:23.390" style="s2">it takes a handful of us to come</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.280" end="00:21:25.460" style="s2">together to create something that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.390" end="00:21:27.380" style="s2">anybody can be part of and then it grows</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.460" end="00:21:31.130" style="s2">and grows from there if it&#39;s if the</p>

<p begin="00:21:31.130" end="00:21:38.060" style="s2">not necessarily peer to peer and and on</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.770" end="00:21:40.040" style="s2">the stack because those things are just</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.060" end="00:21:41.420" style="s2">gonna feed off each other right you you</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.040" end="00:21:42.890" style="s2">each have your own project and no one</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.420" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">else wants to join it and yet owning</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.890" end="00:21:46.280" style="s2">that right I have my own project and yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:47.510" style="s2">it&#39;s the meta project but it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.280" end="00:21:50.930" style="s2">same thing right it&#39;s still I want</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.510" end="00:21:55.010" style="s2">people to join it and so Bentley joined</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.930" end="00:21:57.170" style="s2">he has his own project reason score and</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.800" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">project and then the bigger meta project</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.170" end="00:22:13.320" style="s2">and then project raisings on Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:16.200" style="s2">that our</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.320" end="00:22:19.289" style="s2">you can bring your project to it and how</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.200" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">do we get to the how do we create the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.289" end="00:22:24.119" style="s2">system that helps all of them and how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:26.220" style="s2">we create the communication pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.119" end="00:22:29.549" style="s2">how do we create something that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.220" end="00:22:32.070" style="s2">already being done and it&#39;s just a fun</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.549" end="00:22:34.619" style="s2">space to play in because it is it brings</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.070" end="00:22:37.019" style="s2">up a lot of emotion and ego at least in</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.619" end="00:22:39.179" style="s2">me I can feel of like this is mine and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.019" end="00:22:41.519" style="s2">it&#39;s not mine it&#39;s not mine in any way I</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.519" end="00:22:47.489" style="s2">even own the thing that&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.809" end="00:22:50.429" style="s2">coming through me it&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.489" end="00:22:52.289" style="s2">exactly the right space but having but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.429" end="00:22:53.700" style="s2">still want more organization like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.289" end="00:22:55.859" style="s2">idea that everything happens in there</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.700" end="00:22:58.049" style="s2">it&#39;s like yes and we can organize it so</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.859" end="00:22:59.970" style="s2">that when it happens it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.049" end="00:23:03.090" style="s2">every piece of it doesn&#39;t need to happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.970" end="00:23:04.889" style="s2">to every person you can have the next if</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.090" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">I know I need legal advice I know where</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.889" end="00:23:08.039" style="s2">to go for legal advice if I know I need</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:10.230" style="s2">financial advice I know where to go for</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.039" end="00:23:11.850" style="s2">financial advice and I think that is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.230" end="00:23:15.899" style="s2">next step we&#39;re taking and is fine you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.850" end="00:23:18.529" style="s2">know how to bring people together with</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.899" end="00:23:21.359" style="s2">projects and offer them something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.529" end="00:23:24.659" style="s2">they want to be part of the more meta</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.359" end="00:23:28.700" style="s2">project and not making it be ours right</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.659" end="00:23:28.700" style="s2">like how do how do how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.710" end="00:23:47.059" style="s2">okay I have to take a step back because</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.440" end="00:23:52.379" style="s2">I find myself reacting with skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.059" end="00:23:56.549" style="s2">and I&#39;m tempted to enter an</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.379" end="00:23:59.789" style="s2">argumentative mode but I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.549" end="00:24:08.100" style="s2">that&#39;s appropriate order that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.789" end="00:24:10.259" style="s2">want you know wondering because at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.100" end="00:24:13.220" style="s2">end of the day it&#39;s just a feeling so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.259" end="00:24:20.879" style="s2">would be I think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.220" end="00:24:22.499" style="s2">confabulating arguments and you might</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.879" end="00:24:25.519" style="s2">have answers to all those arguments the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.499" end="00:24:25.519" style="s2">feeling would still be there</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.620" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">trying to think what what the right</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.600" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">approach would be here there definitely</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:52.460" style="s2">is a fear of losing power</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:55.070" style="s2">there definitely is something like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.460" end="00:25:00.649" style="s2">there you know like my project I have no</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.070" end="00:25:03.320" style="s2">control over it and so the like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.649" end="00:25:06.350" style="s2">trust that would be needed to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.320" end="00:25:07.880" style="s2">hand over part of the control or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.350" end="00:25:10.039" style="s2">know I don&#39;t even know what you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.880" end="00:25:15.889" style="s2">maybe even just the credit part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.039" end="00:25:19.220" style="s2">credit right and this might be linked to</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.889" end="00:25:25.809" style="s2">I don&#39;t know a tendency of mine kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.220" end="00:25:29.090" style="s2">being the lone wolf and and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.809" end="00:25:32.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not productive that&#39;s for sure</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.110" end="00:25:40.220" style="s2">to degree though it&#39;s an aesthetic as</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.669" end="00:25:42.380" style="s2">well if I think about open source</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.220" end="00:25:46.610" style="s2">libraries there are kind of two types of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.380" end="00:25:49.070" style="s2">libraries there are these small little</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.610" end="00:25:53.090" style="s2">things that do one thing and do it well</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.070" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">it&#39;s the UNIX principle and they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.090" end="00:25:57.769" style="s2">barely updated you know they once</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re done maybe once in</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.769" end="00:26:02.029" style="s2">a decade someone finds a bug and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:04.309" style="s2">fixed and that&#39;s it right so no new</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.029" end="00:26:07.850" style="s2">features no nothing it&#39;s just there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.309" end="00:26:10.600" style="s2">it does its thing and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.850" end="00:26:15.159" style="s2">would call a micro contribution right</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.600" end="00:26:18.110" style="s2">it&#39;s small it&#39;s maximally composable and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.159" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">it can be owned by one person right like</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.110" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">one person thinks deeply about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">problem finds the one little solution to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:24.830" style="s2">that very well specified problem and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:26.659" style="s2">that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.830" end="00:26:28.940" style="s2">the solution is there for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.659" end="00:26:32.029" style="s2">forever and then there are these other</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.940" end="00:26:33.950" style="s2">things did these big monoliths that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.029" end="00:26:36.230" style="s2">these frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.950" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">generally it&#39;s frameworks that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.230" end="00:26:39.980" style="s2">are there to allow you to do everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.980" end="00:26:43.580" style="s2">you want to build a website use this</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:46.460" style="s2">framework you can build any website and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.580" end="00:26:47.990" style="s2">then you have plugins and all this it</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.460" end="00:26:50.809" style="s2">takes care of everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.990" end="00:26:53.149" style="s2">but then the problem is governance</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.809" end="00:26:56.179" style="s2">starts becoming a problem right does</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.149" end="00:26:59.750" style="s2">this belong to the feature stack or is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.179" end="00:27:02.750" style="s2">it a plug-in that updates and technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.750" end="00:27:05.720" style="s2">and you know like maybe one quarter of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.750" end="00:27:09.320" style="s2">the feature set now suddenly is being</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.720" end="00:27:11.149" style="s2">solved very well by some new thing right</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.320" end="00:27:13.130" style="s2">that is somewhere but then now we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.149" end="00:27:15.289" style="s2">to decide whether all these hours that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.130" end="00:27:17.779" style="s2">we invested and then the technology</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.289" end="00:27:23.480" style="s2">becomes tightly coupled and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.779" end="00:27:25.730" style="s2">nightmare right and so it&#39;s certainly an</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.480" end="00:27:29.899" style="s2">aesthetic thing probably there is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.730" end="00:27:32.389" style="s2">place for such projects as well even</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.899" end="00:27:35.210" style="s2">though I found myself as an engineer</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.389" end="00:27:37.130" style="s2">avoiding them more and more in my life I</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.210" end="00:27:38.870" style="s2">don&#39;t know yeah you probably not</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.130" end="00:27:44.960" style="s2">familiar with meteor but that would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.870" end="00:27:48.529" style="s2">an example to twin country or meteor you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.960" end="00:27:51.409" style="s2">know exactly I mean that I I founded a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.529" end="00:27:53.480" style="s2">start-up built the technology on that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.409" end="00:27:57.380" style="s2">stack and it took me two years to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.480" end="00:28:00.019" style="s2">out I mean in the end that startup we</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.380" end="00:28:02.210" style="s2">for other reasons we closed it it never</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.019" end="00:28:05.419" style="s2">went anywhere but I never managed to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.210" end="00:28:09.169" style="s2">away from that monolith where every</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.419" end="00:28:12.679" style="s2">little library was like you were stuck</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.169" end="00:28:15.730" style="s2">with the whole thing and so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.679" end="00:28:19.159" style="s2">like when I think about meta projects</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.730" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">this is the feeling that comes online of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.159" end="00:28:23.240" style="s2">the thing that then suddenly like my</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:29.330" style="s2">contribution is part of this bigger</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.240" end="00:28:31.460" style="s2">thing and instead if I didn&#39;t label it</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.330" end="00:28:33.860" style="s2">or like I didn&#39;t brand it or I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.460" end="00:28:35.870" style="s2">kind of kind of like connected or couple</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.860" end="00:28:37.519" style="s2">it strongly with this meta project it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.870" end="00:28:39.950" style="s2">would be simply this one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.519" end="00:28:41.899" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not even be related it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.950" end="00:28:44.779" style="s2">like it has an input it has an output</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.899" end="00:28:46.669" style="s2">anyone who needs that thing can use it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.779" end="00:28:52.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s it you know the anti</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.669" end="00:28:56.820" style="s2">rivalries nests maximize yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.440" end="00:28:58.350" style="s2">like the intellectual piece of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.820" end="00:29:00.060" style="s2">everyone being able to contribute to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.350" end="00:29:02.610" style="s2">comments and take from the you know like</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.060" end="00:29:04.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s how many what antivirus is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.610" end="00:29:07.650" style="s2">game be in the future but how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.920" end="00:29:09.150" style="s2">there when we all want to keep track a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.650" end="00:29:10.500" style="s2">hold of our own baby news and we all</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.150" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">want you know what I mean like we want</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.500" end="00:29:13.800" style="s2">to make a living and get our</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.110" style="s2">intellectual property on the way there</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.800" end="00:29:18.600" style="s2">right like we want someone else to show</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.110" end="00:29:21.210" style="s2">off our ideas when we&#39;re and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.600" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">partly owning that right and how do we</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.940" end="00:29:46.920" style="s2">that we feel safe enough letting go of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.890" end="00:29:48.660" style="s2">them but only ever if you feel safe</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.920" end="00:29:50.280" style="s2">enough right not with the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.660" end="00:29:51.570" style="s2">that everyone has to just like I&#39;m never</p>

<p begin="00:29:53.270" end="00:29:58.800" style="s2">but I get to choose whether and part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.430" end="00:30:01.020" style="s2">a group right I get to choose how much</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.800" end="00:30:02.310" style="s2">together we&#39;ve made rules and then I get</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.020" end="00:30:04.050" style="s2">to decide if I want to participate or</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.310" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">not or I want to take my sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.050" end="00:30:16.170" style="s2">himself and go somewhere else okay I</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:20.220" style="s2">mean it&#39;s interesting the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.170" end="00:30:21.780" style="s2">you mentioned are not necessarily coding</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.220" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">related right it&#39;s more like it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.780" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">about everything outside the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.150" end="00:30:30.540" style="s2">are around the expertise okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:33.710" style="s2">interesting well then I guess I have</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.540" end="00:30:36.630" style="s2">another a follow-up question and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.710" end="00:30:39.780" style="s2">believe I didn&#39;t know the answer and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.630" end="00:30:43.260" style="s2">don&#39;t find it so satisfactory but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.780" end="00:30:45.680" style="s2">let let me let let me ask you how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.260" end="00:30:48.830" style="s2">have you thought about governance</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.680" end="00:30:51.990" style="s2">because the way I understand it is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.830" end="00:30:54.560" style="s2">basic democratic democratic process</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.990" end="00:30:58.410" style="s2">right we&#39;ve four big decisions we vote</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.560" end="00:31:02.270" style="s2">and the feeling that I have is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.410" end="00:31:04.950" style="s2">that&#39;s just very very beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.270" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">thinking about governance and if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.950" end="00:31:09.150" style="s2">want to have a meta project</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:11.280" style="s2">does everything democracy like just this</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.150" end="00:31:14.820" style="s2">basic democratic principle is not going</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.280" end="00:31:18.179" style="s2">to do it yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.820" end="00:31:19.260" style="s2">so there&#39;s so many facets of answers</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.179" end="00:31:21.720" style="s2">that yes I&#39;ve thought a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.260" end="00:31:25.140" style="s2">governance for together tech when it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.720" end="00:31:26.160" style="s2">more met on my project um before letting</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.140" end="00:31:28.350" style="s2">other people touch it</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.160" end="00:31:30.210" style="s2">the idea was until we didn&#39;t need one</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.350" end="00:31:32.790" style="s2">there would be a board of directors who</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.210" end="00:31:34.740" style="s2">would be empowered with liquid democracy</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.790" end="00:31:37.740" style="s2">so your members and power them and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.740" end="00:31:39.750" style="s2">get to come to consensus and/or vote if</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.740" end="00:31:41.340" style="s2">they come to a standstill with the power</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.750" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">the members have given them right so you</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.340" end="00:31:44.820" style="s2">have between 0 and 99 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:49.400" style="s2">vote or 100 percent of the vote I guess</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.820" end="00:31:52.110" style="s2">sitting around the boardroom but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.400" end="00:31:53.670" style="s2">my version of how it would be now that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.110" end="00:31:59.370" style="s2">we&#39;re growing up we&#39;re building it from</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.670" end="00:32:00.780" style="s2">the bottom out it&#39;s not that it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.370" end="00:32:02.850" style="s2">don&#39;t have an entity yet that needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.780" end="00:32:04.200" style="s2">governance its sovereign individuals</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.850" end="00:32:05.730" style="s2">coming together let&#39;s figure out how we</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.200" end="00:32:08.370" style="s2">can coordinate a conference let&#39;s figure</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.730" end="00:32:10.530" style="s2">out how we can what would what would you</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.370" end="00:32:12.750" style="s2">need in that meta project to be willing</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.530" end="00:32:15.000" style="s2">to come and participate to be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.750" end="00:32:17.220" style="s2">at what point would you be okay giving</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.000" end="00:32:19.020" style="s2">up your baby even if you don&#39;t ever have</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.220" end="00:32:21.630" style="s2">to just like a thought experiment right</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.020" end="00:32:23.640" style="s2">like well if I maintain 51% ownership or</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.630" end="00:32:25.020" style="s2">if there are a million people involved</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.640" end="00:32:27.630" style="s2">and they I don&#39;t know what those that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.020" end="00:32:29.730" style="s2">barrier is for people but you get to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.630" end="00:32:32.220" style="s2">maintain yourself in your project but</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.730" end="00:32:33.900" style="s2">you can also at what point do we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.220" end="00:32:35.700" style="s2">enough funding enough numbers I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.900" end="00:32:37.559" style="s2">enough to offer you that you would give</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.700" end="00:32:42.090" style="s2">up your project right like that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.559" end="00:32:44.130" style="s2">don&#39;t ever have to it&#39;s it&#39;s dealing</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.090" end="00:32:46.940" style="s2">with that stubborn individual and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.130" end="00:32:49.559" style="s2">sovereign groups and saying yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.940" end="00:32:50.940" style="s2">dealing with people where they are right</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.559" end="00:32:54.170" style="s2">if they don&#39;t feel comfortable giving it</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.940" end="00:32:57.000" style="s2">up and who does right now nobody then</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.170" end="00:32:59.820" style="s2">what would make that safe enough if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.000" end="00:33:03.590" style="s2">have got salary would you feel safe</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.820" end="00:33:07.380" style="s2">enough right like what is the level so</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.590" end="00:33:08.850" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t understand yet what what</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.380" end="00:33:13.830" style="s2">that means what what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.850" end="00:33:16.590" style="s2">give up a product because because okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.830" end="00:33:19.110" style="s2">I&#39;m going to add the context which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.590" end="00:33:21.270" style="s2">that my projects that I&#39;m contributing</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.110" end="00:33:24.180" style="s2">to game be</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.270" end="00:33:26.430" style="s2">are basically in the public domain I</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.180" end="00:33:29.940" style="s2">don&#39;t want anything in return like they</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.430" end="00:33:32.820" style="s2">I have already given up yeah these</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.940" end="00:33:35.160" style="s2">projects plus I&#39;m building them or and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.820" end="00:33:37.320" style="s2">trying to build build them in this</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.160" end="00:33:41.430" style="s2">minimalist way so that you know like</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.320" end="00:33:44.810" style="s2">they are they can be maximally reused so</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.430" end="00:33:48.210" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what more I could give up</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.810" end="00:33:49.890" style="s2">the question right so I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.210" end="00:33:51.690" style="s2">about that type of project I have those</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.890" end="00:33:53.670" style="s2">as well and they just go up into the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.690" end="00:33:56.310" style="s2">world and they&#39;re already in that space</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.670" end="00:33:57.990" style="s2">but if we build something together which</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.310" end="00:34:00.270" style="s2">is what I had envisioned for together</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.990" end="00:34:01.410" style="s2">Tech is like we and I&#39;m still envisioned</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.270" end="00:34:04.410" style="s2">and I&#39;m still working out how we</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.410" end="00:34:06.030" style="s2">actually would do that together the idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.410" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">for the food one was we&#39;d get together</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.030" end="00:34:11.670" style="s2">for a conference have an idea cafe on</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:13.740" style="s2">what are you currently doing for food</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.670" end="00:34:16.260" style="s2">and what does that mean for your body</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.740" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">the environments and the world and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.260" end="00:34:19.560" style="s2">could we be doing in groups of ten in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:21.330" style="s2">hundred and a thousand and then if</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.560" end="00:34:22.860" style="s2">something came out of there how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.330" end="00:34:24.060" style="s2">fund it how do we create it how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.860" end="00:34:27.570" style="s2">how do we work through that process</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.060" end="00:34:29.550" style="s2">together if we created it in that way we</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.570" end="00:34:30.750" style="s2">own it together and then we have to work</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.550" end="00:34:32.100" style="s2">through the governance of what happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.750" end="00:34:33.780" style="s2">when new people come on board is this</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.100" end="00:34:37.140" style="s2">owned by humanity or is it owned by the</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.780" end="00:34:38.910" style="s2">500 people who started right I hope I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.140" end="00:34:41.940" style="s2">gonna be but that&#39;s my voice right</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.910" end="00:34:44.610" style="s2">that&#39;s my vote but I think my brother</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.940" end="00:34:46.680" style="s2">has Wiki election as his project that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.610" end="00:34:48.420" style="s2">Lee has reasons scorned as his project</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.680" end="00:34:50.010" style="s2">I kind of have idea cafe as my project</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.420" end="00:34:50.990" style="s2">although it&#39;s also under the together</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.010" end="00:34:54.270" style="s2">tech umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.990" end="00:34:56.430" style="s2">yonis has one called kind Act they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.270" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">all kind of in their infancy they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.430" end="00:35:02.010" style="s2">coated ready to use apps right and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:05.340" style="s2">part of it is you have your own idea how</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.010" end="00:35:06.600" style="s2">to make a sense making up and all these</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.340" end="00:35:08.850" style="s2">other people are making sense making</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.600" end="00:35:10.590" style="s2">apps as well at what point do you let go</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.850" end="00:35:12.390" style="s2">of your vision and create something from</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.590" end="00:35:13.890" style="s2">the base up you have to decide right</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.390" end="00:35:15.630" style="s2">like at what point is my brother gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.890" end="00:35:17.310" style="s2">let wiki lection be part of the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.630" end="00:35:20.040" style="s2">that&#39;s for him to decide because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.310" end="00:35:21.420" style="s2">his so it depends how like these are</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.040" end="00:35:23.700" style="s2">things that you&#39;re actually putting time</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.420" end="00:35:25.470" style="s2">actually putting money into and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.700" end="00:35:27.350" style="s2">point are you willing to maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.470" end="00:35:29.460" style="s2">selling it to the comments maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.350" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">maintaining ownership and having other</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.460" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">people come on board but they&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">decide if they come on board if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:35.830" style="s2">maintain 99</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:37.810" style="s2">ownership and all of the power no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.830" end="00:35:43.060" style="s2">gonna come on more project right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.810" end="00:35:45.250" style="s2">about solving and marketing finance and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.060" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">people for each individual project how</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.250" end="00:35:47.950" style="s2">do we do that together so you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:49.540" style="s2">to give up your project but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.950" end="00:35:54.180" style="s2">tool that helps you get those problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.540" end="00:35:54.180" style="s2">solved okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.510" end="00:35:59.800" style="s2">please correct me I&#39;m still not 100%</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.550" end="00:36:02.410" style="s2">sure I understand it because from what</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.800" end="00:36:04.870" style="s2">you say my sense is that I have already</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.410" end="00:36:08.410" style="s2">given up my project like it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.870" end="00:36:11.140" style="s2">yours it&#39;s already you know on github</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.410" end="00:36:16.690" style="s2">download it modify it or use it you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.140" end="00:36:19.270" style="s2">like it looks like it&#39;s not about my</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.690" end="00:36:23.020" style="s2">project it&#39;s about my time like from now</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.270" end="00:36:26.970" style="s2">on what am I going to do am I going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.020" end="00:36:30.340" style="s2">give up my time to do something I feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.970" end="00:36:33.060" style="s2">may be less meaningful but would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.340" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">shared with other stuff is it about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.060" end="00:36:39.820" style="s2">or is there something more than I can do</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:41.610" style="s2">with my projects other than open</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.820" end="00:36:45.340" style="s2">sourcing them from the start</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.610" end="00:36:46.750" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.340" end="00:36:48.130" style="s2">the individual has to decide when</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.750" end="00:36:50.020" style="s2">they&#39;re creating a project right is it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.130" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">open source is it not open source is it</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.020" end="00:36:55.060" style="s2">community owned do I own it</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:56.500" style="s2">the shareholders own it but anyone we</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.060" end="00:36:57.940" style="s2">don&#39;t have them at a project yet the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.500" end="00:36:59.620" style="s2">idea is anyone can bring their matter</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.940" end="00:37:01.030" style="s2">but it&#39;s just them and their project and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.620" end="00:37:03.130" style="s2">they never have to give up ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.030" end="00:37:04.420" style="s2">anything they can just come and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.130" end="00:37:06.150" style="s2">I need help with marketing and I need</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.420" end="00:37:08.170" style="s2">help with finance I need help with</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.150" end="00:37:09.850" style="s2">brainstorm E and how to get more members</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.170" end="00:37:12.310" style="s2">right that&#39;s what raising project</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.850" end="00:37:13.930" style="s2">raising is you don&#39;t come to it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.310" end="00:37:15.610" style="s2">share of it we&#39;re giving you an hour of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.930" end="00:37:17.310" style="s2">our time how do we help you move forward</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.610" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">with your project in your goals in life</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.310" end="00:37:22.870" style="s2">and creating the infrastructure to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:25.420" style="s2">able to do that on a platform creating</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.870" end="00:37:28.780" style="s2">the infrastructure to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.420" end="00:37:30.910" style="s2">facilitate that process it&#39;s and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.780" end="00:37:33.100" style="s2">the ideas eventually maybe we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.910" end="00:37:34.900" style="s2">metrics for whether you can be involved</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.100" end="00:37:39.310" style="s2">in it right like if you&#39;re a completely</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.900" end="00:37:41.740" style="s2">game B for-profit hurting the earth you</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.310" end="00:37:42.940" style="s2">know game a company we probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.740" end="00:37:44.860" style="s2">want you to be part of it we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.940" end="00:37:47.140" style="s2">to help you get there so what are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.860" end="00:37:50.920" style="s2">check box be part of this right</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.140" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">what point do we there&#39;s a cost and a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.920" end="00:37:56.260" style="s2">benefit to owning something together but</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:57.670" style="s2">if somebody owns it already they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.260" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">gonna give up ownership unless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.670" end="00:38:00.640" style="s2">something in it for them right including</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:02.950" style="s2">just the feel-good feeling of giving it</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.640" end="00:38:05.410" style="s2">to the Commons then great but most of us</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.950" end="00:38:07.270" style="s2">the ideas people in game bSpace have</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.410" end="00:38:08.830" style="s2">projects right if you&#39;re someone who</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.270" end="00:38:11.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a project and it is looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.830" end="00:38:14.110" style="s2">where to put your time and expertise</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.370" end="00:38:16.120" style="s2">that&#39;s gold right like we want those</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.110" end="00:38:19.900" style="s2">people to be working on the projects but</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.120" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">everyone has a project and so if it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.900" end="00:38:22.750" style="s2">more than the other way around where</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:24.190" style="s2">there was a handful of projects and tons</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.750" end="00:38:25.480" style="s2">and tons of people looking to work on</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.190" end="00:38:27.130" style="s2">them then we would create the platform</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.480" end="00:38:28.600" style="s2">for the tons and tons of people that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.130" end="00:38:30.700" style="s2">want to work on them but it&#39;s creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.600" end="00:38:32.980" style="s2">both of that it&#39;s creating as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.700" end="00:38:34.810" style="s2">individual projects I want one dashboard</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.980" end="00:38:37.210" style="s2">to see with all the projects I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.810" end="00:38:38.590" style="s2">involved in and where I can go and how I</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.210" end="00:38:40.660" style="s2">can be part of a conversation to help</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.590" end="00:38:43.120" style="s2">this one and help this one as a project</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.660" end="00:38:44.980" style="s2">owner I want to be able to draw in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.120" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">people and work with them effectively to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.980" end="00:38:48.700" style="s2">move my project forward as a matter</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:50.920" style="s2">project holder I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.700" end="00:38:54.580" style="s2">create project solutions from the ground</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.920" end="00:38:56.140" style="s2">up working through a process and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.580" end="00:39:01.030" style="s2">paint on all three of those fronts at</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.140" end="00:39:11.470" style="s2">the same time my phone keeps getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.030" end="00:39:14.350" style="s2">dark okay honey</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.470" end="00:39:17.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve been following you on YouTube like</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.350" end="00:39:20.110" style="s2">I check in the videos and so I am more</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.830" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">or less aware of what&#39;s happening I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.110" end="00:39:25.840" style="s2">found that interesting that the project</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:28.570" style="s2">project raising and also their I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.840" end="00:39:31.840" style="s2">the rather project of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.570" end="00:39:35.710" style="s2">I follow them quite find them quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.840" end="00:39:38.430" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s cool that you you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.710" end="00:39:42.270" style="s2">all willing to share that I like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.430" end="00:39:42.270" style="s2">mode of participation</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.540" end="00:39:50.730" style="s2">I mean I this is something I find</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.200" end="00:39:54.090" style="s2">interesting this approach of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.730" end="00:39:55.859" style="s2">everyone has a project that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.090" end="00:39:58.369" style="s2">because there is overlap between the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.859" end="00:40:01.710" style="s2">project right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.369" end="00:40:04.260" style="s2">now I think in my head the solution is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.710" end="00:40:06.119" style="s2">still a different one and then then the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.260" end="00:40:09.270" style="s2">new the one she would approach or</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.119" end="00:40:16.130" style="s2">perhaps I guess my my input would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.270" end="00:40:19.380" style="s2">taken in if I were part of it but so my</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.130" end="00:40:22.200" style="s2">approach would be a clear separation of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.380" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">concerns rather than trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.200" end="00:40:28.080" style="s2">something together like oh let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:30.900" style="s2">this bigger project that like puts these</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.080" end="00:40:32.760" style="s2">four together I would say okay wait I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.900" end="00:40:34.980" style="s2">doing this and you&#39;re doing that there</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.760" end="00:40:37.230" style="s2">is overlap how can we differentiate more</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.980" end="00:40:41.190" style="s2">so that my project can Indian interface</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.230" end="00:40:43.859" style="s2">with your project so this is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.190" end="00:40:46.200" style="s2">approach that I would follow and I go</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.859" end="00:40:48.510" style="s2">towards this this pattern of doing one</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.200" end="00:40:49.950" style="s2">thing that does it well what for once</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.510" end="00:40:52.830" style="s2">and then it&#39;s done you know it could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.950" end="00:40:55.380" style="s2">a micro protocol it could be okay you</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.830" end="00:40:58.380" style="s2">find yourself with this huge meta</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.380" end="00:41:00.840" style="s2">project vision maybe I would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.380" end="00:41:05.430" style="s2">solve maybe even from the outside you</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.840" end="00:41:07.050" style="s2">know I&#39;m it&#39;s a generic I like how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.430" end="00:41:08.730" style="s2">have a meeting that&#39;s successful you</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.050" end="00:41:11.369" style="s2">know like a little protocol right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.730" end="00:41:13.890" style="s2">and that&#39;s it right that&#39;s my project I</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.369" end="00:41:15.930" style="s2">don&#39;t need to you know like share it</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.890" end="00:41:19.500" style="s2">with anyone because it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.930" end="00:41:25.010" style="s2">beginning and an end and and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.500" end="00:41:27.300" style="s2">done you know and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.010" end="00:41:29.660" style="s2">additionally there is this you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.300" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">there is already so much that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.660" end="00:41:34.830" style="s2">happening along those lines without any</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:37.050" style="s2">meta project needed to coordinate that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.830" end="00:41:39.630" style="s2">right there is already so much that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.050" end="00:41:42.410" style="s2">being added to the Commons especially in</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.630" end="00:41:46.230" style="s2">in in in terms of open source software</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.410" end="00:41:48.540" style="s2">um so that then the question is okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.230" end="00:41:50.130" style="s2">like if it&#39;s already happening and there</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.540" end="00:41:57.020" style="s2">is a phenomenon there it&#39;s powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.130" end="00:41:59.380" style="s2">so on like where exactly is there is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.020" end="00:42:01.089" style="s2">the the umbrella project</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.380" end="00:42:04.089" style="s2">right if it&#39;s already emerging on its</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.089" end="00:42:06.730" style="s2">own yeah best argument for helping each</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.089" end="00:42:10.180" style="s2">other with that with a kind of boundary</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.730" end="00:42:12.369" style="s2">you know marketing and so on like for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.180" end="00:42:13.960" style="s2">with open source technology I love open</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.369" end="00:42:15.640" style="s2">source technology anything I&#39;m part of I</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.960" end="00:42:18.849" style="s2">would love to be open source technology</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.640" end="00:42:22.210" style="s2">but it also isn&#39;t I&#39;m not a tech person</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.849" end="00:42:24.309" style="s2">i discord annoys annoys me a lot like I</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.210" end="00:42:27.220" style="s2">can&#39;t deal with discord face looks kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.309" end="00:42:29.079" style="s2">of like the level of my technology that</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.079" end="00:42:33.609" style="s2">can&#39;t I can&#39;t do that and open-source is</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.660" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">accessible and open to people who know</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.420" end="00:42:45.309" style="s2">me for the free level and so to be able</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.180" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">to have a tech cooperative that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.309" end="00:42:51.339" style="s2">dealing with the actual user to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:53.289" style="s2">I have this problem I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.339" end="00:42:55.869" style="s2">work through it to a solution and have</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.289" end="00:42:57.789" style="s2">somebody code that solution is only</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.869" end="00:43:00.190" style="s2">available in the tech space like even</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.789" end="00:43:01.630" style="s2">this like hacker activities thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.190" end="00:43:03.309" style="s2">just joined I&#39;m like wait do you have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.630" end="00:43:05.619" style="s2">be a coder to be part of it like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.309" end="00:43:07.480" style="s2">isn&#39;t it Sun accessible to everyone if</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.619" end="00:43:09.730" style="s2">we want 7.5 billion people to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.480" end="00:43:11.369" style="s2">involved eventually writing game be it</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.730" end="00:43:15.309" style="s2">has to be accessible to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.369" end="00:43:17.740" style="s2">intellectually and technologically and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.309" end="00:43:19.329" style="s2">don&#39;t find open-source is that&#39;s and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.740" end="00:43:21.009" style="s2">lot of times the open-source projects</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.329" end="00:43:24.309" style="s2">aren&#39;t pretty and they&#39;re not user</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.009" end="00:43:27.339" style="s2">friendly and so something that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.309" end="00:43:29.319" style="s2">essence a seed we can grow can be both</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.339" end="00:43:31.539" style="s2">user friendly and have an every project</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.319" end="00:43:33.609" style="s2">that started has a lot of risk to it it</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.539" end="00:43:35.589" style="s2">you don&#39;t maybe have risk because you</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.609" end="00:43:36.970" style="s2">know how to code yourself but if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.589" end="00:43:38.559" style="s2">know how to code not to pay someone ten</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.970" end="00:43:39.819" style="s2">thousand dollars to create a scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.559" end="00:43:42.190" style="s2">and then it doesn&#39;t go anywhere because</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.819" end="00:43:44.230" style="s2">people don&#39;t want to use it</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.190" end="00:43:45.940" style="s2">Selvi that to me is a matter problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.230" end="00:43:47.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like getting people together to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.940" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">we have a problem how do we create a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.650" end="00:43:52.859" style="s2">solution and then how do we fund it</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:55.059" style="s2">together okay I find this interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.859" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize that you are not a tech</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.059" end="00:44:02.170" style="s2">person you know because I assumed</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:05.319" style="s2">because you&#39;re building attack you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.170" end="00:44:08.380" style="s2">actually are and so it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.319" end="00:44:11.829" style="s2">because so the curse of knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.380" end="00:44:14.499" style="s2">someone who belongs to that III has</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.829" end="00:44:16.479" style="s2">surely have some blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.499" end="00:44:18.999" style="s2">and so that that&#39;s that makes this an</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.479" end="00:44:22.089" style="s2">opportunity to see kind of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.999" end="00:44:25.269" style="s2">what&#39;s the what what do I take for</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.089" end="00:44:28.689" style="s2">granted that yeah people from outside</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.269" end="00:44:31.029" style="s2">these don&#39;t don&#39;t see or don&#39;t know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.689" end="00:44:33.899" style="s2">or difficulties that I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.029" end="00:44:40.749" style="s2">because it&#39;s my expertise right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.899" end="00:44:46.839" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.749" end="00:44:51.130" style="s2">I feel like I have seen at least a part</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.839" end="00:44:54.639" style="s2">of what game B could be in this space in</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.130" end="00:44:59.019" style="s2">open source and like there is a baby</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.639" end="00:45:01.709" style="s2">that I wouldn&#39;t want to be thrown out</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.019" end="00:45:05.229" style="s2">with the bathwater you know they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.709" end="00:45:10.089" style="s2">and so I&#39;m wondering whether I&#39;m failing</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.229" end="00:45:11.739" style="s2">to translate the pattern because when I</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.089" end="00:45:14.819" style="s2">talk about open source to you it just</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.739" end="00:45:19.809" style="s2">appears as this kind of ugly and awkward</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.819" end="00:45:22.569" style="s2">non professional ecosystem yeah all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.809" end="00:45:25.569" style="s2">them yes like that is what it clearly</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.569" end="00:45:27.099" style="s2">right and it&#39;s doesn&#39;t that piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.569" end="00:45:29.019" style="s2">to make it better for people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.099" end="00:45:30.669" style="s2">techy and need the beauty and need the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.019" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">like efficiency of something like</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.669" end="00:45:37.719" style="s2">Facebook and I do think we can have both</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:40.299" style="s2">okay okay some in a sense money could</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.719" end="00:45:46.719" style="s2">play a role in in building that last</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.299" end="00:45:51.519" style="s2">mile to to the actual end user yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.719" end="00:45:52.899" style="s2">so actually yeah that money is its money</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.519" end="00:45:55.059" style="s2">part of the picture of the tech</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.899" end="00:45:58.809" style="s2">cooperative is the idea like okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.059" end="00:46:01.409" style="s2">build projects that should make money to</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.809" end="00:46:04.239" style="s2">the to the people that are part of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.409" end="00:46:06.039" style="s2">not necessarily the idea is some</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.239" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">technology makes money right very</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.039" end="00:46:09.130" style="s2">naturally something like uber that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.409" style="s2">owned by the people is gonna naturally</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.130" end="00:46:13.449" style="s2">make money other things like Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.409" end="00:46:15.069" style="s2">don&#39;t naturally make money because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.449" end="00:46:17.769" style="s2">not we used to paying for information</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.069" end="00:46:20.709" style="s2">having one umbrella that gives you as</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.769" end="00:46:22.119" style="s2">the user access to all of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.709" end="00:46:27.099" style="s2">different technologies where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.119" end="00:46:29.170" style="s2">getting a lot of you&#39;re paying $10</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.099" end="00:46:30.549" style="s2">getting way more than $10 a month of use</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.170" end="00:46:34.960" style="s2">right you&#39;re getting information you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.549" end="00:46:37.059" style="s2">getting systems your debt in for $10</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.960" end="00:46:39.249" style="s2">right the user gets a lot out of it the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.059" end="00:46:40.329" style="s2">people doing the work also have to get a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.249" end="00:46:41.499" style="s2">lot out of it they need to know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.329" end="00:46:43.059" style="s2">when they&#39;re putting their time and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.499" end="00:46:45.549" style="s2">energy into something it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.059" end="00:46:46.869" style="s2">at least them not taking on risk and not</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.549" end="00:46:50.739" style="s2">be able to feed their family</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.869" end="00:46:52.239" style="s2">so having an umbrella that has a funding</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.739" end="00:46:54.069" style="s2">model as part of it now we&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.239" end="00:46:55.420" style="s2">yet in any way shape or form we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.069" end="00:46:57.700" style="s2">meeting for like what kind of matter</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.420" end="00:46:59.410" style="s2">project could we create no one&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.700" end="00:47:01.900" style="s2">pay $10 something when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.410" end="00:47:04.749" style="s2">getting anything out of it so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.900" end="00:47:07.479" style="s2">yes we need a funding source that deals</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.749" end="00:47:09.849" style="s2">with funding at the umbrella level</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.479" end="00:47:11.890" style="s2">instead of each individual project right</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.849" end="00:47:14.289" style="s2">like how do we create $50,000 to create</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.890" end="00:47:16.869" style="s2">this well is it worth 50,000 and how can</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.289" end="00:47:18.489" style="s2">we bring that down and how can we make</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.869" end="00:47:19.660" style="s2">sure it&#39;s worth it before we create it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.489" end="00:47:23.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s getting people involved</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.660" end="00:47:24.970" style="s2">before before I not just like created an</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.380" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">idea in my head and I put 50 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.970" end="00:47:30.039" style="s2">dollars and now I get fifty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:32.469" style="s2">dollars out it&#39;s finding how to spread</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.039" end="00:47:35.079" style="s2">that risk out and how to create a funnel</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.469" end="00:47:38.819" style="s2">it&#39;s reliable I&#39;m just realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.079" end="00:47:42.609" style="s2">the one of the big risk that you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.819" end="00:47:44.979" style="s2">that&#39;s going to basically be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.609" end="00:47:46.719" style="s2">compound of all the individual risks</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.979" end="00:47:51.299" style="s2">from all these idealistic people with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.719" end="00:47:54.549" style="s2">project is that in general we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.299" end="00:47:56.859" style="s2">just be enthusiastic about the idea and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.549" end="00:47:58.359" style="s2">just we get started and have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.859" end="00:48:03.579" style="s2">whether there is actually a market for</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.359" end="00:48:06.339" style="s2">it I mean we&#39;re in general if we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.579" end="00:48:07.749" style="s2">scratching our own itch right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.339" end="00:48:09.489" style="s2">don&#39;t even know if there if the if</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.749" end="00:48:11.349" style="s2">anyone would actually use the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.489" end="00:48:13.660" style="s2">application once it&#39;s done and even</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.349" end="00:48:16.269" style="s2">there there are a lot of development</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.660" end="00:48:21.880" style="s2">patterns a gelatinize you&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.269" end="00:48:26.589" style="s2">that and so yeah I mean that&#39;s a risk of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.880" end="00:48:30.690" style="s2">course that if your project oriented</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.589" end="00:48:33.579" style="s2">that you just make project after project</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.690" end="00:48:35.589" style="s2">without ever testing or verifying</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.579" end="00:48:39.790" style="s2">whether anyone would actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.589" end="00:48:42.550" style="s2">pay for that the umbrella companies</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.790" end="00:48:44.560" style="s2">taking that risk on right like if you as</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.550" end="00:48:45.730" style="s2">a person want to want to take you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.560" end="00:48:47.100" style="s2">like well I&#39;m just gonna put all my time</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.730" end="00:48:49.360" style="s2">and energy into creating this project</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.100" end="00:48:51.820" style="s2">nobody asked you - you&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.360" end="00:48:53.380" style="s2">any compensation for it right but if</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.820" end="00:48:55.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a way for us to get your needs</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.380" end="00:48:58.360" style="s2">met like if your food shelter clothing</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.360" end="00:49:00.580" style="s2">is sold because someone else sold that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.360" end="00:49:02.590" style="s2">with their own app then you have more</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.580" end="00:49:04.120" style="s2">freedom to do that so it&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.590" end="00:49:05.290" style="s2">risk because you&#39;re not put you don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.120" end="00:49:06.760" style="s2">mean you&#39;re not putting your retirement</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.290" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">money into it you&#39;re just putting your</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.760" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">time into it the ones we create together</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:12.850" style="s2">with our shared funds or ones we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:15.430" style="s2">already decided we have the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.850" end="00:49:17.710" style="s2">for right so we don&#39;t create a food app</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.430" end="00:49:19.210" style="s2">with five people we create a food app</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.710" end="00:49:20.830" style="s2">with a million people we create a food</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.210" end="00:49:23.830" style="s2">up with 10,000 people with everyone</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.830" end="00:49:29.140" style="s2">putting ten dollars in or using their</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.830" end="00:49:31.480" style="s2">$10 a month more accurately you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.140" end="00:49:35.370" style="s2">just get to say hey I put in $100,000 I</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.480" end="00:49:35.370" style="s2">get $100,000 though right that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.400" end="00:49:40.630" style="s2">figure you know later on what is your if</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.560" end="00:49:42.040" style="s2">you wanted to sell your idea to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.630" end="00:49:43.240" style="s2">collective or you wanted to give your</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.040" end="00:49:44.890" style="s2">idea to collective</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.240" end="00:49:47.320" style="s2">what is it worth then and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.890" end="00:49:48.220" style="s2">we&#39;d have to decide that together right</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.320" end="00:49:50.500" style="s2">just cuz you put in a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.220" end="00:49:51.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean a clue or wallers you might</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.500" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">have put in no money and it&#39;s for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.610" end="00:49:55.510" style="s2">million dollars right like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:56.920" style="s2">actually discuss the value of something</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.510" end="00:50:01.030" style="s2">that gets put in because the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.920" end="00:50:02.620" style="s2">creating technology together a Netflix</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.030" end="00:50:03.970" style="s2">of apps that we all own the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.620" end="00:50:05.350" style="s2">there&#39;s both gonna be apps that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.970" end="00:50:07.030" style="s2">created together that we do truly own</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.350" end="00:50:09.910" style="s2">together and ones that we&#39;ve licensed</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.030" end="00:50:11.590" style="s2">we&#39;re never gonna license one if it</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.910" end="00:50:15.310" style="s2">costs more to licensing than it does to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.590" end="00:50:16.750" style="s2">recreate it so if you&#39;re gonna sell us</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.310" end="00:50:19.210" style="s2">your app for a million dollars that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.750" end="00:50:20.410" style="s2">can make it for a hundred thousand we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.210" end="00:50:24.910" style="s2">not gonna buy your app for a million</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.410" end="00:50:28.030" style="s2">dollars right so it&#39;s still has to work</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.910" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">within that like market and within we</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.030" end="00:50:33.190" style="s2">can make it ourselves we can recreate</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:35.110" style="s2">Facebook we can recreate uber and if</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.190" end="00:50:37.390" style="s2">it&#39;s cooperative basically those ones</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.110" end="00:50:40.270" style="s2">don&#39;t exist anymore if we&#39;re big enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.390" end="00:50:43.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s videos then it&#39;s not me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.270" end="00:50:43.650" style="s2">like that the wing is big enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.170" end="00:50:54.510" style="s2">something else I&#39;m wondering have you</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.150" end="00:50:59.560" style="s2">take at the Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.510" end="00:51:00.790" style="s2">personality test does have to be hmm no</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.560" end="00:51:02.680" style="s2">and I can never even remember what my</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.790" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">other personality you know the like INF</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.680" end="00:51:06.550" style="s2">TP one I can never remember what I am</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:07.690" style="s2">and it changes there&#39;s two of them that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.550" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">change back and forth because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.690" end="00:51:12.630" style="s2">basically 50/50 but I can hmm number one</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:20.380" style="s2">I am are you aware of the mother</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.630" end="00:51:24.520" style="s2">basically yeah the big five so how</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.380" end="00:51:26.800" style="s2">what&#39;s your level of openness before if</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.520" end="00:51:28.360" style="s2">I may ask me what&#39;s the other one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.800" end="00:51:33.130" style="s2">open it&#39;s not opening closing yes or</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.360" end="00:51:38.200" style="s2">it&#39;s openness and I actually don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.130" end="00:51:43.060" style="s2">how you would call the opposite um I</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.200" end="00:51:44.830" style="s2">mean openness is basically yeah you like</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.060" end="00:51:46.660" style="s2">we are open to ideas and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.830" end="00:51:50.140" style="s2">experimentation and you like new things</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.660" end="00:51:52.120" style="s2">and you find many things interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.140" end="00:51:53.830" style="s2">do I find many things industry and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.120" end="00:51:55.810" style="s2">also do not like it when my phone</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.830" end="00:51:58.060" style="s2">changes like when it updates and have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.810" end="00:52:01.090" style="s2">learn something new on it I&#39;m like like</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.060" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t like it but I love having new</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.090" end="00:52:07.450" style="s2">ideas and under it like and I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:09.940" style="s2">more into try it now break it before you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.450" end="00:52:12.460" style="s2">even try it like try figure it out as</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.940" end="00:52:14.410" style="s2">you go because that agile process of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.460" end="00:52:16.990" style="s2">creating something and testing it out</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.410" end="00:52:18.790" style="s2">like that is what is a big issue in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.990" end="00:52:21.010" style="s2">tech space is like well you create this</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.790" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">hundred thousand five hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.010" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">dollar entity and you have no idea if</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.720" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">it&#39;s usable we broke it if people want</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">it and so no and I don&#39;t have ten right</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:34.510" style="s2">so I&#39;ve had to figure out how to use</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:36.130" style="s2">existing technology to do what I know we</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.510" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">could create with technology right like</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.130" end="00:52:40.750" style="s2">using stream yard for idea Cafe the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:44.920" style="s2">point I can get a hundred people and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.750" end="00:52:46.630" style="s2">do it on zoom like using how do we run a</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.920" end="00:52:49.510" style="s2">conference without the scheduling tool</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.630" end="00:52:51.310" style="s2">er right like URI no yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.510" end="00:52:53.740" style="s2">work part of these things out before we</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.310" end="00:52:58.360" style="s2">ever put money into the platforms and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.740" end="00:53:01.319" style="s2">this is okay I have a claim that and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.360" end="00:53:03.930" style="s2">maybe that more</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.319" end="00:53:06.089" style="s2">more things I mean you will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.930" end="00:53:08.089" style="s2">solve more and more problems that way</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.089" end="00:53:12.479" style="s2">without having to build things yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.089" end="00:53:16.949" style="s2">yeah yeah just because of the trends I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.479" end="00:53:18.690" style="s2">see as a developer you know like how</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.949" end="00:53:20.489" style="s2">your software updates maybe sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.690" end="00:53:22.170" style="s2">it&#39;s annoying but in principle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.489" end="00:53:23.609" style="s2">actually quite cool right your phone is</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.170" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">there you&#39;re not doing anything and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.609" end="00:53:28.799" style="s2">every little app is just like improving</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:29.729" style="s2">over time right on its own without you</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.799" end="00:53:32.969" style="s2">asking for it</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.729" end="00:53:35.969" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s as an engineer that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.969" end="00:53:39.779" style="s2">close to the more like to the developer</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.969" end="00:53:42.089" style="s2">scene that happens everywhere in my</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.779" end="00:53:45.029" style="s2">tooling in the techno in every little</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.089" end="00:53:48.150" style="s2">aspect technologies that I use libraries</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.029" end="00:53:52.319" style="s2">methodologies I&#39;m just I I go day by day</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.150" end="00:53:54.599" style="s2">doing my thing and it just improves you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.319" end="00:53:56.279" style="s2">know it like gradually gradually if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.599" end="00:53:58.109" style="s2">don&#39;t know it maybe you don&#39;t notice it</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.279" end="00:54:00.239" style="s2">if you don&#39;t pay attention but like</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.109" end="00:54:02.489" style="s2">every week or two or so there is like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.239" end="00:54:04.499" style="s2">a new way to do something that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.489" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">more pleasant more efficient better and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.499" end="00:54:10.819" style="s2">and think about what that means like</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:14.249" style="s2">every little innovation trickles over</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.819" end="00:54:16.019" style="s2">you know through the you know in</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.249" end="00:54:18.569" style="s2">principle instantly throughout the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.019" end="00:54:20.160" style="s2">to the people that can benefit from it</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.569" end="00:54:26.670" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s not everyone immediately</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.160" end="00:54:30.390" style="s2">but the compound effect of that data to</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.670" end="00:54:33.299" style="s2">me is gonna be already on its way in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.390" end="00:54:37.380" style="s2">way you know like this is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.299" end="00:54:42.359" style="s2">we&#39;re already through the antivirus</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.380" end="00:54:45.289" style="s2">nests that IT provides every little</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.359" end="00:54:48.059" style="s2">thing that can be reused by others</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.289" end="00:54:52.380" style="s2">that&#39;s already an improvement for</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.059" end="00:54:55.199" style="s2">everyone else and so this is also</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.380" end="00:54:59.640" style="s2">something I&#39;m afraid can become a blind</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.199" end="00:55:01.229" style="s2">spot if if you think about like again if</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.640" end="00:55:04.529" style="s2">you put an artificial boundary and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.229" end="00:55:08.670" style="s2">think that there is a so there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.529" end="00:55:12.859" style="s2">of saying that that is the N I H not</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.670" end="00:55:14.770" style="s2">invented here syndrome it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.859" end="00:55:17.470" style="s2">tendency of companies</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.770" end="00:55:18.940" style="s2">to want to reinvent the wheel you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.470" end="00:55:20.950" style="s2">there is something already out there</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.940" end="00:55:22.990" style="s2">that works because it&#39;s it has not been</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.950" end="00:55:26.110" style="s2">invented here you know and then yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.990" end="00:55:28.780" style="s2">we don&#39;t like it so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.110" end="00:55:31.090" style="s2">I think these are the usual risks</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.780" end="00:55:33.130" style="s2">associated with identity right like you</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.090" end="00:55:34.660" style="s2">Kray recreate the thing you belong to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.130" end="00:55:43.180" style="s2">and then things that are outside our</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.660" end="00:55:45.160" style="s2">suspect yes and I definitely come up to</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.180" end="00:55:47.020" style="s2">that both in the technology space and</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.160" end="00:55:48.760" style="s2">also in my own body right Rob like well</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.020" end="00:55:52.050" style="s2">it&#39;s on ours it isn&#39;t like it&#39;s not no</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.760" end="00:55:54.550" style="s2">thank you at the same time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.050" end="00:55:57.430" style="s2">realness to that that it goes beyond ego</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.550" end="00:55:59.619" style="s2">and emotion that if we don&#39;t own it</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.430" end="00:56:02.110" style="s2">together we actually can&#39;t improve it</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.619" end="00:56:04.840" style="s2">and we can&#39;t create iterations that are</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.110" end="00:56:06.700" style="s2">for the greatest benefit right like we</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.840" end="00:56:08.619" style="s2">can tell Facebook what we would like</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.700" end="00:56:11.740" style="s2">them to do but if we don&#39;t own Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.619" end="00:56:13.960" style="s2">we can&#39;t use it to cut our carbon and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.740" end="00:56:16.869" style="s2">get to zero slaves we whereas if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.960" end="00:56:18.670" style="s2">owned it together we could and so that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.869" end="00:56:22.030" style="s2">does it but you also can&#39;t recreate the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.670" end="00:56:24.490" style="s2">wheel all at once and so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.030" end="00:56:27.310" style="s2">financial piece of like how much does it</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.490" end="00:56:29.109" style="s2">cost to recreate zoom way too much money</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.310" end="00:56:31.690" style="s2">we&#39;re not recreating zoom we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.109" end="00:56:34.900" style="s2">using other people&#39;s video technology</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.690" end="00:56:36.790" style="s2">and creating a scheduling tool but</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.900" end="00:56:40.000" style="s2">eventually if we have billions of people</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.790" end="00:56:41.500" style="s2">and we&#39;re giving millions to zoom it</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.000" end="00:56:42.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense to give it to zoom it</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.500" end="00:56:44.859" style="s2">makes sense to actually recreate it</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.730" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">yourself but not because of ego because</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.859" end="00:56:48.609" style="s2">of Finance right cuz you&#39;re like oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.720" end="00:56:49.060" style="s2">no this doesn&#39;t make sense to keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.609" end="00:56:53.650" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.060" end="00:56:57.450" style="s2">because the money internal yes like</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.650" end="00:57:02.650" style="s2">obviously yeah no I completely agree I</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.450" end="00:57:04.330" style="s2">think that yeah yeah I was not making a</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.650" end="00:57:08.650" style="s2">clear distinction between open-source</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.330" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">and and things that are and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.650" end="00:57:11.859" style="s2">again it&#39;s a blind spot was mine because</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:15.369" style="s2">I have been moving within the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.859" end="00:57:20.080" style="s2">open-source world for the last decade</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.369" end="00:57:21.490" style="s2">practically because you know software</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.080" end="00:57:25.690" style="s2">running on my laptop is open-source</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.490" end="00:57:27.710" style="s2">everything I immediately like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.690" end="00:57:29.690" style="s2">open source i I look for open so</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.710" end="00:57:34.760" style="s2">alternatives and and so I&#39;ve been kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.690" end="00:57:38.660" style="s2">of living in this world and you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.760" end="00:57:41.869" style="s2">last last spring my channel I had been</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.660" end="00:57:43.700" style="s2">using it or trying to promote coaching</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.869" end="00:57:45.230" style="s2">business actually I was I was doing a</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.700" end="00:57:48.320" style="s2">coaching course and I wanted to promote</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.230" end="00:57:50.510" style="s2">myself for the coach and kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.320" end="00:57:54.740" style="s2">this encounter with game B and his idea</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.510" end="00:57:57.970" style="s2">of anti reverse nest made me realize</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.740" end="00:58:03.400" style="s2">that I&#39;m not interested in earning money</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.970" end="00:58:06.020" style="s2">that that kind of diss diss link between</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.400" end="00:58:08.510" style="s2">doing something valuable and earning</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.020" end="00:58:10.310" style="s2">money I mean obviously I still have my</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.510" end="00:58:14.150" style="s2">day job and and I&#39;m going to keep that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.310" end="00:58:15.980" style="s2">as long as game a exists but I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.150" end="00:58:17.830" style="s2">that game be the dynamic would be</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.980" end="00:58:20.570" style="s2">completely different in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.830" end="00:58:23.060" style="s2">you probably want to be paid for what</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.570" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">you do and you will get almost</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.060" end="00:58:28.839" style="s2">everything for free so that&#39;s that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:30.740" style="s2">I look look at it and so in a sense I</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.839" end="00:58:33.020" style="s2">did this completely change my</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.740" end="00:58:34.940" style="s2">perspective and I started looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.020" end="00:58:38.270" style="s2">things that I&#39;m already getting for free</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.940" end="00:58:40.880" style="s2">obviously I can see it more because I am</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.270" end="00:58:43.460" style="s2">close to the source which is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.880" end="00:58:47.260" style="s2">like the digital realm right we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.460" end="00:58:51.890" style="s2">there yet with the physical realm and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.260" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">and then seeing that abundance but even</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.890" end="00:58:55.369" style="s2">even the stuff that is not closed stores</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:57.740" style="s2">like YouTube you know the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.369" end="00:58:59.810" style="s2">that we have with you can just broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.740" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">stuff to millions of people in principle</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.810" end="00:59:03.920" style="s2">just like that for free you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:06.770" style="s2">obviously YouTube has its downsides and</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.920" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">once they become too much we will</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.770" end="00:59:13.640" style="s2">hopefully have another platform to jump</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:15.589" style="s2">on um but there is a big there is</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.640" end="00:59:18.800" style="s2">already so much that we get for free and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.589" end="00:59:20.930" style="s2">and and then I said okay then I will</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.800" end="00:59:26.300" style="s2">also start using that attitude and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.930" end="00:59:30.170" style="s2">provide everything I do for free which</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.300" end="00:59:32.810" style="s2">makes it maybe for me I feel it less</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.170" end="00:59:36.050" style="s2">necessary to join a cooperative because</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.810" end="00:59:38.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t have all the problems associated</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.050" end="00:59:40.820" style="s2">with holding on to my thing because I</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.420" end="00:59:43.970" style="s2">already decided it&#39;s all out for</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.820" end="00:59:48.770" style="s2">like it&#39;s just their creative commons</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.970" end="00:59:50.900" style="s2">public domain I don&#39;t care it the more</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.770" end="00:59:53.710" style="s2">people can use it better and and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.900" end="01:00:00.590" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit like language right</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.710" end="01:00:04.220" style="s2">if I can use a non non IT example right</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.590" end="01:00:05.600" style="s2">do you need to own English to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.220" end="01:00:08.900" style="s2">improve it now you don&#39;t need to own it</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.600" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">right it&#39;s just distributed protocol and</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.900" end="01:00:17.570" style="s2">you can buy by participating in it</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:20.530" style="s2">you are already improving it so this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.570" end="01:00:20.530" style="s2">the direction I see</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.430" end="01:01:45.790" style="s2">oh yeah it&#39;s still going so that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.069" end="01:01:50.680" style="s2">hello and that it kicked me out and said</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.790" end="01:01:53.079" style="s2">my internet was bad I have had them at</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.680" end="01:01:55.569" style="s2">the end of my stream it won&#39;t let me</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.079" end="01:01:58.900" style="s2">stop the stream it&#39;s happened a handful</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.569" end="01:02:01.210" style="s2">of times over a few months and so it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.900" end="01:02:05.050" style="s2">just keep broadcasting and so I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.210" end="01:02:08.280" style="s2">have to get in and stop it anyway so</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.050" end="01:02:08.280" style="s2">good old technology</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.740" end="01:02:14.260" style="s2">so what we&#39;re in the middle of talking</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.329" end="01:02:15.369" style="s2">about no I&#39;m just realizing that I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.260" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">bit heavy</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.369" end="01:02:23.050" style="s2">like happy criticizing all this right</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:25.030" style="s2">now and I mean I like that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.050" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">participate and that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.030" end="01:02:32.650" style="s2">important thing right and most people</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.280" end="01:02:35.170" style="s2">are a bit passive and and so we should</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.650" end="01:02:38.500" style="s2">we should really kind of like have more</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.170" end="01:02:41.250" style="s2">awareness among the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.500" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">actually hands on doing things and</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.250" end="01:02:52.020" style="s2">that&#39;s a small subset I believe of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:55.030" style="s2">scene and and so yeah in a way even</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.020" end="01:02:57.190" style="s2">though I&#39;m bit allergic to code due to</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.030" end="01:02:59.380" style="s2">coordination like I said we have to find</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.190" end="01:03:07.660" style="s2">a way to kind of like find the synergies</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.380" end="01:03:09.190" style="s2">between the things that we do even</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.660" end="01:03:12.369" style="s2">though I&#39;m not sure like what the best</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.190" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">way for me right now would be to cope -</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.369" end="01:03:18.760" style="s2">you know cooperate because in a sense I</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:23.049" style="s2">see it as a restriction actually of my</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.760" end="01:03:28.900" style="s2">possibility to to be active if I were to</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.049" end="01:03:33.579" style="s2">join the cooperative yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.900" end="01:03:36.609" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit because I mean our garden</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.579" end="01:03:38.049" style="s2">area like it doesn&#39;t eat like right now</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.609" end="01:03:39.549" style="s2">if someone comes and participates in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.049" end="01:03:41.619" style="s2">project raising right they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.549" end="01:03:43.840" style="s2">joining the cooperative like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.619" end="01:03:46.150" style="s2">they&#39;re just getting their project ray</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.840" end="01:03:48.160" style="s2">they&#39;re just worse giving feedback on</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.150" end="01:03:50.050" style="s2">what they want feedback on and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.160" end="01:03:51.310" style="s2">there&#39;s no point where you know like I</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.050" end="01:03:54.100" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you guys have common law</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.310" end="01:03:55.810" style="s2">in your in your country but like common</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.100" end="01:03:57.100" style="s2">law just like oops you live together a</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.810" end="01:03:59.320" style="s2">year now it&#39;s like you&#39;re married and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.100" end="01:04:00.610" style="s2">all the same rules apply there is like</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.320" end="01:04:02.260" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t happen you&#39;re not like</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.610" end="01:04:03.700" style="s2">automatically in the coop and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.260" end="01:04:06.910" style="s2">gonna you know take your project at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.700" end="01:04:08.890" style="s2">side it&#39;s how can we service each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.910" end="01:04:11.500" style="s2">right like how can we actually help with</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.890" end="01:04:13.270" style="s2">that process and so Bentley and I got</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.500" end="01:04:15.130" style="s2">together tech or work you know what does</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.270" end="01:04:17.020" style="s2">that look like so we&#39;re offering the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.130" end="01:04:18.550" style="s2">project raising two people it&#39;d be great</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.020" end="01:04:20.350" style="s2">if we could offer it more than just on</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.550" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">Saturday mornings right so and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.350" end="01:04:24.280" style="s2">just us raising people&#39;s projects it was</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">anyone could come and you could get a</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.280" end="01:04:28.390" style="s2">panel of financial or marketing whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">that looks like and so we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.390" end="01:04:31.600" style="s2">working through what those things looks</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:36.490" style="s2">like what do we have to offer each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.600" end="01:04:38.260" style="s2">for free and then also working through</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.490" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">that ego piece of like well I still want</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.260" end="01:04:42.070" style="s2">to hold on to my project so how can we</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:43.450" style="s2">come together maybe for mastermind</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.070" end="01:04:45.790" style="s2">groups around people who have similar</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.450" end="01:04:47.560" style="s2">projects like everyone in the together</p>

<p begin="01:06:09.580" end="01:06:14.800" style="s2">somewhere so I want to figure out how do</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.060" end="01:06:17.970" style="s2">we get our food and clothing and shelter</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.800" end="01:06:20.860" style="s2">how do we create things that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.970" end="01:06:22.060" style="s2">voluntary systems right not one food</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.860" end="01:06:23.620" style="s2">source and everyone&#39;s under this</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.060" end="01:06:25.660" style="s2">umbrella and now it has it&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.620" end="01:06:27.820" style="s2">can tech support you in your food</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.660" end="01:06:29.680" style="s2">sovereignty how can it support you in</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.820" end="01:06:32.140" style="s2">your housing and community sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.680" end="01:06:34.810" style="s2">and then how do you also contribute your</p>

<p begin="01:06:34.810" end="01:06:39.190" style="s2">you contribute it and how do we like get</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.310" end="01:06:41.770" style="s2">that into like one thing that is Omni</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.190" end="01:06:43.990" style="s2">when energy progress the thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.770" end="01:06:46.990" style="s2">are describing is such a weird inversion</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.990" end="01:06:50.620" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know how to say that in one</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.990" end="01:06:53.070" style="s2">book you know like it&#39;s similar to when</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.620" end="01:06:56.260" style="s2">people are afraid of losing their jobs</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.070" end="01:06:58.390" style="s2">because the economy is is getting better</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.260" end="01:06:59.890" style="s2">it&#39;s weird because in a sense like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.390" end="01:07:03.910" style="s2">economy is going to provide you more and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.890" end="01:07:05.860" style="s2">more for less money so the dependency is</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.910" end="01:07:09.130" style="s2">towards not needing a job you know so</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.860" end="01:07:21.100" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like if you look things one</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.130" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">way or the other but anyway there was</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.100" end="01:07:29.860" style="s2">something I wanted to ask you I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:35.980" style="s2">it&#39;s the Sun yeah you wanted to organize</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.860" end="01:07:41.280" style="s2">with this conference about food and zero</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.980" end="01:07:41.280" style="s2">zero slaves and and three tons of co2</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.820" end="01:07:48.910" style="s2">about wonder whether one should also add</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.170" end="01:07:53.010" style="s2">zero killings you know like if if one</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.910" end="01:07:53.010" style="s2">should add animals as a standard there</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.320" end="01:08:02.920" style="s2">but there it&#39;s it&#39;s okay the way I look</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.010" end="01:08:06.580" style="s2">at this is I&#39;m trying to approach that</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.920" end="01:08:10.120" style="s2">problem like any every way the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.580" end="01:08:11.200" style="s2">bottom-up like my core focuses the sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.120" end="01:08:13.869" style="s2">making tool</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.200" end="01:08:18.009" style="s2">and in my opinion the sense making to</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.869" end="01:08:19.960" style="s2">shoot kind of like become so powerful to</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.009" end="01:08:23.949" style="s2">help you also deal with that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.960" end="01:08:26.319" style="s2">stuff like a bridge that I see which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.949" end="01:08:28.179" style="s2">obviously not what it&#39;s going to be or</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.319" end="01:08:30.160" style="s2">what in the end you know if you fill out</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.179" end="01:08:31.719" style="s2">the gap in reality it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.160" end="01:08:33.880" style="s2">different but the bridge that I see is</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.719" end="01:08:38.469" style="s2">imagining a tool where you can start</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.880" end="01:08:40.330" style="s2">logging things from everyday life in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.469" end="01:08:44.130" style="s2">very easy way you know like okay what</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.330" end="01:08:46.390" style="s2">you eat what you buy your workouts</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.130" end="01:08:48.400" style="s2">everything right if you can start</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.390" end="01:08:51.730" style="s2">tracking all those things then that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.400" end="01:08:54.850" style="s2">stepping stone towards then the tool</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.730" end="01:08:56.949" style="s2">informing you about ok disease maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.850" end="01:09:00.100" style="s2">could with your tool also like describe</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.949" end="01:09:01.960" style="s2">your values and then the tool kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.100" end="01:09:03.730" style="s2">squares the values with your behavior</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.960" end="01:09:07.299" style="s2">and shows you look this decision could</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.730" end="01:09:09.069" style="s2">lead towards a lifestyle that is more</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.299" end="01:09:11.170" style="s2">according to your value right instead of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.069" end="01:09:13.480" style="s2">buying that food to try to buy that food</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.170" end="01:09:16.359" style="s2">and you know that kind of stuff and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.480" end="01:09:19.060" style="s2">this is my way of inching towards that</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.359" end="01:09:22.420" style="s2">thing so I want the tool that I can use</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.060" end="01:09:26.560" style="s2">for basically my whole thinking I just</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.420" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">want I don&#39;t know the stupidest thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.560" end="01:09:32.080" style="s2">could be just I want one word file where</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.199" end="01:09:33.940" style="s2">I could just write everything and then I</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.080" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">want that word file to become something</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.940" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">super powerful that can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:42.730" style="s2">automatically generate tweets blog posts</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:45.130" style="s2">or chats to communicate with other</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.730" end="01:09:47.140" style="s2">people like and bad but then also give</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.130" end="01:09:49.779" style="s2">me feedback about my life about how I</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.140" end="01:09:51.730" style="s2">like faster and thinking patterns I keep</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.779" end="01:09:56.290" style="s2">thinking the same thing and maybe then I</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.730" end="01:09:59.320" style="s2">realize so this is kind of like the arc</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.290" end="01:10:01.810" style="s2">that I&#39;m following implicitly my life</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.320" end="01:10:04.770" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to build the tool that I can</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.810" end="01:10:08.199" style="s2">use to think out loud into the tool and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.770" end="01:10:11.530" style="s2">and kind of like track everything about</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.199" end="01:10:13.390" style="s2">myself so that then the tool becomes</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.530" end="01:10:15.580" style="s2">kind of like in between me and the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.390" end="01:10:20.739" style="s2">like to put it in a very own respective</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.580" end="01:10:23.290" style="s2">way yeah I mean I love that I that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.739" end="01:10:25.000" style="s2">a lot of my ideas come from it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.290" end="01:10:27.460" style="s2">need this tool to exist to make</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.000" end="01:10:30.160" style="s2">of the world everything is too like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.460" end="01:10:32.410" style="s2">cared about my footprint my whole life</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.160" end="01:10:34.420" style="s2">without knowing that word like I cared</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.410" end="01:10:35.890" style="s2">about the impact it had but no one else</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.420" end="01:10:38.710" style="s2">does because it&#39;s a lot to care about</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.890" end="01:10:42.070" style="s2">like it&#39;s a lot if it&#39;s not easy to know</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.710" end="01:10:45.120" style="s2">what your decisions do and it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.070" end="01:10:47.770" style="s2">to see a different decision you can make</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.120" end="01:10:49.690" style="s2">we&#39;re asking people to take on a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.770" end="01:10:51.340" style="s2">guilt and a lot of like useless</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.690" end="01:10:53.710" style="s2">knowledge that they can&#39;t they&#39;re in not</p>

<p begin="01:10:53.710" end="01:10:58.150" style="s2">was the idea behind the zero slaves and</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.660" end="01:11:01.780" style="s2">three tons of carbon was that when I</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.150" end="01:11:04.600" style="s2">took the calculators that Vinnie had</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.780" end="01:11:06.820" style="s2">suggested I have 33 slaves and like 10</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.600" end="01:11:09.580" style="s2">tons of carbon well I live in Canada</p>

<p begin="01:11:16.660" end="01:11:22.090" style="s2">the one thing we can maybe tackle</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.660" end="01:11:23.740" style="s2">together but there&#39;s this big space in</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.090" end="01:11:25.450" style="s2">between you have to solve it it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:26:25.989" end="01:26:34.230" style="s2">six five months it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.310" end="01:26:37.360" style="s2">whole like parenting and disability are</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.230" end="01:26:38.949" style="s2">of my university degree for teaching me</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.360" end="01:26:41.469" style="s2">things like they&#39;re like much higher</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.949" end="01:26:45.699" style="s2">like oh and I didn&#39;t I mean I paid a lot</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.469" end="01:26:48.190" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t like they did not charge a</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.699" end="01:26:51.460" style="s2">tuition for either of those things they</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.190" end="01:26:54.190" style="s2">both cost a lot have you heard children</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.460" end="01:26:56.409" style="s2">halls remarks on parenting</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.190" end="01:26:58.270" style="s2">they&#39;re quite I think it&#39;s in one of</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.409" end="01:27:03.909" style="s2">those videos that are more underground</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.270" end="01:27:05.260" style="s2">less public have you heard them I know</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.909" end="01:27:08.110" style="s2">necessarily he seems to be more of like</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.260" end="01:27:10.090" style="s2">I don&#39;t know his parenting philosophy is</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.110" end="01:27:16.480" style="s2">but I imagine more attachment parenting</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.090" end="01:27:21.909" style="s2">than actually I think he links it a bit</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.480" end="01:27:25.659" style="s2">to to these the forest Landry and these</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.909" end="01:27:28.810" style="s2">love is like a choice love is what</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.659" end="01:27:31.270" style="s2">enables choice that kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.810" end="01:27:32.830" style="s2">like treating your baby from the start</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.270" end="01:27:37.900" style="s2">or something that can make and make</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.830" end="01:27:40.150" style="s2">choices like I think he made an example</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.900" end="01:27:42.670" style="s2">of like okay from the start like trying</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.150" end="01:27:45.159" style="s2">to see whether when you want to grab</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.670" end="01:27:47.080" style="s2">your baby to see whether it makes kind</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.159" end="01:27:48.969" style="s2">of like a gesture towards you and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.080" end="01:27:50.800" style="s2">and then you know like and if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.969" end="01:27:54.520" style="s2">already really needs to kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.800" end="01:27:57.510" style="s2">make make a choice I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.520" end="01:27:59.800" style="s2">interesting to do I mean I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.510" end="01:28:03.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a few times in my parent team</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.800" end="01:28:05.290" style="s2">were like oh who has sovereignty here</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.280" end="01:28:07.869" style="s2">I&#39;m like really who is in control here</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.290" end="01:28:09.160" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know there was this when she</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.869" end="01:28:10.630" style="s2">was really little I took pictures</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.160" end="01:28:12.850" style="s2">all the time and then she got to the age</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.630" end="01:28:14.410" style="s2">where like I started asking her and</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.850" end="01:28:17.920" style="s2">there were times where she would say no</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.410" end="01:28:20.470" style="s2">and I&#39;m like but it&#39;s Christmas I need</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.920" end="01:28:21.700" style="s2">pictures it&#39;s Christmas right like hey</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.470" end="01:28:23.170" style="s2">and then there was a point where she</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.700" end="01:28:25.060" style="s2">asked me to stop watching videos and</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.170" end="01:28:27.580" style="s2">looking at her when she was a baby</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.060" end="01:28:29.380" style="s2">like and I&#39;m like wait who owns those</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.580" end="01:28:31.660" style="s2">they&#39;re all mine like Facebook flashback</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.380" end="01:28:33.310" style="s2">right I&#39;m like she asked me not to look</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.660" end="01:28:37.660" style="s2">at photos of her as a little kid I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.310" end="01:28:38.920" style="s2">know and I think it&#39;s very common to</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.660" end="01:28:40.330" style="s2">pick a kid up when just because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.920" end="01:28:41.590" style="s2">not doing what you want right and like</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.330" end="01:28:44.080" style="s2">moving them somewhere else doing</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.590" end="01:28:46.420" style="s2">something and like they get sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.080" end="01:28:50.170" style="s2">over their own body unless it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.420" end="01:28:51.880" style="s2">inflicted on their safety and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.170" end="01:28:54.340" style="s2">it is you gotta get to work you got to</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.880" end="01:28:57.280" style="s2">do something we gotta get the car sorry</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.340" end="01:28:59.080" style="s2">you know we need to do this and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.280" end="01:29:00.850" style="s2">constant struggle and I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.080" end="01:29:02.200" style="s2">is a struggle if you follow traditional</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.850" end="01:29:05.200" style="s2">parenting because it&#39;s like one the</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.200" end="01:29:07.570" style="s2">parents I&#39;m in control but try to raise</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.200" end="01:29:11.950" style="s2">a sovereign individual it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.570" end="01:29:14.920" style="s2">yeah you gotta say you know what the</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.950" end="01:29:19.210" style="s2">biggest struggle is for me parenting is</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.920" end="01:29:21.730" style="s2">like with every choice could be like</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.210" end="01:29:24.880" style="s2">okay there is some something that is not</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.730" end="01:29:27.840" style="s2">going well and you can do something</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.880" end="01:29:31.290" style="s2">about it and it&#39;s always a question of</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.840" end="01:29:36.760" style="s2">so what I&#39;m doing is either going to</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.290" end="01:29:39.220" style="s2">traumatize this child or if I don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.760" end="01:29:41.530" style="s2">it it actually is going to make the</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.220" end="01:29:44.170" style="s2">child get used to the the wrong way of</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.530" end="01:29:45.820" style="s2">doing things and okay I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.170" end="01:29:54.070" style="s2">say that well I think I have to make an</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.820" end="01:29:56.350" style="s2">example so baby is crying and I picked</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.070" end="01:30:00.040" style="s2">him up my baby is crying do you know in</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.350" end="01:30:03.910" style="s2">the night I pick him up another question</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.040" end="01:30:06.850" style="s2">is okay if I pick him up does am I going</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.910" end="01:30:09.130" style="s2">to make him get used to cry the night so</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.850" end="01:30:11.200" style="s2">I pick him up more or is it action and</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.130" end="01:30:12.730" style="s2">actual need you know and if I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.200" end="01:30:14.590" style="s2">take him up it would actually be bad for</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.730" end="01:30:17.020" style="s2">his psychology you know so and there is</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.590" end="01:30:19.450" style="s2">no answer you just have to make a choice</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.020" end="01:30:21.310" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know what what and for me</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.450" end="01:30:22.420" style="s2">as you know like as a programmer where</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.310" end="01:30:26.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.420" end="01:30:27.760" style="s2">world is clear it&#39;s crazy and also you</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.290" end="01:30:29.410" style="s2">know like even the scientific approach</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.760" end="01:30:32.920" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t work you cannot repeat</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.410" end="01:30:34.989" style="s2">things right you do it once and and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.920" end="01:30:36.610" style="s2">second time the first time is already</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.989" end="01:30:38.850" style="s2">having an impact on the second time so</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.610" end="01:30:42.190" style="s2">you don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.850" end="01:30:43.480" style="s2">reproduction or no and you truly don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:31:08.440" end="01:31:14.199" style="s2">like okay I can see I have this weird</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.790" end="01:31:17.020" style="s2">like I&#39;m going through unlearning what</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.199" end="01:31:19.960" style="s2">society has taught me on gender on</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.020" end="01:31:21.160" style="s2">culture on just all of the BS rules well</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.960" end="01:31:23.080" style="s2">trying to teach them to the next</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.160" end="01:31:24.160" style="s2">generation it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.080" end="01:31:26.860" style="s2">have to learn them before you can</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.160" end="01:31:28.660" style="s2">unlearn them or do I just let me be you</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.860" end="01:31:30.580" style="s2">and I&#39;m kind of going with the let you</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.660" end="01:31:35.320" style="s2">be you and that might be broken</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.580" end="01:31:38.260" style="s2">it might be like make friends and also</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.320" end="01:31:39.969" style="s2">owe yourself you&#39;ll find them like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.260" end="01:31:42.850" style="s2">and she&#39;s good at making friends she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.969" end="01:31:44.770" style="s2">an extrovert and pretty just feels I</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.850" end="01:31:47.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have and she&#39;s taught me them like</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.770" end="01:31:49.960" style="s2">I she taught me when she was about to</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.790" end="01:31:51.340" style="s2">she had these intense emotional</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.960" end="01:31:53.830" style="s2">outbursts I remember not being allowed</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.340" end="01:31:55.510" style="s2">to have emotions as kid as a kid so all</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.830" end="01:31:57.190" style="s2">I knew was to allow her to have it that</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.510" end="01:31:58.900" style="s2">she would have more capacity within her</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.190" end="01:32:00.880" style="s2">to deal with that than I do to teach her</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.900" end="01:32:03.100" style="s2">how to do that I just didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.880" end="01:32:05.440" style="s2">break her in the same way and she went</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.100" end="01:32:07.690" style="s2">like kick and scream and be super sad or</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.440" end="01:32:10.570" style="s2">super angry and then it would go away</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.690" end="01:32:12.880" style="s2">she&#39;d just be like happy bubbly fine it</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.570" end="01:32:15.520" style="s2">was like okay I tried and it works it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.880" end="01:32:17.530" style="s2">like this stopping of emotion is what</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.520" end="01:32:20.620" style="s2">keeps it in your body and makes it</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.530" end="01:32:22.090" style="s2">Johnson and yet then it was more with</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.620" end="01:32:24.730" style="s2">sadness and almost like oh that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.090" end="01:32:28.410" style="s2">you do just process it it goes away but</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.730" end="01:32:28.410" style="s2">anger kind of sticks around</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.100" end="01:32:35.410" style="s2">telogen and like actually emotional</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.810" end="01:32:36.210" style="s2">intelligence we had this point where</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.410" end="01:32:37.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve got really</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.210" end="01:32:40.140" style="s2">three on her one night and the next day</p>

<p begin="01:32:40.140" end="01:32:44.520" style="s2">what do you do it you&#39;re angry and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.300" end="01:32:48.719" style="s2">like I&#39;m never really angry it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.520" end="01:32:59.760" style="s2">just sadness underneath hmm thanks</p>

<p begin="01:33:13.920" end="01:33:18.800" style="s2">men in my life</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.540" end="01:33:21.300" style="s2">adult man all I heard was a children</p>

<p begin="01:33:22.920" end="01:33:28.290" style="s2">passive there and but for me it has been</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.110" end="01:33:32.120" style="s2">super interesting like I almost daily I</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.290" end="01:33:35.280" style="s2">can notice something new that they learn</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.120" end="01:33:36.750" style="s2">he learns and like the all the nuances</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.280" end="01:33:38.070" style="s2">and differences and what I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.750" end="01:33:41.700" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.070" end="01:33:44.010" style="s2">psychology but I don&#39;t know I wonder you</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.700" end="01:33:46.610" style="s2">know like I&#39;ve never seen myself as a</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.010" end="01:33:50.280" style="s2">very masculine man so maybe that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.610" end="01:33:55.800" style="s2">mean you know it&#39;s a complicated topic</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.280" end="01:33:58.320" style="s2">but I mean I&#39;m certainly happy that I</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.800" end="01:34:01.350" style="s2">can spend time with this with this</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.320" end="01:34:03.090" style="s2">little boy and and relate to him in a</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.350" end="01:34:06.660" style="s2">way that I don&#39;t know my parent my</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.090" end="01:34:10.290" style="s2">father didn&#39;t first and then was not</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.660" end="01:34:14.969" style="s2">able to because my mom divorced him and</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.290" end="01:34:17.100" style="s2">so you know like it has been therapeutic</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.969" end="01:34:19.440" style="s2">actually to be able to spend time with</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.100" end="01:34:22.500" style="s2">him and then see the relationship that I</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.440" end="01:34:25.370" style="s2">could have had but didn&#39;t and then try</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.500" end="01:34:28.110" style="s2">and kind of realize in the absence of</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.370" end="01:34:29.910" style="s2">something that he now has the</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.110" end="01:34:32.550" style="s2">opportunity to have psychologically in</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.910" end="01:34:34.320" style="s2">his life that I had to kind of build and</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.550" end="01:34:37.080" style="s2">it&#39;s still only partially there like</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.320" end="01:34:40.050" style="s2">through therapy I call it kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.080" end="01:34:41.880" style="s2">the benevolent I somehow like an image</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.050" end="01:34:43.500" style="s2">of an inner eye that just looks at you</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.880" end="01:34:46.469" style="s2">in a better man ambulant way you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.500" end="01:34:48.150" style="s2">like this kind of unconditional love and</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.469" end="01:34:49.840" style="s2">the thing that gives you secure</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.150" end="01:34:51.670" style="s2">attachment basically for</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.840" end="01:34:54.610" style="s2">made something that I&#39;m only slowly</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.670" end="01:34:59.140" style="s2">realizing that I had to build it or like</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.610" end="01:35:01.690" style="s2">it was gifted to me through people only</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.140" end="01:35:03.970" style="s2">later in life and so and that when I</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.690" end="01:35:08.980" style="s2">realized it it made me cry and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.970" end="01:35:11.380" style="s2">also something that I rarely do and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.980" end="01:35:12.970" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting and and this is also</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.380" end="01:35:17.580" style="s2">something that Jordan Hall was talking</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.970" end="01:35:17.580" style="s2">about with a guy shanks talk about</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.090" end="01:35:25.330" style="s2">having like having secure attachment to</p>

<p begin="01:35:25.330" end="01:35:28.480" style="s2">be the reason why it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.680" end="01:35:32.770" style="s2">multi-generational project because the</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.480" end="01:35:34.900" style="s2">people that we need to and that that are</p>

<p begin="01:36:19.120" end="01:36:22.060" style="s2">can&#39;t do anything cuz you already broke</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.650" end="01:36:23.380" style="s2">in and like you might like just do</p>

<p begin="01:36:23.380" end="01:36:28.660" style="s2">raise a generation in this it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.140" end="01:36:30.100" style="s2">I&#39;m not broken my brokenness is my</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.660" end="01:36:33.550" style="s2">wholeness that helps to raise the nice</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.100" end="01:36:35.350" style="s2">gentle like oh you can&#39;t raise a perfect</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.550" end="01:36:38.170" style="s2">generation like I&#39;m already screwing up</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.350" end="01:36:39.820" style="s2">into all kinds of wonderful ways but</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.170" end="01:36:41.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not about getting it perfect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.820" end="01:36:43.450" style="s2">about improving on your parents and they</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.890" end="01:36:45.640" style="s2">improved on their parents and they</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.450" end="01:36:47.290" style="s2">improved on their parents and so my goal</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.640" end="01:36:49.060" style="s2">isn&#39;t to raise a perfect kid it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.290" end="01:36:50.620" style="s2">raise one that&#39;s better than me it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.060" end="01:36:52.300" style="s2">raise LeMat like hug for sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.620" end="01:36:53.830" style="s2">they mean he has more sense of who she</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.300" end="01:36:56.080" style="s2">is and doesn&#39;t have to deal with all the</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.830" end="01:36:58.450" style="s2">wounds but she&#39;ll have some because</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.080" end="01:37:02.040" style="s2">that&#39;s just letting them and figuring</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.450" end="01:37:03.280" style="s2">out that piece of it and so yes there is</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.040" end="01:37:05.770" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.280" end="01:37:07.570" style="s2">generation of earrings right now that</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.770" end="01:37:09.880" style="s2">has more attachments and has more</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.570" end="01:37:12.310" style="s2">sovereignty and that&#39;s amazing at the</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.880" end="01:37:15.640" style="s2">same time leaving it all up to them</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.310" end="01:37:16.960" style="s2">right as like we can&#39;t even make it for</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.640" end="01:37:19.360" style="s2">them or they&#39;re not gonna even have the</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.960" end="01:37:20.920" style="s2">capacity to make it because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.360" end="01:37:22.450" style="s2">entering all these feedback loops that</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.920" end="01:37:27.910" style="s2">like we have to do a lot with our</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.450" end="01:37:29.350" style="s2">current ego and and movies right now the</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.910" end="01:37:31.620" style="s2">next generation well we&#39;re also raising</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.350" end="01:37:37.440" style="s2">a generation to hopefully have less</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.620" end="01:37:37.440" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s kind of a hard thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.940" end="01:37:44.380" style="s2">and there&#39;s I mean what what gives hope</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.070" end="01:37:46.600" style="s2">is the idea of the virtuous cycles right</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.380" end="01:37:50.380" style="s2">but when we are when you&#39;re truly able</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.600" end="01:37:53.020" style="s2">to build something that&#39;s good then it</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.380" end="01:37:55.390" style="s2">helps others also participate in a more</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.020" end="01:37:58.360" style="s2">wholesome way and any kind of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.390" end="01:38:01.030" style="s2">this that upward spiral idea that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.360" end="01:38:03.390" style="s2">kind of what gives one hope right ya</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.030" end="01:38:06.130" style="s2">know I have a lot of hope like I mean a</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.390" end="01:38:07.960" style="s2">lot of what we&#39;re creating in together</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.130" end="01:38:09.190" style="s2">tech and just my role in the world</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.960" end="01:38:10.720" style="s2">everything&#39;s chicken-and-egg but</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.190" end="01:38:12.130" style="s2">everything is like well this existed we</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.720" end="01:38:14.440" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have to create it because it</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.130" end="01:38:15.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist we have to create it but</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.440" end="01:38:19.290" style="s2">that same thing that makes this</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.760" end="01:38:22.120" style="s2">beginning process so slow also means</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.290" end="01:38:24.040" style="s2">once we get the first egg it grows into</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.120" end="01:38:27.690" style="s2">a chicken and then it just bleep laces</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.040" end="01:38:29.500" style="s2">eggs and it just you know exponentially</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.690" end="01:38:35.230" style="s2">use that metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.500" end="01:38:38.760" style="s2">I remember Matthew / Kowski it&#39;s a super</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.230" end="01:38:42.910" style="s2">smart guy he had talks with Peterson and</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.760" end="01:38:45.190" style="s2">Jordan Hall before it was cool I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.910" end="01:38:49.990" style="s2">know right now he&#39;s a bit more</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.190" end="01:38:52.000" style="s2">underground again but so so he once</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.990" end="01:38:53.980" style="s2">talked about it not about game B but</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.000" end="01:38:56.470" style="s2">like about this what we want to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.980" end="01:38:59.080" style="s2">like more generic way about like a</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.470" end="01:39:00.730" style="s2">Minimum Viable wheel right like if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.080" end="01:39:03.100" style="s2">have only half of wheel it won&#39;t roll</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.730" end="01:39:05.290" style="s2">right you need that you need a full</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.100" end="01:39:06.940" style="s2">wheel a minimally viable but it needs to</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.290" end="01:39:10.600" style="s2">be a full wheel and then and then it can</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.940" end="01:39:11.950" style="s2">start turning and then you know I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.600" end="01:39:15.180" style="s2">think he was talking about it in terms</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.950" end="01:39:17.260" style="s2">of technology but like you know these</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.180" end="01:39:22.270" style="s2">cryptocurrencies but Musti</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.260" end="01:39:26.350" style="s2">the metaphor is there right and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.270" end="01:39:27.640" style="s2">it&#39;s similar to your egg idea yes and</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.350" end="01:39:30.220" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because my mind wants it to</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.640" end="01:39:32.410" style="s2">be complex technology and yet I cannot</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.220" end="01:39:34.720" style="s2">in any way create the complex technology</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.410" end="01:39:36.730" style="s2">and so my brain keeps making it easier</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.720" end="01:39:38.260" style="s2">and simpler and less technological to</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.730" end="01:39:40.300" style="s2">start it off like perfect and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.260" end="01:39:42.640" style="s2">know access to it until I do like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.300" end="01:39:44.350" style="s2">like I have to fight with this level</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.640" end="01:39:46.180" style="s2">before it gives me the next easier level</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.350" end="01:39:48.940" style="s2">like fight with this one and it gets the</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.180" end="01:39:52.060" style="s2">next easier one cuz right now it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.940" end="01:39:53.770" style="s2">little technology meaning of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.060" end="01:39:56.080" style="s2">technology it&#39;s conversations on video</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.770" end="01:39:58.600" style="s2">chat but it&#39;s also not needing to code</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.080" end="01:40:00.340" style="s2">anything and it&#39;s like how do we get</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.600" end="01:40:01.570" style="s2">people together in small groups and help</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.340" end="01:40:03.489" style="s2">them together in bigger groups and how</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.570" end="01:40:08.980" style="s2">do we work that out and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.489" end="01:40:10.960" style="s2">starting how you doing it yeah it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.980" end="01:40:13.020" style="s2">mean the impact that you&#39;re having in</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.960" end="01:40:15.940" style="s2">the scene or even just the presence</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.020" end="01:40:18.550" style="s2">based on just having conversations with</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.940" end="01:40:22.060" style="s2">people I mean it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s cool and</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.550" end="01:40:25.270" style="s2">I I personally because of my background</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.060" end="01:40:26.710" style="s2">I have this you know hammer syndrome</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.270" end="01:40:29.340" style="s2">where everything looks like a nail</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.710" end="01:40:32.170" style="s2">and I&#39;ve done does make that mistake</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.340" end="01:40:34.090" style="s2">repeatedly and now I hope hopefully I do</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.170" end="01:40:36.100" style="s2">that in a more and more nuanced way but</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.090" end="01:40:42.630" style="s2">it&#39;s still there this tendency to try to</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.100" end="01:40:45.400" style="s2">solve inter-human problems by a code and</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.630" end="01:40:47.170" style="s2">but it&#39;s like it looks like actually the</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.400" end="01:40:50.770" style="s2">most powerful technologies are those</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.170" end="01:40:55.570" style="s2">that amplify the humaneness like video</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.770" end="01:40:57.970" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t need a special chart</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.570" end="01:41:00.100" style="s2">to communicate well we just need a video</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.970" end="01:41:02.470" style="s2">that like kind of opens and amplifies</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.100" end="01:41:07.380" style="s2">the bandwidth of what&#39;s already human</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.470" end="01:41:10.780" style="s2">communication yeah that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.380" end="01:41:13.030" style="s2">reminds another project there has been</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.780" end="01:41:13.510" style="s2">there have been projects that are video</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.030" end="01:41:15.040" style="s2">chat</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.510" end="01:41:17.410" style="s2">right there was chatroulette there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.040" end="01:41:19.300" style="s2">that&#39;s very similar to chat roulette and</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.410" end="01:41:21.610" style="s2">they&#39;re always taken over by naked</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.300" end="01:41:23.320" style="s2">people like that&#39;s like or just trolls</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.610" end="01:41:25.510" style="s2">right like you&#39;re like let&#39;s just roll</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.320" end="01:41:26.179" style="s2">through until there&#39;s not any good human</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.510" end="01:41:28.909" style="s2">on the other</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.179" end="01:41:30.739" style="s2">or but it&#39;s like they&#39;re so close to</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.909" end="01:41:32.750" style="s2">being right it&#39;s like all you need is</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.739" end="01:41:34.940" style="s2">also be like the Facebook feature right</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.750" end="01:41:36.530" style="s2">where you have like one account and you</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.940" end="01:41:38.960" style="s2">don&#39;t get to show up and be an asshole</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.530" end="01:41:40.730" style="s2">like you don&#39;t it&#39;s like people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.960" end="01:41:41.120" style="s2">show up - I need a cafe and act like an</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.730" end="01:41:43.610" style="s2">asshole</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.120" end="01:41:45.739" style="s2">they just don&#39;t and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.610" end="01:41:47.360" style="s2">about when you don&#39;t have anonymity but</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.739" end="01:41:50.750" style="s2">it is on video that gets rid of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.360" end="01:41:52.010" style="s2">trolls we&#39;re still human</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.750" end="01:41:53.960" style="s2">there&#39;s still gonna be an emotion that</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.010" end="01:41:56.750" style="s2">arises and there&#39;s still but like OD not</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.960" end="01:41:58.760" style="s2">- there was a conversation I was on</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.750" end="01:42:01.909" style="s2">about John Byrne baking with the future</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.760" end="01:42:03.560" style="s2">thinkers where they&#39;re like I kept like</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.909" end="01:42:04.670" style="s2">for yelling at people for yelling at</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.560" end="01:42:07.100" style="s2">people I&#39;d be there like you&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.670" end="01:42:08.150" style="s2">one yelling and it&#39;s like oh I&#39;m yelling</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.100" end="01:42:11.840" style="s2">at people for yelling at people</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.150" end="01:42:14.120" style="s2">gotcha but it was coming up in a</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.840" end="01:42:16.670" style="s2">somewhat negative way but I also learned</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.120" end="01:42:20.330" style="s2">from that much more than if I had an</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.670" end="01:42:20.690" style="s2">experience right and so it was I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.330" end="01:42:23.120" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.690" end="01:42:27.320" style="s2">very powerful about actual face-to-face</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.120" end="01:42:29.840" style="s2">as close as you can get that I&#39;d be able</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.320" end="01:42:32.840" style="s2">to meet notes both one-off groups and</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.840" end="01:42:37.670" style="s2">repeated that helps human beings evolve</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.840" end="01:42:38.780" style="s2">and just have that is enough and yet not</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.670" end="01:42:42.370" style="s2">because I want it to be really not</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.780" end="01:42:44.390" style="s2">another one I want all the trends but</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.370" end="01:42:47.750" style="s2">still I mean I think that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.390" end="01:42:50.449" style="s2">part of the wisdom of the scene that to</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.750" end="01:42:54.110" style="s2">a degree we are aware of well we need to</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.449" end="01:42:56.239" style="s2">hop medium you know like we try to</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.110" end="01:42:58.550" style="s2">engage in text on Facebook on Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.239" end="01:43:02.179" style="s2">but we are very kind of aware of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.550" end="01:43:05.690" style="s2">medium and and therefore willing to kind</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.179" end="01:43:08.780" style="s2">of switch context and and create a new</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.690" end="01:43:10.520" style="s2">context like video where something</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.780" end="01:43:14.449" style="s2">different can happen I think that this</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.520" end="01:43:19.310" style="s2">is a core a key skill of the scene that</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.449" end="01:43:20.900" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s maybe that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.310" end="01:43:22.640" style="s2">the scene is here to bring and then</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.900" end="01:43:24.590" style="s2">there will be the next scene that brings</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.640" end="01:43:27.469" style="s2">the next thing because I actually leave</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.590" end="01:43:31.159" style="s2">it I lived the whole progression really</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.469" end="01:43:34.040" style="s2">a bit like the narrative that rebel</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.159" end="01:43:35.870" style="s2">wisdom has because they were they</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.040" end="01:43:37.699" style="s2">followed George Peterson at the</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.870" end="01:43:39.980" style="s2">beginning right and then they moved to</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.699" end="01:43:42.140" style="s2">the intellectual dark web in general</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.980" end="01:43:46.190" style="s2">and now they&#39;re following you know the</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.140" end="01:43:50.570" style="s2">sense makers sort at all and and the the</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.190" end="01:43:53.630" style="s2">narrative there is that there has been a</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.570" end="01:43:57.770" style="s2">step wise improving the quality of</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.630" end="01:43:59.420" style="s2">discourse so the form of conversation</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.770" end="01:44:01.370" style="s2">rather than the content it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.420" end="01:44:05.300" style="s2">about okay the form is always improving</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.370" end="01:44:07.489" style="s2">and and so like you know you have CNN</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.300" end="01:44:10.550" style="s2">and blah blah blah where everyone has to</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.489" end="01:44:12.500" style="s2">talk in sound bites and obviously that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.550" end="01:44:16.430" style="s2">not productive okay then you have a</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.500" end="01:44:19.580" style="s2">certain type of podcast world like the</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.430" end="01:44:24.140" style="s2">Joe Rogan kind of thing where it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.580" end="01:44:26.239" style="s2">of a long-form interview and Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.140" end="01:44:28.910" style="s2">kind of a John Jordan Peterson was able</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.239" end="01:44:31.420" style="s2">to surf that wave and and kind of what</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.910" end="01:44:35.030" style="s2">he also represents in this space is the</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.420" end="01:44:37.880" style="s2">congruity you know like I tell my truth</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.030" end="01:44:38.239" style="s2">and I show up as someone who tells the</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.880" end="01:44:42.710" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.239" end="01:44:47.780" style="s2">and then there was this whole discussion</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.710" end="01:44:49.790" style="s2">about a we if we want to kind of proceed</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.780" end="01:44:53.060" style="s2">as as a society we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.790" end="01:44:55.220" style="s2">have difficult conversations we need to</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.060" end="01:44:57.830" style="s2">be able to talk about controversial</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.220" end="01:44:59.300" style="s2">stuff without people immediately losing</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.830" end="01:45:01.790" style="s2">the reputation their jobs their</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.300" end="01:45:03.620" style="s2">livelihood right and this was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.790" end="01:45:06.710" style="s2">like the message of the intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.620" end="01:45:08.810" style="s2">dark web right people with different</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.710" end="01:45:10.610" style="s2">ideologies but in general against</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.810" end="01:45:13.910" style="s2">political correctness because again like</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.610" end="01:45:16.910" style="s2">stifling discourse but there was still</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.910" end="01:45:18.710" style="s2">the frame of the debate I have an idea</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.910" end="01:45:21.739" style="s2">you have an idea and now we fight it out</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.710" end="01:45:24.050" style="s2">and in the end you have one or I have</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.739" end="01:45:26.510" style="s2">one or you know and the problem there is</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.050" end="01:45:28.580" style="s2">that not many minds were changed and I</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.510" end="01:45:31.820" style="s2">think the peak there was the Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.580" end="01:45:34.180" style="s2">Peterson versus sam Harris debates where</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.820" end="01:45:38.810" style="s2">there you had like the New Atheists</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.180" end="01:45:41.620" style="s2">and you had this kind of like Union type</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.810" end="01:45:44.150" style="s2">of psychological religious mythological</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.620" end="01:45:47.330" style="s2">crowd right you had these two kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.150" end="01:45:49.550" style="s2">people and and these debates were about</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.330" end="01:45:51.680" style="s2">is science nested in religion or is</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.550" end="01:45:54.140" style="s2">religion nested in science you know like</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.680" end="01:45:56.830" style="s2">what&#39;s more fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.140" end="01:46:00.830" style="s2">and it was still trained as a debate and</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.830" end="01:46:04.969" style="s2">even the speakers found it frustrating</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.830" end="01:46:07.370" style="s2">that the the crowd was cheering you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.969" end="01:46:09.680" style="s2">yes yes you you gave him a good punch</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.370" end="01:46:13.700" style="s2">and so on right and that was for me like</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.680" end="01:46:17.510" style="s2">the end of an era of the debate era if</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.700" end="01:46:19.430" style="s2">you will but I think Jorah Peters from</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.510" end="01:46:21.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t manage to overcome the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.430" end="01:46:24.469" style="s2">confrontational tone or that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.620" end="01:46:27.100" style="s2">stuff he has in himself it&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.469" end="01:46:30.920" style="s2">weakness basically right this whole like</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.100" end="01:46:33.320" style="s2">oppositional frame and and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.920" end="01:46:34.940" style="s2">kind of like he started becoming less</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.320" end="01:46:37.160" style="s2">relevant and now these other people came</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.940" end="01:46:39.050" style="s2">out like Jordan Hall who has a</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.160" end="01:46:41.030" style="s2">completely new and different way of</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.050" end="01:46:44.450" style="s2">communicating right this rule Omega and</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.030" end="01:46:46.940" style="s2">it&#39;s more like every perspective has</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.450" end="01:46:49.880" style="s2">validity and we try to create parallax</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.940" end="01:46:55.370" style="s2">and circling an hour with John Rivera</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.880" end="01:46:57.170" style="s2">key there&#39;s this new form so this is</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.370" end="01:47:01.250" style="s2">kind of like my way of following the</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.170" end="01:47:03.080" style="s2">whole thing I don&#39;t know how you you</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.250" end="01:47:04.670" style="s2">jumped into game being like completely</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.080" end="01:47:08.410" style="s2">from the side right like how did you</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.670" end="01:47:11.480" style="s2">even know that anything was happening I</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.410" end="01:47:14.570" style="s2">came on to the zoom meeting literally</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.480" end="01:47:16.100" style="s2">Remzi on Twitter was like Oh have you</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.570" end="01:47:17.810" style="s2">heard of game B and there&#39;s I was like</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.100" end="01:47:20.660" style="s2">no and I was much go live for my first</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.810" end="01:47:21.950" style="s2">fixer I rolled Friday so I was preparing</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.660" end="01:47:24.140" style="s2">for that I was like oh there&#39;s a zoom</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.950" end="01:47:26.719" style="s2">call right now and I jumped on and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.140" end="01:47:28.880" style="s2">I jumped in cuz I was like I dunno how</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.719" end="01:47:30.920" style="s2">to create a B link but I know how</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.880" end="01:47:32.870" style="s2">egotistical that sounds and I also know</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.920" end="01:47:36.200" style="s2">that it&#39;s not at the same time it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.870" end="01:47:38.120" style="s2">I have a path and it&#39;s actually a very</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.200" end="01:47:39.800" style="s2">simple path it&#39;s like cooperation</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.120" end="01:47:41.450" style="s2">outcompetes competition the more we get</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.800" end="01:47:42.380" style="s2">together and cooperate the more it just</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.450" end="01:47:45.320" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.380" end="01:47:49.210" style="s2">and I had a very rigid way of getting</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.320" end="01:47:51.290" style="s2">there and it the rigidity has left the</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.210" end="01:47:52.820" style="s2">thing like I&#39;m like nope</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.290" end="01:47:54.650" style="s2">having technology we&#39;re going together</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.820" end="01:47:56.750" style="s2">and that helps us figure things out and</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.650" end="01:48:00.530" style="s2">help us make sense and work through</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.750" end="01:48:01.910" style="s2">solutions together is powerful it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.530" end="01:48:04.130" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna create it who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.910" end="01:48:05.540" style="s2">actually get that out there when I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.130" end="01:48:07.189" style="s2">and I can&#39;t even communicate the big</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.540" end="01:48:09.800" style="s2">idea and</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.189" end="01:48:12.590" style="s2">enjoying that like getting in the game</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.800" end="01:48:15.439" style="s2">be space and getting the conversations</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.590" end="01:48:17.239" style="s2">and doing the project raising it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.439" end="01:48:20.329" style="s2">everything I&#39;m doing I&#39;m enjoying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.239" end="01:48:23.510" style="s2">fun and so this idea that it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.329" end="01:48:24.979" style="s2">hard to do I don&#39;t buy like even guys in</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.510" end="01:48:27.679" style="s2">stock it&#39;s like you know the world is</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.979" end="01:48:29.329" style="s2">suffering and like it&#39;s really not once</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.679" end="01:48:31.429" style="s2">you get to the point where suffering is</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.329" end="01:48:32.719" style="s2">like I&#39;ve experienced suffering a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.429" end="01:48:35.030" style="s2">suffering and I still experience</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.719" end="01:48:38.449" style="s2">suffering and it&#39;s always not accepting</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.030" end="01:48:40.400" style="s2">what is once you and your like with the</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.449" end="01:48:41.929" style="s2">game of life it&#39;s fun and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.400" end="01:48:44.900" style="s2">right like you show it can be part of a</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.929" end="01:48:47.179" style="s2">conversation and the more I need it to</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.900" end="01:48:50.719" style="s2">be a certain way the less fun it is and</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.179" end="01:48:53.689" style="s2">the more it&#39;s just is what it is it</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.719" end="01:48:56.360" style="s2">continues to flow in the right direction</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.689" end="01:48:58.669" style="s2">like there&#39;s something here that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.360" end="01:49:01.729" style="s2">science and isn&#39;t religion that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.669" end="01:49:03.349" style="s2">magic that happens but it proves it as</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.729" end="01:49:06.320" style="s2">it goes so it&#39;s not you need to take</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.349" end="01:49:09.699" style="s2">faith in it it&#39;s like curiosity and then</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.320" end="01:49:12.650" style="s2">it proves itself to you as you go yeah</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.699" end="01:49:15.110" style="s2">do usually do some kind of meditation or</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.650" end="01:49:18.559" style="s2">something I tried I tried to meditate</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.110" end="01:49:20.510" style="s2">daily and I do yoga and righteously</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.559" end="01:49:22.219" style="s2">conscious I mean they just look for</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.510" end="01:49:26.360" style="s2">things that trigger me and I learn from</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.219" end="01:49:29.179" style="s2">them that&#39;s a very good practice because</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.360" end="01:49:32.209" style="s2">maybe possible easy to do because I</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.179" end="01:49:34.400" style="s2">can&#39;t do hard like hard got taken away</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.209" end="01:49:36.709" style="s2">with my neurological dysfunctions so I</p>
