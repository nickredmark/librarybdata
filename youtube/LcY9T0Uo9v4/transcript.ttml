<p begin="00:00:08.460" end="00:00:14.360" style="s2">out a few films that we shot with ken</p>

<p begin="00:00:14.360" end="00:00:18.180" style="s2">they&#39;ve had a lot of views a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.680" end="00:00:20.550" style="s2">really interesting comments a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.180" end="00:00:22.410" style="s2">of really interesting feedback both in</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.550" end="00:00:25.010" style="s2">the comments on the videos and also kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.410" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">of on some of the integral forums and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.010" end="00:00:30.439" style="s2">we&#39;re recording this because we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">to kind of talk about why we think that</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.439" end="00:00:36.380" style="s2">Ken&#39;s work is so significant Y the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.000" end="00:00:39.809" style="s2">integral work is so significant and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.380" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">why where we see it fitting into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.809" end="00:00:43.500" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s kind of emergent at</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.489" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">the moment we talked to John Verve a key</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.500" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">about this quite recently and John bhave</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">key also kind of has this sense there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:52.070" style="s2">the potential for the integration of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:55.140" style="s2">lot of the wisdom traditions of the past</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.070" end="00:00:57.989" style="s2">with modern science cognitive science in</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.140" end="00:01:01.739" style="s2">his perspective but also this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.989" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">map that integral talked about a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.739" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">time ago there could be a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">this is the time that integral talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">about like integral and we&#39;re also going</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">to explain a few of the sort of key</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">concepts of integral why we think</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">they&#39;re relevant and why we think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">they they illustrate or illuminate</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">what&#39;s happening at the moment and one</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">of the key points is that integral</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">predicted that there would be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">new level of consciousness called</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:34.770" style="s2">integral that would be able to where a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">lot of the paradoxes of previous levels</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.770" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">of consciousness would be resolved and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the potential for a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:43.140" style="s2">synthesis would would come about I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:44.939" style="s2">it&#39;s worth just even if we rewind all</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">the way to what what is integral because</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.939" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">it&#39;s quite a complicated philosophy for</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:51.630" style="s2">for anyone looking from the outside he</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:52.829" style="s2">doesn&#39;t engage with it but and why does</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.630" end="00:01:53.909" style="s2">it matter to the conversation we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.829" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">been covering like how does it relate to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.909" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">the intellectual darkweb phenomena and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:01:59.159" style="s2">and everything else we&#39;ve had on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:01.829" style="s2">channel I think if I had to break down</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.159" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">in incredibly simple terms I think one</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.829" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">of the things that integral is about as</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:11.849" style="s2">a kind of philosophical model is that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:12.989" style="s2">as people and as societies never stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.849" end="00:02:15.269" style="s2">developing and growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.989" end="00:02:17.489" style="s2">we keep evolving so it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.269" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">present in our culture we have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.489" end="00:02:22.049" style="s2">problem recognizing that an 8 year old</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:25.109" style="s2">is different in many ways to an 18 year</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.049" end="00:02:27.780" style="s2">old just you know we develop but we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.109" end="00:02:30.030" style="s2">this sense that at some point in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.780" end="00:02:32.719" style="s2">early 20s maybe we just stopped</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:34.889" style="s2">developing and we&#39;re just an adult then</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.719" end="00:02:36.719" style="s2">integral points out and not just</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.889" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">integral as we&#39;re saying so there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.719" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">of different developmental models people</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:43.950" style="s2">like Robert Keegan and many many more a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:46.950" style="s2">lot of people have put a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.950" end="00:02:49.379" style="s2">into looking at how do we develop over</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:52.079" style="s2">time and I suppose the genius of Ken</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.379" end="00:02:54.900" style="s2">Wilber and integral is that he made</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.079" end="00:02:57.150" style="s2">amongst other things a map of maps so he</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.900" end="00:02:59.030" style="s2">took all not all of them but many many</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:02.189" style="s2">many different developmental models and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.030" end="00:03:05.700" style="s2">synthesized them into one meta model</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.189" end="00:03:08.549" style="s2">I suppose so and why I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.700" end="00:03:11.129" style="s2">important is just before we go into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.549" end="00:03:12.629" style="s2">different aspects of it having a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.129" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">framework on the world and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.629" end="00:03:16.859" style="s2">happening in our culture and why people</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">can&#39;t get along with each other and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.859" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">that the polarity we&#39;re seeing having a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:24.569" style="s2">developmental model as a map the map is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">not the territory there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.569" end="00:03:29.699" style="s2">another thing we should talk about but</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">having that model makes things easier to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.699" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">navigate and understand in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:34.919" style="s2">has been certainly for me I think for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:37.650" style="s2">in general with the channel it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.919" end="00:03:39.359" style="s2">quite a useful filter through which to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.650" end="00:03:42.419" style="s2">see and understand more about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.359" end="00:03:44.250" style="s2">going on in the culture right now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.419" end="00:03:46.139" style="s2">and it&#39;s important as well to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.250" end="00:03:49.049" style="s2">just take a step back as well because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.139" end="00:03:51.000" style="s2">think one of the the problems with</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.049" end="00:03:52.379" style="s2">integral is that because there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.000" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">of cognitive framework there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.379" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">colors there&#39;s the different quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:04:01.319" style="s2">it can get very the the conversation can</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">become very jargon heavy very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.319" end="00:04:05.069" style="s2">and it can become a very inside baseball</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:08.189" style="s2">kind of conversation as you&#39;ll see if</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.069" end="00:04:11.819" style="s2">you go to any of the integral sites and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.189" end="00:04:16.829" style="s2">so but this but this developmental piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.819" end="00:04:19.349" style="s2">the idea that how we think is as</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.829" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">important as what we&#39;re thinking which</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.349" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">is also at John for a key is also</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:24.779" style="s2">talking about quite a lot which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:26.700" style="s2">really interesting with cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.779" end="00:04:28.920" style="s2">science is at least as</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.700" end="00:04:31.170" style="s2">because it actually frames what we think</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.920" end="00:04:33.330" style="s2">far more than we realize and that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.170" end="00:04:36.270" style="s2">an our sense is that that developmental</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.330" end="00:04:38.520" style="s2">piece is a key ingredient in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.270" end="00:04:41.100" style="s2">evolving conversation that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:43.650" style="s2">intellectual dark web is a part of we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.100" end="00:04:44.580" style="s2">a part of this sense that people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.650" end="00:04:47.160" style="s2">where the conversation is going</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.580" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">somewhere there is a need for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.160" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">developmental the developmental piece is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">such a key part of that and integral</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:55.920" style="s2">ease is is probably the best-known</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">school that deals with the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.920" end="00:05:01.490" style="s2">model but it&#39;s not the only one and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:03.660" style="s2">also for example Jean Piaget who was</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.490" end="00:05:05.850" style="s2">Jordan Pederson talks about as a key</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.660" end="00:05:09.210" style="s2">influencer looked at kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.850" end="00:05:14.630" style="s2">children develop as a but also his</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.210" end="00:05:18.420" style="s2">ultimate aim was to unite science and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.630" end="00:05:20.580" style="s2">ethics religion morality and was able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.420" end="00:05:23.580" style="s2">do that in a way of kind of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.580" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">how we develop so I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.580" end="00:05:27.720" style="s2">to put the sort of flag there and say</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:30.060" style="s2">that it&#39;s not just about integral and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.720" end="00:05:32.250" style="s2">also I think what we&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.060" end="00:05:35.700" style="s2">doing and I&#39;ve seen a few people reflect</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.250" end="00:05:38.730" style="s2">on this on online it&#39;s like is now a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.700" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">good time to look at the legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.730" end="00:05:43.260" style="s2">integral like what it&#39;s what it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.430" end="00:05:45.960" style="s2">really well what it&#39;s done less less</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.260" end="00:05:47.340" style="s2">well and I think so and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.960" end="00:05:49.470" style="s2">something that we&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.340" end="00:05:52.890" style="s2">looking at we&#39;ve got an interview with</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.470" end="00:05:55.890" style="s2">Jamie wheel coming up who&#39;s one of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.890" end="00:05:57.780" style="s2">kind of real who&#39;s been a star of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.890" end="00:06:00.140" style="s2">channel for quite a while and also has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.780" end="00:06:03.450" style="s2">real history with integrity was part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.140" end="00:06:07.890" style="s2">kind of the integral movement from quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.450" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">a while ago so just going to play a clip</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.890" end="00:06:13.350" style="s2">from him that we&#39;ve got in the the film</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.490" end="00:06:15.930" style="s2">that&#39;s coming up it seems to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.350" end="00:06:18.690" style="s2">as we move into these you know nominally</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.930" end="00:06:20.430" style="s2">transpersonal communities is that all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.690" end="00:06:22.290" style="s2">these thought leaders who have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.430" end="00:06:23.940" style="s2">breaking trail right there but they</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:07.679" style="s2">helped guide us to that land to to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.049" end="00:08:10.229" style="s2">party itself so the connection with Ken</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.679" end="00:08:13.439" style="s2">came out quite synchronistically because</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.229" end="00:08:15.329" style="s2">we wrote a piece on the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.439" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">dark web as an emerging integral</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.329" end="00:08:19.649" style="s2">conversation and it became kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:23.069" style="s2">of the most read articles that I&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.649" end="00:08:26.579" style="s2">on medium and in that so they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.069" end="00:08:28.979" style="s2">halfway down I talked about how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.579" end="00:08:31.379" style="s2">integral framework was really useful to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.979" end="00:08:33.389" style="s2">look at what was going on and how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.379" end="00:08:36.860" style="s2">intellectual dark web could be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.389" end="00:08:40.889" style="s2">an emerging integral conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.860" end="00:08:43.170" style="s2">can read that and also read a piece in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.889" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">that where I think I said</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.170" end="00:08:47.820" style="s2">okay we&#39;re going to try and summarize</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:51.060" style="s2">integral theory in three paragraphs and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.820" end="00:08:52.920" style="s2">you actually wrote that piece and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.060" end="00:08:54.150" style="s2">said he read that like someone&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.920" end="00:08:55.650" style="s2">summarize integral theory and three</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.150" end="00:08:57.270" style="s2">paragraphs was like I&#39;d like to see you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.650" end="00:08:59.480" style="s2">try and actually was quite impressed</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.270" end="00:09:01.770" style="s2">that it was a pretty good job of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.480" end="00:09:05.330" style="s2">interpreting integral Theory in a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.770" end="00:09:07.500" style="s2">short space of time so he got in touch</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.330" end="00:09:10.100" style="s2">with us or Ken&#39;s people got in touch</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.500" end="00:09:12.600" style="s2">with us and suggested an interview and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.100" end="00:09:14.820" style="s2">the interview was like a four and a half</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.600" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">hour epic which if you want to see in</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.820" end="00:09:20.210" style="s2">full you can see by becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:23.070" style="s2">subscriber and then we turned it into</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.210" end="00:09:24.810" style="s2">three documentaries the Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.070" end="00:09:26.280" style="s2">Jon and Peterson and the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.810" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">thought which is the central one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.280" end="00:09:30.840" style="s2">had about 80,000 views then another one</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.710" end="00:09:32.280" style="s2">called the intellectual dark web an</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.840" end="00:09:35.940" style="s2">integral conversation and then another</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.280" end="00:09:37.620" style="s2">one Jordan peace and Sam Harris how</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.940" end="00:09:40.230" style="s2">integral Theory can illustrate their</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.620" end="00:09:42.330" style="s2">different conceptions of truth I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.230" end="00:09:44.610" style="s2">that points to another useful aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.330" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">integral is that it has a it provides a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.610" end="00:09:50.070" style="s2">map of reality again it&#39;s a map of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:51.690" style="s2">territory and they&#39;re to put it very</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.070" end="00:09:54.150" style="s2">very simply it&#39;s kind of a four quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.690" end="00:09:56.730" style="s2">model but it divides into the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.150" end="00:09:58.680" style="s2">inner experience and the outer</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.730" end="00:10:00.780" style="s2">experience we can have so my inner</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:02.220" style="s2">experience of being me and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.780" end="00:10:03.990" style="s2">subjective reality of that has its own</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.220" end="00:10:06.540" style="s2">language and a way of inquiring into</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.990" end="00:10:09.390" style="s2">that and studying that and our shared</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.540" end="00:10:10.920" style="s2">understanding of the outside world that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.390" end="00:10:12.900" style="s2">has its own language of the language of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.920" end="00:10:14.820" style="s2">science of you know measurement and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.900" end="00:10:17.250" style="s2">those are great those it&#39;s it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.820" end="00:10:19.230" style="s2">yes and with integral those two aspects</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.250" end="00:10:20.400" style="s2">of reality they&#39;re not mutually</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.230" end="00:10:23.910" style="s2">exclusive they&#39;re both happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.400" end="00:10:26.190" style="s2">same time and when for example with</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.910" end="00:10:28.140" style="s2">Jordan peterson and sam harris they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.190" end="00:10:31.500" style="s2">talking from those two different</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.140" end="00:10:34.260" style="s2">quadrants in this model so that in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.500" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">integral that can&#39;t work because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.260" end="00:10:38.370" style="s2">different language it&#39;s a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:41.640" style="s2">of order of thinking required and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.370" end="00:10:43.310" style="s2">can&#39;t collapse one truth claim into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.640" end="00:10:45.270" style="s2">other truth claim so science does not</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.310" end="00:10:46.710" style="s2">and that&#39;s often what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.270" end="00:10:48.570" style="s2">science where they just don&#39;t accept the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.710" end="00:10:50.850" style="s2">the reality of the interior experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.570" end="00:10:52.380" style="s2">yes yeah exactly so that&#39;s that&#39;s a key</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.850" end="00:10:54.570" style="s2">you know that&#39;s an example of where this</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.380" end="00:10:56.430" style="s2">model can be used to have a better</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.570" end="00:10:56.819" style="s2">understanding of you know in particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.430" end="00:10:58.559" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.819" end="00:10:59.910" style="s2">can&#39;t people agree on something I find</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.559" end="00:11:02.189" style="s2">that very interesting thing especially</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.910" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">in a very polarized environment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.189" end="00:11:06.359" style="s2">easier for us to agree on things that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:07.769" style="s2">can parse out go okay well this is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.359" end="00:11:08.850" style="s2">internal experience I&#39;m trying to apply</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.769" end="00:11:10.769" style="s2">it to something else that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.850" end="00:11:12.899" style="s2">work I just have to really put it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.769" end="00:11:14.879" style="s2">holding lots of different things in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.899" end="00:11:18.539" style="s2">mind and in your awareness at the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.879" end="00:11:20.249" style="s2">time so so Jordan Pederson famously kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.539" end="00:11:22.289" style="s2">of is always going on about</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.249" end="00:11:24.269" style="s2">post-modernism and that the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.289" end="00:11:26.459" style="s2">pathologies of post-modernism what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.269" end="00:11:29.369" style="s2">really interesting is that Ken Wilber</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.459" end="00:11:32.999" style="s2">actually diagnose what he called Boomer</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.369" end="00:11:37.379" style="s2">itis back a couple of decades ago and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.999" end="00:11:39.029" style="s2">and at the time so so Ken&#39;s conception</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.379" end="00:11:40.229" style="s2">of where that goes wrong I think is much</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.029" end="00:11:41.910" style="s2">more sophisticated than Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.229" end="00:11:44.279" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s I think Jordan Peterson can</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.910" end="00:11:45.539" style="s2">become quite one-dimensional when he</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.279" end="00:11:47.729" style="s2">talks about post-modernism and he</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.539" end="00:11:49.919" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to appreciate or at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.729" end="00:11:51.959" style="s2">doesn&#39;t speak to the value of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.919" end="00:11:54.389" style="s2">post-modernism that actually there was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.959" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">stage where it was quite there is some</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.389" end="00:11:58.589" style="s2">use in it there is a pathology about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:01.979" style="s2">when it dissolves into relativism and to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.589" end="00:12:04.679" style="s2">kind of the associated narcissism that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.979" end="00:12:07.679" style="s2">that Ken talks about that Ken also can</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.679" end="00:12:09.569" style="s2">just diagnose a long time ago like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.679" end="00:12:11.869" style="s2">this particular way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.569" end="00:12:13.799" style="s2">world that he called green kind of multi</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.869" end="00:12:17.009" style="s2">perspectival respecting sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.799" end="00:12:19.439" style="s2">different perspectives had the potential</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.009" end="00:12:22.259" style="s2">to go bad there he called boomer itis</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.439" end="00:12:24.509" style="s2">and diagnose that that would mean that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.259" end="00:12:28.049" style="s2">it would effectively collapse into if</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.509" end="00:12:31.859" style="s2">this sort of paradox of no no truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.049" end="00:12:35.159" style="s2">claim is is kind of canonical becomes</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.859" end="00:12:37.079" style="s2">all truth claims are equally valid and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.159" end="00:12:38.939" style="s2">then eventually you just collapse into</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.079" end="00:12:41.909" style="s2">this kind of morass of relativism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.939" end="00:12:44.279" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting is that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.909" end="00:12:46.379" style="s2">of people at the time when Ken was</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.279" end="00:12:47.729" style="s2">saying this was sort of saying while</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.379" end="00:12:50.579" style="s2">he&#39;s going over the D he&#39;s going off the</p>

<p begin="00:12:50.579" end="00:12:54.809" style="s2">it&#39;s quite clear like the pathology of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.649" end="00:12:57.539" style="s2">Greene the pathology of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.809" end="00:12:59.549" style="s2">is so rampant that a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.539" end="00:13:01.799" style="s2">now saying whoa he was he was very</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.549" end="00:13:05.339" style="s2">prescient he actually spotted it a long</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.799" end="00:13:06.419" style="s2">time ago and and has been borne out by</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.339" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">what&#39;s been happening in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.419" end="00:13:10.250" style="s2">since I think it&#39;s week that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">really nice example because it</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.250" end="00:13:13.790" style="s2">applies to where we might be going I</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:15.710" style="s2">think with any developmental model is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.790" end="00:13:17.830" style="s2">very useful because if you look at when</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.710" end="00:13:21.970" style="s2">green the this kind of pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.830" end="00:13:24.380" style="s2">relativistic how it arose it arose</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.970" end="00:13:25.790" style="s2">against the context of like the 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.380" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">and everything had to come before that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.790" end="00:13:30.050" style="s2">and just I think it&#39;s often good to put</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:31.490" style="s2">oneself back in that world where there</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.050" end="00:13:34.010" style="s2">was segregation where there was very</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.490" end="00:13:36.620" style="s2">rigid thought structures whether you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.010" end="00:13:38.630" style="s2">know that was an incredibly cutting edge</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.620" end="00:13:41.540" style="s2">inspiring you know civil rights comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.630" end="00:13:45.170" style="s2">out of it art starts to change there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.540" end="00:13:46.760" style="s2">freeing of sexual mores and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.170" end="00:13:49.090" style="s2">people are experimenting with their</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.760" end="00:13:50.780" style="s2">consciousness like that is a natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.090" end="00:13:53.030" style="s2">developmental it&#39;s like a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.780" end="00:13:54.920" style="s2">getting finally being free from a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.030" end="00:13:56.900" style="s2">stifling home it&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.920" end="00:14:00.440" style="s2">developmental thing and yes it went sour</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.900" end="00:14:03.770" style="s2">for sure but what&#39;s interesting for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.440" end="00:14:06.200" style="s2">is that you can look at that in context</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.770" end="00:14:08.330" style="s2">it adds a certain understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.200" end="00:14:10.670" style="s2">compassion which i think is needed for</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.330" end="00:14:12.110" style="s2">us ever any of us ever getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.670" end="00:14:13.660" style="s2">proper dialogue where something new can</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.110" end="00:14:15.710" style="s2">emerge instead of being in our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.660" end="00:14:17.720" style="s2">ideological camps in the same way i</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.710" end="00:14:20.030" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be rate an eight-year-old for</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.720" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">not being particularly good at drawing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.030" end="00:14:24.020" style="s2">square because they&#39;re an eight-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:26.089" style="s2">you know and so we all as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.020" end="00:14:27.860" style="s2">and as cultures go through processes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.089" end="00:14:31.640" style="s2">then the question is okay where are we</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.860" end="00:14:33.470" style="s2">going now how can we use that to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.640" end="00:14:36.230" style="s2">understand what&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.470" end="00:14:37.520" style="s2">and where we might be going in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.230" end="00:14:39.230" style="s2">we never know where we&#39;re going you</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.520" end="00:14:40.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the next this is you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.230" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">never know where the next stages you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.910" end="00:14:45.220" style="s2">don&#39;t but at the same time there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:47.630" style="s2">sense I think from a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.220" end="00:14:49.930" style="s2">are following our content and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.630" end="00:14:52.310" style="s2">dialogue with that there is a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.930" end="00:14:54.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a teleology to this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.310" end="00:14:56.450" style="s2">as a tote there is a sense that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.440" end="00:15:00.380" style="s2">people have it is going somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.450" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">yes the it came from the like we saw the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.380" end="00:15:04.970" style="s2">the kind of eruption and the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.530" style="s2">phenomenon of Jordan Peterson we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.970" end="00:15:09.220" style="s2">a real kind of intellectual awakening</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.530" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">online the intellectual dark web is one</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.220" end="00:15:14.570" style="s2">manifestation of that the kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:17.480" style="s2">bottom-up sense making process coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.570" end="00:15:19.190" style="s2">out and I mean my sense of where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.480" end="00:15:23.690" style="s2">going also John bhave key pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.190" end="00:15:26.300" style="s2">confirmed that in a recent interview is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.690" end="00:15:29.840" style="s2">a conscious reintegration of of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.300" end="00:15:32.780" style="s2">wisdom traditions and and a the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.840" end="00:15:34.370" style="s2">potential for a grand synthesis which I</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.780" end="00:15:35.870" style="s2">think a lot of us are really sensing</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.370" end="00:15:38.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay there&#39;s a real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.870" end="00:15:41.170" style="s2">that coming and also what we really</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.780" end="00:15:43.160" style="s2">found was like Ken Wilber is a really</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.170" end="00:15:43.910" style="s2">important voice to be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.160" end="00:15:45.860" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.910" end="00:15:48.350" style="s2">and that was ultimately our aim with</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.860" end="00:15:51.250" style="s2">doing the interview with him is to bring</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.350" end="00:15:54.380" style="s2">him into this conversation and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.250" end="00:15:56.120" style="s2">mean we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see where it goes from</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.380" end="00:16:00.310" style="s2">here but the interesting thing as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.120" end="00:16:04.640" style="s2">is that it&#39;s it&#39;s now a very networked</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.310" end="00:16:05.900" style="s2">decentralized two-way process and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.640" end="00:16:07.850" style="s2">think that&#39;s very different from how it</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.900" end="00:16:10.700" style="s2">probably was back in the days when</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.850" end="00:16:12.380" style="s2">integrals first arising it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.700" end="00:16:17.090" style="s2">interesting a lot of the a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.380" end="00:16:19.660" style="s2">sort of most dedicated followers and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.090" end="00:16:22.310" style="s2">lot of our subscribers as well are also</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.660" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">have a history with integral there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.310" end="00:16:26.330" style="s2">sense of that there is it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:29.300" style="s2">attractive to people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.330" end="00:16:32.960" style="s2">make sense of the world in terms of big</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.300" end="00:16:34.280" style="s2">picture big patterns and they I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.960" end="00:16:36.440" style="s2">they also recognize that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.280" end="00:16:39.260" style="s2">trying to do with with rebel wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.440" end="00:16:42.050" style="s2">to create a sense making enterprise and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.260" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">to try and put see okay how does this</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.050" end="00:16:47.480" style="s2">fit so for example Jamie wheel is a good</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:50.210" style="s2">example it&#39;s like Jamie wheel for me is</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.480" end="00:16:53.800" style="s2">holding a really crucial piece around</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.210" end="00:16:57.890" style="s2">flows but flow states embodied wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.800" end="00:16:59.960" style="s2">transformational stuff which is as far</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.890" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">as I can see kind of he&#39;s holding that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.960" end="00:17:04.730" style="s2">particular piece in the constellation</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.740" style="s2">and the yeah the constellation that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.730" end="00:17:08.420" style="s2">we&#39;re aware of and different people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.740" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">holding different places but I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.420" end="00:17:15.319" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting now is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.829" end="00:17:19.670" style="s2">much more two-way conversation and I I</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.319" end="00:17:23.150" style="s2">wonder I think Ken and the people around</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.670" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">him I would invite them to enter that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.150" end="00:17:27.860" style="s2">conversation more in a two-way process</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:30.530" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.860" end="00:17:32.780" style="s2">that integral has had before in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.530" end="00:17:35.690" style="s2">same way yeah and I think I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.780" end="00:17:37.230" style="s2">key point because you know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.690" end="00:17:38.790" style="s2">a lot we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had people</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.230" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">Jorden Greenhalgh Daniel schmackdown</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.790" end="00:17:42.150" style="s2">burger on the channel talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:44.910" style="s2">importance of this decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.150" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">collective intelligence as an antidote</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.910" end="00:17:48.929" style="s2">to the collapse of the institutions that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:51.330" style="s2">aren&#39;t really working right now in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.929" end="00:17:52.530" style="s2">society we need to decentralize and get</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.330" end="00:17:53.850" style="s2">into this mode where something new</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.530" end="00:17:56.610" style="s2">emerges through the interaction between</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.850" end="00:18:00.390" style="s2">us and implicit in that is this level of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.610" end="00:18:02.370" style="s2">openness and this level of not quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.390" end="00:18:03.510" style="s2">knowing the answer and feeding back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.370" end="00:18:05.130" style="s2">one another and this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.510" end="00:18:06.929" style="s2">trying to do it the rebel ISM summit as</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.130" end="00:18:10.710" style="s2">well it&#39;s this kind of process and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.929" end="00:18:12.419" style="s2">really land that yeah it&#39;s shifting for</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.710" end="00:18:15.570" style="s2">as Jordan Greenhalgh it&#39;s shifting from</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.419" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">this broadcast modality to a more</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.570" end="00:18:20.250" style="s2">networked collective modality and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:21.390" style="s2">has to happen as individuals as</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.660" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">trying to make sense together and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.980" end="00:18:28.980" style="s2">think that&#39;s the next process that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:30.299" style="s2">what needs to happen yeah and just</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.980" end="00:18:31.710" style="s2">something else that just comes up in</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.299" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">terms of why people have traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.710" end="00:18:36.030" style="s2">been very interested in integral is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.120" end="00:18:37.620" style="s2">it&#39;s also a map or a model that allows</p>

<p begin="00:19:00.600" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;ve one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.830" end="00:19:05.340" style="s2">found very useful about integral you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:09.179" style="s2">know understanding how to deal with a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.340" end="00:19:11.070" style="s2">shadow understanding how to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.179" end="00:19:13.110" style="s2">relationship between states we can get</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.070" end="00:19:14.309" style="s2">into like the flow state and how we then</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.110" end="00:19:16.200" style="s2">interpret the world you know we</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.309" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">interpret that state or whatever stage</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.200" end="00:19:20.669" style="s2">we&#39;re at so there&#39;s lots of very useful</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">stuff in there that allows for a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.669" end="00:19:25.650" style="s2">maybe a more mature understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:27.570" style="s2">metaphysical let&#39;s say so yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.650" end="00:19:31.110" style="s2">really interested in exploring the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.570" end="00:19:32.370" style="s2">legacy of integral and the first person</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.110" end="00:19:34.650" style="s2">I thought to call was Jamie wheel</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.370" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">because Jamie Jamie I knew had a big</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.650" end="00:19:38.010" style="s2">history with integral going back quite a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:39.240" style="s2">long time and is also kind of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.010" end="00:19:40.860" style="s2">most impressive thinkers that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.240" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">interviewed in the time that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.860" end="00:19:44.700" style="s2">doing the channel if you haven&#39;t watched</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:47.809" style="s2">his piece stealing fire from the gods</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.700" end="00:19:50.970" style="s2">then you should because it&#39;s amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.809" end="00:19:52.350" style="s2">he he had quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.970" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">appreciation but also quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.350" end="00:19:56.940" style="s2">criticisms of integral and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:19:59.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s got to be done I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.940" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">time for if we&#39;re going to do this</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.760" end="00:20:04.679" style="s2">properly we need to to bring that level</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:06.419" style="s2">of kind of transparency and honesty to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.679" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">this is what integral did really well</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.419" end="00:20:11.070" style="s2">this is what integral didn&#39;t do so well</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:12.090" style="s2">and and so that&#39;s what that&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.070" end="00:20:15.780" style="s2">of conversation that we were interested</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.090" end="00:20:19.049" style="s2">in in hosting is is both sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.780" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">coin yeah something Jamie said as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.049" end="00:20:23.490" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a lot of people walking</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:24.900" style="s2">around running integral OS like an</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.490" end="00:20:27.450" style="s2">operating system you know I&#39;d class</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.900" end="00:20:30.780" style="s2">myself as one of those people and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.450" end="00:20:34.590" style="s2">think that that there&#39;s a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.780" end="00:20:37.740" style="s2">distinction between integral OS and when</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.590" end="00:20:40.200" style="s2">integral becomes the only map someone is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.740" end="00:20:43.409" style="s2">using for example you know that one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.200" end="00:20:46.020" style="s2">the difficulties in integral communities</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.409" end="00:20:49.620" style="s2">is that this that those very complex</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.020" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">things levels of you know different</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.620" end="00:20:54.390" style="s2">models are spiral dynamics there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:57.240" style="s2">these different things they can a be</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.390" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">kind of hijacked by the ego so we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.240" end="00:21:01.740" style="s2">hide in them in a sense and be they can</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:03.330" style="s2">create shadows of their own because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.740" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">very common for people to kind of accuse</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.330" end="00:21:07.380" style="s2">each other of being not integral you</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">know this happens quite a lot and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.380" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">something that&#39;s a very first tier thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:12.510" style="s2">to say yeah this is something I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:14.100" style="s2">needs to be I think a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.510" end="00:21:15.840" style="s2">the integral communities are aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.100" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">I think it seems to be out and explicit</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.840" end="00:21:19.590" style="s2">and explored this is it yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:20.820" style="s2">spend any time on any integral forum</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.590" end="00:21:23.159" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that kind of integral</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.820" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">one-upmanship yes like I&#39;m more second</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.159" end="00:21:29.309" style="s2">tier than you and so that I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:33.450" style="s2">is a difficulty and a danger within all</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.309" end="00:21:36.390" style="s2">of these developmental Maps like I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.450" end="00:21:38.280" style="s2">we need to recover hierarchy like we</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.390" end="00:21:40.429" style="s2">have sort of one of the insights of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.280" end="00:21:42.179" style="s2">integral is that we&#39;ve had a green</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.429" end="00:21:44.070" style="s2">postmodern consciousness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.179" end="00:21:45.990" style="s2">obliterated all hierarchies and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.070" end="00:21:48.510" style="s2">in flat land and we can&#39;t navigate</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.990" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know what up is but at</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.510" end="00:21:53.340" style="s2">the same time implicit in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:56.909" style="s2">hierarchies is it&#39;s a dangerous business</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.340" end="00:22:00.780" style="s2">because you&#39;re automatically in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.909" end="00:22:02.970" style="s2">sense creating this diet this dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.780" end="00:22:05.080" style="s2">I&#39;m more developed than you it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.970" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.080" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s a very difficult space to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">navigate yeah the irony is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:15.160" style="s2">that whole model of saying yes and going</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:16.890" style="s2">to the next stage and then like Russian</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.160" end="00:22:20.170" style="s2">dolls kind of growing more and more</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.890" end="00:22:22.030" style="s2">integrated is is based mainly on empathy</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.170" end="00:22:24.610" style="s2">for the pre you know that and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.030" end="00:22:26.230" style="s2">there&#39;s not I have not seen a huge</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.610" end="00:22:28.690" style="s2">amount of empathy sometimes in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.230" end="00:22:30.840" style="s2">the integral communities you know and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.690" end="00:22:33.400" style="s2">yeah like we were talking before about</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.840" end="00:22:35.470" style="s2">you know the movement from the 1950s so</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.400" end="00:22:37.870" style="s2">this kind of green pluralistic modality</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.470" end="00:22:39.970" style="s2">i think jeff salesman pointed out that a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.870" end="00:22:41.860" style="s2">lot of people missed out who were born</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.970" end="00:22:44.500" style="s2">after that missed out on the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.860" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">values so that&#39;s a good example of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.500" end="00:22:48.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t say oh now screw that like we</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:49.930" style="s2">you know to screw the nineteen fifty we</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.280" end="00:22:51.880" style="s2">were wrong we&#39;re gonna go into another</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.930" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">thing it&#39;s yes there&#39;s truth in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.880" end="00:22:55.270" style="s2">and let&#39;s integrate that where&#39;s my own</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:58.090" style="s2">traditionalism where&#39;s my own morality</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.270" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">that maps more to that hold it integrate</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.090" end="00:23:01.990" style="s2">it have it as part of myself and also</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">have the pluralistic side as part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.990" end="00:23:06.550" style="s2">myself and all the other bits and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:08.950" style="s2">all of that relies on empathy and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.550" end="00:23:11.410" style="s2">openness genuine empathy and openness</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.950" end="00:23:12.700" style="s2">and if it can&#39;t like that that&#39;s place</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.410" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">to start I think and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.700" end="00:23:16.690" style="s2">where I&#39;d like to see the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:18.100" style="s2">go as well and for all of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.690" end="00:23:21.100" style="s2">interested in this to ask hard questions</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.100" end="00:23:22.510" style="s2">of ourselves am I really am I really</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.100" end="00:23:23.830" style="s2">coming from a place of openness or am i</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.510" end="00:23:25.500" style="s2">coming from a place of you know like</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.830" end="00:23:28.750" style="s2">that word you mentioned one-upsmanship</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.500" end="00:23:30.430" style="s2">so yeah the Jamie wheel piece about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.750" end="00:23:33.250" style="s2">legacy of integral is going out pretty</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.430" end="00:23:36.430" style="s2">much at the same time as this or very</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.250" end="00:23:39.190" style="s2">shortly afterwards and yeah we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.430" end="00:23:41.080" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna see I&#39;m interested in doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.190" end="00:23:43.330" style="s2">maybe another couple of interviews about</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.080" end="00:23:44.860" style="s2">the legacy of integral people who might</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.330" end="00:23:48.430" style="s2">have something really worthwhile to talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.860" end="00:23:50.590" style="s2">about kind of developmental thinking why</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.430" end="00:23:52.600" style="s2">it&#39;s useful where it can go wrong kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.590" end="00:23:56.650" style="s2">of the lessons that we can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.600" end="00:23:59.980" style="s2">the past and for example Robert Keegan</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.650" end="00:24:02.770" style="s2">is a very well-known Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.980" end="00:24:04.060" style="s2">developmental psychologist who hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.770" end="00:24:06.970" style="s2">will govern interview with coming up at</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.060" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">the end of April and yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.970" end="00:24:11.950" style="s2">interested in sort of seeing where this</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.810" style="s2">conversation is going and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.950" end="00:24:16.150" style="s2">developmental piece being just something</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.810" end="00:24:17.890" style="s2">absolutely crucial to bring in so just</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.150" end="00:24:19.630" style="s2">some quick updates to close</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.890" end="00:24:21.070" style="s2">we had the Revel wisdom summit coming up</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.630" end="00:24:21.490" style="s2">on the 12th of May which is a one-day</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.070" end="00:24:25.810" style="s2">event</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.490" end="00:24:28.120" style="s2">with Jordan Greenhalgh Ian McGilchrist</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.810" end="00:24:30.670" style="s2">brett Weinstein and Heather huiying and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.120" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">so very excited about that and thank you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.670" end="00:24:35.020" style="s2">to everyone who&#39;s coming it&#39;s sold out</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:36.330" style="s2">now is gonna be about 150 people and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.020" end="00:24:38.890" style="s2">first of what we hope will be many</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.330" end="00:24:42.090" style="s2">spaces where we can get into this kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.890" end="00:24:45.670" style="s2">of collaborative conversation where we</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.090" end="00:24:47.020" style="s2">practice really seeing we can let</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.670" end="00:24:49.690" style="s2">something emerge between us that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.020" end="00:24:52.180" style="s2">than the sum of our parts so as well as</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.690" end="00:24:54.310" style="s2">that separately we have finally after</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.180" end="00:24:56.860" style="s2">many months set up the rebel wisdom</p>
