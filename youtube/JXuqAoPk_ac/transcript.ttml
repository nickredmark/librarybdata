<p begin="00:00:44.800" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">we are just doing our usual check to see</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.960" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">whether the audio and video are</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:53.199" style="s2">in sync whether or not the amplitude is</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:56.079" style="s2">correct for you to hear it</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.199" end="00:00:58.239" style="s2">on your system and whether everything is</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.079" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">good to go so please tell us in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.239" end="00:01:02.559" style="s2">whether things</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">seem copacetic do they seem copacetic</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:07.520" style="s2">if you feel good about what you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">they&#39;re probably copacetic</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">all right we&#39;ve got feedback we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">in a few minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">hey folks welcome to the dark horse</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">podcast live stream</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">number 49 is that right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">for today we are perfectly square we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">very square we&#39;re always a little square</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">um so in the audio visual check before</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">the podcast we always do a little check</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">just to make sure the equipment is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">and somebody in the chat said they could</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">hear me</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">and see me but wanted to know if it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">normal that they could</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">smell me and i wanted to just take a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">moment to respond and say no</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">it&#39;s very unlikely you could smell me</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">but probably you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">a stroke so you might want to look into</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">or if you&#39;re luckier you&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">synesthetic experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">and uh keep up with it oh synthetic it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">could be the mushrooms kicking in mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">or just your brain or just your brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">exactly okay well cool so</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">um where should we begin today well we</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">want to talk about a number of things we</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">the political compass test we want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">talk about complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">and both mesentery and helium obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">and uh we want to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">about sultanates yes um and probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">other things as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">uh should we start with political</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">compass test let&#39;s start with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">political compass test</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">okay uh do you want to begin by just</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">describing what you understand it to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">sure um political compass test if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">went way back in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">twitter feed a couple years ago you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">would find me saying something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">you didn&#39;t want to engage the modern era</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">politically without at least running</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">through the political compass test</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">because it adds a dimensionality to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">understand people&#39;s political position</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">isn&#39;t there in the classic right left</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:08:02.879" style="s2">dimension so if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">a system of two axes the left right axis</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.879" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">is the same as normal political left and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">political right but there&#39;s a second</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">axis the vertical axis that goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">from libertarian in the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">to authoritarian in the top and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">is that this gives you four quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">that describe different sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">ideologies right so it&#39;s a small l</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">libertarian this is not a map</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">for um the big l libertarian political</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">party that we have in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">yes and in fact uh if you look on</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">my wikipedia page you will see that i am</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">quoted as describing myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">as a left libertarian which is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">head scratcher</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">if you think of it as big libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">but it is of course little libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">which means</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">uh very liberty focused um as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">trying to dictate how things ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">uh one one way i&#39;ve heard it described</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:01.839" style="s2">is the libertarian versus</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">authoritarian access is that those</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.839" end="00:09:06.959" style="s2">near the authoritarian end uh prefer to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">use power to accomplish their goals</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.959" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">and those closer to the libertarian and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">prefer to use</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">reason or perhaps gentler forms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">coercion</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">so you know given that you might imagine</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:21.519" style="s2">that politicians people who have decided</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">that they want to be in a position</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.519" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">of of power would lean towards the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">authoritarian end</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">of the axis simply because they have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">chosen uh to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">to be in a position in which they hope</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">to exert some control</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">in many cases to to try to do good uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">but that power is inherently part of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">job description</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:43.760" style="s2">well i want to i want to back us up just</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">slightly because</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.760" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">my sense is that it&#39;s not that um</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">libertarians like</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">uh gentler forms of coercion i believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.920" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">the bias really if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">if you uh chase down what we actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">believe is you want to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">the coercion necessary to accomplish the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:13.360" style="s2">which is why the power versus reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">description seems just too</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.360" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">too much in favor of the libertarian end</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">for me to say it without any</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">qualification</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">qualifying words at all because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">you know that must be my bias showing um</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">but it i think it is pretty accurate</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">frankly well let me uh i think where it</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">would be something like this for me at</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">least i will say</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">the mechanisms i favor most to</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">accomplish an objective like leveling a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">playing field</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">would be um incentives</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">that allow the market to solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">right now i am not</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">a market fundamentalist i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">that the market inherently solves all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">our problems if we just</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">give it leeway i actually think we need</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">to very carefully think about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">incentives</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">um to place but once we place those</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">incentives</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">market mechanisms allow people</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">essentially to discover whether they</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">are on the right track by whether or not</p>

<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">and that shouldn&#39;t be but a system of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">proper incentives would be a very gentle</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">way to</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">um decades ago at this point have um</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">have taken a lot of flack for it uh and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">have also responded</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:34.320" style="s2">um almost entirely as far as i can tell</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">you can go online and take the test</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">yourself and it will</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">plot you on this on this graph of two</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">axes and then it will also show you</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">who among historical figures both past</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">they get these politicians to take these</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">tests no</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">uh and maybe some of them do um but</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">their position is and i&#39;ll just read</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">here from their site you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">show this sack</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">um and they&#39;re on their faq</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">page how can you determine where</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">politicians are honestly at without</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">asking them and you know before i even</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">read their answer i would say</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">as an animal behaviorist i used to joke</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">oh wouldn&#39;t it be easier if we could</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">just interview the bees or the beavers</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">the parakeets like no actually because</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">they&#39;d lie yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">would politicians lie of course they</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">would you know of course they would</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">so what they say here is how can you</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">tell where they are honestly at by</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">asking them</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">especially around election time we rely</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">on reports parliamentary voting records</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">manifestos</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">and actions that speak much louder than</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">words it takes a great deal longer than</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:24.959" style="s2">simply having the politician take the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">test</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.959" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a far more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">assessment okay so they go on a bit but</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">given that um let us</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">show zach the political compass tests</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">estimation</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">of where in 2020 the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">candidates for president fall on their</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">graph</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">left is left right is right top is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">authoritarian bottom is libertarian oof</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">right almost everyone who was running</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">for president</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">in the united states this year shows up</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">in the authoritarian right</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">trump of course pence of course biden</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:03.920" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">not really that much farther left than</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.920" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">trump and only a couple squares down in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">the authoritarian axis</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">harris a similar position to biden as</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">biden as to trump</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:15.199" style="s2">almost everyone else the the big</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">exceptions and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.199" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">i was so pleased to see this gabbard</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:20.959" style="s2">tulsi gabbard and then we have hawkins</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">as the green candidate</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.959" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">uh over over on in the left</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">libertarian camp and joe jorgensen who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">libertarian candidate for president far</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">far right</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">in in libertarian camp and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">sanders and gravel also and left</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">so i want to point out a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">things here i have to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">i both do and don&#39;t buy this graph and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">the reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">is that i am afraid that what we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">downstream of the effect of a giant</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">magnetic force yeah and what that but</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t mean that this was untrue</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">it would just mean that these characters</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have the agency that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">they pretend they do or think they do</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">well i think i think it means two things</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">and one of them is consistent with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:12.399" style="s2">interpretation presented and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.399" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">um so if you imagine a system that will</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">only accept</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">answers that don&#39;t upend what it finds</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">sacred</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">right then it will essentially</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">filter the world of potential candidates</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">for only those</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">that are consistent and therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">will get this amazing bias it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">do you want you want zach to be showing</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">this yeah zach would you put it back up</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">so um all of these candidates in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">upper right hand</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">quadrant are effectively in the upper</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">hand right hand quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">after we know of them and after they</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">have ascended to a point of seriousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.000" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">in these races and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">in some sense that is you are seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">validation</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">of the duopoly there and it is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">surprising that the duopoly favors</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">uh authoritarian measures and is far</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">right leaning right</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s bias um so</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">on the one hand this is a filter of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">that part would correctly reflect their</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">position here</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">but then the other part which is going</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">to be very hard to disentangle from this</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:20.320" style="s2">is that their tendency to say things</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">that allow them to move into the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.320" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">round to live to fight another day</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">politically</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">means that they may uh not tell us what</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">they really think you know is bernie</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">sanders</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">really that close to the actual center</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">you know by some measures yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">why i mean that&#39;s why i read part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">their answer to the question about how</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">it is that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">place the can the the politicians that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">they do on these graphs or they do</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">uh which is that they use actions</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">whenever they can voting records and</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">right so not not just words but if if</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">it&#39;s words it work it&#39;s words that have</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.320" end="00:16:55.759" style="s2">something demonstrating skin in the game</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:58.000" style="s2">behind them right</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.759" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">so the real question i think people</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.000" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">should be asking themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">is if you take this test and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">come out in that upper right hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">quadrant and then you imagine well were</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">i to enter</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">the political landscape how how far in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">that direction would i find myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">moved that&#39;s a really important question</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:15.919" style="s2">and the fact that you would find</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:19.280" style="s2">yourself moved at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.919" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">is really the hidden message here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.280" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">right the fact that our system just</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:26.480" style="s2">simply refuses to accept</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">anything um of uh a different type</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.480" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">right that it systematically</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">marginalizes things in the lower</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">uh left-hand quadrant on the lower right</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">yeah i would say it does though there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">a well no i guess i guess it does</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">systematically</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">marginalize both differently and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">know according to this we have no one in</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">the upper left now you know you you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">i would argue and i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">i think that most people would argue</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">given the description of what this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">describe yeah that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">minimizing anyone in the upper half</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">of this of this at all and so when i say</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">there&#39;s no one here in the upper left</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not that i wish that there was</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s that i wish that there you know all</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">of those people in the upper right</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">were down in the lower lower half and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:10.400" style="s2">frankly if they were all in the lower</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">we would have a much more fair and just</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">world even though</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">you and i are both pretty far over left</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">in that lower left quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">yeah um i would agree and i you know one</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">of the critiques that has been leveled</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">is that nobody will place themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">the upper part of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">this graph right now they will</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">accidentally by answering the questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">honestly but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">uh stigmatizing about the label</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">authoritarian um whereas</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">libertarian small l at least is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:43.280" style="s2">stigmatizing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">um but i will also say you know in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.280" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">sense the upper left-hand</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">quadrant is in the street rebelling</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">um in a very frightening way but</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">wokeness</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">is unrepresented on this graph with</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">respect to modern</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">politicians though many have uh paid lip</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">service to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">um and so there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">oh i also got mao and stalin and and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">shay guevara and such in the upper left</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">historically oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">historically yes modern times no</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">and you know we&#39;re seeing a resurgence</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">of this which is frightening right</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">because of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">where all of those examples point but</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">the other thing i wanted to point out</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">and i wish i wish we had this paper but</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">a couple years back there was a paper</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">that suggested that authoritarianism was</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">actually a personality type and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">many of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">that we find on the authoritarian left</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">actually would be just as happy on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">authoritarian right if the winds were</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">blowing the other way well we talked</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">one piece of research that came out um a</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">number of episodes ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">that was not from a couple years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">more but more recent</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">we specifically talked about um such</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">such a piece of research</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s possible i&#39;m misremembering when it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">when it came out but in any</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">case um it is worth</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">considering where you would where you</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:00.640" style="s2">would find yourself in the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">these other influences</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.640" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">what motivates you to be there um</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:08.440" style="s2">you know in other words there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.440" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">self-serving economic conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">in the upper right-hand quadrant whereas</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">ideological economic conservatives often</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">find themselves in the lower right hand</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">quadrant in other words it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">belief that if we just simply clear the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">decks of obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">people will find their way to success</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">and it fixes problems yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s not that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">truth in that but it&#39;s far from a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">complete solution as</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">as you and i would see it now this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">this is verificationist i think but i</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:43.280" style="s2">find it</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">interesting that the characters that i</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.280" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">have the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">strong visceral reaction to are are very</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">far over</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">right and the two that strike me</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">particularly um even farther right the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">trump on here</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:56.720" style="s2">are bloomberg and inslee and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">bloomberg i think every american</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.720" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">watching at least will will recognize</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">who he is and at the point that he</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">started running late in the game um</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:06.000" style="s2">before it looked like biden was the heir</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">apparent i said to you i cannot believe</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:08.640" style="s2">that there&#39;s some chance the democrats</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">are going to elect</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.679" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">so not on the left but inslee</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.880" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">who is uh who ran briefly is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">governor of washington state</p>

<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">interested people like us would be in</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">yeah in some ways he um he is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">the same level of emptiness of joe biden</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">but he&#39;s accomplished it without the</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">so hard to do but um okay so this</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">actually points</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">to another odd anomaly that happened</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">this week in the wall street journal</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">actually okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know you and i have not talked</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">about it but okay you may have seen it</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">where the wall street journal published</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">an editorial an op-ed</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">um decrying the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">honest liberals fighting a back against</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.679" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">uh the woke revolution oh yeah you see</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">did you see this</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">yeah i i tweeted about it uh just jason</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">stanley</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">jason still no no no no no no no no it</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s totally wrong um i&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">into it as you talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">rightly maybe um in any case uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">this was an amazing error</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">because the wall street journal</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">has been exceptional in publishing a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">many jason riley jason reilly uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">publishing a great many</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">honest liberals who have pushed back</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">against woke-ism it&#39;s almost a singular</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">exception in this regard they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">published you they&#39;ve published me peter</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">pagozian</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">they&#39;ve discussed jonathan height</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.799" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve published john mcwarder</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">they&#39;ve interviewed greg lukianov so</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">there&#39;s this long list of people and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">either the wall street journal opinion</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">page</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">decided to ignore their own history of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">publishing these people or they forgot</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">yeah so the quote the quote that i</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">pulled from the piece was</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">there is no shortage of conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">willing to push back against this</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:30.480" style="s2">pernicious nonsense but where have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">honest liberals gone</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.480" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">and to some degree and this is what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">know this is what i said online</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">we&#39;re told in part what you&#39;re seeing if</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">you&#39;re on the right and you think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">no one on the left is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">is speaking to this um like partially</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s a it&#39;s a disingenuous and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">a dishonest assessment coming out of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">wall street journal</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">for precisely the reasons that you say</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">um but in part we are told that our very</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">criticism of this ideology</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">proves that we&#39;re on the right right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">it there&#39;s no there&#39;s no winning there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">no being able to continue to claim that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.840" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">you&#39;re on the left if you&#39;re critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">the really horrifying ideology that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">emerging from the left</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">and that makes it even easier for</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">everyone from you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">uh journalists who are being uh who are</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:12.159" style="s2">being published in the wall street</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">journal</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.159" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">to just you sort of rank and file uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">people on the street who have</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">either a lifetime of voting um on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">right and of being conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">or have moved from the left to right</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">over time and anyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">who moved after them i find they want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">point a finger and say where were you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">how did you not see this until i saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:35.360" style="s2">and the fact is that we you know we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">should all be interested in everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.360" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">eyes being open to whatever is true</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">at the moment some of what is true is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">some very scary stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.600" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">on um on the far left</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:51.919" style="s2">going on across the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">but the idea that you aren&#39;t welcome</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.919" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">unless you arrived at the revelation at</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">the same moment that i did</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not going to end well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">uh it&#39;s crazy um and it speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">a you know you and i talk about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">analysis is very important to get right</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">but that what moves people</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:13.840" style="s2">is narrative but the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.400" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">is it also means that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.840" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">narrative control is effectively the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">ability to overwrite</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">analysis and so yeah um what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">is that we you know it&#39;s like we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">vampires who do not reflect in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">mirror</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">right the narrative is that there are no</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">liberals</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">pushing back that conservatism is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">bulwark that will stop this thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">right liberals are completely absent</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">from the fight and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">total nonsense right and you know back</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:47.520" style="s2">early days of idw you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">we we just watched this unfold in every</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.520" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">major publication where all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">liberals you know joe rogan uh sam</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">harris you and me eric</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">all of these people were just simply</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">portrayed as on the right because it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">necessary to the narrative that we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">on the right even though</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">christina summers christina sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">and the um you know the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">actually things like the political</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">compass test are very useful because you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">can go and check you just</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">deliver you know your honest answers and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">see where you come out so</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">it does require that you&#39;re honest</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">because presumably the test is gameable</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to game it sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">you can spot questions that would move</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">you one direction or another but if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">answer it honestly you can find out yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:29.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">but okay so um all right is that as far</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.840" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">as we want to go political compass-wise</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:37.039" style="s2">all right what should we do next as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.360" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">like we can we can go into complex</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.039" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">systems let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">let&#39;s do complex systems and we have two</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">topics in this neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">you want to start uh fully biological</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">all right let&#39;s do it let&#39;s do it okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">so there</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">is uh a a structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">i will say for the moment in</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">boy i didn&#39;t look it up i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">certainly all tetrapods and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">probably all chordates</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">uh called mesentery which is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">this as as someone who used to teach</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">comparative anatomy labs where we</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.640" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">that quarter um it&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">when you when you do visceral anatomy</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">and you open up the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">peritoneal cavity of of an animal</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">you find that basically all of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:25.360" style="s2">organs of the abdominal cavity are</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:28.399" style="s2">suspended in this sort of vague</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.360" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">transparent membrane uh depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">animal you can tell that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">actually functional stuff inside that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">membrane</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s it&#39;s quite fat especially</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">if you and the animal itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">the cat that you&#39;re dissecting is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">actually quite fat um almost always that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.039" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">mesentery has a lot of fat in it as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">um but really at the point that i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">learning my comparative anatomy in order</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">to teach it in the 90s in grad school</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">every time i looked into it before i</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">would teach it again every i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">three years or so because it wasn&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">main</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">main gig at all um as a as a professor</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">um it was really it was sort of this an</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">aside like you&#39;re going to have to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">through it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">um or you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna see it</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">basically all the stuff in that cavity</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">that you&#39;re interested in you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">stuff that you&#39;re interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">small intestine the large intestine the</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">um is suspended in this mesentery but</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of it like that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">story and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">um here&#39;s a a more formal definition of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">from a paper that just came out is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">the collection of tissues that supports</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">the development of all abdominal</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">digestive organs and that maintains</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:30.799" style="s2">these in systemic continuity in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">adulthood so that&#39;s written as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.799" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">biolog</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">biology ease but it&#39;s consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:36.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">you know what what is it like you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.159" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">it when you see it and you definitely</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">like you you did this</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">you you did comparative anatomy with</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">with me once or twice maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">but we have now in the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">years evidence that it has a single</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">um developmentally and embryologically</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">embryologically exactly it has a single</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">and that it retains a single form and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">that has led to calls for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">labeled an an organ and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">so one of the things that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">one of the sets of things that we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">now understanding about mesentery is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">there and again i&#39;m just going to quote</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">from this coffee at all 2020 paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">that the functions of mesentery are</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">underpinned by quote extensive gene and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">protein expression over 50 cytokines</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:25.840" style="s2">are produced in the mesentery these</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">include ghrelin</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.840" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">not going to be able to pronounce most</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">of these adiponectin resistant</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">adipophylline and many others cellular</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">activities are supported by molecular</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:35.279" style="s2">activities</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">a large number of enzymes are produced</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">by the mesentery and it is not known if</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">these in conjunction with surface</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">receptors</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">subserve specialized or general</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">functions or both</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">so that both has a lot of information in</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">it most of which</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">most listeners won&#39;t have any particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">association with</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">but it points to oh my god the mesentery</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:55.760" style="s2">which we thought was</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">not much just something you kind of cut</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.760" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">through when you&#39;re trying to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">stuff that you&#39;re trying to get to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">actually is this font of molecular</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">enzymatic cellular functionality</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t know as recently as 10</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">so how does this this traditional</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:17.039" style="s2">understanding of mesentery which as long</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.799" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">as 100 years ago there were a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.039" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">doctors saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">you know the definition of mesentery is</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">going to prevent us</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">from understanding what it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s very insightful right</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">that our debt once we have these</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:32.000" style="s2">definitions in place</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">we often cannot go beyond them</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.000" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">and see what is actually true of them so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">one more cat in my way here</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">one more quote if i can find it here</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:46.159" style="s2">from this paper</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">is all abdominal digestive organs are</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.159" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">directly connected to a single mesentery</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">this means that the mesentery provides a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:53.200" style="s2">linkage mechanism between abdominal</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">digestive organs</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.200" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">in addition it collectively links all</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">these organs to the body</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:31:00.240" style="s2">a linkage mechanism is an essential</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">component of any functional system</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.240" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">the elements of a system cannot function</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">in concert unless they are connected</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">the mesentery is the anatomical platform</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">in which all abdominal digestive organs</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">are integrated</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">in the systems that collectively</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">generate the human body</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">integration commences or ends at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">histological level in the digestive</p>

<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">in the mesentery integration is</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.159" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">concentrated into prominent lymphatic</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">vascular and neurological elements the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">mesentery can thus be compared with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">biological circuit board</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">by which digestive organs are integrated</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">in the body unless we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">mesentery we cannot hope to have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">complete understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">of the mechanism by which the human body</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">so that to me is a perfect encapsulation</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">of the failure of reductionism in</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">modern medicine to and and biology to</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:53.519" style="s2">it&#39;s it reflects the hubris of uh of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">of humanity in imagining that we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.519" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">walk in</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">uh immediately categorize a few aspects</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">and try to control it we cannot fully</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">and by imagining that we can we actually</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">and one more thing um before i stop</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">talking here so this</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">reminds me very much of uh the thinking</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:20.399" style="s2">as well so fascia um for for people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:23.120" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.399" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">interested in in fitness or have ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">had to go to pt</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:28.240" style="s2">of late or are athletes that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">probably be familiar at this point with</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.240" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">the term fascia or</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">myofascial or myofascial release</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">techniques</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">so fascia is the very effectively the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">very thin layer of muscle that lies</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">between the skin</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">and the skeletal muscle and skeletal</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">muscle is when you do dissections</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">really easy to see it has clear origin</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">and insertion points</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">um and you can you know you can point to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">uh what it must do</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">based on where it is and what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:54.960" style="s2">attached to whereas fascia is this</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">set of or you know maybe single origin</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.960" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">of sheaths</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">that are wrapping the body wrapping all</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">aspects of the body and similarly</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">to mesentery at the point i was learning</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">dissections in the 90s on vertebrates</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">we were told just go right through the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">fascia it&#39;s not really a thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">and of course it absolutely does so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">anti-fascia people were just dead wrong</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">is that your point is that it was all a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">setup</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.000" end="00:33:25.279" style="s2">all right so yeah this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">and you know how many times are we going</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.279" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">to make this</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:29.519" style="s2">mistake in various different places</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">right you know we&#39;re going to make it</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">every time</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">uh junk dna yes we have dna which is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">junk if it doesn&#39;t code for genes it</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">must not do anything right oops that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">90</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">of the genome right uh we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:45.039" style="s2">uh so-called vestigial organs like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">appendix</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.039" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">and like um the uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">the tonsils um yep we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">uh yeah we&#39;ve got a whole list of places</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:56.799" style="s2">where we have decided that because we</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:58.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t know exactly what something was</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.799" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">that it was actually some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.480" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">error of evolution and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:03.760" style="s2">essentially never going to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">let me just say a word about vestigial</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.760" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">because i actually evoked a vestigiality</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">in a tweet this week i talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">vestigial wings of flightless birds and</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">compared them to the vestigial morals</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">and intellects of modern politicians</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">uh because it amused me to do so um</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">after the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">vice presidential debate this week um</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">but obviously the wings of penguins for</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">instance while</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:29.359" style="s2">vestigial with reference to their</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">ability to allow the bird to fly</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.359" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">are used to allow the penguins to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">effectively fly through water</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">and so vestigiality the term vestigial</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">kind of like the word weed and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">talked about the word weed before on</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.040" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">these vestigial and weed are actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">are actually human constructs right like</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">so and yeah you don&#39;t you don&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">like this this construction so</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">um the way that when we call something</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:56.960" style="s2">vestigial</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">it is very often a description of our</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.960" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">failure to understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">what it is and what we call something a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">weed it is a reflection</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">of our desire for whether or not it</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">should be in the landscape or not right</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:09.599" style="s2">uh just a reminder for people i argued</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.599" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">weeds are botanical noise that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">signal is what you&#39;re trying to grow in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">your garden and the weeds are the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">um the things that grow of their own</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">accord</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:25.520" style="s2">um but in this case i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:27.839" style="s2">like that because as you know i tend to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.520" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">garden by um competing on behalf of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.839" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">native plants that i like</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">sure right no and then this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">the right way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:35.839" style="s2">gardening but nonetheless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">competing on behalf of certain plants</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:38.480" style="s2">that are the signal and the weeds are</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.480" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">you spend most of your time fighting but</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">in any case</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">the um term vestigial has a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">use but i would argue in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">truly vestigial it is also in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">process of disappearing</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">right now it may be a very long period</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">over which it is disappearing but for</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">example the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.640" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">limbs of snakes there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">some basil snakes that have some remnant</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">limbs that are presumably i mean they</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">may have adopted a function maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">have stuck around and is it pythons</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the boweds at the at the base</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">of the snake tree no one has</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">they don&#39;t have retain any of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">pectoral girdle or limbs but they have</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">early in development um a tiny pelvic</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">girdle and just the tiny rudiments of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">femurs</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">right and we have uh webbing in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">fingers that disappears by apoptosis so</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">that is presumably vestigial or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just structural</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">in other words it may be necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">have that webbing in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">fingers and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">but anyway there&#39;s a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:40.720" style="s2">things that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">continuing to exist not disappearing</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.720" end="00:36:44.079" style="s2">like the appendix and the tonsils</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">that have a function we just haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.079" end="00:36:47.119" style="s2">found it and so it&#39;s sort of we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">have in both those cases</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.119" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">but just most people don&#39;t know them but</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:53.599" style="s2">for the long history</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">of medical science we didn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.599" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">it was and so we assumed it didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">one which</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">never made any evolutionary sense so</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">anyway we&#39;ve got to distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">all right um is there more oh so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">cap this off the argument here is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">this is an</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:12.400" style="s2">organ and it is an organ in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">that it functions like one</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">it is disgusting it&#39;s got a single</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">origin distinct from most organs in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">do all organs have a single origin that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">the consensus and of course the the term</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">organ</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">is itself a human construct right so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">know does</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:30.240" style="s2">does does the category organ have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">biologically meaningful reality i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">but part of the reason that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">mesentery is now being reclassified as</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">an organ</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">is because it um has been found to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">a single developmental embryological</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">right i&#39;m just wondering whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:44.079" style="s2">really a category that we already adhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">to maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.079" end="00:37:47.280" style="s2">yeah i mean i think i mean of course it</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">depends on how</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s fractal right it depends on how far</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">you go in so if you&#39;re looking you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">single embryological origin are you</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">talking about just like the three very</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:56.960" style="s2">pyramidal</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">layers of endoderm music ectoderm you</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.960" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">know which case okay skin has a single</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s all over the body</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s tough to do right yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">and you know so</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a very fascinating subject actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:14.079" style="s2">embryology is one of those places</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">that in my opinion was kind of a dormant</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.079" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">science uh when we were in college it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">wasn&#39;t you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">very empirical didn&#39;t have a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">underpinning that was very deep there</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">had been some very powerful early work</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">where people had</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">grafted uh parts of chicken embryos onto</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">each other to see</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">what it changed and some of the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">genetic work was done by embryologists</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">right the let&#39;s beam in a mangle and</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">right yeah but it went through this</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">period where we i don&#39;t think we were</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">learning very much because we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">have the theoretical grounding and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:44.560" style="s2">the so-called evo devo developmental</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">evolutionary science which</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">uh has a a large</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">it unearthed a large number of what are</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">called epigenetic factors which</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.400" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">in this case means these molecular</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">factors that adjust what genes are being</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">transcribed</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">um so anyway that&#39;s a large part of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">content of the genome that doesn&#39;t code</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">for proteins that was long dismissed as</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">junk but anyway um that field</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">really came alive and is now one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.000" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">most vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">fields in embryology in biology wow evo</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">i because it now does have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:19.599" style="s2">grounding but one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">things that you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.599" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">anticipate till you see it is that a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">developing</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">body a developing vertebrate the cells</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">you know each you know how you start out</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">with one cell and then each</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">cell you know is a descendant in some</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">line and at some point it starts</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">differentiating and so you&#39;re in some</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">line that ultimately leads</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">you know to an eye and several other</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">things but um</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">but in any case there are multiple</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">processes interacting one is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.240" end="00:39:50.079" style="s2">counter where the cell knows how many</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">you know steps down the line it is and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.079" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">so it becomes more and more specific</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">with respect to what it does as it goes</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:57.119" style="s2">down that line</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">but it also by touching other tissue is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.119" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">induced to produce new kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">structures and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">um it is possible so there&#39;s clock and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">there&#39;s induction and those are two</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">different processes right</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">and so you could get for example the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">same kind of clock exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">um you could get the same kind of tissue</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">produced by two different</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">origins because basically the real</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">question is to be a kind of tissue you</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">will encode a certain subset of genes</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">and you can be instructed to do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">from two different starting points</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">yeah so anyway well i wonder actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:33.920" style="s2">boy i think i&#39;m gonna get it wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">is it maybe the pancreas</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:37.119" style="s2">maybe that has both an anterior and a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:39.440" style="s2">posterior</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.119" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">portion that are actually actually have</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.440" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">different embryologic</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:46.480" style="s2">origins and so i think as a result boy</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">please correct me if i&#39;m wrong and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.480" end="00:40:51.359" style="s2">try to figure out if i am</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">but one one of these organs that shows</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.359" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">up generally</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">in our viscera i believe has um</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">at least different origins in time and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">think actually in place with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">embryology and then later comes together</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">to fuse and appears to be a single organ</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.960" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">but actually really is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">so that would be the perfect answer to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">my question i would expect actually this</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.400" style="s2">happens in multiple places but maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">um and maybe maybe there&#39;s a reason it</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.400" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t in other words maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">uh composite organs are more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.440" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">to developmental screw-ups or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">like that who knows</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">and you know and and you know how how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">you get cellular policing of the borders</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">as they fuse</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s there&#39;s going to be some</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:30.079" style="s2">challenge there that you wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">in a single origin organ</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re certainly going to get a um</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">increase in the potential for mismatches</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">yeah all right so are we there with</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:44.480" style="s2">respect to mesentery yeah i just uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">just you know once again the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.480" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">reductionism with which we often</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">approach complex systems and i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">this this is a place where conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">are much more likely</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">uh to uh engage in imagining that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">can control</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">that you can control a system and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">know control nature control the body</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">control you know whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s a mistake and it almost always</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">results</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">in um wrong understandings and missed</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">opportunities to actually generate</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">better you know health well-being</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">whatever it is depending on the system</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">so if you&#39;re keeping track pluto is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">a planet</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">mesentery is an organ the appendix is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">not vestigial and junk dna does a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">really cool stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">yeah i wish you hadn&#39;t put pluto on that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">list all right i&#39;m taking pluto off the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">list</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">even though it was the taking it off the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">list that put it on this list</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">all right so are we there we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">all right so uh we had another topic</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">in the realm of complex systems which i</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">this time since i screwed it up badly</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">in the last instance i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.200" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s true um</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">we were speaking and don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">fleeing from your seats as i raised this</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">issue we were speaking of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">a certain set of technical failures that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:02.800" style="s2">happen in our system</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:03.440" style="s2">while portland was inundated by smoke</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">from our</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.440" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">fires and i set this in motion as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">of tech which is stupid you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:10.560" style="s2">about the tech i don&#39;t care very much</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">about the tech</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.560" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">i care about it in as much as it allows</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">us to do the podcast and not much beyond</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">that however</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">the tech allows us to understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:24.880" style="s2">how you can dive into</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">a complex system that you will by</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.880" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">definition not know very much about</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">and make progress with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">understanding how it works</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">now i want to catch people up to where</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">we were because some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:38.319" style="s2">things came to light</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">after our last discussion on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.319" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">about this topic so</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:43.599" style="s2">you will recall we had a problem where</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">five</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.599" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">cameras of several different kinds began</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:49.040" style="s2">to screw up in</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">almost the identical way where they</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.040" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">would fail to send signal to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">and there would be a drop the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">problem was that zach and i spent many</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">hours testing</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">every conceivable reason that our system</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:03.440" style="s2">could be failing and we falsified</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">virtually</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.440" end="00:44:07.599" style="s2">every hypothesis that was available to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">us the only one left over</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">was interference but there was no</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">obvious source for the interference</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">and so we were puzzling over what could</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">possibly be interfering</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:23.599" style="s2">with the cameras now we hypothesize that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:26.160" style="s2">it might be</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.599" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">radiation liberated by the fires</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.160" end="00:44:29.280" style="s2">radiation that might have been lodged in</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:33.119" style="s2">those forests</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.280" end="00:44:35.440" style="s2">through nuclear meltdowns in fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.119" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">the fallout did fall in the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.440" end="00:44:38.079" style="s2">northwest got incorporated into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">trees when the trees burned it got</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.079" end="00:44:40.960" style="s2">liberated</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">and maybe those radioactive decay events</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.960" end="00:44:43.760" style="s2">and the smoke around</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">us were interfering with the cameras</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.760" end="00:44:47.119" style="s2">that was the hypothesis on the table</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">and it was the only thing that seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.119" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">explain it many of you</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">did some calculations on the actual</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">errors and you told us</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">that you believed that it was a mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">that something had</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">uh adjusted the frame rate of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">cameras relative to the computer so they</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">were slightly off because the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:11.839" style="s2">drops were regular right</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">and we falsified that hypothesis because</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.839" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">first of all nothing in the settings had</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">changed second of all when the smoke</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">went away the problem cured itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">without us</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">resetting anything and we could swap in</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:22.560" style="s2">a totally different computer</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">and the problems still happen so there</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.560" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">was no place for a mismatch to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">gotten in the system and it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:30.319" style="s2">have cured itself if it had been one</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:31.599" style="s2">however there was something important in</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.319" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">that observation</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.599" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">what emerged as a result of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.960" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">was something we did not anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">which does actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">involve radiation but not in the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">that we had proposed it</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">so the observation is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">many devices as a result of the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">to miniaturize components the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">quartz crystals that used to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">regularly used to create a</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">time signal in things like watches and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">have been replaced by a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">of component that i&#39;d never heard of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:07.359" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:09.119" style="s2">mems m-e-m-s and these components</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.359" end="00:46:10.720" style="s2">keep time in a different way it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:13.520" style="s2">quartz crystal it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.720" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">something like a tuning fork a nano</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.520" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">tuning fork embedded in a little chip</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">and you realize this sounds completely</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">implausible hey zach</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">you want to put that electron micrograph</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:26.319" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">okay so here is an electron micrograph</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.319" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">of the inside of a mems</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:32.079" style="s2">chip which is now the time keeper on</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:34.960" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.079" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">electronics that have had pressure to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.960" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">shrunk down to a smaller size</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">um now is there can you point to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">the tuning fork is it the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">ends uh i believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">yeah i believe it is the end and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">kind of have two railway lines</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.000" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">but you know i&#39;m no expert on this thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">and in fact this micrograph</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">comes from the guy whose video uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.720" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">alerted me to this um who actually took</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">a chip and basically sanded it down</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">one layer at a time to reveal how it</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">and so he happened to have an electron</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">microscope and he sanded it down one</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">layer at a time and anyway to make a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">long story short</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">these chips have to be made in such a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">way that leaves the tuning fork</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">able to vibrate right but in order to</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:23.760" style="s2">build them</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">up they have to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.760" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">you may have encountered in 3d printing</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:29.839" style="s2">sometimes a part</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">has extra stuff that needs to be printed</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.839" end="00:47:33.760" style="s2">in order to support some piece and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">that stuff gets cut out</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.760" end="00:47:37.440" style="s2">so it has some of that they dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:39.280" style="s2">away something that would interfere with</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.440" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">the functioning of these tuning forks</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">but to make a long story short that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">that these chips are permeable</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">to very tiny molecules</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">and what appears to have happened is</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">helium is small enough to invade these</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">chips which was discovered</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">when a set of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">i believe it was iphones that were in</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:07.359" style="s2">proximity to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">an mri machine suddenly all died</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.359" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">right the mri machine involves a certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">amount of helium</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">and so the long and short of this story</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">so i</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">i know where this is going but i have</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">not yet heard in your story</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">how helium gets into our story</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:27.200" style="s2">okay so first of all we don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">answer there are two possible ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.200" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">but helium is very light it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">uh rise in the atmosphere so there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">a lot of it down here on earth</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">that which is down here on earth is all</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:40.000" style="s2">the result of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">radioactive decay that is to say heavier</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.000" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">elements decay</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">into lighter elements and one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">very frequently helium so</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">uranium decay creates helium okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">so the among other things yes among</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">other things right</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">helium is one of the things it creates</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.559" style="s2">so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">emerging hypothesis here is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.559" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">radioactive decay</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">of one kind or another and there are two</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">possible sources in this case</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">liberated helium which was trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:10.240" style="s2">our sealed up house</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">and that helium invaded these chips</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.240" end="00:49:14.559" style="s2">causing them to vibrate at a different</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">rate in the same way that helium causes</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.559" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">your vocal cords to vibrate</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">at a different rate if you inhale it now</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:22.880" style="s2">our house was really so well sealed that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">it trapped helium</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.880" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">uh i mean it can&#39;t have been we had we</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">had air exchange</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:31.680" style="s2">we did so a it takes very little helium</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">to do this you would think it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.680" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">lot it takes very little</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:36.880" style="s2">okay so okay let&#39;s talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">about the two possible sources of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">helium</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">one is radioactivity in the smoke and</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">there is radioactivity in the smoke</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.599" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">irrespective of whether</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">there have been meltdowns meltdowns</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">could exacerbate it</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">but it could be that a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">helium was getting into the house</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">where a certain amount of uh uranium was</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">getting into the house</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:58.240" style="s2">decaying liberating helium which invaded</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.559" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">the chips which caused them to vibrate</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.240" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">very slightly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">which is the reason that people</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">calculated that there was a frame rate</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:05.040" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:06.800" style="s2">that didn&#39;t involve us miss setting</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.040" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">something or resetting it</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.800" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">it involved the chips vibrating at just</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">the wrong frequency so that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">regularly hiccuped right so smoke is one</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:19.599" style="s2">uh way and the other way is that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">this is plausible here in portland</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">there is enough uranium in our rocks</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:25.920" style="s2">that it could</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">have it could be decaying all the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.920" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">underneath the building</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:30.319" style="s2">and something about our behavior in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.319" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">resulted in it being trapped now i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:35.359" style="s2">that&#39;s unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">i would lean strongly against that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.359" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">hypothesis because in the winter we</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">it was smoke related and so here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">i think happened</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:50.559" style="s2">this studio is over the garage</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">right the garage was regularly opened</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.559" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">and invaded by smoke</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">during the event so we open the garage</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">smoke floods in close the garage</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">whatever decay happens happens</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">helium migrates up through the floor of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.359" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">the studio</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">messes up the cameras lo and behold when</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">the smoke goes away problem clears</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:13.839" style="s2">up so</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">the long and short of this and um you</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">heather and i were both a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">thrown by people not being</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">some people not being so interested in</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">this discussion because to us this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">just a complex system and it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">great place to train your brain well so</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">what i will say is you&#39;re now talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">about our conversation about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">whatever it was two three</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">episodes ago right yeah um i</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">am less driven to be thinking about and</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:44.000" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">uh hypotheses about complex systems that</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.000" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">are entirely abiotic</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s a fairly gender</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">typical interest actually right you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">i&#39;m more interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">not so much the people but the but the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:57.200" style="s2">but the non-human animal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">and uh and you know those of you with y</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">chromosomes are more likely to be more</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">interested in the stuff that are there</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">more things even you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">even a biologist um so the particulars</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">don&#39;t really intrigue me i don&#39;t spend</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:10.480" style="s2">time at night thinking about them but i</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">do spend time at night thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.480" end="00:52:15.440" style="s2">things like mesentery so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">that&#39;s my weird you know interests um</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.440" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">but the conversation that we had uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">whatever it was two three four episodes</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:24.079" style="s2">struck me as exactly the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">conversation regardless of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.079" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">particular topic</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">uh that we would be able to have in</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">long-term discussion with students in</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">our classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">because we were exploring ideas</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">hypotheses predictions</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:38.000" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">that i hope for us to be able to do more</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.000" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">of here</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">as when if</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">the world in any way normalizes and uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.880" end="00:52:49.920" style="s2">we can look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">uh to actually trying to build something</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.920" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">new and good as opposed to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:57.760" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen next well i agree</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:53:01.119" style="s2">with this of course i would just add</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">one thing on top of it which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.119" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a question of where you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:07.359" style="s2">are going to train your mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">to do certain things and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.359" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">problem with biology is</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:16.400" style="s2">the there&#39;s almost nothing in biology so</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">simple that you can really understand it</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.400" end="00:53:20.720" style="s2">fully</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:23.040" style="s2">and that means that we&#39;re all dropped in</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.720" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">at some level and we have a very scatter</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.040" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">shot</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">understanding of some things and black</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">boxes elsewhere and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:32.480" style="s2">things that are black boxes for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a great place to train</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.480" end="00:53:34.800" style="s2">yourself to do the work that makes you a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.800" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">good biologist so one of the things i</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">discovered</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">in my dissertation work which was on</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">biological trade-offs that was what i</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">ended up</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">doing my dissertation on was that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">things that i had</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">gotten involved in that were complex but</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">very complex that i was involved in for</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">reasons that had nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">biology or theory or anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">turned out to be very useful models so</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">things like the evolution of the bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">a flight of of human flight right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">aviation turns out airplanes are simpler</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:09.359" style="s2">than you think and there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">aspects in which they mirror biological</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.359" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">i mean not accidentally in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.839" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">wright brothers were inspired by the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">flight of birds</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">and the flight of toys that mimic birds</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">and things like this</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">but you know cameras also which have now</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">gotten so freaking</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:28.400" style="s2">complicated that you can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">understand them in detail but</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.400" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">there was something about learning to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:35.520" style="s2">shoot</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">uh a you know a manual camera</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.520" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">that has trade-offs written into them in</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:40.799" style="s2">a way that they become second nature to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.799" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">so you know one of the things that uh i</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">ended up realizing in my dissertation</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">work was that when we say trade-off we</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">mean one of two different things and one</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">and this is very well um</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:58.880" style="s2">this is very well mirrored in in cameras</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">so for example a bigger lens collects</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.880" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">more light right that&#39;s an inescapable</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:07.599" style="s2">relationship right um on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">if you have an amount of light coming</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.599" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">into the camera and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:12.799" style="s2">proper to make a good exposure you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">play games</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.799" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">with you know increasing the shutter</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">speed um</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">and increasing the size of the aperture</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">uh in order to you know either freeze</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">motion</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">or get greater depth of field but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">stuck in this trade-off world until you</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:28.319" style="s2">can supplement the light at which point</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">the trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:32.640" style="s2">seems to vanish right you can get</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">shorter shutter speeds</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.640" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">and smaller aperture at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">i just thought it was a good discussion</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">and that what i</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:43.839" style="s2">what i think we both hope people will</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">get from this</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.839" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">is that any system that is uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">that you can sort out through</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:51.760" style="s2">hypothetical deductive method is a good</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:52.480" style="s2">place to train your mind to think about</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.760" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:55:55.760" style="s2">absolutely and i&#39;m reminded in your</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">discussion of cameras</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.760" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">you know what you say about cameras now</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">being so complicated that it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:01.839" style="s2">hard to do it but when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:03.599" style="s2">somewhat simpler you know somewhat less</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.839" end="00:56:05.200" style="s2">electronically based camera</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">um another thing that you would do</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.200" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re in the field for</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">instance in panama</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:10.160" style="s2">is if something stopped working</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">including you know you became the guy</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.160" end="00:56:12.559" style="s2">that other people when their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:13.280" style="s2">stopped working they would bring it to</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.559" end="00:56:15.599" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">and um you would take it apart and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">would put it back together and very</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">it would work and sometimes it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:20.960" style="s2">but you would have learned something and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">you might have</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.960" end="00:56:24.559" style="s2">saved you know the day for them and</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">their research um</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.559" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">cars are the same way you you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">you know a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.920" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">you know car interested guy nor was nor</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">was i at all</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:35.280" style="s2">um but cars also have become so</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">complicated that people can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.280" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">learn to work on their own modern cars</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:40.640" style="s2">but any car from</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:42.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know any car from probably the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.640" end="00:56:44.559" style="s2">90s or mid 90s or earlier</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.480" end="00:56:45.680" style="s2">almost you should be able to work on to</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.559" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">some degree and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.680" end="00:56:50.319" style="s2">learn and learn something real about</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">the universe that way and so i just want</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.319" end="00:56:55.520" style="s2">to pitch as i have before</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">um this book shop class as soul craft by</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.520" end="00:57:00.160" style="s2">matthew crawford</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:02.559" style="s2">um who is a you know phd</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.160" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">in economics from the chicago school</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.559" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">from university of chicago</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:07.920" style="s2">who left his life as a i don&#39;t know some</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.920" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">talking head consultant inside the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">beltway i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">um to open up a vintage motorcycle</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">repair shop in virginia where he finds</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">that his life has much more meaning</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:21.599" style="s2">because he&#39;s actually solving um he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.640" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">actually solving</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.599" end="00:57:25.119" style="s2">real problems you know problems come to</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:27.920" style="s2">him that are</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.119" end="00:57:29.520" style="s2">um maybe amorphous maybe not clear but</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">clearly there&#39;s a problem at the point</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.520" end="00:57:32.480" style="s2">that the motorcycle doesn&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">for instance to use just the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.480" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">example and if he makes it run he has</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">solved it</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">so there are real problems affecting</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">real people that&#39;s one aspect of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:43.359" style="s2">but maybe more interesting from my</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">perspective is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.359" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">you know that you are training your mind</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">and honing</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">your not just your intuition but your</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">insight and your analysis</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:54.720" style="s2">uh when you work on such a system and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:57.920" style="s2">make it better as a result</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.720" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">yeah absolutely um i want to adjust</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.920" end="00:58:01.520" style="s2">one thing you can work on a modern car</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:03.520" style="s2">and you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.520" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">you know play these games with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.520" end="00:58:06.160" style="s2">modern camera the problem is that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">fraction</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.160" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">that is in the black box has gotten so</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">great that you are</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">you know you are just a consumer of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">of the black box that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">there aren&#39;t other things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">if i can give one the same thing has</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">happened to just two statistics</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">you know the way that i taught</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">statistics which i did every time i</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">taught animal behavior was</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:30.480" style="s2">from the ground up and i didn&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:32.960" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.480" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">use the tests that they did not have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.960" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">real solid understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">the assumptions that went into them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">you know if there was</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">a chance at all that they could use a</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">chi square which there&#39;s a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">limited number of questions that you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">use a chi square on</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">but a goodness of fit test like that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">can literally do by hand</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:52.000" style="s2">all you need is the one chart of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">critical values to compare your answer</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.000" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">to and then you know whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a result that</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">um is unlikely to have happened by</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">chance and it&#39;s just so empowering not</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:02.480" style="s2">to have fed your</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">hard-earned data that you collected</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.480" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">after you imagined what the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">was the predictions were in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">experimental design where and everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">to not feed that into the black box that</p>

<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:19.359" style="s2">well i guess so</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">i guess the people who wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.359" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">software know what they&#39;re doing so it</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">speaks to two different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:28.960" style="s2">empowerment right</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:29.359" style="s2">one is how well does your brain work how</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.359" end="00:59:33.040" style="s2">programmed and primed is it based on</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">your ability to actually run a test that</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.040" end="00:59:36.000" style="s2">you understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:38.799" style="s2">but from the point of view of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.000" end="00:59:42.559" style="s2">careerist the ability to throw stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.799" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">into a program and try different tests</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.559" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">until something statistically</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:47.200" style="s2">significant pops out</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">and have no you know it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.200" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">curious if you broke the assumptions of</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:52.079" style="s2">the test</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:52.640" style="s2">well it&#39;s not who cares it&#39;s i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.079" end="00:59:55.040" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.640" end="00:59:56.880" style="s2">right and so the point is where did the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.040" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">replication crisis came from</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.880" end="01:00:00.559" style="s2">it came from a lot of people using very</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">powerful software that was all black</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.559" end="01:00:03.599" style="s2">boxed to them</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">in order to get results that were flashy</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.599" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">most of which were wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:08.160" style="s2">almost no biologist i&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.559" end="01:00:09.200" style="s2">understands the statistics that they use</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.160" end="01:00:12.319" style="s2">in their published work</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.200" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">right and so that has been</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.319" end="01:00:16.960" style="s2">a disaster and it is the result of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">complex a semi-complex system that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:21.520" style="s2">navigating it don&#39;t know anything about</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.359" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">so i wanted to point out um</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.520" end="01:00:25.359" style="s2">a couple of things about what happened</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:26.480" style="s2">as these cameras so my first camera was</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.359" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">a manual</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.480" end="01:00:31.040" style="s2">canon i was lucky enough my dad gave me</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:32.240" style="s2">an f1 which was this very high quality</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.040" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">but ancient</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.240" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2">uh manual camera and you could</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:40.559" style="s2">understand fully how it worked right</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:41.839" style="s2">at the point that digital cameras took</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.559" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.839" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">it changed things so we used to have two</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:47.280" style="s2">parameters that we would play off</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">against each other right you had shutter</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">speed and you had</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">aperture or the lens opening at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">point that digital cameras</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">became the norm suddenly you had a third</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">it took me a long time to even realize</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">that i had a third the third being</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:05.359" style="s2">sensitivity of the sensor right because</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:07.359" style="s2">it used to be that you would load your</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.359" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">camera with a kind of film you&#39;d load it</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.359" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">iso 100 or 400 or 800 or something and</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:13.359" style="s2">then you were just stuck with it and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">you were playing this trade-off game</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.359" end="01:01:17.680" style="s2">in a world where the sentence was vsa</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:19.680" style="s2">right what film was asa film was asa</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:20.960" style="s2">then it became iso and then that got</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.680" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">transported onto these</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.960" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">sensors but the whole point is my mind</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:28.319" style="s2">was built around a world</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:30.400" style="s2">of shutter speed and aperture in which i</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.319" end="01:01:33.040" style="s2">had before i ever you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.400" end="01:01:33.520" style="s2">walked out the door i had set in motion</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.040" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.520" end="01:01:36.799" style="s2">sensitivity and that was a fixed</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:37.520" style="s2">parameter so sometimes i would carry two</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.799" end="01:01:39.760" style="s2">cameras</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.520" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">to have two different speed films</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.760" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">because it was just</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">so fixed so i mean i think i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:45.760" style="s2">you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:48.079" style="s2">quite doing yourself a service here i</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.760" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">mean i know from us having packed</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.079" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">carefully you know many you know dozens</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:54.160" style="s2">of rolls of film packed them in these</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">lead bags so that they could go through</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.160" end="01:01:57.520" style="s2">airport security if they refused to let</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:01:58.240" style="s2">us have them hand checked and all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.520" end="01:02:00.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.240" end="01:02:02.640" style="s2">um that we would always travel with um</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.240" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">everything ranging from 64 to 1600</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.640" end="01:02:05.440" style="s2">uh when we were when we were shooting</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:06.319" style="s2">film in the 90s when we were in grad</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.440" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.319" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">and um it&#39;s not that you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:13.280" style="s2">constantly thinking about sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">it&#39;s that once you had a roll of 36</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.280" end="01:02:17.119" style="s2">um loaded you couldn&#39;t do anything about</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:20.640" style="s2">it right once once you were</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.119" end="01:02:22.720" style="s2">faced with the question of the the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">module that operates in the mind has</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.720" end="01:02:25.920" style="s2">this thing as a fixed parameter and it</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">knows very well how sensitive the film</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.920" end="01:02:28.160" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:30.240" style="s2">camera body is but it&#39;s just not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.160" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">not an option to play with it</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.240" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">right and so the thing is at the point</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:36.799" style="s2">that you can play with that parameter</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">very often what you want to do is pick</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.799" end="01:02:42.559" style="s2">your ideal shutter speed pick your</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">ideal aperture and then borrow from iso</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.559" end="01:02:46.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s a whole different mindset that</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:47.760" style="s2">takes you a while to get used to and now</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.240" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">we&#39;re getting into this</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.760" end="01:02:51.359" style="s2">new realm so this keeps happening right</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:54.559" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.359" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">digital did this then mirrorless changes</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.559" end="01:02:58.559" style="s2">a bunch of bunch of things where</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">suddenly you know it used to be that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.559" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">would hit a button in order to see what</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:04.000" style="s2">your depth of field looked like and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">lens would stop down and you could see</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.000" end="01:03:07.839" style="s2">what was going to be in focus</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:09.839" style="s2">where is that gone well you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.839" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">it because now the viewfinder has that</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.839" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">built in you&#39;re just seeing it all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:15.440" style="s2">time yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:16.640" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got to now erase that thing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.440" end="01:03:18.240" style="s2">wonder about because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.640" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s going to be automatic</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.240" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">to photographers who learn on something</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.079" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">and now we have algorithms that denoise</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.079" end="01:03:27.599" style="s2">things so now you can start borrowing in</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">a way that doesn&#39;t have a cost so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.599" end="01:03:30.799" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole series it&#39;s it&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.799" end="01:03:33.599" style="s2">more biological and therefore maybe less</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.599" end="01:03:39.760" style="s2">as a model um</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:41.440" style="s2">but more biological i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.760" end="01:03:45.119" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.440" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">um i&#39;d say if anything it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.119" end="01:03:48.960" style="s2">here&#39;s what i mean by more biological</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.880" end="01:03:52.400" style="s2">biology is so complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.960" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">right the number of ways in which um</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.400" end="01:03:56.240" style="s2">parameters can be made to interact the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">way it</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.240" end="01:03:59.599" style="s2">you know the trade-offs are inherent on</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">the inside but they can</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:03.520" style="s2">be obscured by the complexity of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.520" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">um the more complex an object is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:11.119" style="s2">more like biology it is and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:13.119" style="s2">my whole point about you know a simple</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.119" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">camera is a good way to train your brain</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.119" end="01:04:16.799" style="s2">to think about trade-offs becomes less</p>

<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:15.679" style="s2">but some of them</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.280" end="01:12:16.800" style="s2">are in the moment useful to them and</p>

<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:05.199" style="s2">yes well in that context i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:07.040" style="s2">important to recognize i&#39;m still not</p>

<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">pointed out just how broken the 1619</p>

<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:24.320" style="s2">he was very careful about it as i think</p>

<p begin="01:13:25.360" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">um but the duplicitous</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.880" end="01:13:35.360" style="s2">way in which the central claim</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:39.679" style="s2">of the 1619 project was</p>

<p begin="01:13:39.679" end="01:13:46.560" style="s2">that that recognition is not just</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">you know a massive lie of a kind that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.560" end="01:13:51.520" style="s2">beginning to move civilization</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:52.320" style="s2">but it was a massive lie in what was</p>

<p begin="01:13:52.320" end="01:13:55.679" style="s2">in our lifetime as the paper of record</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.040" end="01:13:58.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.679" end="01:14:02.000" style="s2">to have the paper of record whose clear</p>

<p begin="01:14:02.000" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">to the best of its ability what has</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:09.199" style="s2">happened and what it appears to mean</p>

<p begin="01:14:09.199" end="01:14:14.719" style="s2">clearly ideological and</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.400" end="01:14:16.239" style="s2">targeted at political power i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.719" end="01:14:18.000" style="s2">obviously not news to anyone that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.239" end="01:14:21.760" style="s2">new york times is now doing that</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.000" end="01:14:23.280" style="s2">but to see such a spectacular example</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.760" end="01:14:24.800" style="s2">which now the new york times has been</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.280" end="01:14:27.679" style="s2">forced to admit because</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.800" end="01:14:28.960" style="s2">apparently it couldn&#39;t sustain the lie</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.679" end="01:14:32.080" style="s2">is really</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.960" end="01:14:32.880" style="s2">stunning so maybe there&#39;s hope in that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.080" end="01:14:36.080" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.880" end="01:14:38.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve reached some place where</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.080" end="01:14:39.840" style="s2">there is a limit to what one can claim</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.159" end="01:14:43.280" style="s2">in this space and even though</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.840" end="01:14:43.600" style="s2">it has taken many many months to reveal</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.840" end="01:14:52.239" style="s2">important victory</p>

<p begin="01:15:46.640" end="01:15:51.120" style="s2">themselves are failures</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.320" end="01:15:52.239" style="s2">as opposed to it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot of us</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.120" end="01:15:54.080" style="s2">regardless of the immutable</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.239" end="01:15:55.840" style="s2">characteristics that we were born with</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.080" end="01:15:57.679" style="s2">who look at this project and say</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.840" end="01:15:59.920" style="s2">actually that&#39;s just that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.679" end="01:16:01.600" style="s2">bad piece of work that is a bad piece of</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.920" end="01:16:05.440" style="s2">work it&#39;s bad scholarship</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.600" end="01:16:07.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s divisive and you&#39;re lying</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.440" end="01:16:09.040" style="s2">and we&#39;re not going to stand for it has</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.360" end="01:16:12.159" style="s2">nothing to do with our mediocrity</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.040" end="01:16:12.480" style="s2">no right well i would say it even goes a</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.159" end="01:16:16.880" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.480" end="01:16:20.239" style="s2">beyond that because the whole idea of</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.880" end="01:16:23.760" style="s2">this country can only be understood</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.239" end="01:16:26.800" style="s2">as a from the first moment</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.760" end="01:16:29.040" style="s2">white supremacist project leaves</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.800" end="01:16:30.400" style="s2">no option but to dismantle it because</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.040" end="01:16:32.960" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to fix</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.400" end="01:16:35.360" style="s2">right and so this lie is so pernicious</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.960" end="01:16:37.280" style="s2">with respect to the actual nature</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.360" end="01:16:39.600" style="s2">of this country which yes screwed up</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.280" end="01:16:42.400" style="s2">from its first instantiation</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.600" end="01:16:42.880" style="s2">but did aspire to something better in</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.400" end="01:16:45.040" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.880" end="01:16:45.920" style="s2">aspired to exactly the thing that an</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.040" end="01:16:48.640" style="s2">honest broker</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.920" end="01:16:50.880" style="s2">would want us now to achieve right which</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.640" end="01:16:53.520" style="s2">is a truly equal society</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.880" end="01:16:55.280" style="s2">so anyway it was it was absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.520" end="01:16:56.719" style="s2">necessary to push back on this because</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.280" end="01:16:58.960" style="s2">the basic point is</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.719" end="01:17:00.560" style="s2">if you accept this narrative framing</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.960" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">then it necessitates</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.560" end="01:17:06.719" style="s2">a massive project of undoing</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:08.400" style="s2">that is not justified so you know this</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.719" end="01:17:10.080" style="s2">is about power and limited resources</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.400" end="01:17:13.840" style="s2">stupid as</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.080" end="01:17:15.360" style="s2">your advisor&#39;s file cabinet</p>
