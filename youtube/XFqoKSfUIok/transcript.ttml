<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:19.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.550" end="00:00:33.190" style="s2">okay might as well get going</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.369" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">welcome everybody I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.190" end="00:00:41.720" style="s2">familiar faces and names and a few new</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:45.260" style="s2">ones so that&#39;s good I think most of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.720" end="00:00:48.920" style="s2">are familiar by now with this term that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.260" end="00:00:52.640" style="s2">were kind of exploring called mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.920" end="00:00:54.290" style="s2">mediation or maybe medic diplomacy is</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:00:58.519" style="s2">another way to put it</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.290" end="00:00:59.900" style="s2">or just give kind of a brief definition</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.519" end="00:01:04.100" style="s2">of about how we use it and then we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.900" end="00:01:05.990" style="s2">into today&#39;s activities so so basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.100" end="00:01:08.930" style="s2">it&#39;s the term that that Peter coined a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.990" end="00:01:11.990" style="s2">while back in his article cultural war</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.930" end="00:01:15.560" style="s2">2.0 and and basically it just comes from</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.990" end="00:01:16.939" style="s2">this acknowledgement that especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.560" end="00:01:23.690" style="s2">online on the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.939" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of fractionating mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.690" end="00:01:31.610" style="s2">tribes is is what he called them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:34.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of kind of straw Manning</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.610" end="00:01:38.300" style="s2">and misunderstanding and dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.970" end="00:01:40.430" style="s2">among them and the idea of mediation is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.300" end="00:01:43.010" style="s2">that well you know if there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.430" end="00:01:45.140" style="s2">kind of a networked alternative or this</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.010" end="00:01:47.180" style="s2">networked collective intelligence there</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.140" end="00:01:50.720" style="s2">needs to be a better way to transmit</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.180" end="00:01:53.150" style="s2">information both information and empathy</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:55.940" style="s2">across these different groups that might</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.150" end="00:01:58.070" style="s2">not really understand each other and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.940" end="00:02:00.729" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s this idea that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.070" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">playing with for the last few weeks I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.729" end="00:02:06.350" style="s2">think Peter just posted yeah he posted a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:08.659" style="s2">spreadsheet from two years ago where he</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.350" end="00:02:10.789" style="s2">mapped out many of these meta tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.659" end="00:02:13.129" style="s2">so if you&#39;re interested in that I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.789" end="00:02:16.220" style="s2">it&#39;s evolved and morphed quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.129" end="00:02:18.590" style="s2">from there and I think we&#39;ve had about</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.220" end="00:02:21.890" style="s2">four or five of these so far and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.590" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">basically we they&#39;ve been different each</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.890" end="00:02:26.840" style="s2">time and it seems like we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:29.090" style="s2">gotten into a pattern of having a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.840" end="00:02:31.670" style="s2">session where we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.090" end="00:02:34.849" style="s2">about you know the concept itself a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.670" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">session where we talk about actual kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.849" end="00:02:40.489" style="s2">of ideologies you can say or mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:42.530" style="s2">tribes that are in tension and talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.489" end="00:02:45.410" style="s2">about you know how can we facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.530" end="00:02:46.910" style="s2">better dialogue between them we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.410" end="00:02:48.980" style="s2">sessions where we do more of an internal</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.910" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">like what is the actual cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.980" end="00:02:55.510" style="s2">dissonance going on inside of you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:58.849" style="s2">how might that be related to perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.510" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">having multiple kind of conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.849" end="00:03:02.299" style="s2">memes in your own mind right and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:04.220" style="s2">connecting it to a more personal level</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.299" end="00:03:05.870" style="s2">and then we have sessions with us that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.220" end="00:03:08.870" style="s2">very meta that&#39;s talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.870" end="00:03:10.040" style="s2">process itself so that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.870" end="00:03:12.709" style="s2">these are the patterns that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.040" end="00:03:18.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve been having so far I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.709" end="00:03:21.830" style="s2">today we could do more of the internal</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.160" end="00:03:23.870" style="s2">more of an internal session where and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.830" end="00:03:25.310" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna open it up to everybody pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.870" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">soon we&#39;re not gonna have this extended</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.310" end="00:03:28.940" style="s2">dialogue Jim Pete Peter and Jared I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:31.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you guys a chance to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.940" end="00:03:35.060" style="s2">but I&#39;d like to open it up pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.310" end="00:03:37.130" style="s2">quickly but I&#39;d like to if if we can I</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.060" end="00:03:43.130" style="s2">just want to give people a space to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.130" end="00:03:45.500" style="s2">express parts of yourself that feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.130" end="00:03:48.019" style="s2">conflicted with different ideas or you</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.500" end="00:03:50.180" style="s2">know you see messaging from I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.019" end="00:03:56.269" style="s2">from say I&#39;m just gonna give a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.180" end="00:03:58.459" style="s2">examples from from say the techno</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.269" end="00:04:01.730" style="s2">utopians for example and it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.459" end="00:04:05.660" style="s2">you see messages from the Eco a pop you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.730" end="00:04:11.180" style="s2">know apocalypse apocalypse seep does oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.660" end="00:04:13.730" style="s2">my god what is the term anyway you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:15.590" style="s2">what I mean and and there&#39;s this rich</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.730" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">tension there where you feel pulled in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.590" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">both directions and the end doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:20.570" style="s2">really make sense so it&#39;d be fun to kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:23.210" style="s2">of get into that today and and really</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.570" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">you know help help each other diagnose</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.210" end="00:04:28.070" style="s2">our own internal cognitive dissonance as</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:31.960" style="s2">related to these kind of external</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.070" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">mimetic movements that are out there I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.960" end="00:04:38.599" style="s2">think last time we did this and it got</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:40.789" style="s2">more personal like more I feel tension</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.599" end="00:04:41.840" style="s2">between being productive and enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.789" end="00:04:42.129" style="s2">life or something like that but this</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.840" end="00:04:43.929" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.129" end="00:04:47.619" style="s2">I&#39;d like to connect it explicitly if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.929" end="00:04:49.809" style="s2">can to these kind of external ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.619" end="00:04:51.729" style="s2">are creating distance within yourself so</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.809" end="00:04:56.229" style="s2">if we can kind of occupy that middle</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.729" end="00:04:59.769" style="s2">space so not not so personal like you</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.229" end="00:05:01.599" style="s2">know my own you know I mean it&#39;s all a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.769" end="00:05:03.339" style="s2">continuum how I see it but if we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.599" end="00:05:04.719" style="s2">kind of occupy that middle space that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.339" end="00:05:06.519" style="s2">would be great I don&#39;t know Peter and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.719" end="00:05:09.330" style="s2">Jared before you started you guys have</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.519" end="00:05:11.949" style="s2">anything you want to want to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.330" end="00:05:14.469" style="s2">just a desire for me not to talk that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.949" end="00:05:16.599" style="s2">much this time and I really like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.469" end="00:05:17.830" style="s2">idea of just feeling into the attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.599" end="00:05:20.259" style="s2">that people are experiencing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.830" end="00:05:21.490" style="s2">different sort of memes or felt senses I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.259" end="00:05:27.509" style="s2">think that&#39;s pretty it pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.490" end="00:05:32.740" style="s2">interesting cool Jerry you anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.509" end="00:05:35.469" style="s2">nothing all right so I want to give the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.740" end="00:05:38.110" style="s2">floor I want to open it up well first</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.469" end="00:05:39.849" style="s2">before we before we be open it up in</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.110" end="00:05:41.559" style="s2">that way is there anybody who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.849" end="00:05:44.229" style="s2">confused or like what the heck are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.559" end="00:05:46.419" style="s2">talking about let&#39;s let&#39;s just clear up</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.229" end="00:05:49.689" style="s2">any you know if you&#39;re confused about</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.419" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">any other terms I use if you&#39;re confused</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.689" end="00:05:55.769" style="s2">about what I was proposing let&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:55.769" style="s2">that up right away before we get started</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.459" end="00:06:05.050" style="s2">Eko what okay I meant you know so</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.919" end="00:06:09.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a general there&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.050" end="00:06:12.309" style="s2">paradigm that says basically you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.399" end="00:06:14.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone past our our ecological</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.309" end="00:06:16.329" style="s2">thresholds and we&#39;re all screwed and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.159" end="00:06:18.759" style="s2">basically humanity&#39;s on the pre of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.329" end="00:06:20.829" style="s2">collapse and maybe a few of us survive</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.759" end="00:06:23.289" style="s2">if if we get involved with permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.829" end="00:06:24.819" style="s2">and stuff like that and I&#39;m and and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.289" end="00:06:28.389" style="s2">to be clear I have a foot in that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.819" end="00:06:30.789" style="s2">that in that camp and that&#39;s and I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.389" end="00:06:35.169" style="s2">just comparing contrasting that to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.789" end="00:06:36.759" style="s2">more eco eco or techno optimists who say</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.169" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">well you know what solve the climate</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.759" end="00:06:41.050" style="s2">crisis and about iversity crisis and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:43.149" style="s2">of these things through technology and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.050" end="00:06:44.740" style="s2">we&#39;ll be fine don&#39;t worry about it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.149" end="00:06:48.219" style="s2">maybe like you know the the critical</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.740" end="00:06:51.819" style="s2">rationalist David Deutsch Ian&#39;s are in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.219" end="00:06:54.180" style="s2">this camp for example so that that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.819" end="00:06:54.180" style="s2">just an example</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">all right so anybody like to offer to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.910" end="00:07:06.830" style="s2">first and maybe I&#39;ll just ask one</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:11.030" style="s2">questions jacent so we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.830" end="00:07:13.070" style="s2">anybody who has these feeling attention</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.030" end="00:07:14.840" style="s2">between 2:00 and themselves or comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.070" end="00:07:18.860" style="s2">hard comes from one and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.840" end="00:07:21.620" style="s2">understand the other or is it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.860" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">propose the former but but the latter</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.620" end="00:07:27.470" style="s2">could work as well so so maybe ok so</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:29.240" style="s2">let&#39;s open this up a little bit so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.470" end="00:07:32.180" style="s2">seems like we&#39;re proposing as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.240" end="00:07:34.190" style="s2">alternative option is that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.180" end="00:07:35.480" style="s2">generally have a certain sensibility way</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.190" end="00:07:37.670" style="s2">of viewing the world and there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.480" end="00:07:38.930" style="s2">sensibility that is kind of strange you</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.670" end="00:07:41.090" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand it maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.930" end="00:07:44.330" style="s2">little bit intriguing you know maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.090" end="00:07:45.620" style="s2">seems a little bit like like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.330" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">really clear blind spots but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.620" end="00:07:48.170" style="s2">still something about it that you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:57.710" style="s2">to explore so that&#39;s an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.170" end="00:08:00.680" style="s2">option yeah sure ok don&#39;t make me call</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.710" end="00:08:02.750" style="s2">on people dude do we want to stick</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.680" end="00:08:04.730" style="s2">strictly to the list and the spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.750" end="00:08:06.380" style="s2">or we don&#39;t know it can be it could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.730" end="00:08:09.650" style="s2">anything that you&#39;ve identified you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.380" end="00:08:13.220" style="s2">use a list okay I mean I think within</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.650" end="00:08:13.910" style="s2">myself of like maybe say like New</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.220" end="00:08:16.640" style="s2">Atheists</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.910" end="00:08:19.670" style="s2">and also I have this desire to like go</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.640" end="00:08:22.700" style="s2">back and revitalize my like Christian</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.670" end="00:08:24.980" style="s2">heritage and there&#39;s kind of a tension</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.700" end="00:08:26.930" style="s2">there I keep revisiting it and then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.980" end="00:08:29.030" style="s2">lose interest again and then I gain</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.930" end="00:08:32.990" style="s2">interest again and ice I can&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.030" end="00:08:36.229" style="s2">seem to come to a conclusion about it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.990" end="00:08:38.390" style="s2">it is it is it more the instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.229" end="00:08:42.380" style="s2">components of of the Christian faith</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.390" end="00:08:44.990" style="s2">like the the community the ritual or is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.380" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">there part of belief structure about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.990" end="00:08:48.080" style="s2">actual claim the Christianity that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:52.040" style="s2">you&#39;re still you still haven&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">rejected no I well I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.040" end="00:08:56.810" style="s2">like I mean I like fully rejected it</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:09:00.920" style="s2">pretty much with exception of some some</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.810" end="00:09:03.230" style="s2">values but I think I have an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.920" end="00:09:05.540" style="s2">maybe on an emotional level like I feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.230" end="00:09:07.730" style="s2">like I want to reconnect with it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.540" end="00:09:08.330" style="s2">such a big part of my upbringing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.730" end="00:09:10.490" style="s2">every</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.330" end="00:09:12.590" style="s2">and I feel like maybe to leave it behind</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.490" end="00:09:15.770" style="s2">is almost like leaving behind part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.590" end="00:09:18.290" style="s2">myself like very emotionally significant</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.770" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">metaphors and I would like he claim them</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.290" end="00:09:22.670" style="s2">in some way and yet another part of me</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:24.440" style="s2">is like gosh there&#39;s so much horrific</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.670" end="00:09:26.780" style="s2">stuff in the Bible I just don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.440" end="00:09:29.650" style="s2">want to have anything to do with it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.780" end="00:09:32.930" style="s2">so does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.650" end="00:09:34.520" style="s2">yeah it makes sense to me I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.930" end="00:09:41.950" style="s2">if anybody else has thoughts about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.520" end="00:09:45.660" style="s2">I guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.950" end="00:09:45.660" style="s2">one question would be so there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.200" end="00:09:52.780" style="s2">do you feel feel like you spend more</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.000" end="00:09:54.970" style="s2">time in a kind of confused state of how</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.780" end="00:09:57.520" style="s2">they relate or a conflicted state in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.970" end="00:09:59.500" style="s2">way that in the way that they are in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.520" end="00:10:03.550" style="s2">conflict or that they don&#39;t match or</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.500" end="00:10:06.040" style="s2">something like that I think most of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.550" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">time I&#39;m just in the state of ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.040" end="00:10:10.930" style="s2">you know but then I noticed that I go</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:16.210" style="s2">back to it and then I kind of get more</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.930" end="00:10:18.040" style="s2">into the confused state well yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.210" end="00:10:21.450" style="s2">maybe I am just in an ongoing condition</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.040" end="00:10:21.450" style="s2">you stay and maybe that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.690" end="00:10:27.490" style="s2">saying you were to reject the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.210" end="00:10:30.490" style="s2">metaphysical claims Christianity but but</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.490" end="00:10:33.670" style="s2">acknowledge that that religion in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.490" end="00:10:36.400" style="s2">general has evolved it&#39;s kind of a you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.670" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">know it was a cultural evolution and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.400" end="00:10:40.030" style="s2">a lot of the myths and the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:43.270" style="s2">contained a lot of useful information</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.030" end="00:10:44.520" style="s2">for for cultural evolution and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.270" end="00:10:48.040" style="s2">those are still valuable I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.520" end="00:10:48.760" style="s2">what if that statement would resonate</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.040" end="00:10:53.500" style="s2">with you at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.760" end="00:10:55.630" style="s2">definitely resonates yeah yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.500" end="00:10:57.720" style="s2">questions like do you do you dig back</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.630" end="00:11:00.700" style="s2">into all that tradition and try to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.720" end="00:11:03.010" style="s2">actually like run with it or do you just</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.700" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">kind of keep it as like well yeah out</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.010" end="00:11:06.850" style="s2">there I know there is the Bible and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:08.770" style="s2">Christianity and like mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.850" end="00:11:10.960" style="s2">or you could like go and try to build</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.770" end="00:11:13.060" style="s2">community around it and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.960" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">the integral Christianity if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.060" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">thinking integral theory or whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.210" end="00:11:25.710" style="s2">about anybody else have thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:25.710" style="s2">that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.529" end="00:11:34.589" style="s2">wanted to say just a lot of what David</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.540" end="00:11:37.139" style="s2">just said resonates with me cuz like I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.589" end="00:11:41.759" style="s2">you know my my heritage is Christian and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.139" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">a lot of my community the people I hold</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.759" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">dear are still very ensconced in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:56.430" style="s2">even system of belief and trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:12:01.230" style="s2">here with that community is is is it big</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.430" end="00:12:04.889" style="s2">like that&#39;s I very much want to go here</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.230" end="00:12:08.519" style="s2">with that the community I have even</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.889" end="00:12:11.819" style="s2">though for me like I sense I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.519" end="00:12:18.930" style="s2">similar place and that I don&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.819" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">that the metaphysical claims but I still</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.930" end="00:12:29.160" style="s2">it you know deep in my bones I feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:32.490" style="s2">Christian and so trying to reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.160" end="00:12:37.819" style="s2">those those two things this is quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.490" end="00:12:37.819" style="s2">interesting I want to think more about</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.839" end="00:12:44.870" style="s2">yeah where we&#39;re sort of my my where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.199" end="00:12:47.129" style="s2">at with that and how it might connect to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.870" end="00:12:51.110" style="s2">what you&#39;ve expressed but I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.129" end="00:12:52.980" style="s2">to say I relate to a lot of that mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.110" end="00:12:55.589" style="s2">yeah I just want to jump in quickly</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.980" end="00:12:58.740" style="s2">because I was baptized as an Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.589" end="00:13:00.059" style="s2">Christian and I just deeply resonate</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.740" end="00:13:00.750" style="s2">with that tradition I like everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.059" end="00:13:03.329" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.750" end="00:13:05.550" style="s2">and and then I&#39;m just like this weird</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.329" end="00:13:07.670" style="s2"> meta space where just like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.550" end="00:13:10.199" style="s2">just dancing with all these weird memes</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.670" end="00:13:13.290" style="s2">and there does feel like a tension there</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.199" end="00:13:15.329" style="s2">and it almost feels inauthentic in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.290" end="00:13:17.850" style="s2">sometimes but then it feels deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.329" end="00:13:25.949" style="s2">authentic just calling it out to so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.850" end="00:13:28.110" style="s2">have attention with that so for me one</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.949" end="00:13:32.040" style="s2">of the interesting things I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.110" end="00:13:34.920" style="s2">hearing coming up is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.040" end="00:13:40.189" style="s2">tension seems to be largely identified</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.920" end="00:13:42.250" style="s2">as a as a kind of uncomfortable kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.189" end="00:13:44.590" style="s2">uncertainty of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.250" end="00:13:46.060" style="s2">connections very very mental a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.590" end="00:13:48.190" style="s2">mental mismatch and so it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.060" end="00:13:49.570" style="s2">you know especially as a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.190" end="00:13:52.270" style="s2">thinkers here we&#39;re all could</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.570" end="00:13:55.810" style="s2">predominantly looking at things from</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.270" end="00:13:57.400" style="s2">kind of a rational perspective and when</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.810" end="00:13:59.530" style="s2">we use that rational toolkit to look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.400" end="00:14:02.260" style="s2">this the religious component of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.530" end="00:14:03.820" style="s2">lives there&#39;s there&#39;s like it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.260" end="00:14:05.800" style="s2">complete mismatch it seems in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.820" end="00:14:07.870" style="s2">because we spent so much time rationally</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.800" end="00:14:11.560" style="s2">disproving this and yet there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.870" end="00:14:14.050" style="s2">felt kind of emotive embodied quality to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.560" end="00:14:15.730" style="s2">the practice that seems to be that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.050" end="00:14:16.990" style="s2">don&#39;t want to we you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.730" end="00:14:18.370" style="s2">internally know that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.990" end="00:14:19.170" style="s2">there to hold on to or something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.370" end="00:14:24.790" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.170" end="00:14:27.970" style="s2">does that sound right ish direction I</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.790" end="00:14:31.810" style="s2">would say also story that&#39;s a big part</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.970" end="00:14:34.150" style="s2">for me mm-hmm what is there a particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.810" end="00:14:37.990" style="s2">story David and Christianity that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.150" end="00:14:40.840" style="s2">particularly resonates with you I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.990" end="00:14:43.000" style="s2">guess just having the story that someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.840" end="00:14:46.830" style="s2">sacrificed their life you know for</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.000" end="00:14:49.510" style="s2">Humanity is like sounds nice in some way</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.830" end="00:14:53.110" style="s2">it feels meaningful to me in some way</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.510" end="00:15:01.270" style="s2">that no other more rational system of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.110" end="00:15:04.180" style="s2">thought seems to quite provide I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.270" end="00:15:05.950" style="s2">you&#39;re just speaking for myself because</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.180" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">I also used to be really just as a part</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.950" end="00:15:11.200" style="s2">of the Baha&#39;i faith but kind of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:15.790" style="s2">know what I&#39;ve come to is is that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.200" end="00:15:19.570" style="s2">know in a way it is it is rational to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.790" end="00:15:21.550" style="s2">to lean in to these kind of mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.570" end="00:15:23.350" style="s2">you know that we resonate with and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.550" end="00:15:26.920" style="s2">can be you know that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.350" end="00:15:28.600" style="s2">particularly powerful one you know this</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.920" end="00:15:30.670" style="s2">idea of a savior dying for the sins of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.600" end="00:15:32.410" style="s2">humanity and then you know resurrect</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.670" end="00:15:34.780" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s incredibly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.410" end="00:15:36.400" style="s2">and I know there&#39;s like a st. Paul used</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.780" end="00:15:38.589" style="s2">like a tree metaphor like a seed</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.400" end="00:15:40.570" style="s2">breaking open and then it you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.589" end="00:15:42.390" style="s2">tree of the Spirit rising out of it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.570" end="00:15:46.120" style="s2">it&#39;s just like you know that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.390" end="00:15:49.390" style="s2">right and and I and I think that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.120" end="00:15:52.150" style="s2">know there&#39;s this really delicate place</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.390" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">where you can kind of maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.150" end="00:15:55.870" style="s2">skepticism of any of the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:57.640" style="s2">claims and one part</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.870" end="00:16:00.130" style="s2">you&#39;re being but then the other part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.640" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">your being kind of like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.130" end="00:16:06.190" style="s2">allow yourself to feel into these</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:10.150" style="s2">stories that are so rich and I really</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.190" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">you know are really you know have</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.150" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">contributed to how we&#39;ve gone to where</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:19.480" style="s2">we are right and I don&#39;t know I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:21.310" style="s2">personally think we are mythological</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.480" end="00:16:23.290" style="s2">creatures right and I don&#39;t know if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.310" end="00:16:25.210" style="s2">can ever get around that even if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.290" end="00:16:28.180" style="s2">think we can right and so it&#39;s how do</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.210" end="00:16:30.040" style="s2">you do it in a kind of conscious way or</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.180" end="00:16:31.650" style="s2">you know it in a meta if you could say I</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.040" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">met a modern way for me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.650" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of like this sense of sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:40.029" style="s2">of sincerity with it as well as a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.839" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">of kind of ironic distance right and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.029" end="00:16:46.750" style="s2">can you hold both of those at the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:49.029" style="s2">time yeah and sometimes I wish that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.750" end="00:16:51.070" style="s2">had just evolved my Christianity rather</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.029" end="00:16:54.550" style="s2">than completely breaking with it I feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.070" end="00:16:59.339" style="s2">like my separating myself somehow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.550" end="00:17:05.910" style="s2">hard for me to go back yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.339" end="00:17:08.589" style="s2">there&#39;s a guy Spears Nathan Spears that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.910" end="00:17:12.370" style="s2">he so we are interviewing a while back</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.589" end="00:17:14.829" style="s2">on our podcast but he was raised Baptist</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.370" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">Southern Baptist I believe and many kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.829" end="00:17:19.920" style="s2">of became atheist agnostic and and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">more recently he&#39;s become Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.920" end="00:17:26.199" style="s2">Orthodox Christian yeah Peter guys are</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:27.610" style="s2">winning men and he you should he might</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.199" end="00:17:30.130" style="s2">be a good person to talk to because he</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.610" end="00:17:33.490" style="s2">he has a very kind of nuanced take like</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.130" end="00:17:36.850" style="s2">he&#39;s very you know he very much occupies</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.490" end="00:17:39.370" style="s2">this this liminal space of you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.850" end="00:17:41.850" style="s2">accepting the claims of that faith but</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.370" end="00:17:46.059" style="s2">but in a very in a way that&#39;s very non</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.850" end="00:17:47.890" style="s2">dogmatic or fundamentalist yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.059" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">maybe maybe looking at you guys yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.890" end="00:17:52.120" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.020" end="00:17:54.250" style="s2">yeah and I was discussing with Nate</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.120" end="00:17:55.809" style="s2">about this he was on your podcast too so</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.250" end="00:17:59.860" style="s2">to plug that episode of the both end</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.809" end="00:18:02.950" style="s2">podcast with with Nate&#39;s BS and then him</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.860" end="00:18:05.260" style="s2">and I we both do the Jesus Prayer</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.950" end="00:18:06.850" style="s2">I don&#39;t do it consistently but it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.260" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">of like one of their their main</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.850" end="00:18:11.460" style="s2">spiritual cycle technologies</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:13.140" style="s2">technologies where you say this phrase</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.460" end="00:18:14.970" style="s2">Lord Jesus Christ son of God have mercy</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.140" end="00:18:17.309" style="s2">on me a sinner you just say that mantra</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.970" end="00:18:19.410" style="s2">over and over again but you first focus</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.309" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">on the words coming out of your mouth so</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.410" end="00:18:23.130" style="s2">you build like a relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.380" style="s2">felt sense of the words coming out then</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.130" end="00:18:26.970" style="s2">you focus on your mind it like the words</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.380" end="00:18:29.059" style="s2">like kind of conjuring up in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.970" end="00:18:31.410" style="s2">then you sink down to your heart and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.059" end="00:18:32.700" style="s2">then so you kind of focus then you start</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.410" end="00:18:33.930" style="s2">focusing on all three at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.700" end="00:18:35.970" style="s2">the word coming out of your mouth</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.930" end="00:18:37.710" style="s2">their mind and the heart until they</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.970" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">become like sort of fuse together and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.710" end="00:18:41.640" style="s2">when you do this often enough you just</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:44.130" style="s2">got like you get this crazy so mad</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.640" end="00:18:46.530" style="s2">experiences in your body but then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.130" end="00:18:48.360" style="s2">idea is just have really fused those</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.530" end="00:18:50.910" style="s2">three things together so when you speak</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.360" end="00:18:53.130" style="s2">you and you think you speak and think</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.910" end="00:18:54.600" style="s2">from your heart and then to me if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.130" end="00:19:01.700" style="s2">can kind of integrate that fully that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.600" end="00:19:01.700" style="s2">that&#39;s Christianity right there mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.090" end="00:19:09.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a few people putting</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">some things in the chat Hannah</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.510" end="00:19:15.540" style="s2">you you wrote something do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">do you want to bring it up or do you</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:39.260" style="s2">talk about anything yeah what do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.210" end="00:19:45.530" style="s2">want you want to read what you wrote and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.260" end="00:19:47.580" style="s2">we can we can respond to that sure I</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.530" end="00:19:51.990" style="s2">mentioned that I have the similar</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.580" end="00:19:53.970" style="s2">attention within sort of spiritual self</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.990" end="00:19:57.179" style="s2">and a rationalist self and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.970" end="00:19:59.370" style="s2">working with that for about two years</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.179" end="00:20:01.470" style="s2">now so I feel like I have a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.370" end="00:20:05.610" style="s2">handle on it but I might be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.470" end="00:20:08.790" style="s2">to others and I was also noting that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.610" end="00:20:11.309" style="s2">the queer community there is a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.790" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">discussion on you know people who were</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.309" end="00:20:17.760" style="s2">raised within religious tradition had</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:19.779" style="s2">varying degrees of acceptance of their</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.760" end="00:20:22.929" style="s2">identity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.779" end="00:20:27.879" style="s2">still have this desire to connect with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.929" end="00:20:31.929" style="s2">tradition whether it&#39;s from relation</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.879" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">with the divine or with community or</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.929" end="00:20:41.979" style="s2">with with values where there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:44.229" style="s2">conflict in between the beliefs from</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.979" end="00:20:46.840" style="s2">those tradition systems and their</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.229" end="00:20:49.869" style="s2">identity and how they can navigate that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.840" end="00:20:52.119" style="s2">tension I&#39;m not personally one of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.869" end="00:20:59.559" style="s2">people but I do think it&#39;s a very rich</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.119" end="00:21:01.659" style="s2">area of discussion and then finally I I</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.559" end="00:21:06.809" style="s2">found really interesting that the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.659" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">Peter describes the Jesus Prayer seemed</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.809" end="00:21:15.570" style="s2">in the way I interpreted it to be very</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:24.940" style="s2">similar to how I do a gratitude practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.570" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">you know that connection between sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.940" end="00:21:33.389" style="s2">an embodied place of sincerity and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:38.349" style="s2">meaningfulness resulting in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.389" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">somatic experience that sounded really</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.349" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">familiar thank you</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:57.040" style="s2">I&#39;d like to chicken please</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.230" end="00:22:03.590" style="s2">I hear I hear the phrase the first time</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.040" end="00:22:05.470" style="s2">spiritual versus Russia and for me there</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.590" end="00:22:10.520" style="s2">is no separation</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.470" end="00:22:16.130" style="s2">they married I know what Russian is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.520" end="00:22:19.309" style="s2">really because whatever I think which</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.130" end="00:22:30.980" style="s2">makes sense it has values so I believe</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.309" end="00:22:36.200" style="s2">in values like my god am i values like</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.980" end="00:22:38.710" style="s2">why why are you separate mister I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.200" end="00:22:41.660" style="s2">speak to that from my own experience I</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.710" end="00:22:45.620" style="s2">was just writing about this recently so</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.660" end="00:22:49.809" style="s2">it&#39;s very fresh on my mind one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.620" end="00:22:54.830" style="s2">practices that I do is energy work and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.809" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">when I started doing it one of the tools</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.830" end="00:23:01.309" style="s2">I used to learn it was colored cue cards</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:05.960" style="s2">I&#39;m touching ones with my eyes closed</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.309" end="00:23:08.809" style="s2">to see what sensations arise to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.960" end="00:23:10.730" style="s2">had a lot of resistance to using this</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.809" end="00:23:16.940" style="s2">tool to learn the practice and to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.730" end="00:23:19.820" style="s2">practice itself because the rationalists</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.940" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">tools that I had used to that point to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.820" end="00:23:26.900" style="s2">navigate life with a lot of doubt and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:28.460" style="s2">uncertainty from my anxiety held that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.900" end="00:23:30.380" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be able to sense different</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.460" end="00:23:35.179" style="s2">things from different colored cue cards</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.380" end="00:23:38.120" style="s2">and I had fears that I wouldn&#39;t sense</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.019" end="00:26:04.129" style="s2">justify that on its on its own merits or</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.059" end="00:26:08.690" style="s2">does it does it have to rely on some</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.129" end="00:26:12.889" style="s2">kind of some kind of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.690" end="00:26:15.019" style="s2">foundational belief the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.889" end="00:26:16.999" style="s2">stands out to me about rationalism I</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.019" end="00:26:20.299" style="s2">just think of all the branches of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.999" end="00:26:22.249" style="s2">mathematics that require a set of axioms</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.299" end="00:26:25.580" style="s2">to start with before you can prove</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.249" end="00:26:26.809" style="s2">anything here like rationalism is always</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.580" end="00:26:30.049" style="s2">like that you have to have a set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.809" end="00:26:31.970" style="s2">starting assumptions and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.049" end="00:26:33.739" style="s2">get those from something non rational</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.970" end="00:26:35.830" style="s2">presumably otherwise you you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.739" end="00:26:43.580" style="s2">rationalist Turtles all the way to here</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.830" end="00:26:46.489" style="s2">mm-hmm funny thing they were reporting</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.580" end="00:26:47.960" style="s2">that to here is that like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.489" end="00:26:51.830" style="s2">things that there&#39;s more religious</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.960" end="00:26:53.739" style="s2">sensibility and a more logical or</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.830" end="00:26:58.600" style="s2">rational or intellectual sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.739" end="00:27:02.869" style="s2">requires is some sort of leap of faith</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.600" end="00:27:05.210" style="s2">tensed trust in in being able to move</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.869" end="00:27:07.909" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.210" end="00:27:09.110" style="s2">and yet they both kind of are based off</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.909" end="00:27:12.770" style="s2">of something quite different one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.110" end="00:27:15.140" style="s2">them&#39;s you know quite nebulous and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.770" end="00:27:20.049" style="s2">more symbolic or archaic and then the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.140" end="00:27:20.049" style="s2">other one is more formed patterned and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.110" end="00:27:24.740" style="s2">and logical or sequential or something</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.610" end="00:27:26.360" style="s2">like that but yeah they do kind of share</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.740" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">the same quality they&#39;re both kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.360" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">being based on a foundation of trust so</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:39.409" style="s2">if we were to extend this out and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:42.140" style="s2">know as you know as aspiring mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.409" end="00:27:45.529" style="s2">mediators if our goal was to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.140" end="00:27:48.380" style="s2">between Christians or you know some</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.529" end="00:27:52.750" style="s2">other religion and and the less wronged</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.380" end="00:27:55.640" style="s2">rationalists for example I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.750" end="00:27:57.140" style="s2">where would we where do we start I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.640" end="00:27:58.520" style="s2">I know that&#39;s already been kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.140" end="00:28:01.309" style="s2">happening I know there&#39;s been kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.520" end="00:28:02.210" style="s2">exodus from some of the rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.309" end="00:28:04.130" style="s2">community there&#39;s like the post</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.210" end="00:28:07.429" style="s2">rationalist what they call them and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.130" end="00:28:10.970" style="s2">and they&#39;re kind of becoming religio</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.429" end="00:28:13.010" style="s2">curious again and you know and getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.970" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">into mythology and and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.010" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">things perhaps with you know it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:20.120" style="s2">from a different place than a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:21.799" style="s2">traditionalist but so it seemed that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.120" end="00:28:25.549" style="s2">seems to me that there&#39;s already some</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.799" end="00:28:28.850" style="s2">kind of mediation or integration of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.549" end="00:28:33.140" style="s2">where we&#39;ve come from into where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.850" end="00:28:41.720" style="s2">going but I&#39;m wondering if people have</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.140" end="00:28:45.130" style="s2">thoughts or thoughts about that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.720" end="00:28:45.130" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve been thinking about recently</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.789" end="00:28:55.210" style="s2">is how to take like we could take for</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.450" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">example what you mentioned Jason the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.210" end="00:29:00.890" style="s2">rationalist versus Christian if we were</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:07.700" style="s2">if I were trying to mediate between</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.890" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">those two groups I think my goal would</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.700" end="00:29:20.020" style="s2">be to get both sides to see the the role</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:20.020" style="s2">of the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.500" end="00:29:30.940" style="s2">as more fundamental than the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.640" end="00:29:36.070" style="s2">propositional so so so trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.940" end="00:29:40.530" style="s2">both sides to see this idea that the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.070" end="00:29:43.770" style="s2">way that we perceive depends upon the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.530" end="00:29:50.980" style="s2">the way in which we are participating in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.770" end="00:29:53.710" style="s2">the world and so I mean for both the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.980" end="00:29:56.350" style="s2">rationalist and the you know believing</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.710" end="00:29:58.600" style="s2">Christian there&#39;s this idea that truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.350" end="00:30:00.610" style="s2">with a capital T is you know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.600" end="00:30:03.100" style="s2">they&#39;re like both both I think would</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.610" end="00:30:07.240" style="s2">stake their you know would plant their</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.100" end="00:30:14.890" style="s2">flag in that that idea of truth with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.240" end="00:30:21.040" style="s2">capital T but then it seems like neither</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.890" end="00:30:28.600" style="s2">one typically recognizes the role that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.040" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">the process of the process of getting at</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.600" end="00:30:34.750" style="s2">truth with the capital T like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:40.690" style="s2">more fundamental than the the eventual</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.750" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">propositions that you may find there and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.690" end="00:30:49.720" style="s2">how to go about how to go about leading</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:52.660" style="s2">people into that recognition which I</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.720" end="00:30:55.419" style="s2">think it&#39;s very important when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.660" end="00:31:00.840" style="s2">emphasize the process of seeking truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.419" end="00:31:03.210" style="s2">over the the conclusions that you&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.840" end="00:31:05.260" style="s2">think that you&#39;ve already made</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.210" end="00:31:10.450" style="s2">well the rationalist might just say well</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.260" end="00:31:12.160" style="s2">is the scientific method or the Critical</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.450" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">rationalist would say we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.160" end="00:31:16.890" style="s2">hard to very explanations right good</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:19.390" style="s2">good explanations that are hard to bury</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.890" end="00:31:23.230" style="s2">meaning that if you could completely</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.390" end="00:31:26.530" style="s2">change the story like what David Deutsch</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.230" end="00:31:27.790" style="s2">argues is that you could you know among</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.530" end="00:31:30.040" style="s2">religions you have completely different</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.790" end="00:31:33.730" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.040" end="00:31:37.360" style="s2">and it kind of it&#39;s okay you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.730" end="00:31:39.640" style="s2">grand scheme of things you know but you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.360" end="00:31:42.190" style="s2">know for for a scientists if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.640" end="00:31:43.930" style="s2">explanation and you very significantly</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.190" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make predictions anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.930" end="00:31:48.430" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s totally useless and so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.110" style="s2">I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.430" end="00:31:57.430" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying I&#39;m wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.110" end="00:31:59.950" style="s2">have thoughts on that yeah just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.430" end="00:32:01.390" style="s2">question I&#39;m not the last piece that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.950" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">mentioned mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.390" end="00:32:09.450" style="s2">but I also just wanted to say that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.000" end="00:32:15.850" style="s2">agree with the way that Joe framed the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.450" end="00:32:20.890" style="s2">question meaning um putting focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.850" end="00:32:22.660" style="s2">process of getting to truth capital T is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.890" end="00:32:26.020" style="s2">an interesting way to put it but</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.660" end="00:32:28.930" style="s2">especially when I really like that in</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.020" end="00:32:34.270" style="s2">the stoah being a philosophical way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.930" end="00:32:36.910" style="s2">thinking as well stoicism itself and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.270" end="00:32:39.310" style="s2">this kind of culture that we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.910" end="00:32:41.980" style="s2">into where we&#39;re speaking from our own</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.310" end="00:32:44.170" style="s2">perspectives and seeing truth from our</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.980" end="00:32:45.580" style="s2">own sort of perspectives so the capital</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.170" end="00:32:50.110" style="s2">T bit is something that I personally</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.580" end="00:32:54.670" style="s2">have always wondered how to get to in</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.110" end="00:32:57.430" style="s2">our own personal process but with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.670" end="00:33:00.100" style="s2">said I wanted just clarity on what that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.430" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">last piece about scientists that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.100" end="00:33:06.340" style="s2">said was I think I just wasn&#39;t paying</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:08.290" style="s2">attention I was just I was just playing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.340" end="00:33:10.210" style="s2">devil&#39;s advocate that so you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.290" end="00:33:12.400" style="s2">about instead of focusing on what is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.210" end="00:33:15.460" style="s2">correct proposition what is the process</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.400" end="00:33:16.690" style="s2">and I was saying well if a hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.460" end="00:33:20.050" style="s2">rations here they might say well the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.690" end="00:33:24.760" style="s2">process is the scientific method so we</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.050" end="00:33:25.690" style="s2">already have the process and in each I</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.760" end="00:33:30.100" style="s2">was just I was just throwing that out</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.690" end="00:33:33.280" style="s2">there as you know how you know how would</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.100" end="00:33:37.180" style="s2">somebody how would somebody respond if</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.280" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">they were a mediator or I don&#39;t know no</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.180" end="00:33:43.690" style="s2">we&#39;re not to shut down the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:45.549" style="s2">I make sense thank you I really hi</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.690" end="00:33:47.259" style="s2">boys because I&#39;m speaking through fears</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.549" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s literally what it is which</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.259" end="00:33:55.929" style="s2">reminds me of um what Hannah said um</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:59.830" style="s2">because um I I relate to her talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.929" end="00:34:03.009" style="s2">about um I see her but you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.830" end="00:34:03.970" style="s2">talking about the energy work that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.009" end="00:34:09.429" style="s2">participate in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.970" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">um and seeing and I don&#39;t think I paid</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.429" end="00:34:16.290" style="s2">full attention to that either but I did</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:21.490" style="s2">pick up pieces about I&#39;m sensing</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.290" end="00:34:23.800" style="s2">something that is been true to you in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.490" end="00:34:27.460" style="s2">way I&#39;m you can clear you can clarify</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.800" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">that because you know I yesterday and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.460" end="00:34:33.609" style="s2">like coming from stories too because um</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:36.579" style="s2">that helps me ground so we castor day I</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.609" end="00:34:39.879" style="s2">was part of like a free styling session</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.579" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">and during the free styling session I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.879" end="00:34:44.679" style="s2">brought up the fact that I have like</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:46.510" style="s2">tarot cards on my desk that I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.679" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">to practice and so someone else was also</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.510" end="00:34:52.179" style="s2">like hey like I have a nice too but</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:55.540" style="s2">they&#39;re of animal spirits and then so II</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.179" end="00:35:01.660" style="s2">freestyled using those cards that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.540" end="00:35:07.869" style="s2">someone else had um so so so with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.660" end="00:35:11.500" style="s2">said I like the process although I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.869" end="00:35:16.630" style="s2">that there is value in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.500" end="00:35:19.960" style="s2">method um there are other processes or</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.630" end="00:35:23.410" style="s2">methods that can help with getting to</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.960" end="00:35:29.800" style="s2">the truth that people are seeking but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.410" end="00:35:34.180" style="s2">would also argue that there needs maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.800" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">to be care in the type of actions we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.180" end="00:35:40.230" style="s2">taking and decisions we&#39;re making to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:44.200" style="s2">come from like an ethical way of working</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.230" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">for whatever practical thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.200" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">working with</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.329" end="00:36:02.490" style="s2">okay can I jump in here hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.210" end="00:36:03.930" style="s2">so one of my one of my questions coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.490" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">into all of your sessions is how is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.930" end="00:36:07.890" style="s2">mimetic mediation different than a</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:10.050" style="s2">regular mediation and the way that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.890" end="00:36:11.730" style="s2">trained in a regular mediation and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.050" end="00:36:13.079" style="s2">said this was probably the hardest thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.730" end="00:36:15.240" style="s2">for me when I was going through the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.079" end="00:36:16.680" style="s2">training coming from like a philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.240" end="00:36:18.650" style="s2">kind of background where there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.680" end="00:36:21.510" style="s2">of focus on epistemology and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.650" end="00:36:22.859" style="s2">all my meat-eater teacher said get that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.510" end="00:36:24.329" style="s2"> out of here we don&#39;t focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.859" end="00:36:26.010" style="s2">at all we only focus on what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.329" end="00:36:28.710" style="s2">person&#39;s underlying values needs</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.010" end="00:36:30.420" style="s2">interests and identities are and we get</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.710" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">away from like what truth is and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.420" end="00:36:35.940" style="s2">saved that for the lawyers and judges in</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:37.950" style="s2">court and so I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.940" end="00:36:40.530" style="s2">framework applies in an emetic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.950" end="00:36:42.300" style="s2">but III do believe what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.530" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">Peter Bogosian Simon&#39;s latest book where</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.300" end="00:36:47.550" style="s2">he calls moral epistemology where under</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:50.369" style="s2">everyone&#39;s identity or meme that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.550" end="00:36:52.530" style="s2">your identity is entangled with there</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.369" end="00:36:53.880" style="s2">it&#39;s you hold that position because you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.530" end="00:36:55.950" style="s2">think that that makes you a good person</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.880" end="00:36:58.500" style="s2">right it is actually ultimately like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.950" end="00:36:59.579" style="s2">bedrock value or moral issue so my kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.500" end="00:37:01.770" style="s2">of framework for going into these</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.579" end="00:37:03.210" style="s2">conversations whether it&#39;s between the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.770" end="00:37:06.450" style="s2">religious person the atheist or</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.210" end="00:37:08.130" style="s2">political or whatever is try to drill</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.450" end="00:37:11.310" style="s2">down to what the person&#39;s values are and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.130" end="00:37:13.460" style="s2">the role that religion whatever plays in</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.310" end="00:37:16.109" style="s2">their life and then you can have some</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.460" end="00:37:17.609" style="s2">you know you can understand how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.109" end="00:37:20.430" style="s2">meaningful to the person or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.609" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">inflow or the how its valuable or or</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.430" end="00:37:24.990" style="s2">morally inspiring for you to hold those</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:26.760" style="s2">positions it&#39;s one of the check them</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.990" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">quickly this may be a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.760" end="00:37:33.060" style="s2">side but it just sparked when you were</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:34.740" style="s2">talking that so I have sort of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.060" end="00:37:37.079" style="s2">have a mediation background but I used</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.740" end="00:37:38.790" style="s2">to work with mediators and the unions</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.079" end="00:37:40.950" style="s2">and I&#39;ve seen that I see the mediation</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.790" end="00:37:42.990" style="s2">is an action and I do think like mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.950" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">mediation done right if there&#39;s stunned</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.990" end="00:37:47.670" style="s2">by a person&#39;s probably it looks exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:49.290" style="s2">the same as a regular mediator but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.670" end="00:37:50.670" style="s2">think the term or the me mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.290" end="00:37:52.440" style="s2">mediation is sort of like a strange</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.670" end="00:37:53.550" style="s2">attractor to people who want to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.440" end="00:37:58.950" style="s2">between different people who have</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.550" end="00:38:02.130" style="s2">different ideologies mm-hmm yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.950" end="00:38:04.230" style="s2">you it&#39;s a really good point is you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.130" end="00:38:06.840" style="s2">is the role of a mediator</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.230" end="00:38:08.970" style="s2">you know to establish truth with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.840" end="00:38:12.350" style="s2">capital T or a process of getting at</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.970" end="00:38:16.170" style="s2">truth and I&#39;m not sure I mean III think</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.350" end="00:38:19.109" style="s2">release for me my interest is really</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.170" end="00:38:21.330" style="s2">just just prompting constructive</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.109" end="00:38:24.480" style="s2">dialogue you know across these groups</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.330" end="00:38:27.270" style="s2">and and whatever you know whatever comes</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.480" end="00:38:28.710" style="s2">out of that is it&#39;s kind of for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.270" end="00:38:30.900" style="s2">kind of a second-order effect doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.710" end="00:38:33.780" style="s2">really you know as a mediator that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.900" end="00:38:35.700" style="s2">really my job is to establish you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.780" end="00:38:37.770" style="s2">okay we we come to a new set of truths</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.700" end="00:38:40.470" style="s2">that then that blends all of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.770" end="00:38:42.090" style="s2">everybody&#39;s truths into one single you</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.470" end="00:38:43.650" style="s2">know meta truth that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.090" end="00:38:47.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the role of a mediator I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.650" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s really just to to help facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.119" end="00:38:53.220" style="s2">to start the process of dialogue right</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:54.510" style="s2">and it might not even be a truth that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.220" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">their dialogue and about it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.510" end="00:39:01.380" style="s2">process a relationship building right</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:04.050" style="s2">where they&#39;re they&#39;re not you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.380" end="00:39:06.840" style="s2">more about building empathy and and also</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.050" end="00:39:10.080" style="s2">be you know developing the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.840" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">see other perspectives to Donella</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.310" end="00:39:21.720" style="s2">can think of it both as okay in one</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.750" end="00:39:30.060" style="s2">it&#39;s more about just improving</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.510" end="00:39:32.390" style="s2">communications so that you can you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.060" end="00:39:34.830" style="s2">you can collaborate for example in</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.830" end="00:39:38.130" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have to end up ever</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.119" end="00:39:39.630" style="s2">agreeing with each other right like</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.130" end="00:39:47.910" style="s2">that&#39;s not I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.630" end="00:39:49.260" style="s2">necessary right and I&#39;m curious so one</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.910" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">of the things starting to think of some</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.260" end="00:39:56.580" style="s2">of the unique qualities or aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:40:00.570" style="s2">the cinematic framing and part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.580" end="00:40:02.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like to Jason&#39;s point it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.570" end="00:40:05.250" style="s2">bit more long-term thing we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.160" end="00:40:08.540" style="s2">there&#39;s not any overt focus on</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.250" end="00:40:10.710" style="s2">resolution especially in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.540" end="00:40:13.140" style="s2">and the other thing here is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.710" end="00:40:16.190" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a cultural orientation</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.140" end="00:40:17.980" style="s2">rather than interpersonal I think and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.190" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">especially since</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.980" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">a lot of these mimetic conversations the</p>

<p begin="00:40:31.180" end="00:40:34.720" style="s2">feel they&#39;re speaking for a tribe rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.890" end="00:40:37.800" style="s2">than kind of defending their own own</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.720" end="00:40:41.320" style="s2">space and so my question to you would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.800" end="00:40:43.630" style="s2">you know with with the the formal</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.320" end="00:40:48.670" style="s2">mediation background how often do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.630" end="00:40:50.670" style="s2">feel like this is the the mediation is</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.670" end="00:40:52.990" style="s2">happening between tribes versus</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.670" end="00:40:54.430" style="s2">interpersonally and of course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.990" end="00:40:56.980" style="s2">both going to be present in every one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.430" end="00:41:00.250" style="s2">these exchanges but it seems like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.980" end="00:41:04.680" style="s2">mimetic war might be more a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.250" end="00:41:07.300" style="s2">more leaning on the tribal element here</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.680" end="00:41:09.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve never done a mediation between</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.300" end="00:41:10.900" style="s2">tribes everything is like I want to put</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.430" end="00:41:13.000" style="s2">my friends here and now yelling for my</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.900" end="00:41:14.380" style="s2">friends here so after you and let&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.000" end="00:41:16.300" style="s2">out an agreement and sign a contract</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.380" end="00:41:18.660" style="s2">super boring that&#39;s why I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.300" end="00:41:21.790" style="s2">I want something juicier and more epic</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.660" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">so like thanks for explaining to me I</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.790" end="00:41:25.660" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve kind of been you know locked</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:27.100" style="s2">into certain framework so I have to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.660" end="00:41:32.760" style="s2">magnetic mediation between regular</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.100" end="00:41:32.760" style="s2">mediation in the minivan</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.740" end="00:41:42.150" style="s2">well and one thing as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.450" end="00:41:44.080" style="s2">right here I think you know the other</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.150" end="00:41:46.300" style="s2">unfortunate thing is that the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.080" end="00:41:48.930" style="s2">tribes because it is a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.300" end="00:41:51.580" style="s2">about ideal ideology and philosophy a</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.930" end="00:41:54.820" style="s2">lot of these conversations really do end</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.580" end="00:41:57.940" style="s2">up in more of the intellectual duals</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.820" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">right or it&#39;s not really I&#39;m protecting</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.940" end="00:42:01.540" style="s2">my my thing where I want a certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:05.830" style="s2">outcome I&#39;m going to prove the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.540" end="00:42:08.320" style="s2">superiority of my ideas and and Jason as</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.830" end="00:42:12.520" style="s2">you were speaking you know we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.320" end="00:42:14.500" style="s2">to our hypothetical of the the critical</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.520" end="00:42:16.119" style="s2">rationalist versus the or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.500" end="00:42:20.950" style="s2">rationalist versus the the religious</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.119" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">minded one thing that I thought I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.950" end="00:42:24.280" style="s2">is important to do especially as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:30.550" style="s2">mediator is to always be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.280" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">sampling the the emotional disposition</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.550" end="00:42:35.790" style="s2">of the conversation and a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:38.350" style="s2">that&#39;s like for me it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.790" end="00:42:40.270" style="s2">calibrator to know where I need to give</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.350" end="00:42:41.950" style="s2">my effort so if so if I wanted it in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.270" end="00:42:44.500" style="s2">spectrum I&#39;m sensing a lot of hostility</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.950" end="00:42:47.110" style="s2">or defensive Mis from somebody I know</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.500" end="00:42:49.420" style="s2">I&#39;m probably gonna not I want to push or</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.110" end="00:42:51.370" style="s2">attack them direct their directly on and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.420" end="00:42:53.980" style="s2">in in that case I might try and find</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.370" end="00:42:56.320" style="s2">some sort of commonality or bring it</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.980" end="00:42:57.760" style="s2">back down to a interation inter inter</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.320" end="00:43:00.700" style="s2">personal thing to get to build some</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.760" end="00:43:03.310" style="s2">empathy and get back into the body and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.700" end="00:43:05.020" style="s2">to kind of you know put you put that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.310" end="00:43:06.460" style="s2">give it a chance to put themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.020" end="00:43:08.590" style="s2">another person&#39;s shoes or something like</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.460" end="00:43:10.600" style="s2">that but if everything&#39;s very cool heads</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.590" end="00:43:12.910" style="s2">then maybe sometimes this you know we</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.600" end="00:43:15.880" style="s2">could go live in the intellectual and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.910" end="00:43:17.560" style="s2">could say that you know Jason&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.880" end="00:43:18.610" style="s2">you know maybe the we can say hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.560" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of perennial philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.610" end="00:43:23.080" style="s2">people who think the religions do share</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.800" end="00:43:25.060" style="s2">an underlying epistemology and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.080" end="00:43:26.590" style="s2">just culturally different or something</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.060" end="00:43:27.850" style="s2">and then we could get into that we could</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.590" end="00:43:30.280" style="s2">stay there but the movement in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.850" end="00:43:34.900" style="s2">moment that the emotion the triggering</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.280" end="00:43:36.820" style="s2">as a Hansie and the meta modernists say</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.900" end="00:43:38.350" style="s2">arise I think that there&#39;s always a cue</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.820" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">to see if we need to take a step back</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.350" end="00:43:44.320" style="s2">and get into the get out of</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:46.530" style="s2">fight-or-flight mode just mmm few</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.320" end="00:43:46.530" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.680" end="00:43:56.739" style="s2">so we think we have about twenty minutes</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.940" end="00:43:59.259" style="s2">or so we started about five minutes late</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.739" end="00:44:03.219" style="s2">so I figure we can go extra five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.259" end="00:44:06.219" style="s2">or so we can continue along this line of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.219" end="00:44:09.369" style="s2">conversation or if somebody else wants</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.219" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">to give another example of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.369" end="00:44:18.339" style="s2">internal dissonance you know with</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:21.130" style="s2">certain ideas or memes ideologies that</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.339" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">that you find that one day you think one</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.130" end="00:44:24.910" style="s2">you know you agree with one side the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:26.890" style="s2">next day you with the other side and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.910" end="00:44:29.229" style="s2">there&#39;s some interesting tension there I</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.890" end="00:44:32.170" style="s2">wonder if anybody else wants to wants to</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.229" end="00:44:48.880" style="s2">express you know a case another case</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.170" end="00:44:51.549" style="s2">study yeah because you have experience</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.880" end="00:44:54.219" style="s2">in mediating in the real world which I</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.549" end="00:44:56.739" style="s2">do not this is my first time figuring</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.219" end="00:45:00.190" style="s2">out what mediation really means could</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.739" end="00:45:02.650" style="s2">you explain what you mean by like fences</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.190" end="00:45:11.049" style="s2">and contracts and signing things because</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.650" end="00:45:12.099" style="s2">I have no idea what that meant yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.049" end="00:45:15.579" style="s2">the most boring thing ever</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.099" end="00:45:17.410" style="s2">so it&#39;s basically like we gotta like</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.579" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of community mediations</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.410" end="00:45:20.410" style="s2">between like angry neighbors it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:22.539" style="s2">one of the most common ones where</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.410" end="00:45:25.029" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of like property disputes</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.539" end="00:45:27.039" style="s2">about like well my property line is here</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.029" end="00:45:28.959" style="s2">and you need to and your offense is you</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.039" end="00:45:30.640" style="s2">know your tree is growing over my and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.959" end="00:45:32.380" style="s2">into my property and I so I cut down</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.640" end="00:45:34.599" style="s2">your branch and then it&#39;s like how dare</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.380" end="00:45:39.869" style="s2">you cut down my tree you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.599" end="00:45:43.329" style="s2">very like um oriented towards external</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.869" end="00:45:46.539" style="s2">like property and stuff that should be</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.329" end="00:45:50.499" style="s2">sorted out probably in like code and not</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.539" end="00:45:52.209" style="s2">but but there are a lot of like personal</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.499" end="00:45:53.890" style="s2">feelings of anger and animosity between</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.209" end="00:45:55.180" style="s2">the neighbors which is usually why they</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.890" end="00:45:56.650" style="s2">can&#39;t work out the problems themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.180" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">and they have to have a third party</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.650" end="00:46:01.869" style="s2">mediator come in but I guess why I find</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">it boring is because I&#39;d rather explore</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.869" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:06.950" style="s2">or more explicitly the values and</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:11.060" style="s2">psychological dynamics underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.950" end="00:46:12.260" style="s2">instead of dislike needy trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.060" end="00:46:14.390" style="s2">people reach agreements about like</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.260" end="00:46:17.420" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna plan you&#39;re gonna put this</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.390" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">end of the fence here on July first I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.420" end="00:46:20.599" style="s2">been I&#39;m gonna call you back in five</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:21.650" style="s2">days you know it gets very technical</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.599" end="00:46:22.970" style="s2">like that and you have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.650" end="00:46:26.090" style="s2">with them and then they sign a contract</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.970" end="00:46:29.420" style="s2">so it&#39;s pretty bad obviously</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.090" end="00:46:35.450" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.420" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">it&#39;s super super helpful Thanks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.450" end="00:46:39.770" style="s2">maybe this is a question we could throw</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:42.790" style="s2">out there as Ryan said we have these</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.770" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">kind of formal mechanisms for legal</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.790" end="00:46:49.400" style="s2">mediation to be requested how could we</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:50.869" style="s2">as mimetic mediators like what cues</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.400" end="00:46:53.060" style="s2">could we be taking from the environment</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.869" end="00:46:55.130" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s mediation that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.060" end="00:46:58.670" style="s2">needs to be happening especially since</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.130" end="00:47:00.859" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a well-known space at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.670" end="00:47:03.260" style="s2">time nobody&#39;s gonna know that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.859" end="00:47:04.220" style="s2">possibility or that it could take place</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.260" end="00:47:07.310" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.220" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">um yeah I&#39;d be curious to know you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.310" end="00:47:10.520" style="s2">maybe this is something that we can put</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:12.650" style="s2">together and even our slack channel to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.520" end="00:47:15.950" style="s2">be like hey I saw this collision on</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.650" end="00:47:18.349" style="s2">Twitter or I you know I was in a private</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.950" end="00:47:19.550" style="s2">call and this came up or you know you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.349" end="00:47:21.560" style="s2">know because it feels like we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.550" end="00:47:24.410" style="s2">kind of sourcing the opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.560" end="00:47:34.580" style="s2">mediation differently rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.410" end="00:47:36.050" style="s2">more traditional forms of mediation and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.580" end="00:47:39.530" style="s2">there&#39;s so many good comments that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.050" end="00:47:43.700" style="s2">coming into the chat I&#39;m tempted almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.530" end="00:47:45.470" style="s2">to to read a couple of them you know</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.170" end="00:48:54.290" style="s2">be pragmatic and you know just let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.020" end="00:48:56.210" style="s2">just stop you know let&#39;s just stop</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.290" end="00:48:58.580" style="s2">warring with each other right because</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.210" end="00:49:01.090" style="s2">it&#39;s just creating this kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.580" end="00:49:03.050" style="s2">dissonance that&#39;s not good for anybody</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.090" end="00:49:04.760" style="s2">and so can we just come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.050" end="00:49:06.560" style="s2">pragmatic solution and I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.760" end="00:49:08.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a spectrum there and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.560" end="00:49:15.830" style="s2">both have their place we&#39;ll think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.690" end="00:49:18.830" style="s2">that think about that probably not the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.830" end="00:49:21.140" style="s2">only way to frame it but that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.830" end="00:49:23.990" style="s2">pragmatic solution oriented focus may</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.140" end="00:49:27.470" style="s2">one tool that the facilitator and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.990" end="00:49:30.740" style="s2">mediator might use I could see other</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.470" end="00:49:33.109" style="s2">situations where that that wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.740" end="00:49:37.850" style="s2">helpful or that wouldn&#39;t be the best way</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.109" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">to keep the process flowing but I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.850" end="00:49:44.570" style="s2">like I really like the question of what</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:47.630" style="s2">is a mediator period versus what is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.570" end="00:49:49.910" style="s2">memetic mediator you know if the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.630" end="00:49:53.030" style="s2">to create consensus that seems like kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.910" end="00:49:56.270" style="s2">of a losing battle in this postmodern in</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.030" end="00:49:58.460" style="s2">post-postmodern world were in so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.270" end="00:50:00.710" style="s2">know what are we doing exactly if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.460" end="00:50:04.250" style="s2">not trying to create consensus and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.710" end="00:50:10.570" style="s2">said something along the lines of having</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.250" end="00:50:13.970" style="s2">generative conversations and yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.570" end="00:50:16.130" style="s2">curious about all the other things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.970" end="00:50:20.540" style="s2">a memetic mediator could be doing in</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.130" end="00:50:23.300" style="s2">terms of sort of like goals like if they</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.540" end="00:50:26.480" style="s2">were the mimetic mediator stepped into a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.300" end="00:50:29.750" style="s2">conversation what would their what would</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.480" end="00:50:31.569" style="s2">their goals be if they had to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.750" end="00:50:41.380" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.569" end="00:50:43.579" style="s2">mm-hmm I think I mean I think somebody</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.380" end="00:50:45.439" style="s2">somebody to mention you know or you</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.579" end="00:50:47.539" style="s2">mentioned you know having a generative</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.439" end="00:50:48.919" style="s2">conversation so it&#39;s for me it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.539" end="00:50:50.029" style="s2">much like okay you&#39;re gonna agree with</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.919" end="00:50:52.369" style="s2">each other and then become the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.029" end="00:50:54.919" style="s2">tribe like that could happen but that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.369" end="00:50:57.019" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t necessarily need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.919" end="00:51:02.059" style="s2">happen I think is it&#39;s just more</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.019" end="00:51:03.380" style="s2">facilitating a process of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.059" end="00:51:05.569" style="s2">taking and that could be a more of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.380" end="00:51:07.519" style="s2">formal process or an informal process</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.569" end="00:51:10.339" style="s2">but it&#39;s perspective taking and and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.519" end="00:51:12.469" style="s2">kind of you know encouraging people to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.339" end="00:51:14.150" style="s2">to at least try and empathize the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.469" end="00:51:15.949" style="s2">point of view and to imagine yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.150" end="00:51:18.439" style="s2">taking on the other point of view and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.949" end="00:51:20.509" style="s2">you know what would the world like look</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.439" end="00:51:24.769" style="s2">like then and so it&#39;s it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.509" end="00:51:25.969" style="s2">just enabling interaction that in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.769" end="00:51:28.009" style="s2">command there can be a lot of tension</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.969" end="00:51:29.390" style="s2">you know but I like this term generative</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.009" end="00:51:31.759" style="s2">tension right but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.390" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">generating something that that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.759" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">positive for the larger culture you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:38.749" style="s2">and we can talk about what positive</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:44.509" style="s2">collateral means as well that would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.749" end="00:51:46.489" style="s2">my answer at least and the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.509" end="00:51:49.939" style="s2">that came to me is like I remember for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.489" end="00:51:52.189" style="s2">while my brother and I I was staying at</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.939" end="00:51:54.369" style="s2">his house and he kind of has we were</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.189" end="00:51:56.569" style="s2">just completely opposite ideologically</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.369" end="00:51:59.569" style="s2">but for this one trip for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.569" end="00:52:02.059" style="s2">reason we had a bunch of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.569" end="00:52:04.549" style="s2">fighting arguments and telling white</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.059" end="00:52:05.900" style="s2">each other why each other was stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.549" end="00:52:09.169" style="s2">yet there was still kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.900" end="00:52:10.789" style="s2">conviviality and and we left each of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.169" end="00:52:13.640" style="s2">those conversations kind of feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.789" end="00:52:16.309" style="s2">yeah I got to work out my ideas and test</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.640" end="00:52:17.809" style="s2">them and and we it was not it didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.309" end="00:52:21.949" style="s2">didn&#39;t leave feeling like it was some</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.809" end="00:52:25.429" style="s2">sort of destructive exchange it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.949" end="00:52:26.689" style="s2">actually generative to Jason&#39;s point and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.429" end="00:52:30.229" style="s2">yeah but the more that those</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.689" end="00:52:31.640" style="s2">conversations are are enabled in the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.229" end="00:52:33.609" style="s2">broader cultural wars I think the more</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.640" end="00:52:35.809" style="s2">we&#39;ll able to be able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.609" end="00:52:40.299" style="s2">collectively grow as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.809" end="00:52:40.299" style="s2">individually wither</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.000" end="00:52:49.300" style="s2">conviviality is such a good word if</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.040" end="00:52:52.730" style="s2">we&#39;re sowing the seeds of conviviality</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.300" end="00:52:56.660" style="s2">hmm that&#39;s a great that&#39;s a great phrase</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.730" end="00:52:59.240" style="s2">I got to give it to Jim rut is the one</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.660" end="00:53:06.340" style="s2">that got one that would entice them to</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.240" end="00:53:08.690" style="s2">it was Ivan Illich for me mm-hmm yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.340" end="00:53:10.430" style="s2">kind of these different levels where you</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.690" end="00:53:11.750" style="s2">know in kind of what you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.430" end="00:53:14.060" style="s2">with Jared there&#39;s one level where</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.750" end="00:53:15.500" style="s2">you&#39;re not even trying to come to terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.060" end="00:53:17.359" style="s2">on a similar worldview you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.500" end="00:53:21.020" style="s2">building a relationship right and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.359" end="00:53:22.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know if if you&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.020" end="00:53:24.109" style="s2">gonna not gonna be able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.310" end="00:53:26.570" style="s2">conversation about how you see the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.109" end="00:53:28.970" style="s2">you know have a conversation about you</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.570" end="00:53:31.070" style="s2">know a band that you both like right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.970" end="00:53:34.730" style="s2">your love for some shared thing and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.070" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">can be completely sub ideological and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.730" end="00:53:39.740" style="s2">you know for me like that&#39;s of benefit</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">in itself with a large larger benefit is</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.740" end="00:53:44.900" style="s2">you know when something does flare up</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:46.640" style="s2">and kind of this cultural tension you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.900" end="00:53:49.280" style="s2">be less likely to attack that other</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.640" end="00:53:51.589" style="s2">person if you just have a you know just</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:52.910" style="s2">a very normal you know really sub</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.589" end="00:53:54.619" style="s2">ideological relationship with them</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.910" end="00:54:01.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll be less likely to at least attack</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.619" end="00:54:01.960" style="s2">them right and to hear them out hmm</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.410" end="00:54:07.940" style="s2">let&#39;s see Hannah do you wanna use it a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.869" end="00:54:10.190" style="s2">couple I haven&#39;t read it exactly</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.940" end="00:54:12.890" style="s2">everything you&#39;ve said but how do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.190" end="00:54:18.980" style="s2">want to do you want to talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.890" end="00:54:21.890" style="s2">your being up here I think what you just</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.980" end="00:54:24.500" style="s2">described is a tool that I use all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.890" end="00:54:31.450" style="s2">time and I think it&#39;s a really useful</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.500" end="00:54:36.650" style="s2">survival tool for minorities you know if</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.450" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">you are going to be disagreed with at</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.650" end="00:54:44.599" style="s2">every turn in terms of who you are what</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:47.990" style="s2">you believe then often the most peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.599" end="00:54:51.550" style="s2">thing is to just change the subject in</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.990" end="00:54:51.550" style="s2">order to get what you need</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.119" end="00:55:00.329" style="s2">I think that is not a new idea but</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.349" end="00:55:11.160" style="s2">perhaps describing it or bringing it to</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.329" end="00:55:14.730" style="s2">light is useful yeah do you I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.160" end="00:55:16.470" style="s2">one sense I mean - I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.730" end="00:55:17.910" style="s2">survival tool I mean it&#39;s unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.470" end="00:55:19.799" style="s2">that it has to be a survival tool right</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.910" end="00:55:21.630" style="s2">like there&#39;s the the you know it seems</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.799" end="00:55:23.309" style="s2">like you&#39;re kind of bringing up you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.630" end="00:55:25.460" style="s2">these notions of kind of power</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.309" end="00:55:29.460" style="s2">asymmetries you know between</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.460" end="00:55:32.519" style="s2">interlocutors which might force one side</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.460" end="00:55:36.059" style="s2">to to have to adopt the you know a</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.519" end="00:55:36.960" style="s2">survival tool you know like this whereas</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.059" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">the other side doesn&#39;t have to drop</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.960" end="00:55:39.720" style="s2">survival in that and that&#39;s one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:41.009" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;ve really discussed in</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.720" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">any of these pneumatic mediation chats</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.009" end="00:55:44.849" style="s2">is how do you account for it for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.960" end="00:55:48.029" style="s2">power asymmetries within the you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.849" end="00:55:50.299" style="s2">interlocutors where one person one side</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.029" end="00:55:55.019" style="s2">you know has to be much more agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.299" end="00:55:57.390" style="s2">because you know their their bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.019" end="00:56:01.230" style="s2">you know there&#39;s their survivability is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.390" end="00:56:02.700" style="s2">much more at stake and this is a whole I</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.230" end="00:56:04.349" style="s2">think this is a conversation for a whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.700" end="00:56:08.520" style="s2">session personally but just just</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.349" end="00:56:11.579" style="s2">throwing it out there yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.520" end="00:56:11.579" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.660" end="00:56:21.329" style="s2">having the tools to actually describe</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.099" end="00:56:25.739" style="s2">that that survival mechanism you might</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.329" end="00:56:29.450" style="s2">call it might be empowering for people</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.739" end="00:56:33.569" style="s2">if you&#39;re able to use it on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.450" end="00:56:35.910" style="s2">mm-hmm so yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.569" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">you could you could go into this at</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.910" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">length yeah I think it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:45.930" style="s2">interesting conversation in the future</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:49.049" style="s2">as well I often think about perception</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.930" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">and action as these sort of opposites</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.049" end="00:56:54.150" style="s2">that are deeply interconnected and</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:56.819" style="s2">mutually defining and then what you just</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.150" end="00:57:00.989" style="s2">said made me think what if power was</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.819" end="00:57:03.029" style="s2">kind of a third leg on that what would</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.989" end="00:57:05.730" style="s2">that look like if action perception and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.029" end="00:57:07.050" style="s2">power related in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.730" end="00:57:11.100" style="s2">fundamental way and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.050" end="00:57:19.050" style="s2">I have to think about that more yeah me</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.100" end="00:57:22.710" style="s2">too yeah and where we have about five</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.050" end="00:57:25.380" style="s2">more minutes I&#39;m wondering if anybody</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.710" end="00:57:27.270" style="s2">has any you know I just want to give the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.380" end="00:57:29.940" style="s2">space for anybody has last thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.270" end="00:57:31.470" style="s2">about what we&#39;ve been discussing or you</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.940" end="00:57:33.420" style="s2">know any other stray thoughts that</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.470" end="00:57:41.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve been itching to get out before</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.420" end="00:57:44.310" style="s2">you wrap up I just had the question of</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.760" end="00:57:46.890" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna mediate among the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.310" end="00:57:51.540" style="s2">mediators as they&#39;re trying to define</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.890" end="00:57:52.980" style="s2">what that is yeah go ahead dude III have</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.540" end="00:57:56.310" style="s2">something to say about that but I always</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.980" end="00:58:00.300" style="s2">say to myself go ahead good that rule</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.310" end="00:58:02.970" style="s2">feels alive for me and it Jason Jason</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.300" end="00:58:05.070" style="s2">and Peter just are in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.970" end="00:58:06.900" style="s2">releasing some some articles on mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.070" end="00:58:09.660" style="s2">mediation and the two of them kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.900" end="00:58:10.710" style="s2">have very different takes at least in</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.660" end="00:58:13.470" style="s2">these things I haven&#39;t read them both</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.710" end="00:58:16.110" style="s2">yet so I&#39;m excited to do so but but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.470" end="00:58:20.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve already I&#39;m already thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.110" end="00:58:22.220" style="s2">how could I mediate these two so I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.010" end="00:58:24.750" style="s2">love to be in that role</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.220" end="00:58:31.130" style="s2">mediation is the role you find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.750" end="00:58:34.770" style="s2">in when your siblings are fighting so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.130" end="00:58:37.710" style="s2">Ryan did you have were you gonna raise</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.770" end="00:58:39.480" style="s2">their hand I was just joking saying that</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.710" end="00:58:41.160" style="s2">I&#39;m down to maybe Jared and I can do a</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.480" end="00:58:45.780" style="s2">cool mediation between Jason and let</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.160" end="00:58:48.750" style="s2">Peter me and Peter aren&#39;t talking right</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.780" end="00:58:50.070" style="s2">now it&#39;s just really bad you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.750" end="00:58:51.870" style="s2">just talking past each other most of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.070" end="00:58:54.450" style="s2">time ya know</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.870" end="00:58:56.910" style="s2">well I I guess how how I&#39;ve been thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.450" end="00:58:58.950" style="s2">about that is I see it kind of fractal</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.910" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">in the sense where I think all mediators</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.950" end="00:59:03.900" style="s2">like everyone in in some small domain or</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:05.490" style="s2">a large domain of their life is</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.900" end="00:59:08.370" style="s2">mediating but everyone is also being</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.490" end="00:59:10.020" style="s2">mediated right so and it can kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.370" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">up and down the stack so I could be</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.020" end="00:59:13.800" style="s2">mediating people who are mediating</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.000" end="00:59:15.450" style="s2">someone else remaining someone else but</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.800" end="00:59:18.450" style="s2">then those last that last person of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.450" end="00:59:19.980" style="s2">chain might be me aiding me right as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.450" end="00:59:21.869" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.980" end="00:59:23.700" style="s2">day I&#39;m like head mediator but then the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.869" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">next day you know I need to be mediated</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.700" end="00:59:28.440" style="s2">with another mediator and so I see one</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:30.840" style="s2">of the benefits of a community of</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.440" end="00:59:32.460" style="s2">mediators is that we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.840" end="00:59:34.770" style="s2">meeting each other all the time</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.460" end="00:59:36.300" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s it&#39;s not like one</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.770" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">person mediating the mediators but then</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.300" end="00:59:39.869" style="s2">who mediates them and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:43.109" style="s2">turtle is all the way up type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.869" end="00:59:46.730" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s this kind of web of Co</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.109" end="00:59:50.100" style="s2">mediation where you know we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.730" end="00:59:52.230" style="s2">gently you know trying to call out each</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.100" end="00:59:53.850" style="s2">other&#39;s blind spots you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.230" end="00:59:57.270" style="s2">like okay when I saw you mediating that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.850" end="01:00:00.150" style="s2">tribe your bias was showing or I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.270" end="01:00:03.450" style="s2">a bias you know and say you&#39;re gently</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.150" end="01:00:04.890" style="s2">pointing that out you know in the next</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.450" end="01:00:06.600" style="s2">week that same person who said that to</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.890" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">me I might notice that then when someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.600" end="01:00:09.840" style="s2">else and hopefully I&#39;m not just doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:15.020" style="s2">that because I&#39;m taking revenge but you</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.840" end="01:00:18.650" style="s2">know so it does require some you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.020" end="01:00:22.470" style="s2">reflexivity and and contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.650" end="01:00:24.780" style="s2">maturity I would say and I think Jason</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.470" end="01:00:26.790" style="s2">had much more foresight in wisdom than I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.780" end="01:00:28.230" style="s2">did here cuz I&#39;m like I approach this</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.790" end="01:00:29.490" style="s2">thing really cautiously</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.230" end="01:00:31.830" style="s2">I got some but we gotta get all done</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.490" end="01:00:33.600" style="s2">like the technology the ideas down and</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.830" end="01:00:35.130" style="s2">this guy&#39;s like a cowboy just hey we</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.600" end="01:00:37.230" style="s2">have a slack Ruby just vice everyone in</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.130" end="01:00:39.869" style="s2">there or just like him both throwing</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.230" end="01:00:41.190" style="s2">elbows but I think he&#39;s he&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.869" end="01:00:43.770" style="s2">definitely I think Jason&#39;s right is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.190" end="01:00:45.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like in order to become good medic</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.770" end="01:00:49.650" style="s2">meters we got to practice with each</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.750" end="01:00:52.140" style="s2">other&#39;s like a dojo and we model it for</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.650" end="01:00:54.180" style="s2">each other we see it being modeled or</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.140" end="01:00:56.460" style="s2">inspired by it just the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.180" end="01:00:58.050" style="s2">all attracted to this mean to some</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.460" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">extent I think it&#39;s you know half the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.050" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">battle is already won there speaking of</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.730" end="01:01:12.630" style="s2">getting in the mess of it so as we were</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.540" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">talking about identifying where</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.630" end="01:01:18.630" style="s2">mediation it needs to take place I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:20.280" style="s2">David mentioned that one of the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.630" end="01:01:24.720" style="s2">primary battlegrounds right now seems</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.280" end="01:01:27.890" style="s2">like it&#39;s Twitter I wonder if I if I</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.720" end="01:01:31.050" style="s2">would it it could invite everybody to</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.890" end="01:01:33.430" style="s2">use a hashtag or something or a phrase</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.050" end="01:01:35.700" style="s2">on Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.430" end="01:01:40.530" style="s2">Twitter exchanges that seem like</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.700" end="01:01:43.089" style="s2">mediation is needed or or is happening</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.530" end="01:01:47.650" style="s2">that might be never give us some more</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.089" end="01:01:51.819" style="s2">real-world mimetic content to to go over</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.650" end="01:01:53.680" style="s2">in this this call even especially if</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.819" end="01:01:55.780" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it in public if anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.680" end="01:01:57.490" style="s2">willing to do it I I mean I do it all</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.780" end="01:02:00.130" style="s2">the time I just never labeled it so I</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.490" end="01:02:02.050" style="s2">guess it would be interesting to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.130" end="01:02:16.089" style="s2">start pushing that out into the broader</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.050" end="01:02:19.030" style="s2">webs all right well thank you everybody</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.089" end="01:02:22.869" style="s2">I think I think we&#39;ll wrap up now as</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.030" end="01:02:26.770" style="s2">somebody posted on the on the chat we do</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.869" end="01:02:28.990" style="s2">have a slack group and mimetic mediation</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.770" end="01:02:31.210" style="s2">slap group and there&#39;s many channels</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.990" end="01:02:32.650" style="s2">that have conversations there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.210" end="01:02:35.770" style="s2">within the slack group there&#39;s a</p>
