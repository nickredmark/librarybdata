<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:33.690" style="s2">beyond psychedelics we have more cyclic</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">research now than the last 50 years so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.690" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">want to start with the question what has</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">motivated you to make this your life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:44.910" style="s2">work fear I wasn&#39;t expecting that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been able to try to turn fear</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.910" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">into motivation so kind of a not</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:55.910" style="s2">overwhelming fear but it&#39;s fear of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:58.470" style="s2">insanity resulting in mass murder and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.910" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">nuclear annihilation and environmental</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.470" end="00:02:03.020" style="s2">destruction all of which are real</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">possibilities hopefully none of them are</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.020" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">likely but they&#39;re all moving in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">direction towards so it was fear of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">Holocaust fear of the Cuban Missile</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:16.050" style="s2">Crisis and fear of Vietnam and what our</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:20.010" style="s2">country was doing that all made me think</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">that the overall trends were bad and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.010" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">that my parents were gonna pay for my</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:27.599" style="s2">food and shelter I had that sense that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:31.020" style="s2">they would support me in that way</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.599" end="00:02:33.030" style="s2">whatever I wanted to do because I am you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.020" end="00:02:35.490" style="s2">know dropped out of college at 18 after</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.030" end="00:02:38.880" style="s2">doing a lot of LSD and told him I want</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.490" end="00:02:40.170" style="s2">him I wanted to study LSD outside of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.880" end="00:02:45.510" style="s2">college on my own and I wanted them to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.170" end="00:02:48.599" style="s2">pay for it Jewish families yes right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.510" end="00:02:50.459" style="s2">so you had a sense of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.599" end="00:02:52.620" style="s2">multi-generational trauma</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.459" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">growing up yeah what was it like to grow</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.620" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">up well I think that for me in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:02.489" style="s2">the trauma was terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:05.250" style="s2">but I was struggling to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.489" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">from a position of incredible safety and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.250" end="00:03:11.489" style="s2">I&#39;ve realized that I we talk about white</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">privilege you know but I think I had I</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.489" end="00:03:16.170" style="s2">had every almost every possible of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">privilege you could have so I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.170" end="00:03:21.690" style="s2">first off you know with this American</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:22.830" style="s2">exceptionalism that America had won the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.690" end="00:03:25.350" style="s2">war that we were the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.830" end="00:03:27.090" style="s2">country in the world and in some part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.350" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">me believed that it was because we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.090" end="00:03:33.630" style="s2">better people or something you know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:35.520" style="s2">were exceptional or that the you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.630" end="00:03:38.190" style="s2">the political system obviously is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.520" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">exceptional that more cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.190" end="00:03:42.810" style="s2">competition but yes I just grew up this</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:47.220" style="s2">way of this American exceptionalism like</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:50.790" style="s2">I grew up with this sense of being white</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.220" end="00:03:55.590" style="s2">being assimilated Jews you know where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.790" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">lived my parents had a house built when</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.590" end="00:04:03.090" style="s2">I was twelve that was designed by a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">student of Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.090" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">was in land in a suburb of Chicago that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:10.730" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t sell to Jews and so there</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">was this piece of four parcels of land</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.730" end="00:04:16.410" style="s2">that this for Jewish families got a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:19.830" style="s2">Christian family to buy the land for</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.410" end="00:04:22.080" style="s2">them and then sell it to them so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.830" end="00:04:23.670" style="s2">how we so we even went to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.080" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">Jews weren&#39;t welcome but I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.670" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">that kind of till later growing up no I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:35.970" style="s2">felt like I remember in the past that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:38.280" style="s2">World War Two was way in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.970" end="00:04:40.020" style="s2">that this kind of prejudice against</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.280" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">American Jews were way in the past so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.020" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">grew up with the Jews as chosen people</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:47.220" style="s2">but something made it made it prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:49.950" style="s2">for you this you sense this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.220" end="00:04:53.760" style="s2">fear the sense of you know wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.950" end="00:04:56.010" style="s2">assure a positive future and move away</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.760" end="00:04:58.950" style="s2">from I guess what these possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.010" end="00:05:01.830" style="s2">had occurred in your family&#39;s ancestry</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.950" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">yeah I think it was that I felt so safe</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.830" end="00:05:10.170" style="s2">again that my parents my grandparents I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:13.080" style="s2">felt it&#39;s just like I had every</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.170" end="00:05:16.980" style="s2">opportunity to do whatever I wanted and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.080" end="00:05:18.950" style="s2">and so I could kind of look at not like</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.980" end="00:05:23.340" style="s2">a lot of people have to think initially</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.950" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">you know survival how do i you know earn</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.340" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">money to survive and I felt like my</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:29.790" style="s2">family would provide survival so that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:34.430" style="s2">could look at the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.790" end="00:05:37.860" style="s2">of threats thriving thriving but also</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.430" end="00:05:40.890" style="s2">yeah thriving in the face of the real</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.860" end="00:05:42.900" style="s2">challenges yeah what did you read what</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.890" end="00:05:45.380" style="s2">did you what was the experience that led</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.900" end="00:05:48.900" style="s2">you to the point of saying psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.380" end="00:05:54.030" style="s2">would be a tool for assuring a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.900" end="00:05:56.280" style="s2">positive future well I was a big big</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.030" end="00:05:57.870" style="s2">reader so I was super shy in high school</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.280" end="00:06:00.420" style="s2">and so there was a year ago I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.870" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">even say a word to a girl other than to</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.420" end="00:06:10.200" style="s2">my sister and mother and so I was living</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.260" end="00:06:12.300" style="s2">in books a lot and so I started the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.200" end="00:06:15.530" style="s2">first book I ever read was called the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.300" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">Cannes Cannes mutiny and it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.530" end="00:06:22.890" style="s2">historical kind of fiction but it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:26.040" style="s2">about a domineering captain on a ship</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.890" end="00:06:27.810" style="s2">where they have ultimate authority and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.040" end="00:06:30.150" style="s2">it was a mutiny among the men during</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.810" end="00:06:34.140" style="s2">during wartime and it was just one</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.150" end="00:06:37.530" style="s2">person against you know against an</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.140" end="00:06:41.490" style="s2">oppressive system but that was the book</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.530" end="00:06:44.640" style="s2">that turned me around really the key one</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.490" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">was one Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest by</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.640" end="00:06:52.920" style="s2">Ken Kesey that on LSD he did but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:55.650" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that till after I read it</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.920" end="00:06:58.890" style="s2">and so I read it and thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.650" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">fantastic again what about the message</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.890" end="00:07:03.240" style="s2">of the book message of the book is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:05.940" style="s2">there&#39;s this combine in the system</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.240" end="00:07:08.670" style="s2">that&#39;s trying to control things and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.940" end="00:07:10.940" style="s2">individuals who stick out there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.670" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">pressure to crush them and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.940" end="00:07:19.560" style="s2">the price you pay for trying to be your</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">own unique self and the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.560" end="00:07:26.760" style="s2">struggling you know and in some ways the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:29.700" style="s2">importance of quiet and laying low like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.760" end="00:07:34.830" style="s2">chief broom who was watching you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.700" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">the destruction of the hero but I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.830" end="00:07:38.130" style="s2">thought it was fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:39.960" style="s2">and was shocked when some of it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.130" end="00:07:42.540" style="s2">written on LSD so change of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.960" end="00:07:43.650" style="s2">I know like if there&#39;s no way somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.540" end="00:07:45.810" style="s2">could write this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.650" end="00:07:48.600" style="s2">an LSD based on what I have been told</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.810" end="00:07:50.490" style="s2">that was DJO it told that physically</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.600" end="00:07:52.680" style="s2">back then when he goes you would grow</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.490" end="00:07:54.449" style="s2">half the point where the laws were</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.680" end="00:07:56.340" style="s2">changing and all the research was being</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.449" end="00:07:57.990" style="s2">shut down yeah you know there was so</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.340" end="00:08:00.509" style="s2">much promise in the study of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.990" end="00:08:03.509" style="s2">in a study of depression and also for</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.509" end="00:08:05.639" style="s2">enhancing creativity but shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.509" end="00:08:08.850" style="s2">culture was causing these walls just</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.639" end="00:08:11.639" style="s2">just sort of come around these compounds</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.850" end="00:08:14.789" style="s2">yeah so you came in and right at that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.639" end="00:08:16.350" style="s2">point yeah and then the other things</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.789" end="00:08:21.150" style="s2">that I was reading I was starting to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.350" end="00:08:24.300" style="s2">read more Eastern mysticism I read a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.150" end="00:08:28.110" style="s2">of Hermann Hesse and Jung and Freud and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.300" end="00:08:30.300" style="s2">what I I Aldous Huxley and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.110" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">read I tried to read everything somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.300" end="00:08:37.709" style="s2">wrote my grandparents had a bookstore</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:40.380" style="s2">I love the Huxley quote psychedelics on</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.709" end="00:08:42.390" style="s2">the plane of Perpetual creation they may</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.380" end="00:08:44.190" style="s2">serve to heal mental illness in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.390" end="00:08:48.209" style="s2">future and that is a future that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.190" end="00:08:51.270" style="s2">bringing to fruition yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.209" end="00:08:54.420" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to we as a large group of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.270" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">people trying to bring psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.420" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">medicines into the mainstream what is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:00.900" style="s2">about the psychedelic experience that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:03.390" style="s2">you feel connects people to a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.900" end="00:09:05.220" style="s2">meaning and a flexibility in which I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.390" end="00:09:08.100" style="s2">orient themselves towards change and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.220" end="00:09:11.300" style="s2">well in your early experiences what led</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.100" end="00:09:14.100" style="s2">you to go AHA this is where I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.300" end="00:09:16.709" style="s2">donate my energies yeah well the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.100" end="00:09:19.110" style="s2">time I ever took LSD you know you hear</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.709" end="00:09:23.339" style="s2">so much about this mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.110" end="00:09:28.200" style="s2">and beyond ego states and how it you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.339" end="00:09:30.060" style="s2">know at the time it was mostly like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.200" end="00:09:33.180" style="s2">time I was doing starting to do LSD a</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.060" end="00:09:35.640" style="s2">standard dose was 250 micrograms right</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.180" end="00:09:38.130" style="s2">now a standard dose of LSD is like 60 or</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.640" end="00:09:40.020" style="s2">70 micrograms or it&#39;s a lot less but it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.130" end="00:09:41.880" style="s2">was designed to have these overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.020" end="00:09:46.230" style="s2">mystical experiences and that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.880" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">considered one dose and so I had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.230" end="00:09:49.950" style="s2">of expectations of what that would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:52.680" style="s2">like and I also had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.950" end="00:09:54.750" style="s2">disappointment from my bar mitzvah which</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.680" end="00:09:56.930" style="s2">I had thought would be a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.750" end="00:09:58.520" style="s2">experience but really wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.930" end="00:10:00.680" style="s2">and so the first things I started</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.520" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">noticing when I was under the influence</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.680" end="00:10:07.940" style="s2">of LSD for that was the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:11.380" style="s2">there was different kind of depths of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.940" end="00:10:14.779" style="s2">feelings you know this kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.380" end="00:10:18.649" style="s2">thoughtful I mean way that I proceeded</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.779" end="00:10:20.990" style="s2">very you know above my emotional life</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.649" end="00:10:23.899" style="s2">but in a way so I could look at because</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.990" end="00:10:27.950" style="s2">I was so scared and so much fear it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.899" end="00:10:30.200" style="s2">it woke me up to my emotions yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.950" end="00:10:32.540" style="s2">often are out of touch with our emotions</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.200" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know we&#39;re not taught how</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.540" end="00:10:37.580" style="s2">to interpret them how to handle them and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:39.170" style="s2">there is definitely and I myself have</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.580" end="00:10:41.899" style="s2">coming from a scientific background</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.170" end="00:10:43.730" style="s2">I very much stand on the side growing up</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.899" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">of a rationality and what can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.730" end="00:10:49.130" style="s2">calculated what we can figure out and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:51.020" style="s2">think that there is a sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.130" end="00:10:53.480" style="s2">mystical experience what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.020" end="00:10:55.490" style="s2">and what is the one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.480" end="00:10:57.350" style="s2">irrational emotional parts of our brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.490" end="00:10:59.779" style="s2">that are definitely there and need to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.350" end="00:11:03.560" style="s2">recognized how do we best approach them</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.779" end="00:11:05.810" style="s2">and sort them out in a way that allows</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.560" end="00:11:08.029" style="s2">us to access our best selves and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.810" end="00:11:11.060" style="s2">psychedelics definitely can be tools for</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.029" end="00:11:13.430" style="s2">those I have really enjoyed some of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.060" end="00:11:17.270" style="s2">stories of your experiences have really</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.430" end="00:11:19.750" style="s2">enabled me to contact those both both</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.270" end="00:11:22.010" style="s2">sides of myself I particularly think of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.750" end="00:11:24.230" style="s2">the story you told me about how</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.010" end="00:11:26.029" style="s2">psychedelics helped you communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.230" end="00:11:29.480" style="s2">your inner critic that voice and we we</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.029" end="00:11:30.830" style="s2">all we all have that always knows what</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.480" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">we could have done better but not really</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.830" end="00:11:38.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really show us how can you tell</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:44.120" style="s2">us about that experience I&#39;d be glad to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.390" end="00:11:47.900" style="s2">even though it was very difficult it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.120" end="00:11:50.120" style="s2">at the time when in 1985 when we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.900" end="00:11:52.790" style="s2">just starting to sue the DEA and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.120" end="00:11:54.440" style="s2">there&#39;s hello Leo&#39;s F that was the we</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.790" end="00:11:55.970" style="s2">call him the secret chief the leader of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.440" end="00:11:58.910" style="s2">underground psychotherapy who really</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.970" end="00:12:00.890" style="s2">helped introduce MDMA he said to me that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.910" end="00:12:02.779" style="s2">as long as I was starting to do more</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.890" end="00:12:05.300" style="s2">political work he wanted me to do an</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.779" end="00:12:07.790" style="s2">experience with ibogaine that he thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.300" end="00:12:10.130" style="s2">would help me for my own shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.790" end="00:12:11.270" style="s2">ibogaine is quite different from other</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.130" end="00:12:14.380" style="s2">psychedelics isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.270" end="00:12:18.649" style="s2">it&#39;s used for this healing of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.380" end="00:12:22.850" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d say it&#39;s more similar than</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.649" end="00:12:24.500" style="s2">different in the sense that it does give</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.850" end="00:12:27.410" style="s2">you a broader perspective there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.500" end="00:12:28.750" style="s2">enhanced imagery yeah I I think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.410" end="00:12:30.980" style="s2">difference is it&#39;s somehow more</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.750" end="00:12:33.339" style="s2">instinctual it feels like people talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.980" end="00:12:37.850" style="s2">about it as like their ancestors are</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.339" end="00:12:39.770" style="s2">more LSD feels like what clear and clean</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.850" end="00:12:42.260" style="s2">up in the head kind of and psilocybin is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.770" end="00:12:48.649" style="s2">a little bit more embodied mescaline</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.260" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">that way too and just by gains are quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.649" end="00:12:52.820" style="s2">a long experience as well it&#39;s very long</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.990" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">and so and it takes a long time to come</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.820" end="00:12:57.320" style="s2">on so Leo said that he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:13:00.170" style="s2">administer it with LSD so it was 350</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.320" end="00:13:05.390" style="s2">micrograms of LSD and about four grams</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.170" end="00:13:07.490" style="s2">of total alkaloid ibogaine and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.390" end="00:13:10.730" style="s2">essence of it was though that I realized</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.490" end="00:13:13.190" style="s2">this inner critic and just felt that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.730" end="00:13:15.860" style="s2">connection between self-criticism and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.190" end="00:13:18.230" style="s2">self-hatred and I got into this whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.860" end="00:13:21.020" style="s2">thing every time I would see that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.230" end="00:13:23.270" style="s2">would kind of feel nauseous even more</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.020" end="00:13:25.640" style="s2">the LSD part went smooth kind of through</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.270" end="00:13:28.339" style="s2">this opening and through the peak of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:31.940" style="s2">and I don&#39;t actually you know recall all</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.339" end="00:13:34.750" style="s2">that much of that LSD part of it because</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.940" end="00:13:37.040" style="s2">it was all about this sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.750" end="00:13:38.690" style="s2">appalled at the amount of self-hatred</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.040" end="00:13:40.850" style="s2">hatred that I have for myself and then I</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.690" end="00:13:42.680" style="s2">would vomit and then we become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.850" end="00:13:44.930" style="s2">it it can be quite shocking that little</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.680" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">voice is this always there itis subtly</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.930" end="00:13:49.970" style="s2">letting us know that we&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:51.800" style="s2">good enough right now how did how did</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.970" end="00:13:55.310" style="s2">that shift how do this create a shift</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.800" end="00:13:57.860" style="s2">into a new relationship yeah well I saw</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.310" end="00:14:00.680" style="s2">that the image I had was as a Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.860" end="00:14:06.170" style="s2">person that I was being crucified on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.680" end="00:14:09.440" style="s2">cross of self perfectionism and I just</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.170" end="00:14:12.140" style="s2">would see that and uh and because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.440" end="00:14:14.450" style="s2">worst part was I would say that and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.140" end="00:14:16.279" style="s2">was doing it to myself not only that if</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.450" end="00:14:18.920" style="s2">I could just relax and get over it I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.279" end="00:14:23.150" style="s2">just didn&#39;t know how and so the way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.920" end="00:14:23.750" style="s2">I got through it was I never could</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.150" end="00:14:26.509" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.750" end="00:14:29.569" style="s2">so what happened was I just vomited for</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.509" end="00:14:34.550" style="s2">like 10 12 10 hours or so just really</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.569" end="00:14:37.850" style="s2">feeling this trap this horror part of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.550" end="00:14:39.949" style="s2">and then I got exhausted and so I know</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.850" end="00:14:41.990" style="s2">that transcendence through exhaustion I</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.949" end="00:14:43.220" style="s2">think the old eel experience is</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.990" end="00:14:46.279" style="s2">something is quite relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.220" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">psychedelics a concept that by facing</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.279" end="00:14:51.319" style="s2">something is challenging so it shows us</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">that we can be so much more we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.319" end="00:14:57.410" style="s2">overcome I think that&#39;s very true but</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.560" end="00:14:59.689" style="s2">but I also think that there&#39;s ways we</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.410" end="00:15:04.430" style="s2">make the ordeal even harder I mean if it</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.689" end="00:15:07.850" style="s2">you know I what what happened for me was</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.430" end="00:15:10.459" style="s2">just I somehow got all exhausted from</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.850" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">that process and I just moved into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.459" end="00:15:14.290" style="s2">opposite of this openness and</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:18.170" style="s2">self-acceptance and most blissful</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.290" end="00:15:19.910" style="s2">peaceful the whole night and I was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.170" end="00:15:22.310" style="s2">place where it was on the water and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.910" end="00:15:25.160" style="s2">could see the stars and I just was part</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.310" end="00:15:27.709" style="s2">of this beautiful peaceful accepting</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.160" end="00:15:28.339" style="s2">process but I felt that I had not earned</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.709" end="00:15:31.250" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.339" end="00:15:34.250" style="s2">I hadn&#39;t like made that turned the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.250" end="00:15:36.500" style="s2">switch to turn it off all of this self I</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.250" end="00:15:39.050" style="s2">just said and so I thought that when the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.500" end="00:15:40.759" style="s2">Sun comes up and the tide comes in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.050" end="00:15:44.029" style="s2">I would be back stocked that this was</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.759" end="00:15:45.949" style="s2">like grace it was like yeah Trenton and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.029" end="00:15:49.550" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what happened so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.949" end="00:15:51.379" style="s2">next day I was I couldn&#39;t even sit up</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.550" end="00:15:52.819" style="s2">without feeling nauseous I couldn&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.379" end="00:15:54.139" style="s2">I had to lie down I couldn&#39;t even leave</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.819" end="00:15:58.329" style="s2">I was supposed to leave the next day I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.139" end="00:16:00.559" style="s2">had to stay there the whole day finally</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.329" end="00:16:03.740" style="s2">barelly somebody came to me on the third</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.559" end="00:16:05.480" style="s2">day to take me home take me somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.740" end="00:16:08.300" style="s2">else and it wasn&#39;t till the fourth day</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.480" end="00:16:10.100" style="s2">that I could drive but what I felt had</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.300" end="00:16:12.649" style="s2">happened was that I had more space in my</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.100" end="00:16:15.350" style="s2">mind I could pay more attention to what</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.649" end="00:16:17.269" style="s2">was happening outside and also that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.350" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">needed that self-critic that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.269" end="00:16:21.379" style="s2">was that I need you need that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:22.730" style="s2">self-critic to help you think about what</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.379" end="00:16:24.920" style="s2">you can do until learn is just learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.730" end="00:16:26.509" style="s2">and you wouldn&#39;t even have those lessons</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.920" end="00:16:28.309" style="s2">if you hadn&#39;t done things which you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.509" end="00:16:30.680" style="s2">be proud of yourself for having tried</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.309" end="00:16:33.139" style="s2">something even if it fails and so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.680" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">could say yeah I can make a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.139" end="00:16:37.400" style="s2">the self-critic</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:40.220" style="s2">and also by virtue of that get</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.400" end="00:16:42.740" style="s2">more and more of the ideas aways</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.220" end="00:16:44.270" style="s2">self-improvement and then the other idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.740" end="00:16:45.860" style="s2">is that you&#39;ve missed the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.270" end="00:16:47.660" style="s2">you&#39;ve blown it in that moment never</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.860" end="00:16:49.340" style="s2">comes back again and I started seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.660" end="00:16:51.440" style="s2">about how there were all these second</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.340" end="00:16:53.030" style="s2">chances that you could you couldn&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.440" end="00:16:55.190" style="s2">it into practice in that moment that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.030" end="00:16:57.740" style="s2">moment is gone but there&#39;s similar kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.190" end="00:16:59.240" style="s2">of moments or situations sometimes with</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.740" end="00:17:02.090" style="s2">different people sometimes with even the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.240" end="00:17:05.750" style="s2">same people and so that I&#39;ve since</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.090" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">that&#39;s 1985 and I felt that it&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.750" end="00:17:12.680" style="s2">extent the success that vamps has had is</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:14.330" style="s2">because it&#39;s been more easy for me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.680" end="00:17:16.010" style="s2">learn from my mistakes in fact I call</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.330" end="00:17:20.750" style="s2">myself just a fuckup who just keeps</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.010" end="00:17:23.510" style="s2">trying to succeed you have to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.750" end="00:17:25.550" style="s2">to fail better each time there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.510" end="00:17:28.070" style="s2">a degree of self-acceptance in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.550" end="00:17:29.930" style="s2">process to view that and I really like</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.070" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">how you describe this experience with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.930" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">sense of turning that inner critic and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:35.240" style="s2">into it into a mentor yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:38.360" style="s2">they&#39;ll have changing that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.240" end="00:17:39.350" style="s2">and we can all do with ourselves yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.360" end="00:17:44.060" style="s2">and you have to be a little bit gentle</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.350" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">on yourself like yeah it&#39;s yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.060" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">think this and be proud of the actions</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.000" end="00:17:54.230" style="s2">don&#39;t we and that&#39;s what psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.260" end="00:17:55.460" style="s2">help us do yeah very much but</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.230" end="00:17:57.590" style="s2">particularly if there&#39;s a supportive</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.460" end="00:17:59.900" style="s2">setting yes that&#39;s very important at a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.590" end="00:18:02.750" style="s2">therapeutic setting not only therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.900" end="00:18:04.190" style="s2">supportive supportive yeah like what do</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.750" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">you think of the key ingredients for</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.190" end="00:18:10.610" style="s2">that setting well let&#39;s say that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:12.230" style="s2">you&#39;re surrounded by a safe place where</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.610" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">you could go inward you could close your</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.230" end="00:18:16.940" style="s2">eyes you could lie in the ground and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:19.880" style="s2">could be defenseless from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.940" end="00:18:21.710" style="s2">but that you could explore wherever your</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.880" end="00:18:24.110" style="s2">mind or feelings were taking you that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.710" end="00:18:26.060" style="s2">you&#39;re in that safe place and also the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.110" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">attitude that you&#39;re open to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.060" end="00:18:31.370" style="s2">happens the that you can have a plan but</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:34.670" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of unconscious the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.370" end="00:18:37.910" style="s2">your mind has a deeper plan or a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.670" end="00:18:39.980" style="s2">sense of need in a heal or something</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.910" end="00:18:41.900" style="s2">it&#39;s very important in psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.980" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">healing this this natural intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.900" end="00:18:45.680" style="s2">that our unconscious minds do seem to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:47.720" style="s2">have about the direction that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.680" end="00:18:50.930" style="s2">go I&#39;m quite curious to hear more about</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.720" end="00:18:53.900" style="s2">the experiences in the MDMA trials</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.930" end="00:18:57.650" style="s2">for PTSD and encounters with this in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.900" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">Gila okay yeah I just had on that last</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.650" end="00:19:01.910" style="s2">question that it that I think you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:04.520" style="s2">have this openness to whatever would</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.910" end="00:19:07.400" style="s2">happen in the sense of safety outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.520" end="00:19:09.860" style="s2">in a dance party with you know friends</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.400" end="00:19:13.190" style="s2">around you or you could have it indoors</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.860" end="00:19:15.230" style="s2">in a treatment center or you can have it</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.190" end="00:19:17.330" style="s2">camping out by yourself or with a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.230" end="00:19:19.310" style="s2">friends it&#39;s a little bit harder to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.330" end="00:19:22.370" style="s2">by yourself because you really need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.310" end="00:19:24.490" style="s2">feel safe in that spot but it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.370" end="00:19:28.250" style="s2">have someone that&#39;s a mediator between</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.490" end="00:19:29.810" style="s2">world and the other sitter isn&#39;t on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.250" end="00:19:31.880" style="s2">psychedelic you can create that safe</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.810" end="00:19:33.470" style="s2">space yeah and where it could be in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.880" end="00:19:34.850" style="s2">church so I guess what I want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.470" end="00:19:36.670" style="s2">that there could be medical use there</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.850" end="00:19:41.510" style="s2">could be religious use there could be</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.670" end="00:19:43.190" style="s2">ceremonial use recreational well people</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.510" end="00:19:45.980" style="s2">or something it&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.190" end="00:19:48.460" style="s2">concept in cyclic world as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.980" end="00:19:52.630" style="s2">this is not just something to heal</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.460" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">illness but to improve the meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.630" end="00:19:57.770" style="s2">allies in our relationship to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:59.420" style="s2">yeah one way to think about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.770" end="00:20:02.300" style="s2">we might be well but we&#39;re not all that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.420" end="00:20:07.040" style="s2">well there&#39;s a lot of ways we could be</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.300" end="00:20:08.630" style="s2">more well self-actualization I think is</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.040" end="00:20:11.180" style="s2">a goal post it&#39;s going to keep moving</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.630" end="00:20:12.380" style="s2">yeah and also even if we&#39;re well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.180" end="00:20:14.060" style="s2">just when you think about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.380" end="00:20:15.590" style="s2">happening to the earth and the species</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.060" end="00:20:18.770" style="s2">and the massive die-off and the threats</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.590" end="00:20:21.320" style="s2">you have to spend some time feeling</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.770" end="00:20:25.160" style="s2">painful and so you know if you&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.320" end="00:20:28.490" style="s2">you&#39;re processing massive trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.160" end="00:20:32.390" style="s2">murder and horrible things you know and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.490" end="00:20:36.440" style="s2">risk it out don&#39;t we yeah yeah it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.390" end="00:20:37.850" style="s2">to function but I think that&#39;s so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:39.380" style="s2">think maybe the idea of betterment of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.850" end="00:20:45.320" style="s2">well people or not actually all that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.380" end="00:20:47.000" style="s2">well yeah a lot of us some I mean or and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.320" end="00:20:48.440" style="s2">and what that does though is that gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.000" end="00:20:52.520" style="s2">into the discussion about prohibition</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.440" end="00:20:56.060" style="s2">and post religious freedom post medical</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.520" end="00:20:58.520" style="s2">use limitations which are valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.060" end="00:21:02.680" style="s2">crucial we are going in those ways but</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.520" end="00:21:04.250" style="s2">there is this bigger a sense of need and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.680" end="00:21:06.170" style="s2">importance and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.250" end="00:21:07.610" style="s2">human rights and freedom yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.170" end="00:21:10.550" style="s2">come back to the healer just because</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.610" end="00:21:11.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone down this path and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.550" end="00:21:14.270" style="s2">taking it back to the beginning idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.960" end="00:21:16.670" style="s2">multi-generational trauma I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.270" end="00:21:19.220" style="s2">really important point for both our</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.670" end="00:21:23.510" style="s2">countries Australia and the United</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.220" end="00:21:26.620" style="s2">States having a history of trauma in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.510" end="00:21:28.850" style="s2">First Nations people well even the whole</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.620" end="00:21:29.960" style="s2">Australia being founded by prisoners</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.850" end="00:21:32.810" style="s2">being sent there</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.960" end="00:21:36.830" style="s2">you know exiled so you&#39;re a country of X</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.810" end="00:21:39.710" style="s2">Isles and you know now bad criminals</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.830" end="00:21:41.090" style="s2">type change changing our storylines is</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.710" end="00:21:42.920" style="s2">something psychedelics are really</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.090" end="00:21:44.180" style="s2">helpful for I guess and that can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.920" end="00:21:47.450" style="s2">hacked that can happen on an individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.180" end="00:21:50.900" style="s2">level or on on a wider scale yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.450" end="00:21:55.790" style="s2">so like some of the examples of an inner</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.900" end="00:21:58.310" style="s2">healer in the studies a lot of it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.790" end="00:22:02.120" style="s2">have been about forgiveness of others</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.310" end="00:22:03.470" style="s2">actually yes oh yeah I think forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.120" end="00:22:05.090" style="s2">is a gift that you give yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.470" end="00:22:06.590" style="s2">actually yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.090" end="00:22:11.750" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s one of the ways to set</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.590" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">yourself free from trauma and I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.750" end="00:22:19.220" style="s2">curious to hear more about your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">on that yeah well one of the Israeli</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:23.030" style="s2">doctors the when we were first starting</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:25.400" style="s2">to try to do the project in Israel we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.030" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">done it in multiple sites he was a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.400" end="00:22:31.390" style="s2">traditional psychiatrist and he asked</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:35.090" style="s2">this question which was is this for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.390" end="00:22:36.530" style="s2">victims or the perpetrators and he said</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.090" end="00:22:39.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t think this should be this would</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.530" end="00:22:41.240" style="s2">work for perpetrators and and I said no</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.740" end="00:22:42.620" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case at all that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.240" end="00:22:46.820" style="s2">harder sometimes to forgive ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.620" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">and just to forgive other people and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.820" end="00:22:51.230" style="s2">what we&#39;ve seen is that people can</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:53.240" style="s2">forgive perpetrators they can see the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.230" end="00:22:55.790" style="s2">pain that drove people to do things</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.240" end="00:23:01.040" style="s2">horrible things to them they can see</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.790" end="00:23:02.420" style="s2">that but then they can also you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.040" end="00:23:04.460" style="s2">people might blame themselves for</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.420" end="00:23:06.590" style="s2">getting in those situations or then they</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.460" end="00:23:08.360" style="s2">can forgive themselves and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.590" end="00:23:09.770" style="s2">huge aspect of trauma feeling like there</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.360" end="00:23:12.530" style="s2">is always something more you could have</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.770" end="00:23:15.350" style="s2">done to avoid the situation is led to</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.530" end="00:23:16.920" style="s2">you feeling this way of feeling trapped</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.350" end="00:23:18.750" style="s2">in your own mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.920" end="00:23:20.310" style="s2">yeah one person had said that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.750" end="00:23:22.020" style="s2">perpetrator told her that if she ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.310" end="00:23:22.650" style="s2">told anybody about what happened he</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.020" end="00:23:27.270" style="s2">would kill her</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.650" end="00:23:31.680" style="s2">that was in an MDMA yeah yeah yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.270" end="00:23:34.230" style="s2">that was a prior obsession but but</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.680" end="00:23:36.090" style="s2">speaking about it was liberating you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.230" end="00:23:42.810" style="s2">know that the fear was carried that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.090" end="00:23:45.060" style="s2">whole time there&#39;s ways in which people</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.810" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">some of the veterans have killed</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.060" end="00:23:51.570" style="s2">innocent people yes in war networks what</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">happens yeah and they were scared and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.570" end="00:23:56.670" style="s2">they were made quick judgments that were</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:59.720" style="s2">wrong and so particularly one that had</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.670" end="00:24:02.220" style="s2">killed two little girls that kill the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.720" end="00:24:03.750" style="s2">they were driving and the father was</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.220" end="00:24:07.560" style="s2">driving and wouldn&#39;t stop and he</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.750" end="00:24:11.250" style="s2">couldn&#39;t figure it out so just forgiving</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.560" end="00:24:14.070" style="s2">themselves now I think there&#39;s a edge</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.250" end="00:24:15.930" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they think they did the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.070" end="00:24:18.420" style="s2">right thing it&#39;s not like people have</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.930" end="00:24:21.270" style="s2">said to me are you making war easier are</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.420" end="00:24:23.610" style="s2">you making it easier for soldiers to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.270" end="00:24:24.750" style="s2">horrible things and then just take MDMA</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.610" end="00:24:27.510" style="s2">and then they&#39;re fine and they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.750" end="00:24:29.480" style="s2">go out and do them again and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.510" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">it&#39;s important to say that it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.480" end="00:24:36.510" style="s2">forgiving but not thinking that it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:39.390" style="s2">okay it was something that they had to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.510" end="00:24:40.920" style="s2">accept and move on not so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.390" end="00:24:43.800" style="s2">forgiving doesn&#39;t mean saying it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.920" end="00:24:45.330" style="s2">matter it wasn&#39;t okay no of course not I</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.800" end="00:24:47.370" style="s2">feel like getting in touch with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.330" end="00:24:49.110" style="s2">roots of your trauma knowing where they</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.370" end="00:24:50.460" style="s2">occurred if this was in war I think it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.110" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">would probably have the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.460" end="00:24:53.940" style="s2">reaction that you wouldn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:24:55.650" style="s2">going back it&#39;s not like II I put on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.940" end="00:24:59.220" style="s2">band-aid trauma fix that send you back</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.650" end="00:25:00.270" style="s2">to the frontlines no that&#39;s I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.220" end="00:25:01.710" style="s2">imagine that would be the reaction of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.270" end="00:25:03.660" style="s2">any of the soldiers in the trials is</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.710" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">that well I think the difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.660" end="00:25:08.700" style="s2">if you believe in the mission you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:10.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the question is like if you were</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.700" end="00:25:16.110" style="s2">in a war for survival and somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.920" end="00:25:17.940" style="s2">you got wounded and you needed to take</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.110" end="00:25:19.830" style="s2">some time to get emotionally patched up</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.940" end="00:25:22.530" style="s2">and you felt that everything was that a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.830" end="00:25:24.180" style="s2">threat you might go back to the war but</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.530" end="00:25:26.250" style="s2">if you don&#39;t really believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.180" end="00:25:29.070" style="s2">mission like with Iraq the invasion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.250" end="00:25:30.770" style="s2">Iraq is our optional war and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.070" end="00:25:34.520" style="s2">people grew to see that we weren&#39;t how</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.770" end="00:25:35.960" style="s2">and that it was not welcome and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.520" end="00:25:37.850" style="s2">they didn&#39;t believe in the mission so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.960" end="00:25:39.710" style="s2">think because we&#39;ve had these</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.850" end="00:25:44.450" style="s2">discussions with the Department of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.710" end="00:25:46.130" style="s2">Defense and other people it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.450" end="00:25:48.740" style="s2">sooner you can treat people to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.130" end="00:25:52.010" style="s2">trauma the better which means moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.740" end="00:25:54.770" style="s2">from veterans to active-duty soldiers if</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.010" end="00:25:57.890" style="s2">you can or moving from people that have</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.770" end="00:25:59.300" style="s2">had PTSD from a childhood and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.890" end="00:26:01.610" style="s2">waiting till they get adults and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.300" end="00:26:03.620" style="s2">treating them you know actually I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.610" end="00:26:06.200" style="s2">the FDA is requiring us to do pediatric</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.620" end="00:26:09.080" style="s2">studies once we complete the studies and</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.200" end="00:26:11.480" style="s2">adults so I think this saturating</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.080" end="00:26:13.010" style="s2">childhood trauma yeah very much so</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.480" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">well one of the friends that was at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.010" end="00:26:17.960" style="s2">conference here Torsten pass II was like</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:20.510" style="s2">what happens if you were doing MDMA</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.960" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">therapy long ago and a Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.510" end="00:26:25.340" style="s2">concentration camp guard said they</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:28.820" style="s2">needed help would you treat them you</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.340" end="00:26:30.380" style="s2">know is that just you know they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.820" end="00:26:32.179" style="s2">this inhumane thing and you just help</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.380" end="00:26:33.830" style="s2">process and they go back and they you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.179" end="00:26:36.770" style="s2">know show more people in the gas chamber</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.830" end="00:26:40.340" style="s2">I mean that was his his worry is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.770" end="00:26:42.350" style="s2">happening and so I think that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.340" end="00:26:43.790" style="s2">likely to be that yeah I think when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.350" end="00:26:46.370" style="s2">get sensitized to the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.790" end="00:26:47.929" style="s2">consequences of what you&#39;re doing if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.370" end="00:26:49.580" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in it it&#39;ll make it harder</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.929" end="00:26:51.800" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.580" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">I think as totally relevant for veterans</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.800" end="00:26:56.570" style="s2">but also victims of sexual assault and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:27:00.140" style="s2">domestic abuse there&#39;s a sense that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.570" end="00:27:02.750" style="s2">know one person who experienced a rape</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.140" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">and she was concerned that if she was to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.750" end="00:27:06.710" style="s2">use only made a heal she wouldn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:10.100" style="s2">be healing herself that she would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.710" end="00:27:14.330" style="s2">losing her sense of injustice towards</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.100" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">her abuse I through our conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.330" end="00:27:19.430" style="s2">sort of communicated to her that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:21.460" style="s2">liberating herself from the rigidity</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.430" end="00:27:24.470" style="s2">that trauma causes around our</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.460" end="00:27:26.540" style="s2">functioning this frozen state in time</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.470" end="00:27:29.390" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s an attractant in</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.540" end="00:27:31.940" style="s2">time we&#39;ll actually free her to do work</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.390" end="00:27:34.460" style="s2">in the world to change the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.940" end="00:27:38.120" style="s2">that have in society that led to this</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.460" end="00:27:41.210" style="s2">mentality of the men who perpetrated the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.120" end="00:27:44.870" style="s2">abuse against her it&#39;s a I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.210" end="00:27:47.480" style="s2">interested to hear your thoughts on on</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.870" end="00:27:49.910" style="s2">the other side of trauma which is stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.480" end="00:27:52.490" style="s2">that happens in in everyone&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.910" end="00:27:55.340" style="s2">domestic abuse sexual assault of women</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.490" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">and what Maps is doing in regards to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.340" end="00:28:00.260" style="s2">that side of trauma yeah because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:02.690" style="s2">way more trauma from those causes then</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.260" end="00:28:04.130" style="s2">from war and and I think sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.690" end="00:28:05.420" style="s2">people lose sight of that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.130" end="00:28:08.300" style="s2">just talking a lot about the veterans</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.420" end="00:28:11.660" style="s2">but I&#39;m curious did your friend actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.300" end="00:28:15.260" style="s2">try MDMA and what impact did it have if</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.660" end="00:28:18.200" style="s2">she did she did try it and it had a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.260" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">positive impact it did reveal in fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.200" end="00:28:23.450" style="s2">she didn&#39;t even have memories of it but</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:25.910" style="s2">her trauma had gone right back into</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.450" end="00:28:28.340" style="s2">childhood and she was able to realize</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.910" end="00:28:31.190" style="s2">these patterns that had led to her</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.340" end="00:28:33.430" style="s2">eventual rape more recent sexual assault</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.190" end="00:28:35.990" style="s2">where she was fulfilling these these</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.430" end="00:28:38.450" style="s2">rigid behavioral roles since her</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.990" end="00:28:40.070" style="s2">childhood and she was able to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.450" end="00:28:41.690" style="s2">environment that she was in that was a</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.070" end="00:28:43.820" style="s2">dangerous one where she was actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.690" end="00:28:49.010" style="s2">still living with the perpetrator Wow</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.820" end="00:28:52.400" style="s2">yes so very positive effect okay so it</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.010" end="00:28:58.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t make her excuse it like it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.400" end="00:29:02.540" style="s2">and she worked very hard on cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.730" end="00:29:05.870" style="s2">a lot of research about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.540" end="00:29:08.870" style="s2">sexual abuse and the prevalence of it in</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.870" end="00:29:09.080" style="s2">society after the rape I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.870" end="00:29:10.670" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.080" end="00:29:13.550" style="s2">MDMA actually made it easier for her to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.670" end="00:29:14.810" style="s2">tackle those issues and to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.550" end="00:29:17.150" style="s2">something it would be quite triggering</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.810" end="00:29:21.580" style="s2">otherwise and she used that knowledge to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.150" end="00:29:25.010" style="s2">empower and to teach other women yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.580" end="00:29:27.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a lot of people have said</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.010" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">we&#39;ll MDMA work with complex trauma</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.530" end="00:29:32.810" style="s2">where people are abused as a child and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:37.220" style="s2">they&#39;re continually raised in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.810" end="00:29:39.350" style="s2">abusive environment as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.220" end="00:29:41.300" style="s2">like a one-time sexual assault or</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.350" end="00:29:43.340" style="s2">something like that and so we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.300" end="00:29:45.890" style="s2">lot of people that have had that chronic</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.340" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">kind of complex trauma that still have</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.890" end="00:29:50.450" style="s2">been able to be healed with</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">mdma-assisted therapy and the way in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.450" end="00:29:57.890" style="s2">which it seems to to work a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:30:00.800" style="s2">that just a lot of its just processing</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.890" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">the the emotions people are when things</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.800" end="00:30:03.500" style="s2">are happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:05.570" style="s2">they tend a lot of times people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.500" end="00:30:08.060" style="s2">dissociate so we have a measure of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.570" end="00:30:09.980" style="s2">dissociation and we find that those</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.060" end="00:30:13.160" style="s2">people that are higher on dissociation</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.980" end="00:30:15.050" style="s2">take longer to heal because it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.160" end="00:30:16.250" style="s2">while the fear is so great that that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.050" end="00:30:18.050" style="s2">their defense strategy</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.250" end="00:30:19.940" style="s2">yes association at one point in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.050" end="00:30:22.010" style="s2">trauma saved them from the full</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.940" end="00:30:23.810" style="s2">experience of the moments in which they</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.010" end="00:30:26.210" style="s2">were traumatized so it&#39;s a protective</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.810" end="00:30:27.860" style="s2">mechanism which is why it you know in</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.210" end="00:30:29.330" style="s2">the brain it&#39;s so locked in because this</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.860" end="00:30:32.600" style="s2">is you know this is what allowed me to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.330" end="00:30:36.380" style="s2">survive yeah and it also helps you to</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.600" end="00:30:38.600" style="s2">stay conscious to pay attention to ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.380" end="00:30:41.000" style="s2">you might escape or ways so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.600" end="00:30:43.460" style="s2">not just yeah it&#39;s both helping you with</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.000" end="00:30:45.080" style="s2">really painful emotions but also you</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.460" end="00:30:46.820" style="s2">know definitely you know ideas that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.080" end="00:30:48.860" style="s2">might get about increasing your chance</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.820" end="00:30:52.310" style="s2">to survive yeah I think it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.860" end="00:30:54.020" style="s2">interesting how MDMA actually is likely</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.310" end="00:30:56.930" style="s2">to be what the mechanism is in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.020" end="00:31:00.790" style="s2">of how it heals trauma this idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.930" end="00:31:03.500" style="s2">by remembering the trauma in a safe</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.790" end="00:31:06.530" style="s2">cognitive space in a sense of love and a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.500" end="00:31:09.950" style="s2">sense of complete ease that we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.530" end="00:31:11.420" style="s2">change the emotive aspects of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.950" end="00:31:13.130" style="s2">memory could you explain a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.420" end="00:31:16.070" style="s2">about how that works</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.130" end="00:31:18.050" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s lucky for me the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.070" end="00:31:19.910" style="s2">da to make a drug into a medicine you</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.050" end="00:31:22.100" style="s2">have to prove safety and efficacy but</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.910" end="00:31:24.980" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to prove mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.100" end="00:31:26.570" style="s2">action so but we do know a lot from</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.980" end="00:31:29.210" style="s2">other people have funded mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.570" end="00:31:32.450" style="s2">action so the emotions get frozen when</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.210" end="00:31:33.890" style="s2">they happen there&#39;s the fear processing</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.450" end="00:31:36.590" style="s2">part of the brain the amygdala which</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.890" end="00:31:38.780" style="s2">over time actually in PTSD patients gets</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.590" end="00:31:41.930" style="s2">more and more active you kind of repeat</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.780" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">these fear cycles stuckness yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.930" end="00:31:47.350" style="s2">prefrontal cortex where we kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:49.940" style="s2">logically and put things in context that</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.350" end="00:31:53.480" style="s2">shrinks for people in PTSD their</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.940" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">emotional sense of self yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.480" end="00:31:59.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a with MDMA it almost does the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">opposite it does the opposite it reduces</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.690" end="00:32:05.540" style="s2">activity in the amygdala so you can take</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">fear emotions and then it increases</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.540" end="00:32:11.150" style="s2">activity in the prefrontal cortex but</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:12.890" style="s2">the other key part is that it increases</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.150" end="00:32:14.750" style="s2">the connection between the hippocampus</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.890" end="00:32:17.510" style="s2">where memories are processed and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.750" end="00:32:19.640" style="s2">amygdala so fear-based memories can now</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.510" end="00:32:21.050" style="s2">move out of this place where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.640" end="00:32:24.230" style="s2">they&#39;re always still happening or about</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.050" end="00:32:26.240" style="s2">to happen which is what the the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.230" end="00:32:27.830" style="s2">what you talked about with time you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.240" end="00:32:29.390" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of stuck in the past that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.830" end="00:32:31.910" style="s2">you haven&#39;t been able to put something</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.390" end="00:32:34.040" style="s2">in the past and and so this movement of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.910" end="00:32:36.230" style="s2">memory from this kind of immediate</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.040" end="00:32:38.120" style="s2">through processing an often that takes</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.230" end="00:32:40.510" style="s2">place emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.120" end="00:32:44.210" style="s2">crying but also a lot through the body</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.510" end="00:32:46.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a expert in PTSD dr. Bessel</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.210" end="00:32:48.800" style="s2">Vandercook yeah and his book is really</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.700" end="00:32:53.690" style="s2">terrific and it&#39;s called the body Keith</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.800" end="00:32:55.580" style="s2">the school yeah listening out there</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.690" end="00:32:59.660" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s principal investigator on our</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.580" end="00:33:01.550" style="s2">Boston site yes yeah and so what we see</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.660" end="00:33:04.310" style="s2">a lot of times is that it comes out not</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.550" end="00:33:06.590" style="s2">in like necessarily like realizations</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.310" end="00:33:07.720" style="s2">but it comes out in the release of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.590" end="00:33:10.250" style="s2">energy in the body</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.720" end="00:33:12.950" style="s2">people could be shaking or crying or are</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.250" end="00:33:15.070" style="s2">just like kicking or just like for</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.950" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">extended periods of time sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.070" end="00:33:20.990" style="s2">resolving what they couldn&#39;t do in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:23.960" style="s2">moment yeah yeah well processing I went</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.990" end="00:33:27.260" style="s2">yeah kind of an resolving yeah that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.960" end="00:33:29.929" style="s2">like stored all this energy that&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.260" end="00:33:32.090" style="s2">released it&#39;s like you know after it</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.929" end="00:33:33.619" style="s2">like grieving you know you can hold that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.090" end="00:33:34.519" style="s2">grieving and then when you cry and can</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.619" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">grieve than you</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.519" end="00:33:40.360" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve taken it in more and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:42.710" style="s2">things change and you can move on to</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.360" end="00:33:44.659" style="s2">express those emotions can be difficult</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.710" end="00:33:49.129" style="s2">but it is there it&#39;s very important very</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.659" end="00:33:52.249" style="s2">much I also like the idea that MDMA the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.129" end="00:33:53.269" style="s2">concept that was in memory every time we</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.249" end="00:33:56.570" style="s2">remember something</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.269" end="00:33:58.639" style="s2">we don&#39;t just reread the file we take</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.570" end="00:34:01.669" style="s2">out the file put it on a laptop and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.639" end="00:34:04.639" style="s2">retype it yeah yeah it&#39;s recreated each</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.669" end="00:34:06.769" style="s2">time we remember something and MDMA what</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.639" end="00:34:09.349" style="s2">may be happening is when we remember</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.769" end="00:34:11.300" style="s2">this this moment in this context of love</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.349" end="00:34:13.429" style="s2">and acceptance we re encode the memory</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.300" end="00:34:17.659" style="s2">without the fear and without the pain</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.429" end="00:34:20.210" style="s2">yeah so I was just at the Czech National</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.659" end="00:34:23.960" style="s2">Institute of Mental Health earlier today</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.210" end="00:34:25.250" style="s2">and they were doing you know as for</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.960" end="00:34:28.119" style="s2">mental health and they were showing me</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.250" end="00:34:30.440" style="s2">some of the research that they do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.119" end="00:34:32.780" style="s2">with rats and they have one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.440" end="00:34:36.710" style="s2">called episodic memory so it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.780" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to see if how much rats</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.710" end="00:34:42.950" style="s2">can remember about a particular maze and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:45.169" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a memory for the episode but</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.950" end="00:34:47.480" style="s2">our memories are sort of combinations of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.169" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">episodic memory and emotional memory and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.480" end="00:34:53.619" style="s2">so what we see with MDMA for trauma is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:55.669" style="s2">that the episodic memory is increased</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.619" end="00:34:58.250" style="s2">because so much of it was linked with</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.669" end="00:35:00.260" style="s2">pain and was forgotten or suppressed or</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.250" end="00:35:02.420" style="s2">some conscious so people under the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.260" end="00:35:06.079" style="s2">influence of MDMA have an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.420" end="00:35:09.230" style="s2">memory of what actually happened but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:11.630" style="s2">emotional memory is switched around from</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.230" end="00:35:13.630" style="s2">the panic and the fear associated in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.630" end="00:35:16.339" style="s2">lack of trust in the world has changed</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.630" end="00:35:18.710" style="s2">to a sense that you&#39;re processing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.339" end="00:35:20.890" style="s2">peacefully it was in the past and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.710" end="00:35:24.440" style="s2">then when the memory gets reconsolidated</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.890" end="00:35:26.660" style="s2">it&#39;s you even have a better episodic</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.440" end="00:35:28.609" style="s2">memory and you&#39;ve switched the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.660" end="00:35:30.559" style="s2">tone which is really important feeling</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.609" end="00:35:31.940" style="s2">and you&#39;re growing new neurons</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.559" end="00:35:33.619" style="s2">so there&#39;s neurogenesis there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.940" end="00:35:39.049" style="s2">different pathways and we&#39;ve shown that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.619" end="00:35:41.809" style="s2">after PTSD treatment in a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.049" end="00:35:43.730" style="s2">patients the amygdala activity is</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.809" end="00:35:47.150" style="s2">actually reduced you can show physical</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.730" end="00:35:48.740" style="s2">consequences of changes in brain and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.150" end="00:35:51.400" style="s2">genuine structural changes in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.740" end="00:35:53.720" style="s2">yeah well these are just so far just</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.400" end="00:35:55.579" style="s2">activity yeah I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.720" end="00:35:56.839" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve shown but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.579" end="00:35:59.119" style="s2">there are studies now more and more</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:36:01.160" style="s2">showing neurogenesis from MDMA and other</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.119" end="00:36:03.380" style="s2">psychedelics but I don&#39;t think that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.160" end="00:36:06.829" style="s2">neuroscientists have shown new</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.380" end="00:36:09.880" style="s2">structural pathways yet maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.829" end="00:36:12.440" style="s2">change it changing connectivity yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.880" end="00:36:14.690" style="s2">bringing it back to this concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.440" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">mystical experience or peak experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.690" end="00:36:20.060" style="s2">we see I think interchangeable terms</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:21.560" style="s2">mystical experience and peak experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.060" end="00:36:24.109" style="s2">peak experience being defined by Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.560" end="00:36:27.230" style="s2">Maslow as a important step for</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.109" end="00:36:30.290" style="s2">self-actualization on the hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.230" end="00:36:33.050" style="s2">needs so what is it about this peak</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.290" end="00:36:35.869" style="s2">experience that you feel connects people</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.050" end="00:36:37.750" style="s2">to meaning in their lives and to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.869" end="00:36:40.040" style="s2">interchange mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.750" end="00:36:42.500" style="s2">well it&#39;s so interesting you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.040" end="00:36:44.210" style="s2">that about Maslow so from the knees</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.500" end="00:36:46.849" style="s2">hierarchy where you&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.210" end="00:36:48.440" style="s2">self-actualization as being the top and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.849" end="00:36:51.079" style="s2">then here so it&#39;s more like your</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.440" end="00:36:53.540" style="s2">survival needs your community social</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.079" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">needs and then self-actualization at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.540" end="00:36:59.390" style="s2">top so the peak experience idea is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:03.829" style="s2">actually something that Maslow changed</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.390" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">his ideas over time and what he he</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.829" end="00:37:07.640" style="s2">started humanistic psychology and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:10.040" style="s2">had this kind of need hierarchy but he</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.640" end="00:37:12.200" style="s2">also near the end of his life started</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.040" end="00:37:14.329" style="s2">transpersonal psychology and so he</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.200" end="00:37:16.810" style="s2">changed the need Harkey so that it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.329" end="00:37:20.329" style="s2">self transcendence above</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.810" end="00:37:23.540" style="s2">self-actualization and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.329" end="00:37:26.780" style="s2">movement towards kind of global</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.540" end="00:37:27.890" style="s2">spirituality or spirituality you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.780" end="00:37:30.230" style="s2">that that&#39;s seeing the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.890" end="00:37:32.859" style="s2">and and then it comes with that a</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.230" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">certain peacefulness about death and a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.859" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">transcendence of time and space and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:41.960" style="s2">the peak experience is meant to be this</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:46.040" style="s2">meaning of life the sense of how we fit</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.960" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">into this bigger picture and but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.040" end="00:37:49.579" style="s2">many different kinds of peak experiences</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:51.230" style="s2">you know that they&#39;re not all like some</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.579" end="00:37:53.569" style="s2">of them are you know just doing things</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.230" end="00:37:56.150" style="s2">that you&#39;re very proud of yes like who</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.569" end="00:37:57.509" style="s2">you could hike and climb a mountain that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.150" end="00:38:00.239" style="s2">could be a big experience or</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.509" end="00:38:02.759" style="s2">could take them milligrams of psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.239" end="00:38:05.189" style="s2">and that would be another form of having</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.759" end="00:38:09.299" style="s2">a evidence-based peak experience which</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.189" end="00:38:11.489" style="s2">has a potential to shift our lives and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.299" end="00:38:12.929" style="s2">was interested in the word transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.489" end="00:38:17.369" style="s2">psychology is are not sure if everyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.929" end="00:38:19.909" style="s2">is familiar with that and you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.369" end="00:38:23.159" style="s2">your mentees centers of Graf yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.909" end="00:38:26.099" style="s2">yeah how that has shaped your connection</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.159" end="00:38:27.479" style="s2">to psychedelics and what and yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.099" end="00:38:29.759" style="s2">the book you asked before about books</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.479" end="00:38:32.849" style="s2">and so where I learned about</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.759" end="00:38:36.299" style="s2">transpersonal psychology and where so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.849" end="00:38:38.069" style="s2">was you know eighteen and had taken a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.299" end="00:38:40.229" style="s2">lot of LSD and was very confused and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.069" end="00:38:43.199" style="s2">knew I wanted to drop out of college and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.229" end="00:38:45.989" style="s2">went to the guidance counselor at my</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.199" end="00:38:47.759" style="s2">college and said help me you know make</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.989" end="00:38:51.209" style="s2">sense of all this all these raging</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.759" end="00:38:53.279" style="s2">emotions and ideas and and so he gave me</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.209" end="00:38:55.589" style="s2">realms of the human unconscious by Stan</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.279" end="00:38:59.719" style="s2">Grof to read and that&#39;s where I first</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.589" end="00:39:01.909" style="s2">started understanding about this</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.719" end="00:39:06.359" style="s2">transcendence of self or the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.909" end="00:39:09.719" style="s2">transpersonal means between it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.359" end="00:39:11.639" style="s2">something that we all have you know so</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.719" end="00:39:12.869" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s beyond the personal so we</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.639" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">all have the confrontation with death</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.869" end="00:39:19.109" style="s2">and we all have the need for community</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.839" end="00:39:21.719" style="s2">and love and the need for you know all</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.109" end="00:39:24.029" style="s2">the things in the need hurricane yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.719" end="00:39:29.089" style="s2">and so I started realizing that here was</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.029" end="00:39:31.589" style="s2">a way through a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.089" end="00:39:33.479" style="s2">experiments with thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.589" end="00:39:36.359" style="s2">under the influence of LSD where I me</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.479" end="00:39:38.609" style="s2">Stan said that the LSD is like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.359" end="00:39:42.119" style="s2">telescope to astronomy or the microscope</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.609" end="00:39:44.729" style="s2">to biology LSD is for the mind like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.119" end="00:39:46.859" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a really powerful court and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.729" end="00:39:49.049" style="s2">quite accurate yeah and so from all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.859" end="00:39:51.659" style="s2">what he was saying here was this broad</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.049" end="00:39:54.719" style="s2">understanding of where the psyche goes</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.659" end="00:39:56.279" style="s2">and it goes into these there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.719" end="00:39:58.529" style="s2">want to give up down kind of metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.279" end="00:40:01.619" style="s2">but it it extends like a rainbow or</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.529" end="00:40:06.289" style="s2">something into these shared kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.619" end="00:40:08.849" style="s2">spiritual areas that give you meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.289" end="00:40:10.050" style="s2">for your life and give meaning to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.849" end="00:40:12.750" style="s2">daily moments</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.050" end="00:40:14.940" style="s2">and gratitude for the chance to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.750" end="00:40:17.100" style="s2">and that their transformative yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.940" end="00:40:18.750" style="s2">think spiritualism can be it&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.100" end="00:40:21.660" style="s2">word for some people particularly of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.750" end="00:40:24.060" style="s2">scientific bent but we are shifting in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.660" end="00:40:25.950" style="s2">our relationship to that word I I love</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.060" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">how the neuroscientist Sam Harris has</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.950" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">come out with his experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">evidence-based spirituality if there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:34.080" style="s2">such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:35.940" style="s2">I think psychedelics look kind of relate</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.080" end="00:40:37.530" style="s2">to that do you know what sam harris said</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.940" end="00:40:44.300" style="s2">was his most mystical experience of his</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.530" end="00:40:44.300" style="s2">life that he&#39;s written about MDMA MDMA</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.140" end="00:40:56.520" style="s2">yeah you are at first empty was it your</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.670" end="00:40:58.530" style="s2">first no no spiritual moment can you</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.520" end="00:41:00.300" style="s2">share that with us yeah well okay so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.530" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">this was at a point in time were also</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.300" end="00:41:04.530" style="s2">not it was around the time that I had</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:08.670" style="s2">the ibogaine experience was also in</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.530" end="00:41:10.740" style="s2">early 85 and I had been working with</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.670" end="00:41:12.750" style="s2">brother David Stein the wrost I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.740" end="00:41:14.460" style="s2">he&#39;d come and taught some classes at</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.750" end="00:41:16.590" style="s2">Esalen that Stan had organized that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.460" end="00:41:19.260" style="s2">participated in and when I learned about</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.590" end="00:41:21.800" style="s2">MD and I got I really appreciated him</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.260" end="00:41:23.790" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of a Roman Catholic mystic</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.800" end="00:41:25.560" style="s2">open-minded and when I was learning</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.790" end="00:41:27.660" style="s2">about MDMA I started talking to him</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.560" end="00:41:30.270" style="s2">about it and eventually he said he</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.660" end="00:41:32.700" style="s2">wanted to do that in the monastery as</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.270" end="00:41:37.050" style="s2">half doses for meditation and he was</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.700" end="00:41:38.730" style="s2">willing to do it and so it was this</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.050" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">period of time where were engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.730" end="00:41:45.720" style="s2">fight with the DEA we&#39;re about to sue</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:48.150" style="s2">them and also I had no relationship at</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.720" end="00:41:51.510" style="s2">the time and so I was feeling alone and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.150" end="00:41:57.540" style="s2">so I decided that I would I had a power</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.510" end="00:42:02.280" style="s2">spot at Esalen for me it was beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.540" end="00:42:04.680" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah I spent a bunch of time</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.280" end="00:42:07.950" style="s2">there and with sanin otherwise so</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.680" end="00:42:10.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a creek that goes through the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.950" end="00:42:14.460" style="s2">property there&#39;s the big house that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.320" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">there&#39;s the near the small waterfall</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.460" end="00:42:20.760" style="s2">near where the right at the edge of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:23.550" style="s2">cliffs so where that waterfall goes down</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.760" end="00:42:25.650" style="s2">and it goes into the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.550" end="00:42:27.420" style="s2">right on the other side of it so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.650" end="00:42:30.090" style="s2">a path from the big house that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.420" end="00:42:32.610" style="s2">get down from the rest of esslyn which</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.090" end="00:42:35.610" style="s2">is their rooms and the hot bath so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.610" end="00:42:38.100" style="s2">the hot tubs and the where the guests</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.610" end="00:42:40.020" style="s2">stay but across the river across the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.100" end="00:42:41.900" style="s2">bridge you come from the other side and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.020" end="00:42:44.760" style="s2">you go down to where the river is and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.900" end="00:42:47.460" style="s2">then you walk across it it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.760" end="00:42:49.650" style="s2">deep and there&#39;s a little spot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.460" end="00:42:52.260" style="s2">about the size of this bench where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.650" end="00:42:55.290" style="s2">mountain comes right behind and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.260" end="00:42:58.710" style="s2">enormous boulders that are you know out</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.290" end="00:43:01.800" style="s2">in front of you ways out but so the high</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.710" end="00:43:03.750" style="s2">tide comes right around and right to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.800" end="00:43:06.540" style="s2">there and I would but you could be in</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.750" end="00:43:08.130" style="s2">this little spot surrounded by at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.540" end="00:43:10.470" style="s2">most you&#39;re safe and dry the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.130" end="00:43:13.530" style="s2">no matter what the tide does but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.470" end="00:43:17.340" style="s2">right nearby mountain behind you the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.530" end="00:43:19.350" style="s2">river and is safe though I felt so this</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.340" end="00:43:24.330" style="s2">was where I decided to do MDMA by myself</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.350" end="00:43:27.270" style="s2">at night down and camping out and just</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.330" end="00:43:28.980" style="s2">feeling really really safe with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.270" end="00:43:32.130" style="s2">universe it felt like the universe was</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.980" end="00:43:34.770" style="s2">my front yard you know the ocean was the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.130" end="00:43:37.890" style="s2">front yard and the sky and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.770" end="00:43:40.740" style="s2">the night was spent looking at a tree</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.890" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">and somehow imagining that the tree was</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.740" end="00:43:45.360" style="s2">the DEA and different people were in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.220" style="s2">tree were looking at me in different</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.360" end="00:43:49.950" style="s2">ways and I was trying to negotiate this</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.220" end="00:43:53.010" style="s2">idea of how do I sue the DEA and stay</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.950" end="00:43:56.190" style="s2">safe and so I came to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.010" end="00:43:58.140" style="s2">from that that that somehow they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.190" end="00:43:59.670" style="s2">always looking for under the rock or</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.140" end="00:44:02.490" style="s2">what&#39;s being hidden and if you come</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.670" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">directly Adam there is a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.490" end="00:44:07.710" style="s2">safety event and so I felt comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:11.690" style="s2">with that but then I started thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.710" end="00:44:14.850" style="s2">about why would brother David want to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.690" end="00:44:17.300" style="s2">celibate why would anybody want I could</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.850" end="00:44:20.280" style="s2">understand more wanting to be reflective</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.300" end="00:44:21.780" style="s2">you know and spend time meditating and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.280" end="00:44:24.210" style="s2">discipline but why would somebody want</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.780" end="00:44:27.330" style="s2">to you know not have human relationships</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.210" end="00:44:29.870" style="s2">like that and be sahabat or not have</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.330" end="00:44:32.730" style="s2">human sexual relationships like that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.870" end="00:44:35.400" style="s2">so I just started thinking about him for</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.730" end="00:44:36.010" style="s2">a while and just speculating on it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.400" end="00:44:38.590" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.010" end="00:44:41.830" style="s2">I started thinking that here I was this</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.590" end="00:44:44.050" style="s2">the roar of the ocean was incredible and</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.830" end="00:44:47.740" style="s2">the the the vastness of the Stars and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.050" end="00:44:51.430" style="s2">just thought man I&#39;m so tiny compared to</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.740" end="00:44:52.810" style="s2">all of this and and I could just the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.430" end="00:44:54.190" style="s2">more I beheld the bigger account I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.810" end="00:44:57.340" style="s2">like I was just fly up I would lose</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.190" end="00:44:59.560" style="s2">myself and I would just fly up and and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.340" end="00:45:02.290" style="s2">thought how come after a while I</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.560" end="00:45:04.120" style="s2">realized I was still there somehow</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.290" end="00:45:06.760" style="s2">that there was something that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.120" end="00:45:10.210" style="s2">keeping me there I didn&#39;t just fly out</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.760" end="00:45:11.860" style="s2">into the universe and I started just</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.210" end="00:45:13.180" style="s2">pondering the fact that it was gravity</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.860" end="00:45:16.500" style="s2">it was the thing that holds things</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.180" end="00:45:18.520" style="s2">together that that there was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.500" end="00:45:20.950" style="s2">without gravity we would all be</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.520" end="00:45:24.760" style="s2">dispersed and everything would be you</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.950" end="00:45:28.210" style="s2">know uniform or whatever so I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.760" end="00:45:30.190" style="s2">this gravity was this force of love and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.210" end="00:45:33.100" style="s2">that it was holding things together and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.190" end="00:45:35.140" style="s2">then I felt it as if it was the arms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.100" end="00:45:38.170" style="s2">a lover and I felt like I was being</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.140" end="00:45:41.530" style="s2">cradled in the arms of gravity and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.170" end="00:45:43.360" style="s2">was so warm and rich that I and then I</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.530" end="00:45:46.120" style="s2">thought that&#39;s what the monastic life is</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.360" end="00:45:48.430" style="s2">about is that if you can have this</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.120" end="00:45:50.680" style="s2">warmth to the universe if you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.430" end="00:45:53.110" style="s2">somehow you don&#39;t you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.680" end="00:45:55.300" style="s2">come from an individual it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.110" end="00:45:59.740" style="s2">the universe and if you can feel it that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.300" end="00:46:03.100" style="s2">way that warm and so I felt like I</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.740" end="00:46:04.510" style="s2">understood a bit about the monastic life</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.100" end="00:46:06.430" style="s2">and I thought well great I&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.510" end="00:46:20.770" style="s2">with MDMA now I don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.430" end="00:46:22.630" style="s2">celibate so thirty years later I was at</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.770" end="00:46:26.080" style="s2">a conference and I was able to sit next</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.630" end="00:46:27.880" style="s2">to brother David 30 years after that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.080" end="00:46:29.650" style="s2">I was like for other day but I had this</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.880" end="00:46:32.020" style="s2">experience most spiritual experience my</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.650" end="00:46:33.940" style="s2">life you weren&#39;t involved in it you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.020" end="00:46:37.510" style="s2">and I want to just describe it to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.940" end="00:46:39.250" style="s2">and see what you think of it so he said</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.510" end="00:46:40.900" style="s2">ok so I told him that story and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.250" end="00:46:43.360" style="s2">afterwards he looked at me just for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.900" end="00:46:47.100" style="s2">second and he said he said Rick I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.360" end="00:46:47.100" style="s2">of gravity every day</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.290" end="00:46:52.040" style="s2">he had the relationship yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.630" end="00:46:55.130" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how you said you felt</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.040" end="00:46:59.420" style="s2">like the ocean the stars were your front</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.130" end="00:47:01.700" style="s2">yard and yet that they are we always</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.420" end="00:47:03.620" style="s2">forget yeah I don&#39;t it wonderful when</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.700" end="00:47:07.220" style="s2">you when you have when you feel that way</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.620" end="00:47:09.380" style="s2">and you know it yeah and I think feeling</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.220" end="00:47:11.330" style="s2">it is part of knowing it actually Rita</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.380" end="00:47:13.670" style="s2">Marley who is married to Bob Marley she</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.330" end="00:47:15.650" style="s2">had the album that&#39;s a terrific album</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.670" end="00:47:18.680" style="s2">and the name of the album is who feels</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.650" end="00:47:20.240" style="s2">it knows it that&#39;s the connection we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.680" end="00:47:22.370" style="s2">looking for something definitely that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.240" end="00:47:24.500" style="s2">psychedelics can provide us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.370" end="00:47:26.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s a great launchpad for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.500" end="00:47:29.780" style="s2">rest of your life looks like I like just</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.750" end="00:47:32.900" style="s2">tools it is one one facet of a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.780" end="00:47:34.790" style="s2">life yeah although I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.900" end="00:47:36.980" style="s2">there&#39;s many different journeys to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.790" end="00:47:39.140" style="s2">launched on throughout your life yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.980" end="00:47:41.570" style="s2">I see that psychedelics have a different</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.140" end="00:47:43.790" style="s2">role at different stages of y&#39;all I like</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.570" end="00:47:46.220" style="s2">this point very much I myself am NOT a</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.790" end="00:47:47.450" style="s2">fan of the Alan Watts quote that once</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.220" end="00:47:48.830" style="s2">you get the message hang up the phone</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.450" end="00:47:50.300" style="s2">like everything could be terrible if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.830" end="00:47:51.980" style="s2">had you know never taken a female</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.300" end="00:47:54.980" style="s2">psychedelics again after that you had</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.980" end="00:47:56.900" style="s2">that moment of a reunion with nature</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.980" end="00:47:59.420" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more to learn and at</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.900" end="00:48:02.030" style="s2">different times yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.420" end="00:48:03.980" style="s2">there&#39;s many different messages it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.030" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a certain we all want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.980" end="00:48:09.530" style="s2">have the message I know the truth I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:11.180" style="s2">got the message and then you can relax</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.530" end="00:48:12.520" style="s2">but things are constantly changing I</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.180" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">would say one of the things that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.520" end="00:48:16.520" style="s2">terrible about Trump just to make a</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:17.090" style="s2">pivot there is let&#39;s make America great</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.520" end="00:48:19.370" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.090" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">I mean you can&#39;t be great again in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.370" end="00:48:24.170" style="s2">way of the past you have to be great in</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:26.450" style="s2">response to the changing of the future</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.170" end="00:48:29.960" style="s2">and the yeah and looking forward like</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.450" end="00:48:32.090" style="s2">that and engaging with an evolving</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.960" end="00:48:33.710" style="s2">process that&#39;s constantly moving</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.090" end="00:48:37.010" style="s2">yeah and when you think I&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.710" end="00:48:39.620" style="s2">truth or I&#39;ve got the message it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.010" end="00:48:44.840" style="s2">of fixed in time and it&#39;s a lazy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.620" end="00:48:47.240" style="s2">way of thinking actually yes also a bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.840" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">of a workout for the mind I going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.240" end="00:48:51.800" style="s2">assume for the mind and they definitely</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:53.150" style="s2">encourage your laziness do they yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.800" end="00:48:55.880" style="s2">at all and I think the other part is</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.150" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">that there&#39;s some there&#39;s another part</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.880" end="00:48:59.870" style="s2">of that that&#39;s really a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.440" end="00:49:02.210" style="s2">which is that we can see things clearly</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.870" end="00:49:04.010" style="s2">and know anything clearly or certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.210" end="00:49:06.590" style="s2">we&#39;re always seeing through filters we</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.010" end="00:49:08.510" style="s2">have unconscious filters so we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.590" end="00:49:13.610" style="s2">have confidence that we really know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.510" end="00:49:16.490" style="s2">going and you know to keep questioning</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.610" end="00:49:17.000" style="s2">you know is important to not think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.490" end="00:49:20.450" style="s2">got it</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.000" end="00:49:22.520" style="s2">questioning and keep trying I think very</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.450" end="00:49:24.760" style="s2">funnily of the chain of emails we had</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.520" end="00:49:27.860" style="s2">when we had synonyms for the word</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.760" end="00:49:29.420" style="s2">tenacity that&#39;s a sign-off I think I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.860" end="00:49:32.330" style="s2">love it because it&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.420" end="00:49:34.310" style="s2">so embody as a person and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.330" end="00:49:35.690" style="s2">something that we could have more of in</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.310" end="00:49:37.130" style="s2">our lives in the way we approach our</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.690" end="00:49:39.170" style="s2">passions in the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.130" end="00:49:42.050" style="s2">can you tell us a bit how you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.170" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">able to embody this within yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.050" end="00:49:46.340" style="s2">one way is that you know I had this idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:48.590" style="s2">when I was 18 that I wanted to devote my</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.340" end="00:49:50.150" style="s2">life to psychedelics as a response to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.590" end="00:49:52.370" style="s2">both personally what I needed</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.150" end="00:49:54.770" style="s2">well actually I&#39;ll say that at 18 I kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.370" end="00:49:56.420" style="s2">of came up with this idea that there was</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.770" end="00:49:58.010" style="s2">two things that I want to do one was to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.420" end="00:50:00.230" style="s2">learn how to trip and the other was to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.010" end="00:50:03.530" style="s2">learn how to make love and that those</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.230" end="00:50:06.170" style="s2">are ways about inner and outer kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.530" end="00:50:08.120" style="s2">and that I want to work on both of those</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.170" end="00:50:11.570" style="s2">that would be the judge of my life in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.120" end="00:50:24.350" style="s2">way you know those would be that and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.570" end="00:50:28.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve never had a better idea very</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.350" end="00:50:30.830" style="s2">important to how we approach mourning</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.100" end="00:50:34.100" style="s2">how we approach our teen as well how we</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.830" end="00:50:38.240" style="s2">approach our co-workers how we approach</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.100" end="00:50:39.470" style="s2">strangers knowledge yeah and and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.240" end="00:50:43.310" style="s2">a lot of the times too that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.470" end="00:50:46.010" style="s2">resistance to psychedelics and to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.310" end="00:50:49.790" style="s2">integrated them into our culture was a</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.010" end="00:50:52.820" style="s2">fear of change of fear of facing oneself</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.790" end="00:50:54.590" style="s2">that that resistance wasn&#39;t a sign that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.820" end="00:50:56.660" style="s2">I was on the wrong track it was a sign I</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.590" end="00:50:59.480" style="s2">was on the right track and what was</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.660" end="00:51:02.810" style="s2">driving me was the fear that it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.480" end="00:51:04.970" style="s2">nothing the the irrational can take over</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.810" end="00:51:07.910" style="s2">I love the stoic phrase the obstacle is</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.970" end="00:51:09.650" style="s2">the path yeah and I actually love that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.910" end="00:51:11.390" style="s2">you sort of be able to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.650" end="00:51:13.220" style="s2">yourself at that moment when you when</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.390" end="00:51:13.670" style="s2">you approach the obstacle that isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.220" end="00:51:16.069" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.670" end="00:51:18.859" style="s2">you should move back it&#39;s actually get</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.069" end="00:51:21.589" style="s2">closer and find out more because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.859" end="00:51:23.809" style="s2">the way to step over yeah when I was 21</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.589" end="00:51:26.809" style="s2">I had the great opportunity to raise a</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.369" end="00:52:25.790" style="s2">bit more about the character Phaedrus in</p>

<p begin="00:52:25.790" end="00:52:30.799" style="s2">play-doh dialogues and it&#39;s it&#39;s about</p>

<p begin="00:52:30.799" end="00:52:35.480" style="s2">coming to the city it&#39;s about the taming</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.359" end="00:52:39.260" style="s2">power of love and in the book Phaedra</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.480" end="00:52:43.210" style="s2">says this person who also is takes this</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.260" end="00:52:45.530" style="s2">independent way towards quality towards</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.210" end="00:52:48.020" style="s2">what he should be doing in his life but</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.530" end="00:52:51.349" style="s2">he gets obsessive and he kind of goes</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.020" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">crazy lose perspective and goes through</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.349" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">electroconvulsive therapy and so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:52:59.210" style="s2">author who&#39;s writing the book is writing</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.240" end="00:53:00.950" style="s2">from the position of somebody who has</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.210" end="00:53:04.190" style="s2">been transformed by electroconvulsive</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.950" end="00:53:08.329" style="s2">therapy and is now more grounded and his</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.190" end="00:53:11.770" style="s2">prior self was Phaedra&#39;s was this no</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.329" end="00:53:14.869" style="s2">wild person from the country who was</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.770" end="00:53:18.680" style="s2">sort of pure and wild in a way and now</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.869" end="00:53:21.049" style="s2">he was having to be worked with him to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.680" end="00:53:23.359" style="s2">contact himself and transform him in</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.049" end="00:53:25.369" style="s2">some way yeah and there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:26.980" style="s2">between his crazy self in a way which</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.369" end="00:53:31.780" style="s2">had virtue and his career</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.980" end="00:53:34.960" style="s2">self and so vedras was my alter ego in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.780" end="00:53:36.790" style="s2">way too because I was wanting I felt</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.960" end="00:53:39.340" style="s2">like you know I want to get past culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.790" end="00:53:42.580" style="s2">and why I brought this up was this idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.340" end="00:53:45.130" style="s2">of the obstacle the way that I built my</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.580" end="00:53:47.020" style="s2">I built a house at the edge of town when</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.130" end="00:53:49.869" style="s2">I was 21 and there was thousand acres</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.020" end="00:53:53.500" style="s2">across the street that was undeveloped</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.869" end="00:53:56.380" style="s2">railroad tracks and little ponds kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.500" end="00:53:58.420" style="s2">tiny tiny little ponds not a lake for</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.380" end="00:54:01.240" style="s2">anything but little hills and different</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.420" end="00:54:04.540" style="s2">trees and burned-out areas of the forest</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.240" end="00:54:08.080" style="s2">and I could take Phaedra&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.540" end="00:54:09.730" style="s2">through the woods off leash and there</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.080" end="00:54:13.300" style="s2">was a few horses there and some things</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.730" end="00:54:16.359" style="s2">but so the way that he moved through the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.300" end="00:54:18.220" style="s2">woods was a lesson to me and I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.359" end="00:54:19.960" style="s2">about him almost every day something</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.220" end="00:54:22.840" style="s2">that because what he would do is he went</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.960" end="00:54:25.359" style="s2">straight for his goal and if there was</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.840" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">like a hill in front of it he would just</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.359" end="00:54:29.410" style="s2">he has so much energy he would just go</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:31.660" style="s2">over the hill he would go through bushes</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.410" end="00:54:33.670" style="s2">he would just cruise where he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.660" end="00:54:35.109" style="s2">go and if there was a you know a gully</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.670" end="00:54:37.660" style="s2">and stuff you would just go down in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.109" end="00:54:41.500" style="s2">neuron and you noticed like here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.660" end="00:54:45.850" style="s2">a sidewalk in modern society westerns</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.500" end="00:54:48.040" style="s2">that there&#39;s sidewalks always and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.850" end="00:54:49.750" style="s2">they&#39;re not always the most direct way</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.040" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">to get there and sometimes they involve</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.750" end="00:54:53.650" style="s2">a tiny bit of an obstacle like in front</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.420" style="s2">of a building there&#39;ll be a little hill</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.650" end="00:54:57.310" style="s2">but you have to walk way around those</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.420" end="00:54:59.590" style="s2">hill but if you just walk over the hill</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.310" end="00:55:01.780" style="s2">you&#39;d get there faster and you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.590" end="00:55:04.150" style="s2">some exercise so the way he moved</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.780" end="00:55:05.920" style="s2">through the world was this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.150" end="00:55:08.140" style="s2">obstacles were opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.920" end="00:55:10.930" style="s2">exercise and finding he&#39;s authentic path</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.140" end="00:55:13.540" style="s2">I guess yeah yeah and he had this quiet</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.930" end="00:55:15.550" style="s2">confidence one thing I learned about</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.540" end="00:55:16.990" style="s2">from him was and it&#39;s connected to</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.550" end="00:55:19.240" style="s2">psychedelics I was a little bit nervous</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.990" end="00:55:21.220" style="s2">about the police at that time and I had</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.240" end="00:55:23.890" style="s2">a bunch of big LSD stash and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.220" end="00:55:26.350" style="s2">friend I asked him if he would store it</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.890" end="00:55:28.450" style="s2">for me at his house and he had five</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.350" end="00:55:31.080" style="s2">acres and a kind of a farm and he had</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.450" end="00:55:33.850" style="s2">this big Doberman that wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.080" end="00:55:35.950" style="s2">friendly but that I knew and so there</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.850" end="00:55:40.000" style="s2">was a time I wanted to trip and so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.950" end="00:55:40.750" style="s2">went over to his house to get some LSD</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.000" end="00:55:44.260" style="s2">but he was</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.750" end="00:55:46.210" style="s2">there and the Doberman it was like out</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.260" end="00:55:49.030" style="s2">back in the barn we&#39;re right where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.210" end="00:55:52.030" style="s2">freezer was but I happen to have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.030" end="00:55:55.060" style="s2">wolf in my truck and the wolf was just</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.030" end="00:55:57.790" style="s2">about five months old or something it</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.060" end="00:55:59.740" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really you know fully growing or</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.790" end="00:56:03.430" style="s2">anything is the and so I thought maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.740" end="00:56:04.570" style="s2">there&#39;s some way because the wolf a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.430" end="00:56:07.930" style="s2">of dogs wouldn&#39;t want to play with him</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.570" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">because he was different but some dogs</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.930" end="00:56:12.670" style="s2">would so I thought okay I&#39;ll get him out</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:15.550" style="s2">of the truck and just see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.670" end="00:56:17.140" style="s2">and so I um took him off the leash and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.550" end="00:56:18.940" style="s2">he wandered around the barn and he saw</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.140" end="00:56:22.150" style="s2">this big door and sort of guarding the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.940" end="00:56:24.280" style="s2">back door where the LSD stash was and he</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.150" end="00:56:28.780" style="s2">just wandered around and he saw the DOE</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.280" end="00:56:31.600" style="s2">buran and and he just kind of casually</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.780" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">kind of stepped on and just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.600" end="00:56:38.350" style="s2">checked him out and it kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:41.050" style="s2">perplexed this Doberman and he just got</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.350" end="00:56:42.730" style="s2">up and and walked away from the door and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.050" end="00:56:45.370" style="s2">left the barn and let me go in and get</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.730" end="00:56:47.410" style="s2">my honesty stash and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.370" end="00:56:49.840" style="s2">Doberman with this was just they were</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.410" end="00:56:50.890" style="s2">big difference in sizes at the time but</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.840" end="00:56:52.840" style="s2">it was just this kind of quiet</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.890" end="00:56:56.820" style="s2">confidence that this wolf had that I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.840" end="00:56:59.530" style="s2">trying to absorb and also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.820" end="00:57:01.960" style="s2">realize that the myth is different than</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.530" end="00:57:03.550" style="s2">the reality that this was first off</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.960" end="00:57:06.970" style="s2">wolves are born with their eyes closed</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.550" end="00:57:08.980" style="s2">for a few days and because the Humane</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.970" end="00:57:12.070" style="s2">Society knew that this wolf was pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.980" end="00:57:13.600" style="s2">they had taken the Cubs away from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.070" end="00:57:15.550" style="s2">mother they were prepared for that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.600" end="00:57:16.780" style="s2">they were raised by people and so when</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.550" end="00:57:19.450" style="s2">they opened their eyes they opened their</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.780" end="00:57:24.280" style="s2">lives on people so they were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.450" end="00:57:29.440" style="s2">bonded to human beings I love this</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.280" end="00:57:31.660" style="s2">aspect of Phaedra&#39;s just dispelling this</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.440" end="00:57:34.900" style="s2">is the sense of myth of the Doberman</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.660" end="00:57:36.610" style="s2">being that the powerful dog or the myth</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.900" end="00:57:38.410" style="s2">of the wolf is how a man it was the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.610" end="00:57:40.630" style="s2">leaping wolves or Wolf&#39;s don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.410" end="00:57:42.850" style="s2">attack people there are great social</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.630" end="00:57:45.580" style="s2">animals they babysit for each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.850" end="00:57:48.100" style="s2">kids they one of the best things about</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.580" end="00:57:50.020" style="s2">wolves is that in the pack when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.100" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a struggle for dominance and</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.020" end="00:57:53.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a fight between like a younger</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:55.460" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.930" end="00:57:58.190" style="s2">reaching maturity and the older wolf</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.460" end="00:58:00.470" style="s2">who&#39;s in charge that rarely all rarely</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.190" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">rarely does the older wolf get killed</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.470" end="00:58:06.200" style="s2">you know they can have these dominant</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">struggles that change things without</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.200" end="00:58:11.720" style="s2">murder so they&#39;re incredible animals and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:14.030" style="s2">there&#39;s something completely different</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.720" end="00:58:16.670" style="s2">from this perspective I hats it sound</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.030" end="00:58:19.160" style="s2">quite scary Saint Amy taming a wolf yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.670" end="00:58:21.619" style="s2">I guess we all we all have these myths</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.160" end="00:58:23.480" style="s2">and personal myths and he gets an</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.619" end="00:58:26.359" style="s2">important things to recheck these</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.480" end="00:58:28.910" style="s2">stories both externally but within</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.359" end="00:58:30.950" style="s2">ourselves and that is what allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.910" end="00:58:33.650" style="s2">move through obstacles to move through</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.950" end="00:58:35.750" style="s2">blockages in and out in our path yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.650" end="00:58:37.309" style="s2">and I knew that the myths of the wolf</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.750" end="00:58:40.369" style="s2">were somewhat similar to the myths of</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.309" end="00:58:41.869" style="s2">psychedelics that we have these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.369" end="00:58:44.240" style="s2">that these are going to drive people</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.869" end="00:58:47.480" style="s2">crazy and that they&#39;re and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.240" end="00:58:52.730" style="s2">some situations where that&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.480" end="00:58:56.380" style="s2">these are tools to be tamed and used but</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.730" end="00:58:58.910" style="s2">tamed in a way where it takes us beyond</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.380" end="00:59:01.099" style="s2">the fences of ourselves so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.910" end="00:59:03.319" style="s2">really tamed it&#39;s a way to use it to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.099" end="00:59:05.180" style="s2">help us grow in ways we might not</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.319" end="00:59:07.040" style="s2">otherwise grow it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.180" end="00:59:11.960" style="s2">relationship you have with them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.040" end="00:59:14.780" style="s2">yeah yeah and so I felt that I I learned</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.960" end="00:59:17.000" style="s2">a lot from just seeing how the myth</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.780" end="00:59:18.980" style="s2">wolves haven&#39;t only rabid wolves have</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.000" end="00:59:21.890" style="s2">ever killed people wolves don&#39;t attack</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.980" end="00:59:24.440" style="s2">people I mean we you know Lions kill</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.890" end="00:59:26.630" style="s2">people Tigers kill people but wolves do</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.440" end="00:59:31.010" style="s2">not kill me no LSD has never killed a</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.630" end="00:59:32.839" style="s2">person not from physically no and people</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.010" end="00:59:35.240" style="s2">have done stupid things and people have</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.839" end="00:59:37.369" style="s2">died there&#39;s and the sentence setting is</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.240" end="00:59:39.109" style="s2">very important yeah there&#39;s people have</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.369" end="00:59:42.980" style="s2">committed suicide under the influence of</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.109" end="00:59:44.540" style="s2">psilocybin or LSD out of fear yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.980" end="00:59:45.589" style="s2">certain setting is very important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.540" end="00:59:46.940" style="s2">not just certain setting for</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.589" end="00:59:48.740" style="s2">psychedelics but I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.940" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">to reflect on a certain setting we have</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.740" end="00:59:53.930" style="s2">just in our lives it&#39;s like a light sky</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:56.599" style="s2">sensitize ourselves to that very much</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.930" end="01:00:00.140" style="s2">and encourage us to be able to change</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.599" end="01:00:04.730" style="s2">and shape what we want for ourselves in</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.140" end="01:00:07.369" style="s2">the world yeah so um so you&#39;ve just said</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.730" end="01:00:09.200" style="s2">it so very articulately and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.369" end="01:00:13.329" style="s2">I wonder like what do your parents think</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.200" end="01:00:13.329" style="s2">when you talk to them about psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.660" end="01:00:19.519" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure what liberties I have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.180" end="01:00:22.180" style="s2">speak here but I&#39;ll start with my mom</p>

<p begin="01:00:38.269" end="01:00:41.799" style="s2">daughter I think it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.220" end="01:00:44.569" style="s2">that we have these compounds available</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.799" end="01:00:48.769" style="s2">for other people who may need them to</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.259" end="01:01:04.819" style="s2">difficult point in a young person&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.059" end="01:01:06.970" style="s2">when they are trying to outgrow their</p>

<p begin="01:02:24.990" end="01:02:29.880" style="s2">track for 2021 for that is that correct</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.540" end="01:02:31.950" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s some hurdles some obstacles</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.880" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">that we have to run over and accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.950" end="01:02:39.840" style="s2">ahead but still yeah like failure</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.280" end="01:02:44.460" style="s2">slightly we will question I like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.840" end="01:02:46.350" style="s2">idea of memes and well what would we</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.460" end="01:02:47.640" style="s2">like to spread into the world like what</p>

<p begin="01:02:59.490" end="01:03:02.850" style="s2">have one like at the top of my mind I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.470" end="01:03:04.230" style="s2">have to think about that just for a</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.850" end="01:03:05.880" style="s2">second so let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.230" end="01:03:17.340" style="s2">something else for a moment I am trying</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.880" end="01:03:19.820" style="s2">to come up with my daily okay the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.340" end="01:03:25.160" style="s2">obstacle one&#39;s important but I guess</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.820" end="01:03:27.540" style="s2">let&#39;s see I think it&#39;s I say that</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.160" end="01:03:30.090" style="s2">self-acceptance is the boundary to your</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.540" end="01:03:32.130" style="s2">personal freedom that if you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.090" end="01:03:34.320" style="s2">approach yourself if you can meet</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.130" end="01:03:36.450" style="s2">yourself look yourself in the mirror and</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.320" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">recognize who you are right now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.450" end="01:03:41.550" style="s2">the next step of becoming who you wish</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.400" end="01:03:42.750" style="s2">to be all right so acceptance is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.550" end="01:03:46.200" style="s2">boundary to freedom that&#39;s the one I</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.750" end="01:03:49.620" style="s2">would spread out all right so I came up</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.200" end="01:03:52.470" style="s2">with one back of my mind so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.620" end="01:03:54.780" style="s2">emailing Stan Grof today earlier this</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.470" end="01:04:00.330" style="s2">morning and so what he said something</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.780" end="01:04:04.230" style="s2">that I think is so eloquent we talk a</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.330" end="01:04:06.510" style="s2">lot about spirituality and you know self</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.230" end="01:04:09.150" style="s2">transcendence and there&#39;s this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.510" end="01:04:12.150" style="s2">ego death but the ego never really dies</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.150" end="01:04:13.860" style="s2">and we&#39;re always really watching you</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.150" end="01:04:16.140" style="s2">know even in these mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.860" end="01:04:18.660" style="s2">somehow there&#39;s like a watcher or</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.140" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">something there&#39;s still some something</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.660" end="01:04:22.440" style="s2">so Stannis said that what we really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:25.200" style="s2">not so much ego death what we really</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.440" end="01:04:29.550" style="s2">need to do is become transparent to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.200" end="01:04:31.470" style="s2">transcendent yes you know that we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.550" end="01:04:33.960" style="s2">filter there were we&#39;re still there</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.470" end="01:04:34.860" style="s2">there&#39;s still this ego sense of who we</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.960" end="01:04:37.530" style="s2">are but we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.860" end="01:04:38.250" style="s2">see so become transparent to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.530" end="01:04:39.960" style="s2">transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.250" end="01:04:41.880" style="s2">something more expansive behind that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.960" end="01:04:43.500" style="s2">love the Buddhist concept that that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.880" end="01:04:45.300" style="s2">know if we sit here now we might feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.500" end="01:04:47.700" style="s2">maybe your arms gonna be a little tired</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.300" end="01:04:50.010" style="s2">or or maybe we remember something but</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.700" end="01:04:53.790" style="s2">that which remembers or that that which</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.010" end="01:04:55.560" style="s2">feels tired isn&#39;t tired there is</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.790" end="01:04:57.930" style="s2">something in the largest space of</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.560" end="01:04:59.610" style="s2">consciousness that we can find pause and</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.930" end="01:05:01.410" style="s2">rest in and I think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.610" end="01:05:03.990" style="s2">that these tools are transformation</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.410" end="01:05:06.720" style="s2">psychedelics meditation neurofeedback</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.990" end="01:05:08.790" style="s2">can allow us to find in our daily lives</p>
