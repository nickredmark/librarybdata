<p begin="00:00:01.490" end="00:00:06.509" style="s2">good morning kahshanna thanks so much</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:09.500" style="s2">for making time for this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.509" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">and really looking forward to it</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.500" end="00:00:14.820" style="s2">normally I ask people to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:16.379" style="s2">themselves with a whole life story but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.820" end="00:00:18.330" style="s2">feel like we could get to that later</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.379" end="00:00:21.930" style="s2">also many people already know you</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">because we&#39;ve talked before and I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.930" end="00:00:30.060" style="s2">just love to take this call to from you</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">a wealth of experience of having worked</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.060" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">with Jen for so long now first in</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">general with the Eco village movement</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">and in recent years really helping to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">lead this diverse group of people</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:51.960" style="s2">working in in a very horizontal way into</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:53.640" style="s2">its its future for quite some time now</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.960" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">and you&#39;re just about to step out of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.640" end="00:00:58.109" style="s2">that so I think it would be wonderful to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">have you recount a little bit from your</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.109" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">perspective and also how you connected</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:06.210" style="s2">to it first the story of the global eco</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">village network because I know something</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.210" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">about it but many people might not</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.479" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">thanks Daniel yeah it&#39;s lovely to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">here with you for the series first you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.890" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">know I&#39;m really I&#39;m so with you that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:22.200" style="s2">this is the age where we need to shift</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">from degenerative to regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.200" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">cultures you know and lovely to bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:28.710" style="s2">that piece of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">you know the mini piece that is my own</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.710" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">personal contribution my own life but</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:35.670" style="s2">then the bigger slightly bigger piece of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:37.530" style="s2">the puzzle there is also the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.670" end="00:01:41.689" style="s2">contribution of the global eco village</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.530" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">Network we&#39;ve which I just feel so</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.689" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">joyful and honored to have been a part</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">of and for some reason it intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">quite early in my life so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:03.320" style="s2">impulse to move away from individual</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">protest against social injustice and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.320" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">understanding that actually we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:11.790" style="s2">come together I think also as you know I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:17.400" style="s2">grew up in South Africa</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.790" end="00:02:20.189" style="s2">then I started being an activist against</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.400" end="00:02:22.859" style="s2">the apartheid system quite early on and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.189" end="00:02:25.170" style="s2">that was quite a lonely place to be in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.859" end="00:02:27.150" style="s2">life so I think many people who are very</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.170" end="00:02:29.700" style="s2">attractive to the global eco village</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.150" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">Network the promise of community might</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.700" end="00:02:38.180" style="s2">also be people who have changed their</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:41.549" style="s2">lives a lot who have been looking for</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.180" end="00:02:45.540" style="s2">what is true for me how can I contribute</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.549" end="00:02:48.359" style="s2">and might have felt quite lonesome at</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.540" end="00:02:50.129" style="s2">times on that journey so I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.359" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">definitely one of those people feeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.129" end="00:02:54.900" style="s2">quite lonesome at times so I started</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:57.299" style="s2">looking for community very early on and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.900" end="00:03:01.560" style="s2">there&#39;s the story of me which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.299" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">reality when I was younger of walking up</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.560" end="00:03:07.409" style="s2">the coast in South Africa on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">pilgrimage and you know very strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.409" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">experience of being out alone in an</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">atmosphere of violence an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">natural beauty and in that atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">just finding back to my inner courage</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:27.959" style="s2">but also to my trust in life and at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:30.810" style="s2">end of that journey ending up in parts</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.959" end="00:03:33.209" style="s2">of Jones where a community of people was</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.810" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">living together black and white people</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.209" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">and that was a changing point a complete</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">turning point in my life because I went</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:43.949" style="s2">on that journey from a deep place of not</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:46.919" style="s2">knowing what to do anymore</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.949" end="00:03:49.349" style="s2">I had studied cultural anthropology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.919" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">linguistics I had been a political</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.349" end="00:03:57.329" style="s2">activist with so science activism and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">none of it really hit the point for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.329" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">and the moment I was in this community I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">started being incredibly awake and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">curious and it was as if I had found</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">something but I couldn&#39;t quite name it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">and it took me years to name it you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">that it&#39;s about believing that we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:24.840" style="s2">create the dream of the future now</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:27.289" style="s2">if we do it together and we need each</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:32.419" style="s2">other that we cannot do it alone and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.289" end="00:04:35.729" style="s2">that was a deep truth that I I i somehow</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.419" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">soaked up more through my cells than my</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.729" end="00:04:41.039" style="s2">senses that my brain and it took me a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">long time before I could bring words to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.039" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">it but from that experience also this</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:49.949" style="s2">concept of not fighting the existing</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:52.199" style="s2">structures but actually creating the new</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.949" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">structures within you know if you we</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.199" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">speak about nested complexity which had</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:04:59.880" style="s2">what happens to complex systems when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:02.039" style="s2">bring in a completely new impulse right</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.880" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">and how can we change complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.039" end="00:05:08.460" style="s2">through that so moving from that back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:10.740" style="s2">Europe I started exploring this network</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.460" end="00:05:15.419" style="s2">of you know through the less-traveled</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.740" end="00:05:17.789" style="s2">class of mouth-to-mouth inspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.419" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">just found communities everywhere you</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.789" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">know in the Pyrenees and Israel in India</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:27.889" style="s2">in Egypt even you know it was just</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:32.070" style="s2">wherever I travel the world was full of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.889" end="00:05:34.259" style="s2">new communities sprouting up people</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.070" end="00:05:39.060" style="s2">creating these lifestyles but also in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.259" end="00:05:40.860" style="s2">very very hidden way and I decided quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.060" end="00:05:45.900" style="s2">early on that I wanted to live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:49.159" style="s2">community so in 1995 when the jhen</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.900" end="00:05:53.009" style="s2">conference happened I was actually just</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.159" end="00:05:55.469" style="s2">moving into pregnancy with my son and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.009" end="00:05:57.569" style="s2">knew about this conference happening so</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.469" end="00:05:59.880" style="s2">my friends from the community at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.569" end="00:06:03.630" style="s2">point I was staying in Germany and my</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.880" end="00:06:08.759" style="s2">friend silca and dieter dieter Halbach</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.630" end="00:06:11.340" style="s2">silca hoc Meier who have been very close</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.759" end="00:06:13.380" style="s2">they were cofounders of similan them but</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.340" end="00:06:16.500" style="s2">also cofounders of the German equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.380" end="00:06:19.110" style="s2">movement at that time they both came so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.500" end="00:06:20.759" style="s2">they shared the stories about even at</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.110" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">that time that there were only three</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.759" end="00:06:26.190" style="s2">people from Africa present present at</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:29.130" style="s2">that founding conference and when it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.190" end="00:06:31.770" style="s2">called a global network they stood up</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.130" end="00:06:33.990" style="s2">and said you know what about us our</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.770" end="00:06:34.930" style="s2">voice isn&#39;t really here you know how can</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.990" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">you call this grow</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.930" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">so I was really aware and I went to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:45.190" style="s2">of the earliest earliest gatherings of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:46.660" style="s2">djenne in 1997 I believe in 1998 there</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.190" end="00:06:49.720" style="s2">was a gathering in the German community</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.660" end="00:06:53.470" style="s2">of the European part of the network and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.720" end="00:06:55.900" style="s2">I found it exciting you know but also it</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.470" end="00:06:57.970" style="s2">was very small you know at that time the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.900" end="00:07:01.150" style="s2">gathering was like 30 people the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.970" end="00:07:05.020" style="s2">European gathering was 30 people or 40</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.150" end="00:07:06.789" style="s2">people coming together and it grew you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:10.750" style="s2">know my engagement really deepened</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.789" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">through moving to a bigger eco village</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.750" end="00:07:15.490" style="s2">in Germany getting involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:18.340" style="s2">founding of Gaia education the writing</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.490" end="00:07:20.349" style="s2">of the curriculum but then my real</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.340" end="00:07:26.759" style="s2">entrance came in a very surprising</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.349" end="00:07:29.320" style="s2">moment which was 2008 when I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.759" end="00:07:33.430" style="s2">co-facilitated co-hosted actually with</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.320" end="00:07:36.190" style="s2">Francois Eastman and Thomas Huebel a big</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.430" end="00:07:38.530" style="s2">conference in Berlin on the on the topic</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.190" end="00:07:41.530" style="s2">of the power of collective wisdom which</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.530" end="00:07:43.500" style="s2">had many people from communities in</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.530" end="00:07:46.300" style="s2">Europe come to that conference and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.500" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">afterwards I went back to my home Eco</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.300" end="00:07:52.060" style="s2">village seed ininin and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">European gathering of the European</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.370" end="00:11:18.490" style="s2">everybody who was a I just just thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.120" end="00:11:20.529" style="s2">it was interesting to tell a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.490" end="00:11:24.339" style="s2">more about that time that led up to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.529" end="00:11:26.529" style="s2">being elected because I always felt from</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.339" end="00:11:29.009" style="s2">the distance at the time I was at</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.529" end="00:11:32.649" style="s2">Finland that what you were doing in</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.009" end="00:11:35.620" style="s2">Linton was really fascinating by really</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.649" end="00:11:37.990" style="s2">pioneering a path to connection with the</p>

<p begin="00:11:44.500" end="00:12:00.730" style="s2">places on the e de well I think it was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.410" end="00:12:03.250" style="s2">gift that was brought to me so I was in</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.730" end="00:12:06.610" style="s2">this eco village in Germany in linen</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.250" end="00:12:09.670" style="s2">which was based on a foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.610" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">radical ecological simplicity so based</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.670" end="00:12:14.170" style="s2">on the Club of Rome report limits to</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:16.839" style="s2">growth and wanting to bring down the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.170" end="00:12:19.540" style="s2">ecological footprint to 30 and even 10%</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.839" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">of German average and I was living in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.540" end="00:12:23.319" style="s2">the most radical neighborhoods so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:26.110" style="s2">Eco village is now around a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.319" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">fifty a hundred seventy people but</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.110" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">organized in neighborhoods and the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:33.850" style="s2">radical neighbourhood at that time was</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">called the club 99 so we were living in</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.850" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">an area where we just trialed building a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:43.209" style="s2">house without any electricity just with</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:46.569" style="s2">horsepower and only with materials from</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.209" end="00:12:48.970" style="s2">the immediate vicinity so the would you</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.569" end="00:12:52.360" style="s2">know SOI to get through with all German</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.970" end="00:12:54.939" style="s2">sores Hansel&#39;s you know my my little son</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.360" end="00:12:57.579" style="s2">was helping to trample the mud for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.939" end="00:13:00.819" style="s2">walls and we ended up with a house that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.579" end="00:13:05.829" style="s2">was below 10% of the energy resources</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.819" end="00:13:07.870" style="s2">that a house uses in Germany of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.829" end="00:13:10.660" style="s2">similar size but also we lived in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.870" end="00:13:14.040" style="s2">area where nothing that was wrapped and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.660" end="00:13:16.629" style="s2">plastic was allowed to be brought in</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.040" end="00:13:20.889" style="s2">nothing that had been wrapped in plastic</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.629" end="00:13:23.949" style="s2">so nothing beyond local production we</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.889" end="00:13:25.750" style="s2">act locally and I lived that life for</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.949" end="00:13:27.699" style="s2">four to five years you know I love to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.750" end="00:13:30.579" style="s2">things in cycles and really get a deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.699" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">taste of it I didn&#39;t fly for seven years</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.579" end="00:13:37.050" style="s2">I refused to fly so I remember traveling</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:41.560" style="s2">by train up Tiffin Turin and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.050" end="00:13:43.839" style="s2">anything because we both did the no fly</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.560" end="00:13:45.779" style="s2">thing for about seven years at a time</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.839" end="00:13:48.310" style="s2">where very few people did it and then I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.779" end="00:13:51.579" style="s2">got a lot of stick afterwards when he</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.310" end="00:13:59.949" style="s2">got fashionable we decided to fly for</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.579" end="00:14:02.769" style="s2">other reason yeah I and I always had a</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.949" end="00:14:04.870" style="s2">global heart I think you know I just</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:12.700" style="s2">similar key experience teaching the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.630" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">first été and once ended after that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.700" end="00:16:18.250" style="s2">meeting they were just talked about and</p>

<p begin="00:16:18.250" end="00:16:26.440" style="s2">from a I think a Christian group in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.260" end="00:16:30.670" style="s2">north of of niyama and after giving a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.440" end="00:16:32.740" style="s2">talk on here I images from eco villages</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.670" end="00:16:34.270" style="s2">all around the world showing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.740" end="00:16:36.640" style="s2">flagships and some of the smaller ones</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.270" end="00:16:38.770" style="s2">and and kind of talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.640" end="00:16:40.930" style="s2">patterns and and John Gilman&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.770" end="00:16:43.450" style="s2">report and all those kind of things he</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.930" end="00:16:45.970" style="s2">came up to me after the talk with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.450" end="00:16:48.280" style="s2">silly sight so the hesitation in his</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.970" end="00:16:50.980" style="s2">voice it was like if what you just</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.280" end="00:16:54.280" style="s2">showed me way ecovillages then all our</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.980" end="00:16:56.920" style="s2">villages are eco villages yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.280" end="00:16:58.960" style="s2">said yes and this this and this this</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.920" end="00:17:02.200" style="s2">moment of recognition</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.960" end="00:17:04.990" style="s2">north south that so much of what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.200" end="00:17:07.390" style="s2">North has thrown out baby with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.990" end="00:17:09.070" style="s2">bathwater of patterns the routier in</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.390" end="00:17:12.520" style="s2">landscape that route you to your health</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.070" end="00:17:16.060" style="s2">through food that you do ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.520" end="00:17:19.030" style="s2">that make you indigenous to place in</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.060" end="00:17:21.880" style="s2">inhabit place patterns that we know</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.030" end="00:17:24.430" style="s2">desperately seeking to reinvent recover</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.880" end="00:17:28.990" style="s2">and reconnect with in the global north</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.430" end="00:17:33.010" style="s2">and giving just that function that jen</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.990" end="00:17:34.780" style="s2">has had of encouraging people in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.010" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">global south to say these patterns are</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.780" end="00:17:38.110" style="s2">valuable patterns and don&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:41.830" style="s2">mistake of just because</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.110" end="00:17:47.800" style="s2">Media pretend you all have to look like</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.830" end="00:17:50.230" style="s2">a Californian um you don&#39;t yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.800" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">exactly it so that&#39;s the trick you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.230" end="00:17:55.650" style="s2">that&#39;s the exploration that I got so</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:59.800" style="s2">involved in so you know just from that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.650" end="00:18:01.960" style="s2">inspiration I started inviting people</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.800" end="00:18:04.810" style="s2">from the global south as much as</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.960" end="00:18:07.720" style="s2">possible to come to the course and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.810" end="00:18:10.930" style="s2">connection to the German Foreign</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.720" end="00:18:13.930" style="s2">Ministry actually grew out of that so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.930" end="00:18:16.510" style="s2">started just by using my own funds and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.930" end="00:18:19.450" style="s2">doing and collecting private donations</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.510" end="00:18:21.040" style="s2">from friends you know I really wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.450" end="00:18:23.590" style="s2">fundraiser but I learned to be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.040" end="00:18:25.540" style="s2">fundraiser over the years is also a</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.590" end="00:18:27.700" style="s2">lesson in there because you created a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.540" end="00:18:29.650" style="s2">pattern that you could then point to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.700" end="00:18:32.590" style="s2">when you asked for the phone exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.650" end="00:18:36.520" style="s2">they&#39;re just going to say so in 2009 I</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.590" end="00:18:39.190" style="s2">went to cop15 in Copenhagen which was</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.520" end="00:18:41.380" style="s2">the disaster cop as some people call it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.190" end="00:18:45.970" style="s2">we&#39;re all negotiations broke down and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.380" end="00:18:48.790" style="s2">you know one friend who&#39;s stayed a close</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.970" end="00:18:50.800" style="s2">friend of mine over all these years who</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.790" end="00:18:53.830" style="s2">is there to negotiate as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.800" end="00:18:56.170" style="s2">German delegation he had been to one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.830" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">our presentations to a few of our</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.170" end="00:19:00.760" style="s2">presentations and I started</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:03.940" style="s2">conversations with him afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.760" end="00:19:06.550" style="s2">because he was so deeply disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.940" end="00:19:08.350" style="s2">that he said we need to start doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.550" end="00:19:10.870" style="s2">something different and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.350" end="00:19:13.800" style="s2">other pattern that is very important</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.870" end="00:19:16.870" style="s2">that there are good people everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.800" end="00:19:18.700" style="s2">amazing we spread ourselves you know I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.870" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say thinly but we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.700" end="00:19:24.340" style="s2">everywhere so the people of regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:26.620" style="s2">are not just in gen and the permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.340" end="00:19:29.140" style="s2">movement they sit in governments they</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.620" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">sit in corporations and we just need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.140" end="00:19:33.220" style="s2">seek each other out because I would say</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:37.180" style="s2">you know even going deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.220" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not the people but the places in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.180" end="00:19:43.000" style="s2">people that beat for regeneration I</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:47.500" style="s2">would say those places are alive in</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.000" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">every person and we just need to connect</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.500" end="00:19:56.110" style="s2">to them and bring them out and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:20:02.230" style="s2">the most joyful creative heart</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.110" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2">fulfilling impulse to give to life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.230" end="00:20:08.630" style="s2">the act that brings joy and satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:11.150" style="s2">and fulfillment to our lives that brings</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.630" end="00:20:12.800" style="s2">out our potential in life so you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.150" end="00:20:14.780" style="s2">this is what we can give to each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.800" end="00:20:16.280" style="s2">what the movement of regeneration gives</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.780" end="00:20:19.940" style="s2">but I want to come back to my story</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.280" end="00:20:22.370" style="s2">sorry so um yeah so you know I could</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.799" end="00:23:22.989" style="s2">because on the one hand is it it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">interesting that in this founding moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.989" end="00:23:28.389" style="s2">at Finland at that conference and there</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:31.570" style="s2">wasn&#39;t enough representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.389" end="00:23:36.249" style="s2">global South but to be fair to the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.570" end="00:23:38.379" style="s2">emergence of that moment and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.249" end="00:23:40.989" style="s2">conference wasn&#39;t called to create Jen</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.379" end="00:23:43.269" style="s2">and the conference brought a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.989" end="00:23:45.809" style="s2">people together that that then decided</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.269" end="00:23:48.849" style="s2">now that we&#39;re all together we we should</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.809" end="00:23:50.529" style="s2">create Jen like there it was it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.849" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">of almost a rushed like the way I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.299" end="00:24:00.809" style="s2">bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.390" end="00:24:06.260" style="s2">it was sort of to lazin to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.680" end="00:24:10.430" style="s2">conference that they decided can we draw</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.260" end="00:24:12.920" style="s2">up the founding impulse for the global</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.430" end="00:24:16.510" style="s2">eco village network yeah I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.920" end="00:24:19.130" style="s2">called the equivalent conference right</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.510" end="00:24:22.340" style="s2">communities for the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.130" end="00:24:25.100" style="s2">yeah exactly but eco village was very</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.340" end="00:24:28.250" style="s2">quiet but also I think we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.100" end="00:24:31.250" style="s2">speaking here about criticizing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.250" end="00:24:35.390" style="s2">first conference much more were speaking</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.250" end="00:24:38.800" style="s2">about you know a founding seed and how</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.390" end="00:24:42.490" style="s2">the patterns of an emerging network are</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.800" end="00:24:47.150" style="s2">visible in the founding seed right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.490" end="00:24:49.490" style="s2">Jen was founded by a circle of white</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.150" end="00:24:52.730" style="s2">Western people and even more so white</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.490" end="00:24:54.680" style="s2">Western men there were women involved</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.730" end="00:24:56.540" style="s2">but the more visible circle of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.680" end="00:25:00.920" style="s2">leadership at the beginning was white</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.540" end="00:25:04.670" style="s2">Western men and I think that is also</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.920" end="00:25:06.380" style="s2">honest to own that a part of the you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.670" end="00:25:08.300" style="s2">know part of the transformation that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.380" end="00:25:11.480" style="s2">was a part of I was the first female</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.300" end="00:25:16.220" style="s2">president of Gen I was the first female</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.480" end="00:25:18.740" style="s2">CEO of Gen not the first female</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.220" end="00:25:20.930" style="s2">president of Gen Europe but of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.740" end="00:25:23.990" style="s2">global ecology network or the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.930" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">president meaning chair of Trustees just</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.990" end="00:25:32.770" style="s2">but you know there there was a shift</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:35.510" style="s2">also to somehow from a circle of masks</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.770" end="00:25:38.060" style="s2">wonderful men wonderful man you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.510" end="00:25:40.700" style="s2">this is Albert Bates max Limburger and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.060" end="00:25:43.430" style="s2">Declan Kennedy wonderful men you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.700" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">Ross Jackson and killed her Jackson in</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.430" end="00:25:48.200" style="s2">the background and then there was me</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:50.540" style="s2">East stepping up and guy education and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.200" end="00:25:53.330" style="s2">then myself stepping up in Gen and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.540" end="00:25:55.670" style="s2">been in very visible leadership in gen</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.330" end="00:25:58.040" style="s2">for the past 12 years in varying roles</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.670" end="00:26:01.160" style="s2">but very visible and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.040" end="00:26:03.320" style="s2">that at this point in time both maiice</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.160" end="00:26:05.630" style="s2">and I are stepping out and I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.320" end="00:26:07.480" style="s2">more collaborative leadership models are</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.630" end="00:26:11.960" style="s2">also being developed in both</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.480" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">organization but so that was one journey</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.960" end="00:26:16.130" style="s2">we could speak more about but the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:20.710" style="s2">journey in gen has</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.130" end="00:26:22.430" style="s2">being from and again we had global self</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.710" end="00:26:25.370" style="s2">represented for instance through</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.430" end="00:26:27.770" style="s2">Sarvodaya which was a strong founding</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.370" end="00:26:30.830" style="s2">member and was very present where</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.770" end="00:26:34.040" style="s2">traditional villages were honored from</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.830" end="00:26:37.010" style="s2">the out start engine as eco villages but</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.040" end="00:26:40.520" style="s2">there was a time in especially 2008 to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.010" end="00:26:44.500" style="s2">2012 where that was a part of my main</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.520" end="00:26:47.690" style="s2">work engine was to find a framework of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.500" end="00:26:50.270" style="s2">recognition both for traditional</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.690" end="00:26:54.070" style="s2">villages as eco villages and intentional</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.270" end="00:26:56.870" style="s2">communities as eco villages urban</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.070" end="00:27:00.350" style="s2">communities as eco villages and rural</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.870" end="00:27:02.300" style="s2">communities as eco villages so that but</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.350" end="00:27:05.000" style="s2">especially the traditional communities</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.300" end="00:27:06.290" style="s2">to bring those voices in to honor them</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.000" end="00:27:08.780" style="s2">because one thing is to know that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.290" end="00:27:10.790" style="s2">they&#39;re there another thing is to bring</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.780" end="00:27:14.120" style="s2">their voice to the table and to bring</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.790" end="00:27:17.540" style="s2">the learning to the table really</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.120" end="00:27:19.250" style="s2">supported the whole what then led to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.540" end="00:27:22.190" style="s2">foundation of gen Africa instead of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.250" end="00:27:24.920" style="s2">having that strange putting Europe and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.190" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">Africa into one Secretariat and and also</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.920" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">like the supports of that gen activities</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:33.560" style="s2">in Africa really brought all these</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:36.770" style="s2">stories of the Senegal Network and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.560" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">mean it&#39;s amazing what Jen has then</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.770" end="00:27:45.770" style="s2">catalyzed by linking local peoples good</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:47.900" style="s2">work not by coming in and doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.770" end="00:27:50.300" style="s2">but by enabling and linking and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.900" end="00:27:53.540" style="s2">supporting people in Africa to work</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.300" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">together yes sir when I was invited in</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.540" end="00:28:01.370" style="s2">in 2008 I was explicitly but invited in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.980" end="00:28:04.580" style="s2">with my passion to work towards the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.370" end="00:28:06.980" style="s2">emergence of Gen Africa so I was part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.580" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">you know and the interesting thing was</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.980" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">that that you could say</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.590" end="00:28:17.090" style="s2">mobilization of Jain Europe you know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.659" end="00:28:19.070" style="s2">know we speak about glocalization and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.090" end="00:28:21.470" style="s2">realize you know I mean that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.070" end="00:28:23.900" style="s2">the important thing is to stay very very</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.470" end="00:28:28.220" style="s2">rooted in the local and spreading out</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.900" end="00:28:30.679" style="s2">but by inviting the global networks to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.220" end="00:28:34.220" style="s2">the European conferences we grew these</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.679" end="00:28:36.679" style="s2">conferences from 80 I believe 70 or 80</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.220" end="00:28:39.590" style="s2">the first conference I was up to seven</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.679" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">hundred eight hundred seven years later</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.590" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">so real beautiful growth of interest</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">simply and in parallel through those</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:52.730" style="s2">eco-village design education that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:55.490" style="s2">just spoke through should being able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.730" end="00:28:58.669" style="s2">show the first example we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.490" end="00:29:01.070" style="s2">attract professional support for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.669" end="00:29:04.490" style="s2">courses we were then able to invite more</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.070" end="00:29:09.830" style="s2">people to come to the Eco village design</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.490" end="00:29:10.940" style="s2">education courses from Africa and I you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.830" end="00:29:13.750" style="s2">know because they are already the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.940" end="00:29:16.760" style="s2">networks are often already existing</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.750" end="00:29:19.059" style="s2">mouth-to-mouth who&#39;s the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.760" end="00:29:21.260" style="s2">doing most community-led work</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.059" end="00:29:22.010" style="s2">regenerative work on the ground in</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.260" end="00:29:24.679" style="s2">Malawi</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.010" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">everybody knows you know and you can go</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.679" end="00:29:29.630" style="s2">in through seven seven portals through</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:32.659" style="s2">our network and the same names may be</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.630" end="00:29:34.490" style="s2">mentioned right so finding those people</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.659" end="00:29:36.679" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so hard</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.490" end="00:29:41.179" style="s2">and inviting them and there was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.679" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">sense of synergy of resonance of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.179" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">recognition and then the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:49.130" style="s2">moment came first in 2011 with the Arab</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:51.049" style="s2">Spring where I got a call from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.130" end="00:29:54.590" style="s2">German Foreign Minister saying actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.049" end="00:29:56.630" style="s2">we have 70 thousand euro left over and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.590" end="00:29:59.750" style="s2">we know that you&#39;re doing some work in</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.630" end="00:30:01.970" style="s2">Africa could you arrange something in</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.750" end="00:30:04.669" style="s2">North Africa and I said yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.970" end="00:30:06.740" style="s2">and so that was kind of the pre gen</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.669" end="00:30:09.590" style="s2">Africa conference where we could invite</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.740" end="00:30:14.539" style="s2">people from Tunisia Morocco Algeria</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.590" end="00:30:18.020" style="s2">Egypt Sudan just to come together in</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.539" end="00:30:20.450" style="s2">Sikkim and then 2012 we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.020" end="00:30:23.270" style="s2">replicate that conference but inviting</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.450" end="00:30:25.750" style="s2">all these people 80 people from around</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.270" end="00:30:28.810" style="s2">Africa 90</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.750" end="00:30:33.060" style="s2">sent of whom had completed an IDI and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.810" end="00:30:36.580" style="s2">semen and that was just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.060" end="00:30:38.590" style="s2">mind-blowing I have never experienced</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.580" end="00:30:40.120" style="s2">anything like it where a conference</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.590" end="00:30:42.910" style="s2">happened where people who didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.120" end="00:30:47.620" style="s2">each other had all been steeped in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.910" end="00:30:50.800" style="s2">same knowledge community and they could</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.620" end="00:30:52.930" style="s2">recognize the language and within five</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.800" end="00:30:56.770" style="s2">days we drafted the vision the mission</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.930" end="00:31:01.150" style="s2">the goals and it was just an explosion</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.770" end="00:31:03.580" style="s2">of creativity the most beautiful I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.150" end="00:31:06.550" style="s2">Africa you know it&#39;s grown slowly</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.580" end="00:31:08.980" style="s2">because Africa is not an easy continent</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.550" end="00:31:12.160" style="s2">to bridge electronically especially if</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.980" end="00:31:14.710" style="s2">you work with grassroots communities but</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.160" end="00:31:18.160" style="s2">that founding impulse for Gen Africa was</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.710" end="00:31:21.130" style="s2">just stunning a star so I still think</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.160" end="00:31:24.460" style="s2">Jed Africa will go very far</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.130" end="00:31:26.710" style="s2">yeah and at the same time the Latin</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.460" end="00:31:29.110" style="s2">American network was founded Casa latina</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.710" end="00:31:31.900" style="s2">which I&#39;ve been in conversation with but</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.110" end="00:31:34.300" style="s2">you know they just decided look this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.900" end="00:31:36.610" style="s2">it were we&#39;re breaking loose from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.300" end="00:31:39.280" style="s2">North American networks and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.610" end="00:31:40.810" style="s2">wanting to do our thing in Spanish</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.280" end="00:31:44.280" style="s2">because we are Spanish and Portuguese</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.810" end="00:31:47.860" style="s2">we&#39;re not English and that became Casa</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.280" end="00:31:53.890" style="s2">so you&#39;d had the same similar dimension</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.860" end="00:31:57.040" style="s2">to it which is the power of a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.890" end="00:31:59.590" style="s2">diverse white I mean you were involved</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.040" end="00:32:02.530" style="s2">in developing the original été</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.590" end="00:32:06.130" style="s2">curriculum that holistic map that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.530" end="00:32:09.130" style="s2">Mandela of the four dimensions and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.130" end="00:32:11.760" style="s2">process of at least opening the window</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.130" end="00:32:15.400" style="s2">on so many interrelated aspects from</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:17.650" style="s2">nonviolent communications to how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.400" end="00:32:19.540" style="s2">write a business plan to how to create a</p>

<p begin="00:32:19.540" end="00:32:26.500" style="s2">in permaculture to sewage free treatment</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.080" end="00:32:32.050" style="s2">systems and it just gives people a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.500" end="00:32:34.179" style="s2">shared knowledge map and in a shared</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.050" end="00:32:36.450" style="s2">experience that then makes it so much</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.179" end="00:32:40.410" style="s2">easier to connect them to work together</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.450" end="00:32:43.500" style="s2">and I&#39;ve seen this when I when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.410" end="00:32:46.740" style="s2">Brazil and met so many of the the guy on</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.500" end="00:32:48.600" style="s2">OHS in Brazil to see how they are linked</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.740" end="00:32:51.870" style="s2">up and down the country and have done</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.600" end="00:32:53.460" style="s2">lots of diverse things since but it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.870" end="00:32:55.680" style="s2">much easier to work together because</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.460" end="00:32:59.040" style="s2">they have that shared experience and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.680" end="00:33:01.620" style="s2">think also drew on that as well and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.040" end="00:33:04.970" style="s2">think in a lesser to a lesser degree</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.620" end="00:33:06.690" style="s2">anybody who has visited an eco village</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.970" end="00:33:10.800" style="s2">especially one of the more established</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.690" end="00:33:15.540" style="s2">eco villages carries that seed within</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.800" end="00:33:19.080" style="s2">them so the amount of change making that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.540" end="00:33:24.090" style="s2">has grown out of eco villages you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.080" end="00:33:27.450" style="s2">we now link to 6090 communities in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.090" end="00:33:30.330" style="s2">world that we can you know know what the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.450" end="00:33:32.040" style="s2">the we have the geographical data we</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.330" end="00:33:35.730" style="s2">have the connecting person for all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.040" end="00:33:38.150" style="s2">people all these communities were linked</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.730" end="00:33:40.590" style="s2">to the global eco village network as</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.150" end="00:33:42.390" style="s2">communities that are dedicated to</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.590" end="00:33:45.920" style="s2">becoming sustainable or being</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.390" end="00:33:49.230" style="s2">sustainable all of these communities are</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.920" end="00:33:52.020" style="s2">churning out changemakers anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.230" end="00:33:54.270" style="s2">comes and visits and leaves again says</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.020" end="00:33:57.090" style="s2">this has changed my life and then the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.270" end="00:33:58.830" style="s2">eco village design education courses are</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.090" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">like a cherry on the cake you know if</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.830" end="00:34:03.720" style="s2">you come to a four-week course like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">an immersion course you leave every</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.720" end="00:34:08.910" style="s2">single person has told me I&#39;m forever</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:11.340" style="s2">changed so it&#39;s an incredible change</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.910" end="00:34:13.980" style="s2">making movement because that is going on</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.340" end="00:34:15.990" style="s2">it&#39;s their incubators for whole host of</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.980" end="00:34:18.870" style="s2">projects that grow up in them and around</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.990" end="00:34:20.760" style="s2">them they then create the first patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.870" end="00:34:22.890" style="s2">for what would an ecosystems restoration</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.760" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">camp look like I mean the the big</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.890" end="00:34:26.640" style="s2">established eco villages know that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:30.390" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been engaged somebody</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.640" end="00:34:32.040" style="s2">who used the ferment of the eco village</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.390" end="00:34:34.470" style="s2">to launch an organization where there</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.040" end="00:34:36.180" style="s2">was trees for life and Alan Watts in</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.470" end="00:34:37.920" style="s2">Featherstone and fintan oh it was all</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.180" end="00:34:38.540" style="s2">the wonderful work that they&#39;ve done in</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.920" end="00:34:40.770" style="s2">Oroville</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.540" end="00:34:44.250" style="s2">so many other the mangrove forest</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.770" end="00:34:47.430" style="s2">regeneration in Senegal and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.250" end="00:34:49.860" style="s2">so many experiences that you can then</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.430" end="00:34:50.200" style="s2">not just talk about by pointer and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.860" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.200" end="00:34:55.419" style="s2">the transformative aspect of learning in</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:58.300" style="s2">ecovillages that that he also connect to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.419" end="00:35:00.760" style="s2">real on-the-ground projects that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.300" end="00:35:03.550" style="s2">have a bit of a track record and and can</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.760" end="00:35:05.410" style="s2">inspire people to say this is possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.550" end="00:35:08.910" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do this in my region and in my</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.410" end="00:35:11.410" style="s2">way with my community in and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.910" end="00:35:11.820" style="s2">sensitivity to the place that that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.410" end="00:35:15.220" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.820" end="00:35:18.369" style="s2">yes and every eco village is an</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.220" end="00:35:20.980" style="s2">ecosystem restoration settlement you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.369" end="00:35:26.190" style="s2">know I love i I just remember that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.980" end="00:35:30.490" style="s2">was this scientific research done on</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.190" end="00:35:33.910" style="s2">biodiversity in the zeg community in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.490" end="00:35:37.150" style="s2">local city like it&#39;s it&#39;s a small town</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.910" end="00:35:40.540" style="s2">like a local external neighborhood and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.150" end="00:35:42.700" style="s2">then a rural area including forests and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.540" end="00:35:45.849" style="s2">everything and the biodiversity was so</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.700" end="00:35:49.329" style="s2">much higher within the eco village you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.849" end="00:35:51.700" style="s2">know so just to say every eco village is</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.329" end="00:35:54.910" style="s2">an ecosystem restoration community or a</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.700" end="00:35:57.010" style="s2">village yeah it&#39;s because we I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.910" end="00:36:00.099" style="s2">we&#39;re both in our journeys of on the one</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.010" end="00:36:05.290" style="s2">hand deeply believing in the very local</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.099" end="00:36:09.900" style="s2">community grounded work of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.290" end="00:36:15.000" style="s2">live sustainably close to the land and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:18.339" style="s2">we also care about how does this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.000" end="00:36:21.250" style="s2">spread into the wider society and how do</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.339" end="00:36:23.859" style="s2">we include everybody including the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.250" end="00:36:27.849" style="s2">millions and of people living in in</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.859" end="00:36:32.170" style="s2">dense cities and and in what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.849" end="00:36:33.670" style="s2">noticing right now is that there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.170" end="00:36:36.310" style="s2">push again there&#39;s almost like a new</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.670" end="00:36:39.670" style="s2">wave of people waking up to that initial</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.310" end="00:36:42.130" style="s2">impulse that might have brought you and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.670" end="00:36:44.500" style="s2">me close to eco villages many years ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.130" end="00:36:46.930" style="s2">where which might be a bit more at a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.500" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">certain phase in life you you just want</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.930" end="00:36:52.329" style="s2">to get together with a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:55.750" style="s2">you feel akin to and just do the project</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.329" end="00:36:57.640" style="s2">and and build the community and em but</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.750" end="00:36:59.650" style="s2">it but it can have that little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.640" end="00:37:02.020" style="s2">energy of Jen collapsing into the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.650" end="00:37:04.090" style="s2">hyperlocal to the point that you lose</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.020" end="00:37:07.690" style="s2">soon with the global and I think we both</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.090" end="00:37:09.460" style="s2">care that that pendulum swing doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.690" end="00:37:11.470" style="s2">happen so much that people can find</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.460" end="00:37:14.530" style="s2">their local grounding place but that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.470" end="00:37:16.710" style="s2">keep open that the global pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.530" end="00:37:20.740" style="s2">how do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.710" end="00:37:25.060" style="s2">dynamic of ultimately we need to all</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.740" end="00:37:28.119" style="s2">localize in order to shift not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.060" end="00:37:31.300" style="s2">doing patterns but being patterns deeply</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.119" end="00:37:34.270" style="s2">in US and at the same time we also still</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.300" end="00:37:36.010" style="s2">need to find ways of maintaining global</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.270" end="00:37:39.730" style="s2">solidarity collaboration knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.010" end="00:37:41.560" style="s2">exchange and connection in order to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.730" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">enable that favori body around the globe</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.560" end="00:37:48.910" style="s2">where do you see Jen if if you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:51.700" style="s2">dream into the highest potential now</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.910" end="00:37:53.619" style="s2">that you&#39;re slowly moving out of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.700" end="00:37:56.980" style="s2">leadership role in Jen where would you</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.619" end="00:38:00.970" style="s2">see gently play role in maintaining that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.980" end="00:38:04.060" style="s2">local dynamic yeah I would love to just</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.970" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">go back to the history and complete that</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.060" end="00:38:11.710" style="s2">first and it leads there anywhere anyway</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:17.500" style="s2">so it&#39;s a perfect perfect common to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.710" end="00:38:23.320" style="s2">bring in so you know with Jen Africa and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.500" end="00:38:27.190" style="s2">Casa having emerged we had finally more</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.320" end="00:38:31.810" style="s2">of a global voice engine and from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.190" end="00:38:38.020" style="s2">beginning the global eco village network</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.810" end="00:38:40.150" style="s2">was there as a idea and organization at</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.020" end="00:38:41.320" style="s2">the time I stepped it in it was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.150" end="00:38:44.650" style="s2">pro-forma</p>

<p begin="00:38:44.650" end="00:38:50.830" style="s2">bank account anymore so it was really</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.340" end="00:38:53.950" style="s2">non-existent and it had an International</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.830" end="00:38:55.570" style="s2">Board that tried to meet in person once</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.950" end="00:38:57.340" style="s2">a year and going to the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.570" end="00:39:02.590" style="s2">places around the planet very lucky</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.340" end="00:39:04.390" style="s2">people that was before my time and but</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.590" end="00:39:07.990" style="s2">really the work was done through the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.390" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">three big regions so eco village Network</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.990" end="00:39:13.600" style="s2">of the Americas enna and Jane Europe</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:44.470" style="s2">nigger stepped out and we had new people</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.700" end="00:39:47.560" style="s2">stepping in from Asia which really</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.780" end="00:39:57.850" style="s2">to was also setting up Jen</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.020" end="00:40:00.760" style="s2">the global part of the network as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.850" end="00:40:03.400" style="s2">strong charity and I at that time I had</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.760" end="00:40:06.190" style="s2">moved to fin torn fin torrents seemed</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.400" end="00:40:09.130" style="s2">like the perfect place you know where</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.190" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">the founding of Jan the celebration of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.130" end="00:40:16.210" style="s2">Jen&#39;s 10th year anniversary had taken</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:18.730" style="s2">place here so in 2013 Jen was founded as</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.210" end="00:40:22.510" style="s2">a Scottish charity and from that point</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.730" end="00:40:24.610" style="s2">on we had a clear Constitution outlining</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.510" end="00:40:27.820" style="s2">that each of the regions would have</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.610" end="00:40:30.220" style="s2">equal representation to the board would</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.820" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">have equal representation to the General</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.220" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">Assembly and Jen became a real conscious</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:45.100" style="s2">expression of global culture you know we</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.220" end="00:40:48.610" style="s2">have 45 representatives to our General</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.100" end="00:40:51.730" style="s2">Assembly and they come from probably 43</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.610" end="00:40:56.050" style="s2">different countries so when we have our</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.730" end="00:40:59.170" style="s2">General Assemblies we span the globe and</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.050" end="00:41:01.600" style="s2">we hear the voices from around the globe</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.170" end="00:41:07.600" style="s2">and that is something incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.600" end="00:41:09.340" style="s2">precious and I find you know just coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.600" end="00:41:14.910" style="s2">back to my own life when we speak about</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.340" end="00:41:17.710" style="s2">so that&#39;s one one aspect of globality is</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.910" end="00:41:21.240" style="s2">actually listening to the voices and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.710" end="00:41:24.970" style="s2">see a great struggle around this or</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.240" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">confusion I would say we&#39;re also I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.970" end="00:41:28.650" style="s2">often now say in environments where</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:31.410" style="s2">indigenous voices are there</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.650" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">and it becomes hard sometimes for other</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.410" end="00:41:40.279" style="s2">voices to be heard right</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:45.329" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s very it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.279" end="00:41:48.900" style="s2">exploration how to listen and which are</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.329" end="00:41:52.859" style="s2">the voices that need to be heard at what</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.900" end="00:41:58.859" style="s2">time at which time and how we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.859" end="00:42:01.770" style="s2">allow how do we allow the world to truly</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.859" end="00:42:03.210" style="s2">speak to us through human voices but</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.770" end="00:42:06.510" style="s2">also through all the other feedback</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.210" end="00:42:09.480" style="s2">systems of the world so listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.510" end="00:42:12.930" style="s2">world you know is is super important in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.480" end="00:42:16.200" style="s2">Jin and super important in all of our</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.930" end="00:42:18.299" style="s2">work of course just a brief question for</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.200" end="00:42:19.770" style="s2">you personally because and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.299" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">little bit of a parallel not that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.770" end="00:42:23.490" style="s2">haven&#39;t grown up in Africa but I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:26.670" style="s2">lived in very different cultures but</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.490" end="00:42:28.730" style="s2">that ability that like you grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.670" end="00:42:32.490" style="s2">South Africa you spend a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.730" end="00:42:35.160" style="s2">Germany no you spend a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.490" end="00:42:37.740" style="s2">Scottish culture and I spent a long time</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.160" end="00:42:41.700" style="s2">in Holland I lived seven years in</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.740" end="00:42:45.029" style="s2">Holland yeah so so it&#39;s this um having</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.700" end="00:42:46.980" style="s2">actually lived in lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.029" end="00:42:51.569" style="s2">cultural contexts and seeing how &#39;days</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.980" end="00:42:53.490" style="s2">is a different uniqueness by a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.569" end="00:42:56.549" style="s2">uniqueness of each place and and each</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.490" end="00:43:01.049" style="s2">culture is that how is that informing</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.549" end="00:43:03.900" style="s2">you your work and do you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.049" end="00:43:05.940" style="s2">important for people to have if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.900" end="00:43:11.849" style="s2">privileged enough to care in to be able</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.940" end="00:43:13.770" style="s2">to do so this this multicultural yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.849" end="00:43:15.990" style="s2">I feel like we have two topics now on</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.770" end="00:43:17.910" style="s2">the table one is about scaling up and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.990" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">this is another topic so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.910" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">Park or scaling out so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:24.539" style="s2">park that one consciously</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:26.940" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s lovely you speak to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.539" end="00:43:28.440" style="s2">that because I&#39;d love I&#39;ve been wanting</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.940" end="00:43:31.260" style="s2">to come to that you know also speaking</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.440" end="00:43:33.839" style="s2">about flying because yes it&#39;s been it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.260" end="00:43:35.670" style="s2">been deeply transformative for me to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.839" end="00:43:42.210" style="s2">have lived in these different cultural</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.670" end="00:43:45.900" style="s2">contexts and you know I to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.210" end="00:43:50.390" style="s2">I my sense is that all of us have</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.900" end="00:43:53.190" style="s2">nervous systems I just want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.390" end="00:43:55.860" style="s2">before I go into the rest I think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.190" end="00:43:59.720" style="s2">our nervous systems have and we know</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.860" end="00:44:06.050" style="s2">this scientifically also that we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.720" end="00:44:08.330" style="s2">a far greater capacity to receive</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.050" end="00:44:12.440" style="s2">information from the world around us</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.330" end="00:44:16.340" style="s2">than we are working with and at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.440" end="00:44:19.790" style="s2">heart of regeneration to me lies the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.340" end="00:44:23.030" style="s2">opening of our capacity to receive the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.790" end="00:44:26.450" style="s2">information that is necessary to be able</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.030" end="00:44:29.000" style="s2">to respond adequately we are not able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.450" end="00:44:31.880" style="s2">respond adequately when our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.000" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">systems are shut down and our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.880" end="00:44:37.609" style="s2">systems are shut down not I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:41.090" style="s2">too absolute but they&#39;re shut down in</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.609" end="00:44:45.770" style="s2">places and that&#39;s that&#39;s an issue of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.090" end="00:44:48.650" style="s2">compassion what it needs is compassion</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.770" end="00:44:51.560" style="s2">and healing because there&#39;s a good a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.650" end="00:44:54.849" style="s2">very good reason for a nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.560" end="00:44:59.030" style="s2">not to be open but to come back to my</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.849" end="00:45:03.320" style="s2">cultural experience growing up in South</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.030" end="00:45:06.680" style="s2">Africa my nervous system as a child was</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.320" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">able to read the field I had I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.680" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">in a relatively conservative bula family</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:20.390" style="s2">speaking Afrikaans which is my language</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:22.339" style="s2">of Wiccans which believed that apartheid</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.390" end="00:45:26.300" style="s2">was the only way to keep us safe as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.339" end="00:45:32.150" style="s2">family as a nation Afrikaner</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.300" end="00:45:35.480" style="s2">and I grew up with a sense of the field</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.150" end="00:45:40.060" style="s2">with dreams about the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.480" end="00:45:46.220" style="s2">apartheid with a sense of the growing</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.060" end="00:45:48.619" style="s2">wave of anger and injustice I could feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.220" end="00:45:52.310" style="s2">it in every cell of my body as a child</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.619" end="00:45:54.740" style="s2">and yes I did see a few images in my</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.310" end="00:45:57.800" style="s2">childhood which brought it home so</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.740" end="00:46:01.700" style="s2">starkly there was no way as a child in</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.800" end="00:46:04.040" style="s2">South Africa that I wouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.700" end="00:46:11.060" style="s2">able to see the system you know and</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.040" end="00:46:13.220" style="s2">there was a heavy um there was a heavy</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.060" end="00:46:15.950" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.220" end="00:46:17.990" style="s2">that the system was portrayed to us as</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.950" end="00:46:20.540" style="s2">children at school you know history</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.990" end="00:46:23.480" style="s2">started with fondly biack landing in</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.540" end="00:46:27.620" style="s2">Cape Town you know there was a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.480" end="00:46:29.840" style="s2">specific way the history was taught to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.620" end="00:46:34.280" style="s2">us or the reasons why the system was in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.840" end="00:46:39.020" style="s2">place so waking up to that the injustice</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.280" end="00:46:41.180" style="s2">being felt on a physical level without a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.020" end="00:46:44.450" style="s2">system responding to it adequately</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.180" end="00:46:49.120" style="s2">without being allowed to speak about my</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.450" end="00:46:52.940" style="s2">sensory perceptions what I experienced I</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.120" end="00:46:56.210" style="s2">find that that that same reality is</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.940" end="00:47:00.770" style="s2">replicated to a globally to all of us</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.210" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">you know as our sensory apparatus our</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.770" end="00:47:05.900" style="s2">nervous system reads what we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:08.300" style="s2">to the planet and I believe that we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.900" end="00:47:10.610" style="s2">much more able to do that than we</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.300" end="00:47:12.740" style="s2">consciously know I believe we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.610" end="00:47:15.980" style="s2">it much more than we are consciously</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.740" end="00:47:19.340" style="s2">know the rising levels of depression are</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.980" end="00:47:22.940" style="s2">one expression of that you know and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.340" end="00:47:27.170" style="s2">again if we align ourselves with what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.940" end="00:47:29.780" style="s2">know is right and wrong wherever we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.170" end="00:47:31.220" style="s2">we find our pathway it&#39;s like the red</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.780" end="00:47:35.180" style="s2">thread right</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.220" end="00:47:38.510" style="s2">so having lived in these different</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.180" end="00:47:40.610" style="s2">countries was one entrance door the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.510" end="00:47:43.760" style="s2">other entrance start from he came with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.610" end="00:47:46.490" style="s2">flying and the fact that I have now</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.760" end="00:47:49.190" style="s2">worked in 48 different countries around</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.310" end="00:52:00.810" style="s2">still it&#39;s still easier for us to do it</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.740" end="00:52:04.740" style="s2">in human to human connectedness so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.810" end="00:52:10.760" style="s2">learning now right but that love is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.740" end="00:52:18.780" style="s2">basis for to humanity to emerge so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.760" end="00:52:21.360" style="s2">could not be more grateful to KLM to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.780" end="00:52:27.030" style="s2">possibility to travel and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.360" end="00:52:31.860" style="s2">really hard if you live in one place all</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.030" end="00:52:36.930" style="s2">your life to grasp the global reality we</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.860" end="00:52:39.830" style="s2">have an incredible resource brought to</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.110" end="00:52:55.750" style="s2">our doorstep what a gift so sitting</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.980" end="00:52:59.140" style="s2">with each other and not just touching</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.750" end="00:53:01.720" style="s2">the surface but going truly deep eating</p>

<p begin="00:53:12.400" end="00:53:20.920" style="s2">to ourselves so I believe this is super</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.750" end="00:53:25.869" style="s2">necessary and maybe I can go to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.920" end="00:53:28.060" style="s2">scaling out and scaling up oh we&#39;re at</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.839" end="00:53:35.589" style="s2">but at the same time there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.490" end="00:53:38.260" style="s2">more we could talk about I just would</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.589" end="00:53:42.630" style="s2">like to bond Lincoln to you your next</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.260" end="00:53:47.950" style="s2">steps from that because you&#39;ve shared</p>

<p begin="00:53:47.950" end="00:53:52.570" style="s2">the people that that is because Jen is</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.960" end="00:53:54.550" style="s2">just a name but it&#39;s the people that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.570" end="00:53:57.339" style="s2">were able to connect with all around the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.550" end="00:54:02.200" style="s2">world that that hold that impulse and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.339" end="00:54:05.619" style="s2">and and and spread it em and give it for</p>

<p begin="00:54:17.950" end="00:54:25.930" style="s2">the central reconnecting to our ability</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:36.940" style="s2">admired that for a long time you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.430" end="00:54:39.460" style="s2">through Thomas&#39;s work working with those</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.940" end="00:54:41.500" style="s2">blocks that shut up off our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.460" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">system so the trauma work and the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.500" end="00:54:46.869" style="s2">work of patterns and and Stan the pocket</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:49.150" style="s2">project also tries to work with that can</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.869" end="00:54:53.020" style="s2">you say a little bit more about your</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.150" end="00:54:56.470" style="s2">personal next yeah you know I think that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.020" end="00:55:00.849" style="s2">just in the global ecology Network I</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.470" end="00:55:02.870" style="s2">have also been in that tension of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.849" end="00:55:06.650" style="s2">local and the global</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.870" end="00:55:09.320" style="s2">my tenancy was always very much to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.650" end="00:55:13.010" style="s2">out there to say look we need to we need</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.320" end="00:55:15.830" style="s2">to give Jin to the world we need to open</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.010" end="00:55:18.470" style="s2">up to the globe you know that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.830" end="00:55:20.960" style="s2">mine and there is another part engine</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.470" end="00:55:24.710" style="s2">which is very much about the local and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.960" end="00:55:26.690" style="s2">love my garden you know it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.710" end="00:55:29.660" style="s2">content of my work in the world but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.690" end="00:55:32.330" style="s2">completely love my carrots growing in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.660" end="00:55:34.580" style="s2">beans and my cucumbers at the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.330" end="00:55:37.880" style="s2">that but that tension between giving</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.580" end="00:55:41.180" style="s2">enough space for the localization</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.880" end="00:55:43.130" style="s2">impulse and the opening impulse for</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.180" end="00:55:47.000" style="s2">going out and how to really bring those</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.130" end="00:55:49.610" style="s2">together that&#39;s part of the shift that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.000" end="00:55:51.890" style="s2">I&#39;m making and the other part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.610" end="00:55:54.890" style="s2">shift is just seeing again and again how</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.890" end="00:55:59.560" style="s2">in our movement of regeneration we hit</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.890" end="00:56:02.030" style="s2">ceilings so we give everything and we do</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.560" end="00:56:04.520" style="s2">amazing work in ecosystem restoration</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.030" end="00:56:07.700" style="s2">camps in eco villages but we hit</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.520" end="00:56:09.610" style="s2">ceilings in the social and I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.700" end="00:56:13.010" style="s2">this over time so I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.610" end="00:56:15.320" style="s2">communities develop really beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.010" end="00:56:18.110" style="s2">to a certain level and then it feels</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.320" end="00:56:19.910" style="s2">like they start circling and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.110" end="00:56:21.770" style="s2">wondering about this and the next level</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.910" end="00:56:25.010" style="s2">of creativity is on the edge of those</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.770" end="00:56:27.940" style="s2">communities I&#39;ve really been wondering</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.010" end="00:56:30.830" style="s2">about that and I&#39;ve written a book on</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.940" end="00:56:33.470" style="s2">collective wisdom in Germany exploring</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.830" end="00:56:35.570" style="s2">what is collective wisdom at that time I</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.470" end="00:56:39.470" style="s2">asked the question and what is</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.570" end="00:56:42.260" style="s2">collective stupidity and I would ask how</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.470" end="00:56:44.630" style="s2">is collective wisdom linked to</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.260" end="00:56:49.040" style="s2">collective and intergenerational trauma</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.630" end="00:56:52.070" style="s2">and as you say for me the edges of our</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.040" end="00:56:54.710" style="s2">region regeneration movement are where</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.070" end="00:56:57.830" style="s2">we hit the places in our nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.710" end="00:57:00.800" style="s2">that are not open to receiving feedback</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.830" end="00:57:03.560" style="s2">that are not open to be inspired by an</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.800" end="00:57:05.210" style="s2">intelligence that is bigger than us and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.560" end="00:57:07.670" style="s2">I would say the deepest wind that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.210" end="00:57:11.420" style="s2">carry is believing that this sack of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.670" end="00:57:14.330" style="s2">skin is Who I am and we know that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.420" end="00:57:16.369" style="s2">more but I don&#39;t think we have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.330" end="00:57:19.400" style="s2">of just what</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.369" end="00:57:23.630" style="s2">actually means what the web of life that</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.400" end="00:57:27.440" style="s2">we are woven into that we are not on top</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.630" end="00:57:32.569" style="s2">of we are a deep expression of it and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.440" end="00:57:36.309" style="s2">will indeed go back to it yeah what that</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.569" end="00:57:41.029" style="s2">means and so now I feel like it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.309" end="00:57:44.809" style="s2">you could say the job of cleaning the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.029" end="00:57:47.749" style="s2">pipes so that the energy of inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.809" end="00:57:51.849" style="s2">and creativity can run more freely</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.749" end="00:57:54.410" style="s2">through the nervous system of humanity I</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.849" end="00:57:56.420" style="s2">believe deeply that we are here on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.410" end="00:58:01.849" style="s2">planet as guardians of life that we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.420" end="00:58:07.869" style="s2">here to express our beauty in extremely</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.849" end="00:58:12.410" style="s2">unique ways where each individual is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.869" end="00:58:15.079" style="s2">king or a queen of our own unique</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.410" end="00:58:19.789" style="s2">expression and at the same time that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.079" end="00:58:22.789" style="s2">being a perfect synchronistic unique</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.789" end="00:58:24.710" style="s2">contribution to the whole and if each</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.789" end="00:58:28.299" style="s2">one of us gives our piece to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.710" end="00:58:31.999" style="s2">there is no too much to do for anyone so</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.299" end="00:58:35.989" style="s2">the clean up of our nervous systems that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.999" end="00:58:41.390" style="s2">we need to be able to do that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.989" end="00:58:43.190" style="s2">what I&#39;m fascinated by next and many</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.390" end="00:58:45.349" style="s2">people get a bit like Oh God working</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.190" end="00:58:49.099" style="s2">with collective trauma that sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.349" end="00:58:53.900" style="s2">dark and daunting to me it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.099" end="00:58:57.470" style="s2">the most exciting journey ever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.900" end="00:58:59.720" style="s2">where the pearls are waiting to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.470" end="00:59:01.549" style="s2">that&#39;s where the light is waiting to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.720" end="00:59:04.940" style="s2">unveiled you know so I&#39;m just super</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.549" end="00:59:06.920" style="s2">excited also it&#39;s also the most deeply</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.940" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">regenerative work because it is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.920" end="00:59:12.829" style="s2">regenerative work of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.720" end="00:59:17.960" style="s2">in healing those places in us you heal</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.829" end="00:59:20.569" style="s2">the larger it goes beyond the humanity</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.960" end="00:59:23.420" style="s2">nature dualism that runs so deep in our</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.569" end="00:59:25.329" style="s2">culture it understands that if we would</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.420" end="00:59:28.549" style="s2">truly want to become</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.329" end="00:59:29.750" style="s2">expressions of life creating conditions</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.549" end="00:59:32.150" style="s2">conducive to life</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.750" end="00:59:34.310" style="s2">again we need we need to deal with with</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.150" end="00:59:38.120" style="s2">with these wounds and the way you just</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.310" end="00:59:45.320" style="s2">described this this dance-off air</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.120" end="00:59:48.260" style="s2">enabling everyone to shine in expressing</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.320" end="00:59:50.630" style="s2">their full unique potential that only</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.260" end="00:59:53.390" style="s2">they in the whole history of life on</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.630" end="00:59:56.300" style="s2">earth and humanity have has only been</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.390" end="00:59:59.090" style="s2">one moment for that person to be that</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.300" end="01:00:03.920" style="s2">person in the best way possible</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.090" end="01:00:06.380" style="s2">and and that in doing so in service to</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:09.350" style="s2">the larger that&#39;s where the nourishment</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.380" end="01:00:13.040" style="s2">comes from the larger that enables that</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.350" end="01:00:15.860" style="s2">individual to do that so it&#39;s this this</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.040" end="01:00:18.710" style="s2">dynamic tension that life has full of</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.860" end="01:00:22.940" style="s2">living in this illusion of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.710" end="01:00:24.860" style="s2">of being for oneself and being part part</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.940" end="01:00:30.250" style="s2">of a larger whole that I find this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.860" end="01:00:35.060" style="s2">where the conscious evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.250" end="01:00:36.530" style="s2">participation in this process is what</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.060" end="01:00:38.720" style="s2">we&#39;re stepping into when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.530" end="01:00:42.140" style="s2">about true regeneration son I&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.720" end="01:00:46.730" style="s2">excited that you I I really honor you</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.140" end="01:00:49.220" style="s2">for for what you&#39;ve already seated in</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.730" end="01:00:51.350" style="s2">the world and I feel that that special</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.220" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">period before you could move to vent on</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.350" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">that we spoke about a little bit where</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:01:00.200" style="s2">these bees were happening from Stephen</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.920" end="01:01:02.420" style="s2">Linton I know that I&#39;ve met lots of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.200" end="01:01:06.860" style="s2">people that were deeply touched by what</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.420" end="01:01:08.750" style="s2">do you enabled with those courses we</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.860" end="01:01:11.690" style="s2">haven&#39;t had much time to talk about how</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.750" end="01:01:15.370" style="s2">Paulo and the lush connection and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.690" end="01:01:18.110" style="s2">all eating in a visionary company into</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.370" end="01:01:19.910" style="s2">supporting this kind of work as we</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.110" end="01:01:22.250" style="s2">talked about bringing in the German</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.910" end="01:01:27.530" style="s2">government but you are an arch Weaver</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.250" end="01:01:29.990" style="s2">and I see you we could go on for a long</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.530" end="01:01:32.930" style="s2">longer but this has been beautiful and</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.990" end="01:01:37.160" style="s2">thank you so much thank you so much</p>

<p begin="01:01:41.330" end="01:01:48.200" style="s2">way connecting to more people</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.640" end="01:01:50.960" style="s2">all through this video when it goes out</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.200" end="01:01:53.900" style="s2">so interesting right how we connect to</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.960" end="01:01:57.560" style="s2">so many people my little meekness and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.900" end="01:01:59.570" style="s2">the global family it&#39;s beautiful this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.560" end="01:02:02.120" style="s2">my little way of trying to find the</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.570" end="01:02:05.240" style="s2">rhythm with actually going local like</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.120" end="01:02:07.880" style="s2">local like I feel a very strong clarity</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.240" end="01:02:10.220" style="s2">now that my daughter&#39;s very young still</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.880" end="01:02:11.540" style="s2">and of course yes before she legally has</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.220" end="01:02:13.100" style="s2">to go to school whether we do</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.540" end="01:02:16.910" style="s2">homeschooling or not is another question</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.100" end="01:02:19.790" style="s2">that is open but I really want to spend</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.910" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">the next three years deepening my roots</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.790" end="01:02:24.050" style="s2">here and and spending time with my</p>

<p begin="01:02:24.050" end="01:02:31.360" style="s2">building a home and and so I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.670" end="01:02:34.190" style="s2">bit in this day how do I do that without</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.360" end="01:02:37.490" style="s2">like how do I disconnect a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.190" end="01:02:40.130" style="s2">from that amazing work that is out there</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.490" end="01:02:42.950" style="s2">that can be done weaving networks and</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.130" end="01:02:45.350" style="s2">people together and and just coming home</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.950" end="01:02:47.290" style="s2">to reason nourish and and just go</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.350" end="01:02:50.600" style="s2">through that cycle in the trust that um</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.290" end="01:02:53.620" style="s2">there&#39;ll be times to be more globally</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.600" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">focused again for me but but right now I</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.620" end="01:02:57.950" style="s2">need to come home to the soil and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:03:00.230" style="s2">think the same might happen for me it</p>
