<p begin="00:00:06.140" end="00:00:11.920" style="s2">Dr. Petersen, I mentioned these notions of responsibility, virtue, and respect.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.460" end="00:00:16.900" style="s2"> I think you have spoken in detail about what you think students should not do</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.000" end="00:00:20.800" style="s2"> In such matters as iprotest and some kinds of political activities.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.820" end="00:00:24.200" style="s2"> What advice would you like to give to students?</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.260" end="00:00:28.380" style="s2"> How can students make the change they want?</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.080" end="00:00:31.080" style="s2"> Of course. Read great books.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.460" end="00:00:36.700" style="s2"> Oh really. You have four years that have been allocated from your life by society.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.500" end="00:00:42.500" style="s2"> That gave you an identity worthy of pride. In addition to freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.800" end="00:00:45.800" style="s2"> And you will never get this again.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.240" end="00:00:51.860" style="s2"> You have an identity that deserves respect. A university student and complete freedom attached to it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:59.440" style="s2"> And you have these giant libraries filled with the writing of very intelligent people.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.720" end="00:01:03.540" style="s2"> And you know you can go to it and learn all these things.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.620" end="00:01:05.620" style="s2"> And you may ask why you should learn it?</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:10.440" style="s2"> Learn it to get a job? Learn it to get high grades? You learn to get a university degree?</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.440" end="00:01:12.340" style="s2"> All this is nonsense!</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2"> The reason you come to university to learn is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:21.700" style="s2"> Nothing is stronger than an intelligent person capable of thinking and expression. It&#39;s strength!</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.860" end="00:01:27.240" style="s2"> And I mean strength at its best. It&#39;s control, influence, respect and competition.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.380" end="00:01:30.220" style="s2"> So you come to the university to strengthen your best skills.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.440" end="00:01:33.280" style="s2"> And is to be strong talk.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.640" end="00:01:39.380" style="s2"> Because if you have the ability to formulate your arguments, you are a winner in everything!</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.720" end="00:01:44.680" style="s2"> And because when you win in everything, everyone around you also wins.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.020" end="00:01:54.680" style="s2"> Because converting yourself to something like a beacon means that you will spend the whole world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:58.760" style="s2"> It is of course the best thing you can do.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.000" end="00:02:02.400" style="s2"> But you should assume that you are coming to the university in order to get a job</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.500" end="00:02:09.300" style="s2"> Which is okay because it is much better than being without a job spending your time on video games.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.540" end="00:02:14.200" style="s2"> I&#39;m not against video games, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.160" end="00:02:21.300" style="s2"> But it is not reason enough to exist in this world.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.300" end="00:02:24.780" style="s2"> This is what universities should call out for.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.940" end="00:02:28.520" style="s2"> I know what Harvard students are like. I have been teaching here for five years.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.580" end="00:02:31.700" style="s2"> You are so amazing! You are amazing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:35.460" style="s2"> All of you can be the best people in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.600" end="00:02:41.700" style="s2"> You are transforming yourselves into something prominent, meaningful, with historical roots and wise with knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.820" end="00:02:45.540" style="s2"> You can do whatever you want. Which I hope is for good.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:48.900" style="s2"> Because if you have a mind, all you want will be for good.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.160" end="00:02:55.520" style="s2"> Because nothing has meaning and deserves attention and is also useful in facing life&#39;s misfortunes</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.780" end="00:02:59.980" style="s2"> More than confronting you with all your soul for good.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.460" end="00:03:02.520" style="s2"> Unfortunately, universities have neglected this matter.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:07.340" style="s2"> This is why you see everyone disavow humanity. And they must because humanity has been corrupted.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.640" end="00:03:11.080" style="s2"> This is because we no longer teach the students these things. It is very clear.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:16.280" style="s2"> Learn to think. Learn to talk. Learn to read.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:19.900" style="s2"> It makes you very powerful.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:27.460" style="s2"> I donâ€™t know why the students are not told this. It is not so difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.520" end="00:03:31.660" style="s2"> Everyone wants to hear about this. &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.960" end="00:03:33.620" style="s2"> Yes, you can do it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.060" end="00:03:37.960" style="s2"> The entire community around you has struggled for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.420" end="00:03:44.440" style="s2"> To provide each of you with this wonderful opportunity that you have before your graduation and at your graduation.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.020" end="00:03:51.620" style="s2"> Everyone is praying that you come here and see everything you can see.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:58.060" style="s2"> And this is what you should do instead of brandishing signs saying that you are wronged.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.300" end="00:04:01.960" style="s2"> You see Yale University students complain of being wronged.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.380" end="00:04:04.860" style="s2"> It makes me very anxious.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:07.640" style="s2"> For example, &quot;We are against the ruling class.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.960" end="00:04:12.960" style="s2"> No, you are the children of the ruling class. You are still young.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.360" end="00:04:22.360" style="s2"> The only reason why you are not rich is because you are still young.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.240" end="00:04:29.920" style="s2"> If you look at the 1% of people with influence, you will see that most of them are very old.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:37.300" style="s2"> Why? Because when you get old and are reasonably successful you are exchanging your youth for wealth in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.580" end="00:04:39.580" style="s2"> But you will still be old in the end.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.860" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2"> Are you going to barter? Are you exchanging your youth for this?</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:47.620" style="s2"> If you take age out of the economic equation, things are completely different.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.820" end="00:04:51.720" style="s2"> Older people of course have more money. They have kept collecting it all their lives.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.980" end="00:04:53.980" style="s2"> Is this unfair?</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.420" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2"> Of course it is fair unless you want to spend your life in complete poverty when you are in your seventieth year.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.540" end="00:05:01.540" style="s2"> And you don&#39;t want this.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.420" end="00:05:10.420" style="s2"> So I do not understand what happens to universities. I can&#39;t believe you are not told the first day you come</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:17.700" style="s2"> &quot;You are on a heroic mission here. You have to take your capabilities to unimaginable levels in order to highlight yourselves.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.920" end="00:05:19.920" style="s2"> &quot;You will get out of here and no one can stop you.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.120" end="00:05:22.120" style="s2"> &quot;You will be able to do whatever you want.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.480" end="00:05:29.900" style="s2"> That is why you are here. Instead, you are taught that the world is a place full of injustice and persecution, and that you are a victim.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.260" end="00:05:36.200" style="s2"> And there is nothing you can do about it. Except for the re-dismantling of society ruled by men.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.620" end="00:05:43.020" style="s2"> It is very pitiful. To universities, you feel ashamed that this is what students are taught.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.340" end="00:05:44.780" style="s2"> I am ashamed of it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:50.060" style="s2"> I have asked many parents about their reasons for making their children go to vocational colleges.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.360" end="00:05:57.060" style="s2"> Because at least they are learning something useful. And something to say is really bad for someone like me.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.480" end="00:06:04.060" style="s2"> Because I believe that getting the best education possible is the best thing for you and the community.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.680" end="00:06:07.820" style="s2"> Why did the universities forget this?</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.120" end="00:06:15.660" style="s2"> It is postmodernism, modern Marxism, and a philosophy of resentment of everything and victimization.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.420" end="00:06:19.460" style="s2"> Oh my God it&#39;s very pitiful.</p>
