<p begin="00:00:05.000" end="00:00:10.620" style="s2">my thinking on this was that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.410" end="00:00:13.559" style="s2">doing all this music sampling people</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.620" end="00:00:15.660" style="s2">talking about stuff and some of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.559" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">people are public intellectuals and some</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.660" end="00:00:19.050" style="s2">of them are former Navy SEALs but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:22.310" style="s2">all people that I think have got</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.050" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">something a value to add to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.310" end="00:00:27.289" style="s2">concurrent conversation of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:31.410" style="s2">important right now at this really</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.289" end="00:00:34.230" style="s2">important point of development as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.410" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">species anyway so yeah I could be</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.230" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">thinking about all these people as kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:40.890" style="s2">of characters and archetypes and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.149" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">have you you know this expanded almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.890" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">like a universe I started to think of it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">like the Marvel Cinematic Universe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">like the meaning way of the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:50.340" style="s2">each person had a part to play and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:51.989" style="s2">figured well Peterson who was the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.340" end="00:00:55.559" style="s2">one I did was kind of like the Iron Man</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.989" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">figure who you know he&#39;s a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.559" end="00:01:01.410" style="s2">earthly science-based character he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:03.149" style="s2">too out there or too crazy or anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.410" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">you know people was talking about stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">that was on an earthly level that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:07.049" style="s2">could regular people could relate to and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">stuff in the same way they launched the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.049" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">Marvel Cinematic Universe with Iron Man</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:13.320" style="s2">who was a guy who built a suit you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">imagine that being a true thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.320" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">could happen you know and then it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:19.040" style="s2">expands and then he gets to like Doctor</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">Strange you like brings in the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.040" end="00:01:23.159" style="s2">magic and then somehow you can do</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">anything and so I was thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.159" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">characters in it like this then I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">thinking about the IDW was kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:33.150" style="s2">like The Avengers who you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:35.670" style="s2">sort of group of of powered individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.150" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">who were gathered together for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.670" end="00:01:43.729" style="s2">critical moment so as regards to each</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">one was I don&#39;t know I mean what but</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.729" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">before what what is your take on the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">anyway what is what does it mean to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:52.470" style="s2">what is it really know well I think for</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">a little bit just go down the road</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.470" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">you&#39;re going down right let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">because I&#39;m interested in finding that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">out but I was noticing as this one is it</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">if I like the irony they have the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">that at least one of the characters in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">the story that you&#39;re telling Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">Peterson tells the story about how you</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:08.489" style="s2">create mythologies of the mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">new abstract up and you&#39;re telling a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.489" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">story which is embedding his story in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:13.580" style="s2">the context of the mythology of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:15.110" style="s2">storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.580" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">and I was noticing as you were talking I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.110" end="00:02:17.810" style="s2">sort of imagining how this shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:20.360" style="s2">all the different kinds of mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.810" end="00:02:23.750" style="s2">like are they actually Greek heroes or</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.360" end="00:02:24.950" style="s2">are they like I have like a comic book</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.750" end="00:02:26.900" style="s2">image that has a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.950" end="00:02:28.790" style="s2">different like shamanic heroes from a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.900" end="00:02:31.100" style="s2">bunch of different distinct lineages all</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.790" end="00:02:32.420" style="s2">somehow being called into place but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.100" end="00:02:35.420" style="s2">this notion of there being like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.420" end="00:02:37.220" style="s2">reference to the myth of poetic layer</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.420" end="00:02:38.360" style="s2">the reference to the to the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.220" end="00:02:40.010" style="s2">layer and then each each of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.360" end="00:02:42.110" style="s2">particular individual human beings for</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.010" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">their own reasons because of who they</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.110" end="00:02:46.130" style="s2">are and how they show up in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:47.750" style="s2">has access to some portion of the myth</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.130" end="00:02:49.940" style="s2">the poetic layer and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.750" end="00:02:51.530" style="s2">mythopoetic times that&#39;s for sure the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.940" end="00:02:52.850" style="s2">mythopoetic layer you can also call the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.530" end="00:02:56.240" style="s2">architect or the archetypal yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.850" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">two two words it&#39;s not ludicrous if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.240" end="00:03:02.570" style="s2">imagine that the archetypes are always</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">existing and so the superheroes will</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.570" end="00:03:06.410" style="s2">take of archetypal archetypal structures</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:07.970" style="s2">yeah they&#39;ve been out they&#39;ve been out</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.410" end="00:03:10.520" style="s2">gods for a while and they&#39;ve introduced</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.970" end="00:03:12.770" style="s2">those concepts to the past couple of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.520" end="00:03:14.690" style="s2">generations just as sort of religions</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.770" end="00:03:17.900" style="s2">sort of died off in the West or like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.690" end="00:03:19.640" style="s2">religion that we had bros Superman and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.900" end="00:03:22.910" style="s2">Wonder Woman and the x-men and all these</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.640" end="00:03:25.070" style="s2">people sort of take these places so a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.910" end="00:03:26.600" style="s2">child who&#39;s born now who might not read</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.070" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">the Bible stories will certainly read</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.600" end="00:03:34.070" style="s2">the superhero stories or L will see them</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:35.750" style="s2">in movies and if if the the IDW are kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.070" end="00:03:37.670" style="s2">of self-selecting they&#39;ve been self</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:39.110" style="s2">selected by the culture it would make</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.670" end="00:03:41.300" style="s2">sense that they would also fill those</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.110" end="00:03:42.950" style="s2">kind of archetypal holes that they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.300" end="00:03:45.320" style="s2">required to fill those archetypal holes</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.950" end="00:03:48.850" style="s2">oh well then we can use that to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.320" end="00:03:51.019" style="s2">make sense of the question you asked me</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.850" end="00:03:52.430" style="s2">some of the characteristics that seem to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.019" end="00:03:55.810" style="s2">be showing up in these individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.430" end="00:03:58.280" style="s2">for example courage yeah they have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.810" end="00:04:00.620" style="s2">archetypal virtue of courage which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.280" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">sort of notably absent from art yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.620" end="00:04:04.250" style="s2">there was someone asked me like why even</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.150" end="00:04:05.660" style="s2">made some music with Peterson in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.250" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">first place of what I likes by him and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.660" end="00:04:10.820" style="s2">the first thing that came to mind was</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">courage was bravery yeah who is someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.820" end="00:04:15.230" style="s2">standing up for something right whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:17.479" style="s2">that is in in the face you could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.230" end="00:04:19.010" style="s2">that like a deep level like in our in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.479" end="00:04:21.410" style="s2">our bones or even in our like</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.010" end="00:04:22.850" style="s2">reproductive organs the part of us that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.410" end="00:04:25.850" style="s2">has been all about how the hell do</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.850" end="00:04:27.139" style="s2">tribes survive has a deep sense of when</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.850" end="00:04:30.289" style="s2">there are when the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.139" end="00:04:32.449" style="s2">no courage were probably so when</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.289" end="00:04:34.460" style="s2">when we feel an absence of courage and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.449" end="00:04:36.919" style="s2">then courage shows up we&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.460" end="00:04:39.889" style="s2">that whatever that is it needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.919" end="00:04:41.479" style="s2">yeah right and so that&#39;s one one piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.889" end="00:04:43.490" style="s2">and then the other piece that we also</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.479" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">see is well I guess I&#39;m gonna break this</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.490" end="00:04:50.689" style="s2">into two one is this notion of a an</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:53.289" style="s2">unreasonable attraction to the truth all</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.689" end="00:04:57.800" style="s2">right so a sense of a willingness to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.289" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">to take pain to like suffer in in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.800" end="00:05:01.909" style="s2">defense of what is perceived to be true</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:04.580" style="s2">all right so rather than being able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.909" end="00:05:06.110" style="s2">capitulate or to equivocate saying no</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.580" end="00:05:09.139" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna kind of like come in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.110" end="00:05:11.659" style="s2">say what I think is true and almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.139" end="00:05:12.650" style="s2">almost blindly not like calculating when</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.659" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">I take the consequence I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.650" end="00:05:16.099" style="s2">good idea but for some reason I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.210" end="00:05:18.620" style="s2">wired is one of these people who just</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.099" end="00:05:21.379" style="s2">can&#39;t feel good about things not being</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.620" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">true and then the other aspect over here</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.379" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">is something about stepping out like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">bigger picture like zooming out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:28.909" style="s2">taking a look at things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:29.479" style="s2">right in front of us and trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.909" end="00:05:31.909" style="s2">like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.479" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">something&#39;s going on and again look if</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.909" end="00:05:35.689" style="s2">you think about this in terms of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:37.580" style="s2">straight evolution you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.689" end="00:05:40.879" style="s2">there&#39;s a situation where we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.580" end="00:05:41.990" style="s2">encamped in a valley for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.879" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">it&#39;s worked out we&#39;ve got a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.990" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">being and but we&#39;re noticing for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:47.659" style="s2">that maybe the hunt isn&#39;t producing as</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:49.250" style="s2">well as it used to where the watering</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.659" end="00:05:51.349" style="s2">hole seems to be getting drier every</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.250" end="00:05:52.430" style="s2">couple of years and most people still</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.349" end="00:05:53.899" style="s2">are just kind of like that&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.430" end="00:05:55.669" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing thing and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.899" end="00:05:57.589" style="s2">focused on what&#39;s going on but a couple</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.669" end="00:05:59.509" style="s2">of folks they step back and like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.589" end="00:06:01.189" style="s2">minute what&#39;s that mean like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.509" end="00:06:03.949" style="s2">happening here and something there whoa</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.189" end="00:06:06.189" style="s2">hold on guys we may have to leave now</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.949" end="00:06:08.210" style="s2">leaving the valley is dangerous as</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.189" end="00:06:09.289" style="s2">going from where you are where things</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.210" end="00:06:11.750" style="s2">working understand what&#39;s happening to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.289" end="00:06:13.339" style="s2">new place is a really bad idea so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.750" end="00:06:14.569" style="s2">not gonna be well-received which is why</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.339" end="00:06:15.979" style="s2">it takes a certain kind of courage to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.569" end="00:06:17.930" style="s2">willing to step up and say it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.979" end="00:06:19.939" style="s2">because we&#39;ve had to do that a lot to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.930" end="00:06:20.300" style="s2">humans and humans more than any other</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.939" end="00:06:21.949" style="s2">animal</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.300" end="00:06:24.589" style="s2">we&#39;re the only animal that is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.949" end="00:06:26.509" style="s2">designed the ability to get up from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.589" end="00:06:28.159" style="s2">whole niche like to leave the African</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.509" end="00:06:31.250" style="s2">savannah and migrate to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.159" end="00:06:32.870" style="s2">Arctic we&#39;re the only animal that has to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.250" end="00:06:34.669" style="s2">have some system that&#39;s able to be able</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.870" end="00:06:36.379" style="s2">to detect when it&#39;s time to do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.669" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">alright so then this is the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.379" end="00:06:39.649" style="s2">step back and try to figure out okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:41.330" style="s2">what is the basis that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.649" end="00:06:43.430" style="s2">use to perceive a bigger pic</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:45.650" style="s2">that allow us to make good choices in an</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.430" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">environment where something is wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.650" end="00:06:49.640" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be very subtle like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:52.220" style="s2">what name it very well if it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.640" end="00:06:53.300" style="s2">mythopoetic layer so maybe that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.220" end="00:06:55.490" style="s2">think is that that&#39;s what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.300" end="00:06:57.220" style="s2">it&#39;s showing up so it&#39;s also perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.490" end="00:06:59.390" style="s2">superpower to be able to detect that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.220" end="00:07:01.760" style="s2">think it&#39;s a if we&#39;re using the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.390" end="00:07:03.920" style="s2">superpower in its market typical sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.760" end="00:07:05.600" style="s2">it is for sure superpower as we just</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.920" end="00:07:07.700" style="s2">described it yeah and it&#39;s listened to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.600" end="00:07:09.530" style="s2">all the times summon the man or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.700" end="00:07:10.850" style="s2">speaker or whatever they whoever&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.530" end="00:07:13.930" style="s2">required at that point in time always</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.850" end="00:07:16.130" style="s2">seems just show up mm-hmm and now</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.930" end="00:07:17.750" style="s2">whoever&#39;s showing God be showing up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.130" end="00:07:22.100" style="s2">it&#39;s the Internet is allowing that to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.750" end="00:07:26.710" style="s2">happen it&#39;s kind of yeah well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.100" end="00:07:28.550" style="s2">this is I mean cuz it does spread I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.710" end="00:07:30.350" style="s2">still one of those things that people</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.550" end="00:07:34.370" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t think people fully grasp</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.350" end="00:07:36.110" style="s2">the enormity of it an idea as person and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.370" end="00:07:38.150" style="s2">say I think and it can just</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.110" end="00:07:39.500" style="s2">reverberate throughout everything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.150" end="00:07:43.940" style="s2">all me well spoke about this before but</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.500" end="00:07:45.590" style="s2">I feel the Joe Rogan is by far the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.940" end="00:07:47.540" style="s2">influential broadcaster of the last</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.590" end="00:07:49.010" style="s2">decade and it&#39;s probably more</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.540" end="00:07:51.650" style="s2">influential than any broadcaster who</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.010" end="00:07:54.680" style="s2">came before him at this point</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.650" end="00:07:57.830" style="s2">a selection of guests on his show can</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:07:59.990" style="s2">shift the course of culture completely</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.830" end="00:08:01.460" style="s2">someone can go on there and introduce a</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.990" end="00:08:03.140" style="s2">new concept and millions of people that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.460" end="00:08:07.210" style="s2">will then spread and people could adopt</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.140" end="00:08:07.210" style="s2">that thing immediately whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.710" end="00:08:14.810" style="s2">with regards to the IDW as superheroes I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.710" end="00:08:15.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know where that puts Rogan didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.810" end="00:08:20.150" style="s2">you think Nick Fury</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.830" end="00:08:21.470" style="s2">I like the Nick Fury feel ya know but</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.150" end="00:08:23.570" style="s2">then I was like maybe I require steins</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.470" end="00:08:26.300" style="s2">Nick Fury because it was Weinstein seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.570" end="00:08:28.010" style="s2">to be kind of pulling things together a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.300" end="00:08:29.210" style="s2">bit and seems to see something coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.010" end="00:08:31.150" style="s2">that requires these particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.210" end="00:08:33.320" style="s2">individuals to be assembled this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.150" end="00:08:34.550" style="s2">generational thing and I connected Nick</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.320" end="00:08:36.950" style="s2">Fury is Nick Fury and his Howling</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.550" end="00:08:38.690" style="s2">Commandos yeah not Nick Fury agent of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.950" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">shield yes there you go when his agent</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.690" end="00:08:44.180" style="s2">of shield Eric won but I this is it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:45.650" style="s2">I grew up with you know the first fury</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.180" end="00:08:47.570" style="s2">be has been completely eclipsed by</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.650" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">samuel l.jackson fury and you&#39;re blind</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.570" end="00:08:50.270" style="s2">yeah totally different guy like full</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">blank yes if you think about the guy</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.779" end="00:09:02.300" style="s2">that&#39;s broken bad yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.140" end="00:09:05.390" style="s2">you think what the guy who&#39;s like more</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.300" end="00:09:07.070" style="s2">of the intelligence operative who is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.390" end="00:09:09.769" style="s2">able to figure out how to make things</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.070" end="00:09:11.329" style="s2">happen inside large complex</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.769" end="00:09:13.490" style="s2">bureaucracies where there&#39;s betrayers</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.329" end="00:09:14.720" style="s2">here and there and kind of but can you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.490" end="00:09:17.450" style="s2">know really is at the end of the day at</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.720" end="00:09:18.829" style="s2">his core the same guy right his essence</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.450" end="00:09:21.079" style="s2">and can then bring people together on</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.829" end="00:09:22.760" style="s2">the basis of hero right it called out</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.079" end="00:09:25.220" style="s2">the hero essence when it&#39;s needed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.760" end="00:09:26.870" style="s2">much more Eric yeah that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.220" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">court call out the hero essence when</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.870" end="00:09:31.399" style="s2">needed yeah yeah and that&#39;s where this</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:33.800" style="s2">key thing and put is that we now have</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.399" end="00:09:36.620" style="s2">that this is part of the whole sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.800" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">internet versus old media thing it just</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.620" end="00:09:42.410" style="s2">wasn&#39;t possible before in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:45.230" style="s2">that was it Kirby wasn&#39;t Morrison anyway</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.410" end="00:09:46.820" style="s2">I think Kirby or Morrison with you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.230" end="00:09:49.070" style="s2">would say that comics is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.820" end="00:09:51.019" style="s2">ultimate art form because you can do</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.070" end="00:09:52.519" style="s2">anything within it and you can tell the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.019" end="00:09:54.260" style="s2">story as long as you need to and you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.519" end="00:09:55.940" style="s2">have any kind of special effects and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.260" end="00:09:58.970" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.940" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">limitations of movies or television and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.970" end="00:10:03.380" style="s2">Internet has done that with idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:05.089" style="s2">spreading and meme spreading it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.380" end="00:10:06.620" style="s2">have the limitations that television or</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.089" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">newspapers or any of these things had</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.620" end="00:10:12.829" style="s2">you can spread the meme as trans McKenna</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.010" end="00:10:15.200" style="s2">will talk about in it almost infinite</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.829" end="00:10:17.870" style="s2">fashion you can take an idea and it can</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.200" end="00:10:19.940" style="s2">disseminate as far as as far as it can</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.870" end="00:10:22.940" style="s2">in a way that it just wasn&#39;t possible</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.940" end="00:10:24.230" style="s2">before wasn&#39;t imaginable before let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.940" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">take it further than that because as you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.230" end="00:10:27.860" style="s2">as you were saying it I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:29.630" style="s2">feel into the like comics and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.860" end="00:10:33.260" style="s2">Internet and I was noticing that I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.630" end="00:10:34.070" style="s2">just to do it this way the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.260" end="00:10:35.180" style="s2">happens in the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.070" end="00:10:36.649" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing something on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.180" end="00:10:41.000" style="s2">Internet I guess kinda like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.649" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">doing is that you&#39;re engaging in a what</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.000" end="00:10:43.730" style="s2">the hell was that called a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:48.140" style="s2">corpse is that right we were that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.730" end="00:10:52.130" style="s2">in art in in in broadcast in a mode like</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.140" end="00:10:54.829" style="s2">say in the moment that the Beatles were</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.130" end="00:10:57.860" style="s2">on The Ed Sullivan Show there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.829" end="00:11:00.050" style="s2">impression of an idea into the culture</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.860" end="00:11:02.630" style="s2">but it goes one direction and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:04.100" style="s2">received and the ability for that to</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.630" end="00:11:06.620" style="s2">them become generative creative on its</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.100" end="00:11:07.820" style="s2">own basis is only out here right so a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.620" end="00:11:08.630" style="s2">bunch of kids of course for sure were</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.820" end="00:11:10.070" style="s2">inspired by the Beatle</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.630" end="00:11:11.450" style="s2">he generated rock and roll and moving</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.070" end="00:11:14.290" style="s2">back out but on the internet what</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.450" end="00:11:17.570" style="s2">happens is that if somebody watches this</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.290" end="00:11:19.730" style="s2">perhaps to say a fabric that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.570" end="00:11:22.130" style="s2">be expressed and it&#39;s not our</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.130" end="00:11:26.270" style="s2">all of it all we have responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.350" end="00:11:29.270" style="s2">is to move it a little bit further and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.270" end="00:11:30.830" style="s2">to participate a little bit our piece or</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.270" end="00:11:32.660" style="s2">anybody else who happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.830" end="00:11:34.520" style="s2">participating in this in any way</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.660" end="00:11:36.140" style="s2">watching it commenting on or creating</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.520" end="00:11:39.110" style="s2">their own video in response like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.140" end="00:11:40.550" style="s2">tomorrow obviously this is a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.110" end="00:11:41.870" style="s2">tomorrow tomorrow after they watch it</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.550" end="00:11:43.190" style="s2">they could create something else and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.870" end="00:11:46.070" style="s2">part of that fabric and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.190" end="00:11:47.540" style="s2">equivalently empowered to everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.070" end="00:11:48.980" style="s2">to actually be participating in that so</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.540" end="00:11:51.170" style="s2">what that does is that actually erases</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.980" end="00:11:53.180" style="s2">remember like I think was Foucault who</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.170" end="00:11:54.230" style="s2">did the birth of the author we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.180" end="00:11:56.300" style="s2">talking about the death of the author</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.230" end="00:11:58.460" style="s2">the end of the notion that the human</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.300" end="00:12:00.050" style="s2">being is the agent of creativity and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.460" end="00:12:02.450" style="s2">recovery of the notion there being some</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.050" end="00:12:03.710" style="s2">kind of more collaborative sense where</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.450" end="00:12:05.150" style="s2">you&#39;re generating and pulling in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.710" end="00:12:07.010" style="s2">the source of creation is happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.150" end="00:12:09.020" style="s2">outside of us entirely there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.010" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">really interesting as well about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.020" end="00:12:13.730" style="s2">kind of marriage of high and low culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got these incredible deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.730" end="00:12:17.750" style="s2">ideas coming out into the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:18.950" style="s2">then we&#39;re kind of you&#39;re turning it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.750" end="00:12:21.740" style="s2">into music you&#39;re turning into something</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.950" end="00:12:24.020" style="s2">that&#39;s really accessible but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.740" end="00:12:26.330" style="s2">feel because of the time we&#39;re in and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.020" end="00:12:28.070" style="s2">the way that the internet works it kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.330" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">of feels right like that those those</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.070" end="00:12:30.590" style="s2">barriers between high and low culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:33.380" style="s2">seem to have been kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.590" end="00:12:35.390" style="s2">completely if you&#39;re born after 1990</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.380" end="00:12:37.970" style="s2">they don&#39;t exist you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.390" end="00:12:40.460" style="s2">concept of that really so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.970" end="00:12:42.950" style="s2">is Joe Rogan I mean the idea that Joe</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.460" end="00:12:44.630" style="s2">Rogan is kind of the the Herald of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.950" end="00:12:46.100" style="s2">well it makes completely select all it</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.630" end="00:12:49.700" style="s2">will reawaken of course it would be Joe</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.100" end="00:12:51.800" style="s2">Rogan because Joe Rogan is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.700" end="00:12:53.930" style="s2">honest with himself enough to know that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.800" end="00:12:55.640" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t know everything lots of smart</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.930" end="00:13:00.100" style="s2">people aren&#39;t smart enough to know they</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.640" end="00:13:03.230" style="s2">don&#39;t know everything he&#39;s inquisitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.100" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">and he&#39;s interested and he&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.230" end="00:13:07.220" style="s2">trippy individual there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:09.620" style="s2">about you talk about sovereignty quite a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.220" end="00:13:11.210" style="s2">lot by Rogan is someone with a huge</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.620" end="00:13:12.920" style="s2">amount of sovereignty from the fighting</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.210" end="00:13:14.780" style="s2">from the kind of deep embodied nature of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.920" end="00:13:16.610" style="s2">a lot of what he&#39;s doing which seems to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.780" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">translate into the kind of having the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.610" end="00:13:19.970" style="s2">courage to go into the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:21.050" style="s2">realms and like you say kind of admit</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.970" end="00:13:22.250" style="s2">that you don&#39;t know something was</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.050" end="00:13:23.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.250" end="00:13:25.640" style="s2">I mean when we were only things that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.780" end="00:13:29.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t just mention was he also he made</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:30.710" style="s2">his living as a stand-up comedian yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.000" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the massive event</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.710" end="00:13:33.590" style="s2">continues to a third yeah but he</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:35.240" style="s2">continues it&#39;s not like that&#39;s a side</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.590" end="00:13:36.620" style="s2">gig that&#39;s like his main passion and</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.240" end="00:13:38.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a skill set right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.620" end="00:13:40.820" style="s2">capacity to simultaneous to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.030" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">use your mind to think of and receive</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.820" end="00:13:46.070" style="s2">things to convey through speech but to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:47.720" style="s2">read a room is the hardest thing reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.070" end="00:13:49.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a level above deejaying on that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.720" end="00:13:51.050" style="s2">DJ&#39;s have no reading a room of working</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.610" end="00:13:53.870" style="s2">out how to take people on a journey but</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.050" end="00:13:55.310" style="s2">then making them laugh yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.870" end="00:13:56.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.310" end="00:13:58.100" style="s2">that&#39;s why comedians don&#39;t get any good</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.780" end="00:14:00.890" style="s2">until they&#39;ve been doing it for about 20</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.100" end="00:14:02.150" style="s2">years like no no young comedian is</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.890" end="00:14:03.410" style="s2">actually very good they might say</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.150" end="00:14:04.910" style="s2">something funny now and again they might</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.410" end="00:14:06.830" style="s2">be good at Twitter but like they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.910" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">good they&#39;re not good they&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.830" end="00:14:10.100" style="s2">on that level of true greatness that a</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:11.270" style="s2">great comedian is so they&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.100" end="00:14:13.340" style="s2">it for 20 years or something</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.270" end="00:14:15.230" style="s2">till I don&#39;t give a till they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.340" end="00:14:16.850" style="s2">give a yeah yeah it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.230" end="00:14:19.430" style="s2">one of them well they have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.850" end="00:14:20.900" style="s2">be in that space that flow yes and have</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.430" end="00:14:22.220" style="s2">the skill set to them be in that space</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.900" end="00:14:23.840" style="s2">of flow yeah because you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.220" end="00:14:26.810" style="s2">trained yourself to have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.840" end="00:14:28.070" style="s2">flow by itself is gonna get it done so</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.810" end="00:14:29.390" style="s2">then what you say that his sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.070" end="00:14:31.250" style="s2">and talking about his sovereignty his</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.390" end="00:14:33.770" style="s2">sovereignty in this in this environment</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.250" end="00:14:35.930" style="s2">is very large but he has a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.770" end="00:14:37.460" style="s2">be able to perceive what&#39;s happening he</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.930" end="00:14:39.020" style="s2">has a capacity to be able to notice the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.460" end="00:14:40.550" style="s2">way that it&#39;s being expressed in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.020" end="00:14:42.950" style="s2">real environment of an actual dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.550" end="00:14:44.390" style="s2">so that it will be heard with an</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.950" end="00:14:46.070" style="s2">audience he can feel the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.390" end="00:14:48.020" style="s2">understand how the audience is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.070" end="00:14:49.430" style="s2">able to respond what&#39;s happening he</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.020" end="00:14:50.540" style="s2">himself and his body has already been</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.430" end="00:14:52.790" style="s2">trained to be able to be punched in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.540" end="00:14:54.050" style="s2">face and not shirk so as things are</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.790" end="00:14:55.130" style="s2">happening to him that might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.050" end="00:14:55.520" style="s2">pushing him that&#39;s not going to move him</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.130" end="00:14:57.230" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.520" end="00:14:59.060" style="s2">he&#39;s actually able to hold like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.230" end="00:15:00.770" style="s2">particular location in the dialogue that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.060" end="00:15:02.750" style="s2">enables the dialogue to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.770" end="00:15:04.460" style="s2">whatever it can be and then increase his</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.750" end="00:15:05.990" style="s2">capacity to be heard using his</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.460" end="00:15:08.030" style="s2">skillfulness as a as a comedian that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.990" end="00:15:09.170" style="s2">actually a it&#39;s one of these things</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.030" end="00:15:11.720" style="s2">right we live in we live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.170" end="00:15:14.270" style="s2">where we&#39;ll stay actually run back the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.720" end="00:15:16.280" style="s2">clock so a thousand years ago there were</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.270" end="00:15:17.810" style="s2">like nine jobs and what your</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.280" end="00:15:19.190" style="s2">great-grandfather did it&#39;s what you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.810" end="00:15:21.200" style="s2">probably gonna do and you didn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.190" end="00:15:22.460" style="s2">change it very much like stuck in a rock</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.200" end="00:15:23.990" style="s2">on top of a rock once you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.460" end="00:15:25.910" style="s2">figured out the basics was the way it</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.990" end="00:15:27.110" style="s2">was gonna be thatching all right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.910" end="00:15:30.080" style="s2">science of thatching is more or less</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.110" end="00:15:31.580" style="s2">figured out it has not changed and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.080" end="00:15:32.510" style="s2">you know as you fast-forward what ends</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.580" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">up happening is there&#39;s more and more</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.510" end="00:15:36.019" style="s2">things that we have to have had to learn</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:38.569" style="s2">how to do and they&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.019" end="00:15:39.769" style="s2">faster so you know it&#39;s funny it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.569" end="00:15:41.329" style="s2">odd thing to say but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.769" end="00:15:42.529" style="s2">actually quite true to say that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.329" end="00:15:44.689" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to imagine like if I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.529" end="00:15:45.980" style="s2">going to have a 15 year old kid come to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.689" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">me and say well what kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.980" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">might I want to study to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:52.249" style="s2">really capable in the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:55.129" style="s2">happening say well perhaps you should</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.249" end="00:15:57.739" style="s2">learn how to do mmm a stand-up comedy</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.129" end="00:16:03.379" style="s2">and then maybe figure out how to create</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.739" end="00:16:04.429" style="s2">your own public media and persona and if</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.379" end="00:16:05.869" style="s2">what&#39;s funny is that all those are</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.429" end="00:16:06.920" style="s2">available as you said like your son is</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.869" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">writing are doing roadblocks he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.920" end="00:16:11.509" style="s2">already learning 19 fundamental skills</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:15.079" style="s2">in that environment and his base skills</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.509" end="00:16:18.319" style="s2">right that are core so yeah Scott Adams</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.079" end="00:16:20.179" style="s2">has this idea of the talent stack like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.319" end="00:16:22.189" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to be successful in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.499" end="00:16:31.160" style="s2">the best in the world one thing but</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.999" end="00:16:32.629" style="s2">that&#39;s all you&#39;ve ever done that&#39;s a lot</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.499" end="00:16:39.529" style="s2">one thing you have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.790" end="00:16:41.509" style="s2">complementary things this is what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.529" end="00:16:43.970" style="s2">done I realized I like just out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.509" end="00:16:45.439" style="s2">forced necessity I&#39;ve made music but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.970" end="00:16:48.379" style="s2">then forced myself to learn graphic</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.439" end="00:16:50.149" style="s2">design and video editing and social</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.379" end="00:16:52.490" style="s2">media and marketing and all these other</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.490" end="00:16:56.029" style="s2">have a bunch of these skills a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.779" end="00:16:57.829" style="s2">pretty high level they&#39;re all work</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.029" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">together to mean that I can function and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.829" end="00:17:04.399" style="s2">release music and videos and things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:07.579" style="s2">three times a week speedily I can do all</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.399" end="00:17:10.250" style="s2">these things yeah well I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.579" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2">that we talked about I know how this the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.250" end="00:17:14.179" style="s2">timeline works here so I know how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:16.730" style="s2">reference or invokes but to me is in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.179" end="00:17:18.740" style="s2">recent past which me in media world be</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:20.419" style="s2">in the distant future but this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.740" end="00:17:24.279" style="s2">there being an actual stack in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.419" end="00:17:27.319" style="s2">like information knowledge skill</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.279" end="00:17:28.820" style="s2">capacity there&#39;s a there&#39;s a basis there</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.319" end="00:17:32.779" style="s2">so like you may have have learned</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.820" end="00:17:35.179" style="s2">information about what was it was one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.779" end="00:17:36.770" style="s2">the skills he just mentioned design so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.179" end="00:17:38.330" style="s2">might read a book on design of just</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.770" end="00:17:40.100" style="s2">absorbed information well I may have</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.330" end="00:17:42.230" style="s2">knowledge meaning that I&#39;ve now been</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.100" end="00:17:43.909" style="s2">able to learn like I know it I know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.230" end="00:17:45.320" style="s2">information well then a skill is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.909" end="00:17:46.549" style="s2">different right I&#39;ve actually practiced</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.320" end="00:17:48.770" style="s2">it in somewhere I&#39;ve learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.549" end="00:17:49.670" style="s2">actually use it in some fashion more</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.770" end="00:17:51.920" style="s2">than a capacities</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.670" end="00:17:54.200" style="s2">deeper which is maybe the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.920" end="00:17:56.090" style="s2">have to read and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.200" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">understand how to build a skill as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.090" end="00:17:59.900" style="s2">capacity and so you know as the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:01.220" style="s2">becomes more complex and as things</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.900" end="00:18:02.930" style="s2">change you have to go deeper on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.220" end="00:18:04.730" style="s2">stack in the fact that I may know</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.930" end="00:18:05.650" style="s2">something is irrelevant Google knows</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.730" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">everything better than I know anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.650" end="00:18:09.620" style="s2">the photo in fact that I have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:10.790" style="s2">amount of skill is relevant but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.620" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">changing it needs to be glued together</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.790" end="00:18:15.980" style="s2">so these capacities the deep capacitors</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:16.970" style="s2">are the things that are invariant ryun&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.980" end="00:18:18.530" style="s2">that&#39;s the stuff that&#39;s at the depth</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.970" end="00:18:19.580" style="s2">high bridge for a little bit though</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.530" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">because there&#39;s actually an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.580" end="00:18:23.510" style="s2">point that I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.690" end="00:18:25.670" style="s2">it might I felt I felt deeply called to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.510" end="00:18:30.920" style="s2">actually channel Heather hang in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.670" end="00:18:32.660" style="s2">high in low culture so she she</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.920" end="00:18:34.070" style="s2">particularly calls out at least in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.660" end="00:18:39.830" style="s2">experience I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.070" end="00:18:43.940" style="s2">doing publicly is this notion of so high</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.830" end="00:18:45.920" style="s2">culture is an evolutionary niche and low</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.940" end="00:18:47.420" style="s2">culture is an evolutionary niche we</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.920" end="00:18:50.330" style="s2">should to say that there&#39;s an audience</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.420" end="00:18:54.710" style="s2">the rich or the aristocratic and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.330" end="00:18:56.270" style="s2">a producer artists of a certain sort who</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.710" end="00:18:57.890" style="s2">over time learn how to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.270" end="00:18:59.780" style="s2">explore that niche and so they realize</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.890" end="00:19:01.960" style="s2">that creating music of a certain sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.780" end="00:19:04.220" style="s2">appeals to the taste of this particular</p>

<p begin="00:19:04.220" end="00:19:07.910" style="s2">appreciates it it oftentimes largely</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.620" end="00:19:09.290" style="s2">just so that they have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.910" end="00:19:11.540" style="s2">exclude other people and show that their</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.290" end="00:19:12.920" style="s2">posh and smart right yeah high culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.540" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">is that direction low culture is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.920" end="00:19:17.300" style="s2">different set of things you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:19.100" style="s2">appeal to right low culture doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.300" end="00:19:20.990" style="s2">necessary have as much of a need or</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.100" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">value in trying to differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.990" end="00:19:24.050" style="s2">themselves from other people but if they</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:26.030" style="s2">could have a good laugh right if they</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.050" end="00:19:27.650" style="s2">can actually feel a certain sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.030" end="00:19:29.410" style="s2">connection or a sense of uproar ease and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.650" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">that&#39;s good rest of different values</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.410" end="00:19:34.460" style="s2">well this is concepts in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:36.440" style="s2">called hybrid vigor where as if the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.460" end="00:19:39.740" style="s2">niche if that if the niche between the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.440" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">the aristocracy and the common people is</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.740" end="00:19:43.550" style="s2">separate for a long time these skills</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:44.630" style="s2">specialize here and these skills</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.550" end="00:19:45.950" style="s2">specialize here and they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.630" end="00:19:47.990" style="s2">they&#39;re Twain right we have high and low</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.950" end="00:19:49.460" style="s2">culture sconce EPS but when this thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.990" end="00:19:51.830" style="s2">starts to break down when a new niche</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.460" end="00:19:53.180" style="s2">emerges these skills need to reconnect</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.830" end="00:19:54.470" style="s2">with these skills why you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.180" end="00:19:56.810" style="s2">like a Joe Rogan you need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.470" end="00:19:59.030" style="s2">sensibility of the low culture how do I</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.810" end="00:20:00.290" style="s2">get to get a lap but then me like</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.030" end="00:20:02.090" style="s2">Russell Brand you also have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.290" end="00:20:03.320" style="s2">sensibility of okay what are these</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.090" end="00:20:05.150" style="s2">things that kind of titillate</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.320" end="00:20:06.770" style="s2">these sensibilities and build a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.150" end="00:20:08.390" style="s2">sharpness or capacity to confront and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.770" end="00:20:10.280" style="s2">you can combine them you have hyper</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.390" end="00:20:12.020" style="s2">configure you have this new species</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.280" end="00:20:13.670" style="s2">which has a vastly higher capability of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.020" end="00:20:15.890" style="s2">exploring a new space a novel</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.670" end="00:20:17.300" style="s2">environment and I think it&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.890" end="00:20:19.010" style="s2">to say they were in a novel environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.300" end="00:20:21.380" style="s2">I kind of get the sense with the IDW at</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.010" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">the moment that it&#39;s it&#39;s an initial</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.380" end="00:20:25.880" style="s2">kind of stake in the ground for a new</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:27.680" style="s2">kind of conversation it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.880" end="00:20:29.030" style="s2">almost like people gathering together to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.680" end="00:20:30.560" style="s2">say okay we need to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.030" end="00:20:33.380" style="s2">conversations about these certain topics</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.560" end="00:20:35.480" style="s2">so I kind of sense that it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.380" end="00:20:38.690" style="s2">doing its job in terms of staking out</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.480" end="00:20:40.040" style="s2">kind of an area to have that where do</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.690" end="00:20:42.680" style="s2">you think that goes do you think we end</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.040" end="00:20:44.570" style="s2">up with this kind of cinematic universe</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.680" end="00:20:45.590" style="s2">getting more and more characters is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.570" end="00:20:47.300" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.590" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">grow do you think once this thing has</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.300" end="00:20:52.310" style="s2">happened once and it comes the bravery</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.510" style="s2">aspect oh you can go out there and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.310" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">talk about these things and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.510" end="00:20:56.750" style="s2">die they don&#39;t kill you immediately you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.070" end="00:20:58.220" style="s2">don&#39;t care like you don&#39;t lose your job</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.750" end="00:21:00.950" style="s2">melee or whatever some more people will</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.220" end="00:21:01.850" style="s2">do it and anyway then there&#39;s more of an</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.950" end="00:21:04.310" style="s2">appetite for it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.850" end="00:21:05.960" style="s2">is normalized to an extent so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.310" end="00:21:08.030" style="s2">seem weird anymore like people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.960" end="00:21:09.920" style="s2">running around with capes and we I</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.030" end="00:21:11.810" style="s2">could do that too you know and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.920" end="00:21:13.910" style="s2">have people who only and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.810" end="00:21:15.250" style="s2">a world of the youngest younger people</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.910" end="00:21:17.570" style="s2">who&#39;ve only ever known a world of capes</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.250" end="00:21:19.250" style="s2">that&#39;s completely normal then and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.570" end="00:21:22.070" style="s2">you can have really big</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.250" end="00:21:24.530" style="s2">conversations so it can it can only grow</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.070" end="00:21:26.630" style="s2">and it can only get more interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.530" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">they extend this or take this as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.630" end="00:21:31.880" style="s2">push which is if you think about the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:34.040" style="s2">notion of sake counterculture if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.880" end="00:21:34.970" style="s2">think about that what was the line say</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.040" end="00:21:36.920" style="s2">hello to the new boss same as the old</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.970" end="00:21:39.260" style="s2">boss if you think about what the IDW is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.920" end="00:21:42.820" style="s2">doing as being just a counterculture to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.260" end="00:21:44.930" style="s2">a centralized narrative structure I</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.820" end="00:21:47.390" style="s2">think that&#39;s wrong that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.930" end="00:21:48.710" style="s2">and so you what I would say is what</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.390" end="00:21:51.830" style="s2">happens next is what&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.710" end="00:21:54.200" style="s2">here because on the one hand we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.830" end="00:21:56.510" style="s2">part of the IDW and there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.200" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">particular intent or notion of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.510" end="00:21:59.510" style="s2">being like the IDW Junior League which</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:01.850" style="s2">is endeavouring to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.510" end="00:22:04.040" style="s2">become the IDW like are we using this to</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.850" end="00:22:07.400" style="s2">become part of that no but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.040" end="00:22:08.900" style="s2">hand we&#39;re we&#39;re presenting the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.400" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">process we&#39;re representing the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.900" end="00:22:13.850" style="s2">field which is say okay how do we come</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:16.360" style="s2">together and begin to have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.850" end="00:22:18.549" style="s2">how do we actually practice this thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.360" end="00:22:20.740" style="s2">that is about how we come together and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.549" end="00:22:23.290" style="s2">become more capable as individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.740" end="00:22:24.280" style="s2">as groups at being able to think and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.290" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">be able to ultimately make better</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.280" end="00:22:27.670" style="s2">choices and be able to do things in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:30.610" style="s2">world and so what I would expect or hope</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.670" end="00:22:33.250" style="s2">is kind of like a rhizomatic growth that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.610" end="00:22:35.170" style="s2">you&#39;ll begin to see a proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.250" end="00:22:36.130" style="s2">quite diverse and heterogeneous groups</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.170" end="00:22:39.190" style="s2">like you said the West Coast Avengers</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.130" end="00:22:40.059" style="s2">just pop up and they aren&#39;t about August</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.190" end="00:22:41.350" style="s2">Hawkeye was but they weren&#39;t worried</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.059" end="00:22:42.700" style="s2">about becoming a member of the Avengers</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.350" end="00:22:45.070" style="s2">they were about doing their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.700" end="00:22:46.870" style="s2">right and that&#39;s the idea right is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.070" end="00:22:49.210" style="s2">it&#39;s because this playing field is in</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.870" end="00:22:52.360" style="s2">fact perfectly flat it is smooth across</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.210" end="00:22:54.220" style="s2">the board it&#39;s now more of a this is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.360" end="00:22:55.900" style="s2">way to play a game there&#39;s a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.220" end="00:22:59.140" style="s2">game a new kind of way of playing it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.900" end="00:23:01.270" style="s2">it is no longer at all about the old</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.140" end="00:23:03.400" style="s2">boss it&#39;s actually about a completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.270" end="00:23:06.250" style="s2">new dynamic I guess this is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.400" end="00:23:07.750" style="s2">thinking looks like and now you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.250" end="00:23:12.040" style="s2">what thinking looks like maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.750" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">do it this is a superhero this is what a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.040" end="00:23:15.309" style="s2">superhero is this is what he does this</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:17.130" style="s2">is what he stands for he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.309" end="00:23:20.020" style="s2"> wants to save the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.130" end="00:23:21.940" style="s2">he&#39;s an emblem of the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.020" end="00:23:25.020" style="s2">humanity and we&#39;re at this point where</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.940" end="00:23:27.640" style="s2">we&#39;re about to as we&#39;ve talked about but</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.020" end="00:23:30.040" style="s2">it&#39;s either death and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.640" end="00:23:32.380" style="s2">destruction or glory and Wonder it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.040" end="00:23:35.080" style="s2">either like everything squandered or the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.380" end="00:23:38.140" style="s2">potential realized like sort of now is</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.080" end="00:23:41.080" style="s2">you know the time is now and only you</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.140" end="00:23:42.429" style="s2">can save mankind which is this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.080" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">message of the superhero or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.429" end="00:23:46.870" style="s2">which is the message of the superhero</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:48.610" style="s2">isn&#39;t someone&#39;s gonna fly in and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.870" end="00:23:50.020" style="s2">save your ass it&#39;s like only you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.610" end="00:23:51.760" style="s2"> save what needs saving and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.020" end="00:23:52.929" style="s2">that&#39;s what you need to do is become</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.760" end="00:23:55.030" style="s2">your own personal life</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.929" end="00:23:56.410" style="s2">yeah become that or whatever it happens</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.030" end="00:23:58.200" style="s2">to be I mean you made you it may</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.410" end="00:24:00.460" style="s2">actually be in a position where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.200" end="00:24:01.929" style="s2">helping save something some other</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.460" end="00:24:03.760" style="s2">environment yeah you might actually save</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.929" end="00:24:06.130" style="s2">the actual world yeah you might actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.760" end="00:24:08.919" style="s2">might be that big yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.130" end="00:24:11.169" style="s2">possible that&#39;s potentiality at this</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.919" end="00:24:12.100" style="s2">point but of course no I it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.169" end="00:24:14.169" style="s2">because we now have this in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.100" end="00:24:15.970" style="s2">environment I can I can say that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.169" end="00:24:18.490" style="s2">also be mindful of part of the message</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.970" end="00:24:20.110" style="s2">that Peterson is spreading which is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.490" end="00:24:21.970" style="s2">not necessarily the case that is your</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.110" end="00:24:23.860" style="s2">particular responsibility to save the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.970" end="00:24:25.300" style="s2">world and not everybody needs to run out</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.860" end="00:24:27.190" style="s2">of the costume and bang someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.300" end="00:24:28.809" style="s2">round the head because like you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.190" end="00:24:30.160" style="s2"> up if you&#39;re not ready if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.809" end="00:24:31.900" style="s2">ain&#39;t done the training later you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.160" end="00:24:34.180" style="s2">you can trigger a video go out there and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.900" end="00:24:36.730" style="s2">be Luke Cage if you don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.180" end="00:24:38.410" style="s2">punch it and I guess the other the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.730" end="00:24:40.060" style="s2">superpower is the ability to have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.410" end="00:24:43.480" style="s2">conversations which is what you were</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.060" end="00:24:45.340" style="s2">talking about with courage the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.480" end="00:24:47.020" style="s2">ability to get yourself into the space</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.340" end="00:24:49.900" style="s2">where you can have a generative</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.020" end="00:24:52.390" style="s2">conversation is in itself a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.900" end="00:24:53.950" style="s2">superpower it&#39;s a bunch we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.390" end="00:24:55.900" style="s2">outside the notion of curation as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.950" end="00:24:58.660" style="s2">which is the same kind of skill set so</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.900" end="00:25:00.760" style="s2">in a conversation there&#39;s a notion of me</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.660" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">listening to you in trying to out of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.760" end="00:25:04.660" style="s2">thing that is being endeavoring to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:07.390" style="s2">expressed how do I identify the highest</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.660" end="00:25:08.440" style="s2">possible aspect of that because there</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.390" end="00:25:09.850" style="s2">are many right and of course in</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.440" end="00:25:11.380" style="s2">traditional debate or even the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.850" end="00:25:14.290" style="s2">aspect in turn what you&#39;re saying into</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.380" end="00:25:15.880" style="s2">some my effort is try to find</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.290" end="00:25:17.890" style="s2">the highest SATs but can bring that out</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.880" end="00:25:19.690" style="s2">and then send something back to you that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.890" end="00:25:20.950" style="s2">is honoring what you said I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.690" end="00:25:22.690" style="s2">changing I&#39;m just trying to listen and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.950" end="00:25:23.800" style="s2">bring it up well we can do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.690" end="00:25:25.300" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s how you have a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.800" end="00:25:26.950" style="s2">conversation right we actually oh and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.300" end="00:25:28.180" style="s2">that&#39;s neat that&#39;s interesting let me</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.950" end="00:25:29.740" style="s2">add more of that it&#39;s there more here</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.180" end="00:25:31.720" style="s2">but you can also do that in the meta</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.740" end="00:25:33.880" style="s2">conversation and if you&#39;re watching this</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.720" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">video you&#39;re part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.880" end="00:25:37.630" style="s2">but in a meta level you can curate it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:39.550" style="s2">you can up regulate it and share it or</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.630" end="00:25:40.540" style="s2">you can add your own voice to it as</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.550" end="00:25:42.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the ideas we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.540" end="00:25:44.800" style="s2">recognize that the same set of skills to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.940" end="00:25:46.180" style="s2">be well honestly just to be in</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.800" end="00:25:47.650" style="s2">relationship with yourself well just to</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.180" end="00:25:49.660" style="s2">be able to speak and think clearly as an</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.650" end="00:25:51.850" style="s2">individual in congruence and integrity</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.660" end="00:25:54.070" style="s2">shows up as the set of skills to be able</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.850" end="00:25:56.530" style="s2">to do it as a group and then as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.070" end="00:25:59.500" style="s2">out to do it as a collection as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.530" end="00:26:00.250" style="s2">community yeah unmask this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.500" end="00:26:02.200" style="s2">things that people don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.250" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">talk about with regards to the influence</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.200" end="00:26:06.730" style="s2">of YouTube is that the the the way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:08.530" style="s2">people act interact with the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.730" end="00:26:10.570" style="s2">video pretty much according to research</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.530" end="00:26:11.710" style="s2">as they look at the video they start</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.570" end="00:26:14.170" style="s2">watching it and then immediately scroll</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.710" end="00:26:17.110" style="s2">down the comments almost immediately so</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.170" end="00:26:20.740" style="s2">the the comments section people reacting</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.110" end="00:26:23.260" style="s2">to the video is seen as much as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.740" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">actual thing itself like is as important</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.260" end="00:26:26.560" style="s2">we were talking about this earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.120" end="00:26:29.470" style="s2">regards to I think it was a dreadful</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.560" end="00:26:31.570" style="s2">mistake for the conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.470" end="00:26:33.700" style="s2">Peterson and Harris to not be broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.570" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">live yeah they should have been streamed</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.700" end="00:26:38.560" style="s2">live people could be everyone would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:40.060" style="s2">getting any information at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.560" end="00:26:41.530" style="s2">and kind of like working on it together</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.060" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">at the same time and that there would</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.530" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">have been a vast conversation this</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.160" end="00:26:49.510" style="s2">a big part of that it&#39;s Peterson talks</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.920" end="00:26:51.280" style="s2">about how he likes to speak live and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.510" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">can see from the reactions of people out</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.280" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">there like how is things how it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:58.270" style="s2">down and that&#39;s the comment section now</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:00.360" style="s2">you know YouTube comment sessions can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.270" end="00:27:02.380" style="s2">full of morons but they&#39;re also full of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.360" end="00:27:04.840" style="s2">what&#39;s the opposite of a moron I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.380" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">know whatever like I see some other</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:09.910" style="s2">people who are watching this people in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:14.050" style="s2">my comment section my comment section is</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.620" end="00:28:27.970" style="s2">because put a stake in the heart of with</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.350" end="00:28:29.470" style="s2">the idea of free speech is because I</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.970" end="00:28:31.980" style="s2">shock to me that we live in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.470" end="00:28:35.650" style="s2">where that still isn&#39;t clear yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.980" end="00:28:36.820" style="s2">what is this concept and I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.650" end="00:28:37.870" style="s2">living in an environment now we can may</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.820" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">even be able to say it quite clearly</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.870" end="00:28:44.260" style="s2">which is free speech is about the degree</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:48.810" style="s2">to which one is able to provide high</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.260" end="00:28:50.020" style="s2">quality high bandwidth signal that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.810" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">insightful</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.020" end="00:28:55.450" style="s2">all right so free speech is that so if</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.800" style="s2">you if I convey to you high quality</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.450" end="00:28:59.410" style="s2">meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.800" end="00:29:01.540" style="s2">the there&#39;s a clarity of expression high</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.410" end="00:29:02.590" style="s2">fidelity meaning it is in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.540" end="00:29:03.910" style="s2">precisely what it is that I am</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.590" end="00:29:05.320" style="s2">perceiving and endeavoring to express</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.910" end="00:29:06.520" style="s2">I&#39;m not lying or manipulating I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.320" end="00:29:08.920" style="s2">trying to do anything with it other than</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.520" end="00:29:10.600" style="s2">expressing it isn&#39;t high-bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.920" end="00:29:12.400" style="s2">meaning there&#39;s a whole lot to it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.600" end="00:29:13.990" style="s2">deep inside which is the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.400" end="00:29:14.920" style="s2">being expressed is worthy of being</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.990" end="00:29:16.300" style="s2">expressed at the level that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.920" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">expressed right so those characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.300" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">are where free speech is now if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:22.750" style="s2">violating any one of those four</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:24.490" style="s2">parameters then you&#39;re not engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.750" end="00:29:25.960" style="s2">free speech all right so if I censor you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.490" end="00:29:28.030" style="s2">I&#39;m doing something which is shutting</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.960" end="00:29:30.430" style="s2">down at a minimum the bandwidth right if</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.030" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">I am misinterpreting you I&#39;m shutting</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.430" end="00:29:34.030" style="s2">down safe the fidelity of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:35.080" style="s2">happening if I&#39;m manipulating you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.030" end="00:29:37.150" style="s2">definitely should know that the fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.080" end="00:29:38.560" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m hijacking the communications</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.150" end="00:29:40.420" style="s2">channel is we could have values</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.560" end="00:29:41.980" style="s2">information theory which we probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.420" end="00:29:43.960" style="s2">ought to it since we live in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.980" end="00:29:46.810" style="s2">information age to redefine this</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.960" end="00:29:48.550" style="s2">character this concept in a modern way</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.810" end="00:29:49.750" style="s2">it actually makes much more clear the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.550" end="00:29:51.820" style="s2">thing we&#39;re dealing with and so it helps</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.750" end="00:29:53.290" style="s2">clarify if I&#39;m running a message board</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.820" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">and people are engaging in things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.290" end="00:29:58.360" style="s2">are creating noise right they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:29:59.770" style="s2">actually generating either insight</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.360" end="00:30:01.780" style="s2">they&#39;re not actually taking the time to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.770" end="00:30:04.420" style="s2">have something to say before they vomit</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.780" end="00:30:05.920" style="s2">on the web webpage or of course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.420" end="00:30:08.770" style="s2">engaging in trolling which to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.920" end="00:30:10.300" style="s2">they&#39;re engaging in expression that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.770" end="00:30:12.010" style="s2">pretends to be one thing but is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.300" end="00:30:13.930" style="s2">something else these are all just forms</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.010" end="00:30:15.310" style="s2">of noise and so we can it&#39;s not hard to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.930" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">identify mister noise is very clear that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.310" end="00:30:19.330" style="s2">those are all know is great it may not</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:21.250" style="s2">be obvious that a particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.330" end="00:30:24.400" style="s2">happens to be noise but it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.250" end="00:30:25.720" style="s2">if it is trolling and not authentic</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.400" end="00:30:27.250" style="s2">expression but it is noise when we could</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.720" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">eliminate it and then what ends up</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.250" end="00:30:30.580" style="s2">happening is as you say then you&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">generated a venue where everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.580" end="00:30:33.820" style="s2">beginning to see oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:35.950" style="s2">I get what good action actually looks</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.820" end="00:30:38.050" style="s2">like exactly this is a thing this</p>

<p begin="00:30:40.990" end="00:30:44.410" style="s2">vast experiment and so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.150" end="00:30:46.330" style="s2">situation where you can go in and just</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.410" end="00:30:47.380" style="s2">say what you think immediately and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.330" end="00:30:48.970" style="s2">seen by lots of people that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.380" end="00:30:51.280" style="s2">exciting for people it&#39;s like this sort</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.270" end="00:31:08.590" style="s2">repercussions of that on a big societal</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">level because it is big repercussions</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.590" end="00:31:12.190" style="s2">the fact that you couldn&#39;t that</p>

<p begin="00:32:33.820" end="00:32:39.190" style="s2">therefore how the duty of learning how</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.710" end="00:32:41.560" style="s2">to wield that power well of curating</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.060" end="00:32:49.570" style="s2">can actually express into it so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.150" end="00:32:51.460" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s novel and the</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.460" end="00:32:55.240" style="s2">that is very different so not only is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.680" end="00:32:56.440" style="s2">a place where we&#39;re having to build new</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.240" end="00:32:59.590" style="s2">skills but these new skills are quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.440" end="00:33:01.720" style="s2">different to the old skills and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.590" end="00:33:03.520" style="s2">you&#39;re especially like when you move</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.720" end="00:33:07.180" style="s2">into the suburb when the suburbs extends</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.180" end="00:33:35.110" style="s2">interesting as well yeah I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.350" end="00:33:38.140" style="s2">just explained the moral rule that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.110" end="00:33:40.300" style="s2">were saying with is that people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.140" end="00:33:43.030" style="s2">comment have power and with that comes</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.300" end="00:33:45.340" style="s2">responsibility and that if we&#39;re yeah as</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.030" end="00:33:47.590" style="s2">curators it&#39;s okay to to remove people</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.340" end="00:33:50.200" style="s2">who are not exercising their power now</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.590" end="00:33:51.640" style="s2">the people who noticed this first in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.200" end="00:33:54.160" style="s2">Cardinal web part of the comic book</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.640" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">analogy this is but this is ties in with</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.160" end="00:34:00.850" style="s2">the new where we&#39;re going but it was the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:02.620" style="s2">the smart trolls the ones who realized</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.850" end="00:34:04.660" style="s2">that they did have a power and they had</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.620" end="00:34:07.480" style="s2">a power to change things in a Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.660" end="00:34:10.300" style="s2">magic type fashion they had a power to</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.480" end="00:34:12.370" style="s2">sort of collectively push sort of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.300" end="00:34:14.550" style="s2">and change people&#39;s perceptions of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.370" end="00:34:17.890" style="s2">people via sort of like meme</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.550" end="00:34:20.020" style="s2">affiliations or outright falsehoods or</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.020" end="00:34:24.220" style="s2">hits this was a thing that a generation</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.690" end="00:34:26.350" style="s2">discovered they discovered they had a</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.220" end="00:34:28.570" style="s2">huge sort of what would have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.350" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">previously called sort of chaos magical</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.570" end="00:34:36.400" style="s2">power and now you have all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">generation who are aware of that as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.400" end="00:34:41.169" style="s2">complete normal thing as in that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">normal that&#39;s real it&#39;s not theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.169" end="00:34:48.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not me jacking off over a sigil in</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:52.270" style="s2">a room hoping I can find my car keys yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.970" end="00:34:55.140" style="s2">it&#39;s that never worked for me by the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.270" end="00:34:57.130" style="s2">thank you Grant Morrison didn&#39;t work but</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.140" end="00:34:59.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that you&#39;ve seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.130" end="00:35:00.730" style="s2">prize as practical really really works</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.080" end="00:35:03.130" style="s2">you can sort of all gather together and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.730" end="00:35:04.600" style="s2">change the course of of discourse or</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.130" end="00:35:06.130" style="s2">history or whatever by combined action</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.600" end="00:35:08.380" style="s2">so the first people who discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.130" end="00:35:10.420" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the way porn dictates</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.380" end="00:35:12.010" style="s2">technological movements you know it</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.420" end="00:35:15.250" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily the sort of most</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.010" end="00:35:16.990" style="s2">useful use of that power or the best use</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.250" end="00:35:18.220" style="s2">of that power or the most heroic use of</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.990" end="00:35:20.140" style="s2">that power or whatever but it&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.220" end="00:35:22.420" style="s2">there now people know so now it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.140" end="00:35:25.390" style="s2">thing that can be harnessed for good and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.420" end="00:35:28.030" style="s2">can be harnessed for sort of heroic</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.390" end="00:35:29.230" style="s2">super heroic means of like saving the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.030" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">world and shifting the culture and all</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.230" end="00:35:31.960" style="s2">that sort of thing there&#39;s like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:34.030" style="s2">bunch of kids you just know that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.960" end="00:35:36.730" style="s2">works they can do it it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.030" end="00:35:37.350" style="s2">useful and usable so then it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.730" end="00:35:39.480" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.350" end="00:35:42.030" style="s2">we do with that power today yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.480" end="00:35:45.830" style="s2">would be the the meaning of the IDW at</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.030" end="00:35:48.840" style="s2">its depth it is re discovering and re</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.830" end="00:35:51.210" style="s2">presenting the hero archetype in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.840" end="00:35:52.980" style="s2">new environment and then inviting anyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.210" end="00:35:54.030" style="s2">to become a hero do you actually say</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.980" end="00:35:55.740" style="s2">okay this is what it feels like this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.030" end="00:35:57.990" style="s2">what it looks like and as you said and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.740" end="00:36:00.750" style="s2">anybody can in fact in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.990" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">everybody both should and must man</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.750" end="00:36:04.440" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s the thing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:06.090" style="s2">actually monsters yeah you must but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.440" end="00:36:08.280" style="s2">not easy and you have to put in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.090" end="00:36:09.480" style="s2">work yeah this is you can&#39;t just put on</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.280" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">a cape and jump off a building and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.480" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">expect a flight this is the calling so</p>

<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:25.830" style="s2">you&#39;re not likely if you&#39;re just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.120" end="00:36:28.080" style="s2">a person out in the world to sort of</p>

<p begin="00:36:40.380" end="00:36:44.760" style="s2">I&#39;m not a differential geometry but if</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.080" end="00:36:46.830" style="s2">you just decide to enter into this kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.760" end="00:36:49.470" style="s2">of conversation that&#39;s the beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.830" end="00:36:52.100" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing how rapidly just the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.470" end="00:36:54.300" style="s2">process of learning from other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.100" end="00:36:56.430" style="s2">listening learning how to listen</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.300" end="00:36:57.900" style="s2">learning how when you&#39;re shutting people</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.430" end="00:36:59.310" style="s2">down because for whatever reason your</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.900" end="00:37:00.600" style="s2">fear or anger is causing you not to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.310" end="00:37:01.980" style="s2">listen and then learning right how</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.600" end="00:37:04.170" style="s2">rapidly that just builds these skills</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.980" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s not I&#39;m gonna say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.170" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">not hard it&#39;s actually hard yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:10.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not the kind of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:11.610" style="s2">effectively everybody couldn&#39;t do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.440" end="00:37:13.020" style="s2">the thing that everybody can do and this</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.610" end="00:37:14.610" style="s2">is a thing that&#39;s been emerging recently</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.020" end="00:37:16.980" style="s2">in the conversation is that for many</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.610" end="00:37:18.420" style="s2">many years we were told we were stupid</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.980" end="00:37:19.770" style="s2">and then we could only handle six</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.420" end="00:37:21.150" style="s2">minutes of television and actually our</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.770" end="00:37:22.440" style="s2">attention spans were getting shorter and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.150" end="00:37:25.560" style="s2">shorter and we were just absolute</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.440" end="00:37:27.840" style="s2"> idiots we could only handle by</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.560" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">like tweet information and MTV or</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.840" end="00:37:30.600" style="s2">whatever it was it turns out that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:32.190" style="s2">completely untrue it turns out we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.600" end="00:37:34.140" style="s2">sit down for like three hours and listen</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.190" end="00:37:35.400" style="s2">to someone talking about something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.140" end="00:37:37.800" style="s2">we know nothing about and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.400" end="00:37:39.270" style="s2">very interested in it and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.800" end="00:37:40.860" style="s2">like a little niche section of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.270" end="00:37:42.600" style="s2">population over here and everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.860" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">is stupid dumb staring at the TV is</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.600" end="00:37:46.170" style="s2">actually way bigger than that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:48.090" style="s2">probably most people it&#39;s looking like</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.170" end="00:37:50.220" style="s2">now it&#39;s actually looking like most</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.090" end="00:37:51.190" style="s2">people are really smart and most</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.220" end="00:37:54.370" style="s2">people&#39;s capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.190" end="00:37:56.860" style="s2">for handling these kinds of subjects and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.370" end="00:37:57.940" style="s2">expanding upon them we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.860" end="00:37:59.530" style="s2">what the limits are you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.940" end="00:38:01.120" style="s2">Jordan Peterson phenomena it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.530" end="00:38:02.620" style="s2">someone&#39;s talking about Bible lectures</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.120" end="00:38:06.220" style="s2">incredibly deep Bible that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.620" end="00:38:10.300" style="s2"> Turing Studios stadiums</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.220" end="00:38:13.180" style="s2">yeah which Jordan Peterson also came to</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.180" end="00:38:17.590" style="s2">of that conversation because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.380" end="00:38:19.300" style="s2">something in the the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.590" end="00:38:21.100" style="s2">symbology of the Christ archetype is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.300" end="00:38:24.100" style="s2">that you die to yourself every moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.100" end="00:38:26.350" style="s2">and there&#39;s something in allowing parts</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.050" end="00:38:36.310" style="s2">off but maybe beliefs that you had</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.120" end="00:38:39.280" style="s2">before or things that are stopping you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.310" end="00:38:40.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of as he also says that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:42.760" style="s2">you have to allow your dead wood to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.870" end="00:38:44.530" style="s2">burned burned off if the river stops</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.760" end="00:38:47.820" style="s2">flowing then it stagnates and closes</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.530" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">ship rose in it well it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.820" end="00:38:53.860" style="s2">you know if we had been in I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:57.310" style="s2">1880s or so this would not have been a</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.860" end="00:39:01.060" style="s2">particularly notable insight I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.310" end="00:39:03.880" style="s2">know why but many people had the basic</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.060" end="00:39:06.520" style="s2">insight of let the the the dead would</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.880" end="00:39:08.350" style="s2">burn off that your job is to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.520" end="00:39:10.990" style="s2">be renewing yourself in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.350" end="00:39:14.410" style="s2">particular situation back then it had</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.990" end="00:39:16.780" style="s2">more of the basic sense of like being</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.410" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">tough like being honest being strong</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.780" end="00:39:20.260" style="s2">being powerful in the world that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:22.030" style="s2">have to learn and allow yourself to grow</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.260" end="00:39:25.000" style="s2">now we can actually do it in thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.030" end="00:39:26.980" style="s2">more fully realized way to and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.000" end="00:39:28.420" style="s2">not have secret things that are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.980" end="00:39:30.610" style="s2">embedding themselves and surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.420" end="00:39:32.080" style="s2">themselves and ever allowing things to</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.610" end="00:39:33.490" style="s2">burn off except for them then he</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.080" end="00:39:34.930" style="s2">actually can be completely open to</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.490" end="00:39:38.500" style="s2">whatever happens to be coming through</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.930" end="00:39:40.690" style="s2">and build like a very deep sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.500" end="00:39:43.120" style="s2">what was his oh it was Nietzsche that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.690" end="00:39:44.920" style="s2">tuned to philosophize with a hammer and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.120" end="00:39:47.110" style="s2">the notion that it&#39;s a sculptors hammer</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.920" end="00:39:48.610" style="s2">that&#39;s not a sledge hammer it&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.110" end="00:39:50.080" style="s2">that knocks wood precisely that which</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.610" end="00:39:52.300" style="s2">prevents the statue from revealing</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.080" end="00:39:54.790" style="s2">itself and so do building to developing</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.300" end="00:39:56.980" style="s2">a level of artistry with self so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.790" end="00:39:58.540" style="s2">you can actually allow precisely that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.980" end="00:40:00.820" style="s2">which should go away like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.540" end="00:40:04.020" style="s2">dead wood yeah it&#39;s not obvious getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.820" end="00:40:04.020" style="s2">skillful at that is a powerful skill</p>
