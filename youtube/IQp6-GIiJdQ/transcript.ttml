<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">um it&#39;s really exciting to be doing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">i&#39;m a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">fan of susan&#39;s for many years as peter</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">mentioned i&#39;m a skeptic</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:36.320" style="s2">so the first time i encountered her work</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">was at a skeptic conference</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.320" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">and um she got up to speak about i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">it was about uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:43.119" style="s2">well it&#39;s about lots of things but out</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:45.040" style="s2">of body experiences and she talked a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.119" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">little bit about her history</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.040" end="00:01:48.079" style="s2">and what really struck me is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">she&#39;s quirky she&#39;s intelligent she&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:51.040" style="s2">amazing speaker</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:52.399" style="s2">but she&#39;s also very very present in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.040" end="00:01:54.640" style="s2">way that&#39;s quite rare</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.399" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">sometimes in skeptics we&#39;re also in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.640" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">head are skeptics</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">it was nice to see someone on stage who</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">was being truly herself</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">which was very exciting uh so i&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">this evening this afternoon this morning</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">for some of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">uh to talk about um the things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in here at the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">and i think susan will have really</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">insightful things to say about most of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">this stuff because she&#39;s a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">she&#39;s a mimeticist and she&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">experience believing some very strange</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">things in her past um</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">she studied parapsychology she knows her</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">way around a lot of esoteric topics</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">um how this is gonna work is we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">have a bit of a chat i&#39;m gonna ask some</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">of the questions i&#39;ve been saving up for</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">these years as a keen reader of susan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">work and then i&#39;m gonna let you all have</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">a chance to ask your own questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">and we can do that in two different ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">if you&#39;d like to ask susan directly</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">then you can write a question just write</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">question at the top in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">and then question about x whatever your</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">question is about</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">and i&#39;ll call on you to come up on</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">screen and ask that question</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:56.319" style="s2">or if you prefer i can read your</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">question for you and this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.319" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">recorded on youtube so</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re having a bad hair day</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">or any other reason you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">appear on screen</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">you can just get me to ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">because my hair&#39;s looking amazing today</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:10.879" style="s2">uh so as i was saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">i&#39;m a long-term fan of susan&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.879" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">really like about her what i like about</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">her writing</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">is how she comes at the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">she asks from</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">at least three different directions um</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">she looks at it as a psychologist and as</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">she looks at it as well i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">you&#39;d call yourself a philosopher susan</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">but you look at it in a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">and well a thoughtful critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">sort of way let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">and then also because i never studied</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">the philosophy so i always feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">you know i mustn&#39;t call myself i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">got a philosophy degree so i yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">you mustn&#39;t call myself a philosopher oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">yeah i agree with you i kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">and then also in in this introspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">way in your actual experience like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">you when when you&#39;re writing a book for</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">example um</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">zen in the art consciousness which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">all about consciousness um you look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">from the perspective of a practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">of zen meditation</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.519" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">and from that that experiential way so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:02.879" style="s2">the first question and i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">something that we all struggle with just</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">when we&#39;re trying to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">world is how do you balance those three</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">perspectives when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">something like consciousness for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">how do you balance how do those three</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">things interrelate</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">i&#39;ve forgotten what the three are um</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">zen um no the site the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">um the the philosophical let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">philosophical inverted commerce</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">and the introspective experiential</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">perspective oh that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">now you&#39;ve explained um</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s all it&#39;s all about curiosity i mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">about i don&#39;t understand what is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">you obviously have seen zen and the art</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:44.639" style="s2">of consciousness which</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s kind of about consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.639" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s a book of it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">originally called ten zen questions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">it was me</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">just writing about my experience with</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">ten cohan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">in zen these weird questions um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">a lot of them are basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">philosophical questions who am i</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">what is this i mean what is this in zen</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">is the fundamental question and i can</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">sit here and think</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">here&#39;s a desk um here&#39;s you know my</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">hands um</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">there&#39;s the trees blowing in the cold</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">wind it&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">really cold day of the autumn now um</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">what&#39;s that got to do with with this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">brain and anyway what</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">is it i mean what is the universe made</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">of physics will tell us it&#39;s made of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">um atoms and subatomic particles and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">what have you</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">psychologists or mystics will say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">all mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">dualism has to be false in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">and many people&#39;s opinions</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">but how can this mental and physical be</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">they&#39;ve got to be but i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">it is so i&#39;ll say of an evening</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:48.479" style="s2">smoking a joint usually and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">what is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.479" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">how can it be and sometimes in deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">or with psychedelics uh particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">deep meditation</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">i meditate every day i&#39;ve done for</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">decades</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">i can get to the point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">obvious i know that i know why and how</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">monism is true um but then i</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">you know come round into a normal state</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">if there&#39;s such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">and i can&#39;t make that into a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:18.240" style="s2">but uh at the risk of rambling on at</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">great length</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">the answer to your question is they are</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">all really</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">hovering around these deep questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:27.039" style="s2">about what on earth is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">being alive being aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.039" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">immediate experience and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">is there a now or you know i mean how</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">deluded are we i&#39;m sure we&#39;re deluded</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">about consciousness and free will</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.919" style="s2">but are we deluded about time and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.919" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s all it&#39;s all part of that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">if that questioning</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">through having weird experiences um</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">takes me to a scientific question well</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll have a scientific go at it as i did</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">in several decades of doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">parapsychology and looking in vain for</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">paranormal phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:01.199" style="s2">or if it takes me to a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">direction like at the moment i&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.199" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">deep deep long months and months of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">arguing back and forth with dan dennett</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">about free will</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">then you know i like he you know he</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">knows i&#39;m not a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.639" style="s2">but he&#39;s uh it&#39;s wonderful he keeps he</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">replies the next day or within a few</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">hours and then it&#39;s a week when i</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:20.479" style="s2">kind of digest this difficult answer and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">have a go so you know i&#39;m just taken in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.479" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">whichever direction by</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">by where this curiosity takes me i</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">suppose</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting um it&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">bring up weed</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">because one of the things i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">wondering is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">in like in altered states um often</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">in fact i think you said um in one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">your talks or possibly elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">that when you had your first out body</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">experience you felt like</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">the experience you were having was</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">realer than real and i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve been one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">concerns me about psychedelics is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">possibility of breaking your brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">and believing something to be true</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">because some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">and obviously i don&#39;t really know how</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">brains work very well but some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:02.879" style="s2">chemical is released in your brain that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">makes you think things are true</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.879" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">that aren&#39;t true luckily it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">happened yet but it&#39;s always like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">concern and i wonder how you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">how you think about those moments where</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">things feel true</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">and then what you do with those feelings</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">like is that maybe that&#39;s what people</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">call gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">that sort of feeling of truth yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">the numinous</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">um yes that feeling that now i know</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">now it&#39;s right so i i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">frying your brain or whatever you called</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">um i would say it&#39;s not a particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">chemical it&#39;s a particular part of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">brain that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">that&#39;s giving the sense of ripeness and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be active</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">and so on of course there are some</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">actually many that&#39;s why you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">skeptics i guess who will take some</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">experience like that it might be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">dramatic psychedelic experience it might</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">be a very ordinary experience like</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">reading some</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">rubbish fake news um conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">thing and going yes that fits with</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">everything i&#39;ve always thought so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">obviously true and i&#39;m going to you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.040" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">tell everybody about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">um but that&#39;s not my approach obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">in that out of body experience and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">50 years ago now so</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">i mean i can still remember it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">vivid but</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">i can&#39;t rely on my memory really but</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">i i would say that my response to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">was to be completely convinced</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">by the way it felt people having nds and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">ob</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">is not so much ordinary obs some of them</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">and some not</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">but nds typically it&#39;s realer than real</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">and this may well be because at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">this is an idea that um</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">an ayahuasca a man i know who</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">who&#39;s an expert ayahuasca he wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">call himself a shaitan but</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">he is really but he&#39;s pointed out that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">um in in the many of those states you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">got no sensory input which we know is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">important for having out of body and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">near-death experiences</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">but all you&#39;ve got to go on is the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">coming in imagination</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to seem real because</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing else saying it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">real it&#39;s a very obvious point really</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">but it</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">got out to me so it&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:05.120" style="s2">this this realness</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">but that&#39;s slightly different from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.120" end="00:10:11.440" style="s2">numinous the the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">the knowing um feeling my response</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">in 50 years ago was to say well now i</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:19.519" style="s2">i&#39;m superior i know that there&#39;s more in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">your philosophy than</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.519" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">all that stuff you know um and i know</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">that there&#39;s another world because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">been there</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">and i know there&#39;s an astral body</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:29.680" style="s2">because i have seen it and felt it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">flown around with it and so i know</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">so i am going to prove to the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">particularly to my</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">physiology and psychology lecturers at</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">oxford who are very</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">you know close-minded materialist and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">i&#39;m going to prove to them that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">wrong and of course this is not a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">scientific attitude but</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">somehow being me whatever that means i</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">i was really persistent and i just went</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">on and on and on looking for paranormal</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">phenomena and never finding them</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">and then changing my whole question</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:58.640" style="s2">that&#39;s really the key</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">to being a scientist i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.640" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">a philosopher probably the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:05.200" style="s2">you ask some question and if you get an</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">answer great</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">if you find that it&#39;s the wrong question</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">that&#39;s is as helpful in another way</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">because it&#39;s the questions that you ask</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">that are important</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.399" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">so i began asking well why and how do</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">people have realer than real feeling out</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">of body experiences if it&#39;s not proof of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">another world and life after death and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">ghosts and poltergeists and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">telepathy and all the things i thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">it was and that&#39;s that&#39;s where it took</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">and that&#39;s already from the beginning a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">combination of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">a scientific approach and respecting the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">actual experiences that you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">and when something feels that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">absolute knowledge well</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">hold it it might be absolute knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">and absolutely right and really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">or it might be just</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">you know just your brain telling you</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">telling you wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the world we live in that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">kind of way our minds are so yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">go for it and explore</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">so you used the word um monas monist</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">and i kind of like i&#39;ve got these three</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">m words um materialist modest</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:08.800" style="s2">and mystic floating in my around in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">head when i think of you</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">do like in one of those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">something you write on a name label and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:16.399" style="s2">whereabouts</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">or all three that is such a pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">question this week</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:30.320" style="s2">um column and stuff for scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">american</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">wrote his scientific american blog post</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">about me</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">and we talked about these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">things in a way</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">um and then he sent me and said here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:49.040" style="s2">the link i checked all the text and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.040" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">and then he sent me the link and it said</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">at the top how to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">a mystical monitor that&#39;s a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">materialist</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">right and i went</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">and you know as much as you can in email</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">immediately how could you say this and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">i looked through the what i&#39;d what he</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">put of what i said and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">two places in that interview i&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:15.519" style="s2">materialism</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">fails it can&#39;t account for consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">at least not consciousness in the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">most people think of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:23.839" style="s2">idealism fails for the opposite reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">um i&#39;m not a materialist i keep telling</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.839" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">everybody i&#39;m not a materialist</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:30.639" style="s2">sorry i shouldn&#39;t chat um and so very</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">kindly</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.639" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">because i reacted very quickly and had</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">time to do it it was changed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">how to be a mystical skeptic</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">so you can see this little you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">debate between us was very pertinent to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">this moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">obviously a psychic phenomenon that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">asked that question</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">uh i think monist is people don&#39;t people</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">on a lot of people know what dual</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">dualist is but they don&#39;t kind of notice</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">the opposite which is modest and i just</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:13:59.360" style="s2">call myself a neutral modest</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">and if i look that up online i get</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.360" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">completely freaked out by all the clever</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">and difficult things it means</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">um and i&#39;m not a philosopher so i feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">all embarrassed and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.320" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">so i just mean all i mean is i i&#39;m damn</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">sure there&#39;s only one kind of stuff here</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">when you say materialism fails to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">explain consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">like what&#39;s what&#39;s the key failure that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">you see there</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">well if by consciousness you mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">subjective experience that is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">experience that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">i am having and is private</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">and nobody else can get into it</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">and it is um uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">different from the physical world that</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">we know from all the experiments and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">physics and chemistry and everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got you you get very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">into dualism</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">and um i was for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">i mean or yeah have been a great fan of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.639" style="s2">dan dennett because he demolishes</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">you know he&#39;s his his version of</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.639" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">illusionism it&#39;s different from mine in</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">but all the ways in which we get it</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">and um we get it wrong right from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:19.760" style="s2">start really</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">i feel that um if you take that view on</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">consciousness then</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">then you&#39;re inevitably dragged into</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">dualism and that won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">so what do you do to me the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">to to square any kind of materialism</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">the existence of this experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">is um by</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">exploring how and why we&#39;re deluded</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">about its nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">so i would say even i mentioned dan</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.959" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">dennett because</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.759" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">he he has this idea about cartesian</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">that is the idea that most philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">and scientists</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">will say no i&#39;m not a cartesian dualist</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:15:59.519" style="s2">i&#39;ve given up you know substance dualism</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:02.399" style="s2">and what have you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.519" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">um and yet they still write and talk as</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.399" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">there&#39;s an audience in the cartesian</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">heads where i</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">am you know and if i am as he would put</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">it a benign user illusion</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:14.959" style="s2">as i would put it down malign user</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">illusion that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.959" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">brings us to suffering and so on um</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">then you know what of consciousness the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:27.360" style="s2">the idea that so many scientists in in</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">the world of consciousness studies</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.360" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">say well you can&#39;t have experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">without an experiencer</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">and i go you can you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not how it normally is but you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:40.399" style="s2">deep meditation psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff happening but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">one it&#39;s happening to you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">described by many people and myself um</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">so um to come back to your question</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:53.759" style="s2">why materialism fails it either takes</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">you into dualism</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.759" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">like that or it puts you straight into</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">problems of physics and you know what</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">what does materialism mean anyway what</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">is it all made of you know in any way we</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">we only know the physics by doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">experiments which we have experience of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:10.959" style="s2">reading off the numbers on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">dials and there well you can see i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">getting into</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">i&#39;ll shut up because i&#39;m getting myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">into the sort of trouble that i like but</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">i can&#39;t say anything go here and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">well let me move you into even more um</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">troublesome</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">area uh let&#39;s talk about um</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about you know esoteric stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of things which like</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">from you know my lay person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">seem to be sort of groping at a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">conception of how culture works</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">or what we might call mimetics but in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">weird way so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.240" style="s2">jungian archetypes and i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with chaos magic at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">but they</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of looking at it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">basically the idea that there is um</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:53.520" style="s2">what alan moore calls uh like an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">world or idea realm</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.520" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">and they think that they can intervene</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">in it so they basically think they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">the way that ideas flow around it by</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">doing all sorts of rituals and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">that&#39;s like platonic sort of it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">of platonic yeah it&#39;s kind of inspired</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">by that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">but i&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">jungian archetypes so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">do you think there are connections</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">between mimetics</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">and that sort of thing are these like</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">the alchemy that will become the science</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">or are they completely divorced and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">barking up the wrong tree or what do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:26.559" style="s2">i&#39;m just smiling because i did a really</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">weird and stressful interview with</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.559" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">jordan peterson somebody&#39;s nodding</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">um he said medics is rubbish it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">just jungian archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">and no it isn&#39;t but it was so</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">so slippery to argue with that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">we never got anywhere with that but um</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">you can watch that online it&#39;s on my</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">website if anyone&#39;s interested</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">because he&#39;s quite a a strong</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">interesting character</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">um so uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">i i don&#39;t really think those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">ideas make sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">um i would say rather that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">human brains are pretty much similar</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">the world over of course every brain is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:11.039" style="s2">sculpted differently by</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:12.960" style="s2">upbringing by the memes that you um</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.039" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">are forced on you when you&#39;re young and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.960" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">then that you select as you get older</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">and become</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">more able to select the memes that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">want to keep and the ones you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">pass on</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">and so on um but it&#39;s not like there</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the the memes themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">hang on i must say for anyone who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">what i mean by the word meme i&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">its original sense from dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:37.360" style="s2">that which is imitated or that which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">copied so if somebody copies an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.360" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">painting in this way or an idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">joke or you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the idea or the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">or whatever is copied is what i call the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">meme</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about where it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">brain or any other</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">complications just just that so um</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">you could see how you&#39;d get to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">that well they&#39;re all kind of out there</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">already and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">why and and what would that where would</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">they be what would be them</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">the medium in which they&#39;re carried i</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:07.360" style="s2">mean information has to have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">have a a physical basis to to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.360" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">information it can&#39;t just go float as</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">far as i know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">can&#39;t just go floating about you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">you catch it</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">so these similarities and that would</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">apply to the archetypes which</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">in one reading of jung um</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of out there and weird in</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">their psychic synchronicity and all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">that in another reading of it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">how we evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">no wonder we&#39;re similar and we come up</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">with these architects again because of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">our similar brains</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">um so and the same i would say about</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:41.280" style="s2">having outer body experiences and so on</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t prove there&#39;s an astral body</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.280" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">that goes somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">it shows that everyone around the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">is capable of having this dislocation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">body schema</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s our similar brains that do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">so no i i</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t go in the direction of of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">ideas no</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">that makes sense to me too i i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">like i said perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">perhaps some of these things are trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">to to look for explanations and using</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">like more metaphorical thinking as they</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">explore it and come up with some strange</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">conclusions but interesting conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">yeah good to have a lot of ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">choose from when you&#39;re out exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">yeah um so the other thing that i i</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">mentioned that i wanted to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">was this idea um that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">have been talking about around here in</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">the star</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">um that we are as you know the sea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">faith recedes and we become a less</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">culture worldwide and i don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">if that&#39;s true to be honest i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">stats to hand but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:43.840" style="s2">you know generally accepted that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">religion&#39;s on the wane come true</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.840" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">in most western countries and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">in europe but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">it&#39;s dodgy elsewhere that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">popped into my head as i was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">i was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">be careful check myself but anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">this idea that without the religious</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">sort of structures that we used to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">um that gave us meaning um whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">that people are feeling a deficit and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">that&#39;s coming across in you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">this longing for the interest in</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:11.919" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">interest in philosophy and on the bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.919" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">side you know like nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">and what people some people have called</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">a mental health crisis again</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have statistics but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">interesting observation</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">i just wanted as someone who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">atheist was obviously is concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">these big questions</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">what you make of that do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">to talk about the idea of a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">crisis even makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">and what would you suggest would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">solutions if you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">i suspect that it&#39;s not i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">what you mean by meaning exactly but i</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">suspect it&#39;s not so much meaning as</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s the feeling of purposelessness that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">gets people down</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">and christianity um gives you a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:53.919" style="s2">um because you know obeying god&#39;s will</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">so does islam</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.919" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">obeying allah and only doing things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">allah wishes and so on</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">gives you a purpose and a structure and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">we humans need structure however ghastly</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">the structure i mean it horrifies me</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">i consider them major religions to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">really pernicious memeplexes if you look</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">at the history of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">any of them you find you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">bush of of different sects and so on</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">and you ask the memetic question the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">question coming from a meme&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">perspective memes are revolving and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">competing to use our brains to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">copied</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">coming from that perspective why has</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">islam ended up this way</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">most of it with the you know the sheer</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">and the sunnis and the different bits</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">and christianity and these multiple</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">versions but loads more died out</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:47.360" style="s2">perspective well the ones that stay</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">one of the big reasons is basic biology</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.360" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">um the the basic thing about sperm and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">eggs</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">um the best biological strategy for</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">women is to protect</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">their um that the few children they can</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">have choose the best mate they can and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">and look look after them best they can</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">uh the best strategy for men is to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">everything in sight and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">matter because you don&#39;t have as many</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">children and let the women look after</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">and what do we find in these religions</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">what we find</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">is women trap them from sorry from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">man&#39;s point of view</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">yeah but but if you&#39;re going to if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re a man you&#39;re going to put any</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:23.039" style="s2">investment into a woman and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">those children then you&#39;ve got to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.039" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">sure that they&#39;re your children and not</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:31.919" style="s2">hence veils and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">body coverings and all the admonitions</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.919" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">against sex and all of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">those kind of things it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">basic biology</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">meaning that these memes thrive better</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">than nicer memes as from a woman&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:47.039" style="s2">of view</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">um so we have all these religions around</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.039" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">i take buddhism which i i mean although</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve been training in zen for</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">40 years nearly um i&#39;m not a buddhist i</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">don&#39;t want to sign up to any beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t would i um but the training</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">but a fascinating phenomenon that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">think has happened in buddhism and i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">like to explore more is</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">what the buddha said mostly is about</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">the self is an illusion everything is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">ephemeral</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">and ever-changing um</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">that&#39;s well it is impermanent it has all</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">the marks</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">of existence um impermanent suffering um</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">it can lead to nihilism and that is one</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:43.919" style="s2">of the problems i mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">that you mentioned nihilism it can lead</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.919" end="00:25:46.799" style="s2">you to oh i don&#39;t exist what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">of anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.799" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">or it can lead you to deep insight into</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">business and how it is and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">behave and watch thoughts come and go</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">and self come and go and so on but</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">is is it is a harping back to all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">of reincarnation which were around in</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">some of the countries where buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">went in the early time</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">because reincarnation gives you that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">purpose if you&#39;re really good in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">life and you do lots of meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">so on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">ah you will get to a higher bit you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:21.360" style="s2">be next next life will be as a higher</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.360" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">and if you&#39;re really bad and wicked</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">you&#39;ll come back as i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">whatever i&#39;m low in the low hells</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">and then all these hells and things</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">which don&#39;t to me make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">so i like zen because it&#39;s more free of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">those things than other</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">kinds of um of buddhism so we see the</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">that then cause them to take on</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">absolutely untrue rubbish ideas like</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">interesting because this is kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2">um when when talking about consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">as well in that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">um you say the questions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">asking are the wrong questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">um like we can&#39;t find consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not that&#39;s fine and i feel like</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of talk about realizing</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">meaning whether that means um</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">people think the meanings out there in</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">the world in in a religion or in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">transcendent deity or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">and that they&#39;re going to realize it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">find out it&#39;s true or realizing it as in</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:32.080" style="s2">making it real like kind of an</p>

<p begin="00:27:32.080" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">um and what i what i got from what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">were saying or what i feel like was</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">underneath what you were saying is</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:42.799" style="s2">perhaps the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">to live with the reality that there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.799" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">no meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">and find a way to be in that instead of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">searching for it or trying to invent it</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">yes i think that&#39;s right i think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">can&#39;t think of the right adjective way</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">fill in blank space um is to accept that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">all meanings and purposes</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">are created by us and by our culture and</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">to go with those meanings and those</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">purposes without thinking that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great i got some i got some</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">self-help advice as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">some of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">so i suppose it&#39;s time for me to stop</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">um if people have put questions in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">chat</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">but i they haven&#39;t put whether they</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.919" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">would like to speak or whether they</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">would like me to speak on their behalf</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">so um that would that would be useful if</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">you could just say</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">um this is a question i&#39;d like to ask or</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a question that i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">ask on your behalf</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:00.399" style="s2">they don&#39;t indicate anything that means</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">they&#39;ll uh happy to ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">themselves oh okay cool well in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">uh can we um call on tom tom beakbain</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">uh if you&#39;re ready to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">that&#39;d be great</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">oh hi susan i&#39;m tom bigbang from toronto</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">uh since you wrote the meme machine um</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">do you think there&#39;s been progress</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">unifying uh different viewpoints you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">the materialistic viewpoint and and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">mystical viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">uh are you becoming less skeptical or</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">um more skeptical about um</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">science&#39;s ability to sort of explain</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">the the soft side of life if you like oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">i&#39;m endlessly optimistic about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">ability of science because science is</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:50.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not a fixed thing that you can pin</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">down it&#39;s more of an attitude and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.159" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:56.559" style="s2">so whatever problem or question there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">we may not be able to do the science on</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.559" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">it right now but in principle</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">i this is a dodgy one isn&#39;t it but in</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">principle i don&#39;t see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">anything that science can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">uh get a handle on i&#39;m not sure why</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">why you relate this to the me machine</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">because i thought maybe you were going</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">in the direction of has there been any</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:16.880" style="s2">progress in mimetics</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">which has been extremely little and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.880" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">lots of interesting reasons</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">possible reasons why um but</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">think that science</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">can&#39;t have a go at it just that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t found the right way</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">i i could draw an analogy it&#39;s only an</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">analogy</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">with with darwin and and um</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">the recognition of evolution by natural</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">selection</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">that just hung on in there i mean people</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">at the time</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">saw some of the potential were horrified</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">a lot of them were horrified</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">um some thought it was wonderful but in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">the absence of the science to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">discover genetics um it couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">very far without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">without knowing how the copy you need</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">for an evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">copying varying and selecting you need</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:05.919" style="s2">those three to make up the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.919" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">and although darwin could see that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">didn&#39;t know about the term algorithm but</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what he was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">if you keep doing that again and again</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">and again you must get</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">evolution but without knowing how the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">copying was done</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">um you know how the selection was done</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">natural selection because things die if</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough food and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.640" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">predators and there&#39;s not enough water</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">and air you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">naturally natural selection does the job</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">but he couldn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">uh the the nature of the copying of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">information down the generations</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">or the where the variation came from</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">and without that couldn&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">anywhere until the early 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">when it became scientifically available</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">through the kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">biology chemistry and so on that we had</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s the same with mimetics</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">um we we&#39;re floundering around i i still</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">think i mean i read i read the mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">machine again recently because it&#39;s 20</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">years and i thought oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">god what did i write um</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.000" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">and i think i would still agree with</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">most of it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">the basic argument but i think we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">in a position at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">to um to write to ask a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">questions that give us a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">handle on it</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">but i think we might be getting there i</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:22.960" style="s2">hope so and i certainly don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:26.840" style="s2">there&#39;s any reason why we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">does that answer your question yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.840" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">good great um peter would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:34.559" style="s2">ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">yeah um so you mentioned this on your uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.559" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">last question um so i was curious what</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">your sense of how the field of medics</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">has progressed and you said very little</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">so maybe why is that the case you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">and then the other part of the question</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">is what is the best criticism</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:50.399" style="s2">of the concept or the field you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">heard or any criticism that given you</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">pause</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">i i think there are lots of reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">i think basically it hasn&#39;t got anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">what what has happened</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">since in in those 20 years i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">the meme idea goes back to 1976 with</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">selfish gene um but if you start from</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">the mean machine</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.080" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">um basically most scientists think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:14.320" style="s2">idea is rubbish</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">remember that 20 years ago there was no</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.320" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">such thing as an internet meme</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">so most people now only know the term</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">meme</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:22.880" style="s2">through the existence of internet memes</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">which made richard pretty</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.880" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">pissed off to begin with and me in a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">but i&#39;m more than he argued that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">actually they&#39;re a very good example</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">if you if you know what an internet meme</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">is then you can easily grasp the idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">memes are information that&#39;s copied</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">buried and selected and there&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">selection pressure to the very few</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">beautiful pussycats that get on you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">get millions of views and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">not so attractive pussycats that or</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">worse jokes that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">so i think they&#39;re not a bad example so</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:52.960" style="s2">that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">very good in the sense that the term</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.960" end="00:33:59.679" style="s2">meme has come to be much better known</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">um but what has happened simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">is a real flourishing of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">evolution theory</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">and and and empirical research</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">so i have been to some conferences um</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:12.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">met with people who are studying for</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">in inuit by inuits and the way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">passed on</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">and the selection is when they sink you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">know um</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">use that as a very sort of simple idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">of memes</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">meme selection um but they they study uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">apprenticeships and and groups of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:34.560" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:36.000" style="s2">different societies it&#39;s a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:38.560" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.000" end="00:34:40.079" style="s2">and the basic difference i would say</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">between and it&#39;s very successful is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">lot of work going on</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">really discovering a lot about human</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">behavior in many different cultures</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">um now the real difference between that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">and mimetics is absolutely fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">in the end those people</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">go back to genetic advantage as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">driving force</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">so the reason why the cultures evolved</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:08.160" style="s2">the way they do and the behaviors it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.119" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">evolved the way they did is because</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.160" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">of the way the genes have made us</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">and that it ultimately benefits the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:17.440" style="s2">genes this goes back to um you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">wilson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.440" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">the uh famous uh saying that um</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">the genes will always keep culture on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">leash</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">now there are many of these people will</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:29.440" style="s2">say well obviously the leash is getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">longer and longer</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.440" end="00:35:33.680" style="s2">we live now everything changes so fast</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">the genes haven&#39;t got time to kill off</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">those of us who believe the wrong idea i</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all happening too fast but</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">the memetic idea of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">is is quite different it is that memes</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">are a second replicator</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">this planet has genes first memes second</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">a new way of copying information</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">using brains not using dna and chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">um and that just as genes are selfish</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">so memes are selfish and that culture is</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">evolving</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">for the benefit of the memes now why</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">hasn&#39;t this gone anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">well i would just like to mention one</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:09.680" style="s2">recent study which is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.680" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">um a study of um the witch trials</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">and you know burning which is at stake</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:21.280" style="s2">and all those horrible things</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:21.280" style="s2">um a study which showed um</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:25.760" style="s2">that this is not really science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">more um history but</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.760" end="00:36:32.320" style="s2">it showed that if if the um</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">if you analyze um</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.320" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">the effects of these witch trials were</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">they of benefit to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2">people who were burnt no were they of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">benefit to people doing the burning</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">no i mean there&#39;s a deep analysis in</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:47.680" style="s2">this paper</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">um uh is it a benefit to the society a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.680" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">whole as whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">which it happened is it of benefit to</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">any small groups within that society</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">and all the answers came back to be no</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">and that i think is an example of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">way we need to go in mimetics</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.960" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">to find something where we can show that</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">it benefited those memes</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">without benefiting us the mean machines</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">i&#39;d love it to go if you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:13.119" style="s2">more about</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">why it doesn&#39;t partly i&#39;ve i&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.119" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">to find ways to do that but i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:18.320" style="s2">we&#39;re beginning to do it and i&#39;m sure we</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.320" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">but people also just don&#39;t get the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">i think the main reason</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:26.079" style="s2">is people don&#39;t get it and they partly</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">don&#39;t get it because they don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.079" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">um but they partly don&#39;t get it because</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:32.880" style="s2">the same problem that darwin had it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">they say</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">oh do you know my mp is a creationist</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">um but sorry this is kind i can you</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">believe it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">21st century my employees anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">yeah here in south devon yes he</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">represents me</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">in parliament he&#39;s very nice and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">charming and always answers my</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">objection emails i write him but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">now where was i um so</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">i was thinking i&#39;m thinking of the amer</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">americans more than</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:08.079" style="s2">in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">the reason i think the fundamental</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">is the way we naturally think is that</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">buses here had to have a designer uh</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">had to have a designer and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:30.800" style="s2">of true</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">in a sense there were humans involved in</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.800" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">this and they had the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">ideas and then you know so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">design without a designer is</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.480" end="00:38:39.280" style="s2">counterintuitive and that was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">dawkins was on about and what den it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">on about but it&#39;s counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">and i think that is one reason why</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">people don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">mimetics and another reason is they</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">don&#39;t like applying evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">at all so sociologists and so on don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">um the the sort of biological</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">implications of evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:01.520" style="s2">coming in</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">the biologists don&#39;t like people like me</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.520" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">because well i don&#39;t know anyway they</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">don&#39;t like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">of of um evolutionary theory being kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">of subverted to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.000" end="00:39:11.839" style="s2">medics when that&#39;s kind of weird and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">that&#39;s their realm and shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.839" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">taken away</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.720" style="s2">many many reasons why it&#39;s difficult i</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">think mimetics will only thrive</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">when and if it proves possible to carry</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">on that kind of idea of experiments in</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">which you find out</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">is this to the benefit of the genes is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">it to benefit of the humans is it to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">groups or is it actually just only to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">the benefit of the means</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">that would make mimetics different from</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">standard cultural evolution theory</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">and very very much worth doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">wow good question um we&#39;ve got another</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:42.880" style="s2">one from someone with a very appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.880" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">handle uh would mimetic caper like to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">ask that question</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">or would you like me to ask it for you i</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.960" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">can ask it great</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">hi susan so um here&#39;s my question a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">cartesian dualism</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">destroys purpose by making the objective</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:02.720" style="s2">world void of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:06.240" style="s2">and the subjective world undefinable</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.720" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">but if purpose or desire is memetic</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">is there a way to bridge the cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:10.480" style="s2">gap through the scientific study of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:12.880" style="s2">memes</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.480" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">as a means of re-emerging the world in</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.880" end="00:40:16.079" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have to repeat that</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">slowly because i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">i didn&#39;t understand the first bit so</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">just say that again</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">so the first bit i&#39;m making the claim</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:30.079" style="s2">that uh cartesian dualism</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">um voids</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.079" end="00:40:33.599" style="s2">uh people&#39;s world view of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:36.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.599" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">um the objective world is just clockwork</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just happening automatically</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:41.920" style="s2">uh purpose to it it&#39;s just it&#39;s random</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">uh i i&#39;m with you in the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">world we can&#39;t say anything about</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s not observable</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting i mean i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">understand it because i i</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">don&#39;t agree at all but i now you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">it again i can see what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">but i really don&#39;t see why cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">dualism should do that because</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">i mean after all cartesian dualism gives</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">we humans</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">and not the rest of the living world a</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">soul or a spirit</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">which answers to god and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">there&#39;s huge purpose i mean the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">of a true cartesian dualist as in</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">they cuts time certainly but probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">still to some extent to this day and</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s i think why it&#39;s so popular i</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">basically some form of dualism is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">natural way we think</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:28.319" style="s2">we know from developmental psychology</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">that kids from a very young age</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.319" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">uh and i&#39;ve got two little</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">granddaughters aged two and five and i</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">can see these things emerging</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:38.480" style="s2">as the sense of self emerges um so</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">comes the sense of and and also the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.480" end="00:41:42.000" style="s2">discrimination between</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">living and non-living things self-moving</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.000" end="00:41:45.760" style="s2">and things that have to be pushed</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">these things all lay the ground for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.760" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">kind of dualism in which there are minds</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:52.079" style="s2">do things and design things and have</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">ideas and there are physical things out</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">there that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">we manipulate it&#39;s the world that given</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">to us um to manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">and so i think so to my mind that kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">of dualism</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">gives people um basic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">and purpose in life their purpose is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">be a good soul and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">and to exploit the world the best they</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">um rather than taking it away i can</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">imagine from what you&#39;ve said that for</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">some people it would take away meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">and purpose but i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">for the majority it doesn&#39;t so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">the second part of your question</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">well i i guess i could have said uh you</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.520" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">could replace</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">cartesian dualism in my question with</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">scientific materialism because</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">yeah i know it&#39;s just so much yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:35.040" style="s2">absolutely straight on there that will</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:36.720" style="s2">take you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.040" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">in a certain interpretation that will</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">take you straight into it yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">yeah so go on yeah so the second part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">is that uh if purpose or desire or</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:50.160" style="s2">whatever you want to call it a if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">memetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">is there a way to bridge the cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">gap</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:58.319" style="s2">through the scientific study of means as</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">a way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.319" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">re-emerging the world in meaning like</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">can um</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">because there&#39;s purpose in the memes</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">i guess is what i&#39;m saying um</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">studying the meme scientifically it</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">brings purpose back to the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">i am not at all sure about that because</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">there&#39;s so little</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:21.760" style="s2">of real scientific study of memes but i</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.800" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">to to think about your suggestion that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:28.240" style="s2">that purpose and meaning in life are</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.240" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">so the specific purposes that we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">i get up in the morning and get to my</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">desk and there&#39;s that bloody email</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">completion i can&#39;t bear it and i have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">spend however much time it is um trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">to deal with it and that&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">purpose that&#39;s a nomadic purpose</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:47.040" style="s2">because that&#39;s all memes all that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:50.319" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.040" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">being sent to me um</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.319" end="00:43:53.760" style="s2">i can have other purposes for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">like to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.760" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">as mindful as my training</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">allows me to be and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">living from just going along responding</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">thoughtlessly to to everything and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s a meme that i have been</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">taught</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">um over the decades how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">um in zen terms sit down shut up and see</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">what the mind does</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">um so those are memes but fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">we go back to genes and this is so often</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">the case there are pure memetic things</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">we can do</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">people studying stuff on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.880" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">there&#39;s lots and lots of that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">lots of fantastic studies</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">of um of mimetics um in the digital</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:35.599" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:37.359" style="s2">which i think is a somewhat different</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.599" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">issue but when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.359" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">memes um shared with humans</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">the need for purpose the need for</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">meaning is a biological</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">drive i would say we</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t we wouldn&#39;t be here as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">species if we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:56.240" style="s2">genes that inclined us to seek out</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">purposes</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.240" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">and and follow them up and they start</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:03.839" style="s2">obviously with getting food</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">getting mates having fun um learning</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.839" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">stuff that might be useful to us i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">that genetic endowment has given us the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">from which all of these this yearning</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:15.760" style="s2">for purpose and meaning comes</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">the memes just come in and give answers</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.760" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">to some extent so i would never say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">purpose of meaning is purely memetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">would i never say that well i don&#39;t at</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">the moment anyway</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">so i just want to add on the one last</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:29.839" style="s2">part of my question that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a separate question are you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">familiar with rene gerard</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.040" end="00:45:37.280" style="s2">no i&#39;m afraid not so i&#39;m gonna strongly</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">recommend</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">that um you do at least some</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">investigation into this guy because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">he&#39;s a i guess he&#39;s a literary uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">theorist</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">anthropologist i&#39;m not maybe a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">both um but his full</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">theory is based on uh imitated desire</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:59.200" style="s2">um and he actually calls it</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">the neck desire but it&#39;s like the latin</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">word pneumatic it&#39;s basically the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">um and you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">mimetic are not the same but anyway go</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">oh okay well um</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">yeah he probably exaggerates the degree</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">to which</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">all purpose is imitated or</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">all desire like he he um i definitely</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">think there&#39;s something to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:29.119" style="s2">biological</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:31.040" style="s2">uh causation of desire right but</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.119" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">um gerard doesn&#39;t focus on that because</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.040" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">he&#39;s it&#39;s not really in</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">his uh domain but he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">interesting theorist</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">um i&#39;ve written down the name yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.079" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">yeah i i second that recommendation for</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">rene gerard i&#39;ve read a lot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">interesting especially as an atheist to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">read him because i believe he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">christian and it comes from that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">but uh yeah it&#39;s definitely worth a read</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">maybe evan could go next if you&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">will i just say something about that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">think that&#39;s not incompatible with what</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">i was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">you start with a biological um</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:09.359" style="s2">wanting desires and um of wanting um</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">yeah desires and purpose and and all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.359" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">that and the memes build on that</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t be doing what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.079" style="s2">doing if it weren&#39;t for that biological</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.319" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">underpinning but studying the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">they&#39;re then</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:22.839" style="s2">um imitated and copied is</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">i guess i will have a look and read this</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.839" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:29.200" style="s2">um evan if you want to step forward sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">so to speak</p>

<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">um like has presented a being no one for</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.079" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">example i was curious just if you had</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:47.920" style="s2">any commentary on that or because to me</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">that seems like an extremely satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.920" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">theory his whole phenomenal self-model</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:54.319" style="s2">theory about the nature of cells and how</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">you know a sort of materialist</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.319" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">compatible theory for how cells get</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">constructed i was wondering if you had</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">any thoughts or comments on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">before i try and answer that let me tell</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been friends ever since i</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">don&#39;t see him very often but</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:12.800" style="s2">he&#39;s in germany and i&#39;m here um but</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve known him very well so i was very</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.800" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">very interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">that book about self it&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">to answer your question properly i would</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:25.599" style="s2">need to read it again</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:27.520" style="s2">um i think the uh the the whole self</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.599" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">model thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">it&#39;s going back that long even in 1986 i</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">gave a conference paper</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">in which i said that um</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing it&#39;s like to be a human</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:41.760" style="s2">being the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">there&#39;s only something it&#39;s like to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.760" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">the model the representation</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:49.119" style="s2">and in a way that&#39;s what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">but his way of saying it is slightly</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.119" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">different from mine but</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">the reason that i stopped doing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">after 1986 is because i</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:58.240" style="s2">simply couldn&#39;t get a handle on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">meant by a model or a representation</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.240" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">and i looked into the philosophy a</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">little bit again no internet</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">um you know have to go to the university</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">library and go to philosophy books and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">fight you know it&#39;s really really hard</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">to find things out in those days</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">um and um</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">i gave up on it because i really</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">couldn&#39;t at all</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">make a theory out of what&#39;s meant by</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">model now i&#39;m not saying that his theory</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:26.480" style="s2">falls because of that same problem but</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">it&#39;s still lurking there this</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.480" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">self model and its um implications for</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:34.880" style="s2">what exactly is the model do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.880" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">inside the brain what the model is doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">this also relates to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">meditation practice like myself thomas</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">is a long-term lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">and we have shared many discussions</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">about that as well</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">i i&#39;m very much in tune with with</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">thomas&#39;s views</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">but i wouldn&#39;t go oh he&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">right because i don&#39;t think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:04.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to the bottom of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">to be a phenomenal self-model</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.960" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">and i think we may do so and that will</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">throw much more</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">light on both his views and mine and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">doughnuts and various other people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:15.599" style="s2">talk about these models</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a little connection here with</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.599" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">the outer body experience stuff because</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">i did a book a couple of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">called seeing myself in which i really</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">pulled together</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">what happened to me in that original</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.839" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">experience all that time ago</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">which led me to think i was going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:29.680" style="s2">prove the existence of you know all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.680" end="00:51:36.480" style="s2">um which is that we now know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">the the temporary parietal junction</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">here is a kind of hub</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">for controlling their body schema which</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">is a model or representation of the body</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">that you need all the time to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:51.520" style="s2">move and speak and everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">else and that autobody experiences</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.520" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">happen when that&#39;s disturbed</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">that that model of self is then</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">connected up in different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:00.160" style="s2">brain with a self-image who am i what am</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">i like what do people think of me what</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.160" end="00:52:02.960" style="s2">do i think of myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.400" style="s2">and to the control areas and frontal</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">cortex and so on</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.400" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">um now knowing that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:11.200" style="s2">um maybe we can the body schemer is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:14.079" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.200" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">easy philosophically i guess easy idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.079" end="00:52:17.839" style="s2">of a model it literally represents the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">position of the body in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.839" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">three-dimensional space</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">but a model a phenomenal self-model is</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">something slight somewhat more than that</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">and i would love to know the connections</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:34.079" style="s2">so yes uh i&#39;m absolutely um</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">i love thomas&#39;s ideas but there&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.079" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">think there&#39;s a long way to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.680" end="00:52:42.559" style="s2">great these are all such great questions</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:44.640" style="s2">i&#39;m glad i passed it over to the chat</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.559" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">um so maybe we can squeeze in just one</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.640" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">more uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve um adam has got a popular question</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:52.559" style="s2">that people seem to want him to step</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:54.559" style="s2">forward and ask if you&#39;d like to come</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.559" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">forward adam hi</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.559" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">um i was just wondering about the moral</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">status of the conf</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:01.359" style="s2">potential conflict between genes and</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">memes</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:04.559" style="s2">because like if you have both</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">replicators going it you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.559" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">i could almost imagine a future in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">memoirs where some humans are fighting</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.000" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">on behalf of the memes</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">other humans that want the genes to</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:15.280" style="s2">control what happens i mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">it just it makes me wonder if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.280" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">stuck as atheists in a kind of morally</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:20.960" style="s2">neutral landscape there of like well</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">there&#39;s genes and memes and like those</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.960" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">both seem like meaningful processes but</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:27.520" style="s2">is there is it just sort of a a watch</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">like are they just</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.520" end="00:53:31.839" style="s2">you know two political parties or you</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">know oh that&#39;s so depressing why do we</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.839" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">have to have such a depressing question</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">because where you&#39;re taking excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">where you&#39;re taking me of course is is</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">what you&#39;re hinting at there</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:44.559" style="s2">you kind of you you ask the question as</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">though will it end up like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.559" end="00:53:48.319" style="s2">there already</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">people defend the memes they have and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.319" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">would love to understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">more why that is i mean you can glibly</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">say well cognitive dissonance once</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve believed something</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t want the dissonance of then</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:53:59.359" style="s2">discovering it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">and of course we&#39;re back to what it</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.359" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">means to be a scientist or a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">philosopher who&#39;s changes your mind when</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">the evidence makes you change it and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">but religions going back to them and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">were talking about atheism</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.839" end="00:54:20.160" style="s2">our prime example of uh me of memplexes</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">that cause their bearers to pass them on</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.160" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">and therefore all those american</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:25.200" style="s2">christians well and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">all those all the muslims around the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.200" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">world not all</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">lots of them the ones who are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:33.440" style="s2">infected with it</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">um they are willing to spend a huge</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.440" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">proportion of their</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">time and energy um and brain power</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">to force those ideas on other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">why why and we&#39;re back then to my</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">question about</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">which religions or which religious um</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:55.599" style="s2">uh versions have thrived</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">take spread the good news of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">now biologically we are a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:03.599" style="s2">social species we use reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">altruism</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.599" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">um you know i do something for you you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:08.000" style="s2">pay me back we keep tracks on who&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:09.760" style="s2">and who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:11.280" style="s2">so from that point of view we all want</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.760" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2">to be good or at least we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.280" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">perceived</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.000" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">to be good and i call this the goodness</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">trick or the altruism trick</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">so these religions play a trick it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s evolved through other religions</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:24.640" style="s2">dying out the ones</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">to some extent the ones left certainly</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.640" end="00:55:28.559" style="s2">in those major religions</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">are the ones that that tell you you are</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.559" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">a good person if you pass on these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:35.599" style="s2">so um in islam there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:37.359" style="s2">conflict because in some places in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.599" end="00:55:38.640" style="s2">quran it says you must never force it on</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.359" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">anyone but then in other places it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.640" end="00:55:41.280" style="s2">telling you how important it is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">everybody else joins you and otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.280" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">you&#39;re going to kill them</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:46.240" style="s2">or or um various other horrible</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">punishments for them</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.240" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">um so that&#39;s a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:55.359" style="s2">how um people come</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">to want to promote their ideas i mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.359" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">two examples a simple one just the kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">of cognitive dissonance i&#39;ve had this</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:01.920" style="s2">great idea so i want other people to</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:02.799" style="s2">agree with me because then i look clever</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.920" end="00:56:05.200" style="s2">and good</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.799" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">um so i&#39;m good in that way or the kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.200" end="00:56:08.079" style="s2">of moral one which i think you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:11.359" style="s2">getting at more</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.079" end="00:56:13.520" style="s2">that that religions give you um</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">a rule about what counts as moral and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.520" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">what counts as not moral so i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">all of you whichever of you out there</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:22.640" style="s2">are atheists will have thought about</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">this because</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.640" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">constantly we&#39;re being told um that</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">the people many religious people</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:32.319" style="s2">feel that you can&#39;t have more you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">have good morals</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">without believing in god because they</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:37.839" style="s2">all come from god and this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.760" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">very pernicious but it&#39;s part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.839" end="00:56:41.359" style="s2">those religions have succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.520" style="s2">is to persuade the believers that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.359" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">how it is that they wouldn&#39;t be good</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.520" end="00:56:47.520" style="s2">if they didn&#39;t follow these rules and</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">then the rules of course were back again</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.520" end="00:56:51.200" style="s2">and something else you said reminded me</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">we&#39;re back again into that biological</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.200" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2">thing the big sex difference thing which</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">obviously particularly up some to me as</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">female is</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">is is um it&#39;s very often the women</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the women who actually carry out</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:09.200" style="s2">the fgm it&#39;s women who persuade other</p>

<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">the woman who&#39;s just died and we might</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">get an anti-abortion</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:25.359" style="s2">um lawyer chosen by trump</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">the these are examples it really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:27.520" style="s2">definitely a really horrible example to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.520" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">women will will um</p>

<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">the moment the answer is there those</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.599" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">religions have</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">evolved in ways that keep those things</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:07.200" style="s2">um going</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">for biological reasons and i i</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.200" end="00:58:11.599" style="s2">in my more optimistic moments i see we</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">are moving away from that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.599" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">in the uk now more than half people</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">say they have no religion um that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:22.160" style="s2">mean they&#39;re all atheists but they have</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">no religious affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.160" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">um and and and then i&#39;m very optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">and then i watch what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">in the islamic world and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">happening in the united states of</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:35.040" style="s2">and i sometimes despair i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:36.559" style="s2">end up and i&#39;m a horrible miserable like</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.040" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t anyone say anything more cheerful</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.559" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">get me out of that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:43.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:46.240" style="s2">cheerful um thought</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.599" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">but um i thought it might make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.240" end="00:58:49.839" style="s2">end with a quick</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">a quick note on teams which we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.839" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">touched on at all</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">yet and like the future of me the third</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">replicator what are we to expect</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:58:59.280" style="s2">but maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s more depressing</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">stuff i don&#39;t know no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.280" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">depressing it well it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:02.720" style="s2">frightening but that&#39;s different from</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">depressing</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">uh i guess i have to be fairly brief um</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">we did touch on it in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">when talking about um internet memes</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">um i some years ago now</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">i i started wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">all the memes that come because more and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">more in my life going from</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">as i&#39;ve described you know within</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.839" end="00:59:27.920" style="s2">writing letters to to</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">to email and and podcasts and all of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.920" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:32.559" style="s2">um is this just more memes or is there</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">something fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.559" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">oh it must be six o&#39;clock look what is</p>

<p begin="01:00:09.200" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">just more memes than they&#39;re just kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">of in the computer rather than in our</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">heads or is it something fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">and the more i thought about it the more</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">i thought it&#39;s something fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.839" end="01:00:20.160" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">and in the years since i first had this</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.160" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">idea this is in my</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:25.520" style="s2">2008 ted lecture and a chapter that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">started it all off</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.520" end="01:00:31.040" style="s2">for a book um i decided that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.040" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll explain why i&#39;ll try to be do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:37.359" style="s2">briefly but</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2">i thought well how did the second</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.359" end="01:00:40.640" style="s2">replicator</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">appear in the first place what happened</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.640" end="01:00:43.680" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.200" end="01:00:44.480" style="s2">the phenotypes constructed by the genes</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.680" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">in other words</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.480" end="01:00:51.040" style="s2">animals plants and human bodies um</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">began to copy information in a new way</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.040" end="01:00:54.559" style="s2">so there was the only evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">process was chemical copying of dna and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.559" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">rna and so on but then</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:00:59.760" style="s2">came copying of behaviors and making</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:01.119" style="s2">noises and</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.760" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">the beginnings of language and all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.119" end="01:01:06.079" style="s2">that so that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.520" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">the physical thing that was created by</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.079" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">the genes</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">now gave rise to a new kind of copying</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:11.920" style="s2">so then my question was well could that</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">happen again</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.920" end="01:01:16.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very close analogy here</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.799" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">always be careful of analogies</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.640" end="01:01:23.040" style="s2">um it&#39;s a close analogy here to say that</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.920" end="01:01:23.839" style="s2">we humans with our memes constructed</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.040" end="01:01:25.680" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.839" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">and phones and servers and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.680" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">for our own benefit so we thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:34.720" style="s2">but those machines started doing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:39.440" style="s2">copying varying selecting</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.720" end="01:01:41.920" style="s2">on their own without us and i decided</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.440" end="01:01:43.599" style="s2">i mean not exactly arbitrarily but i</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.920" end="01:01:45.119" style="s2">mean i felt i was alone</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.599" end="01:01:46.799" style="s2">struggling with these ideas so it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.119" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">to me to make a decision</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.799" end="01:01:52.799" style="s2">and i decided that if we could show</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:54.160" style="s2">that in the cloud which probably didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">exist then i don&#39;t know but in</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.160" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">cyberspace</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:02:00.000" style="s2">the machinery that we constructed is</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">doing those three processes</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.000" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">without our interference then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:06.240" style="s2">new replicator a third replicator</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.559" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">i first called it teams and then people</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.240" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">started thinking i was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">football and which i absolutely wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">so i changed it to dreams i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">actually should have been threams</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">to be third replicator but try dreams i</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:20.559" style="s2">i hoped i wrote an article in new</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:22.160" style="s2">scientist asking people to suggest names</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.559" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">and i got 23 different</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.160" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">words and none of them hardly any</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:29.520" style="s2">duplications at all and so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:31.680" style="s2">so at the moment it&#39;s dreams um</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.520" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">and and why you&#39;re saying that this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:35.039" style="s2">depressing but it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">a bit scary rather than depressing i</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:39.039" style="s2">think it&#39;s rather exciting but important</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">if i&#39;m right about this and it is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.039" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">third replicator</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:44.880" style="s2">then it&#39;s a selfish replicator all that</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:46.640" style="s2">digital information all those bloody</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.880" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">things that come in and shout at you</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.640" end="01:02:50.079" style="s2">you know and all those adverts saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">buy another one of those</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.079" end="01:02:54.319" style="s2">you know shirt you bought last week and</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.119" end="01:02:58.079" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.319" end="01:02:58.400" style="s2">um these are evolving and proliferating</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.079" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.400" end="01:03:03.280" style="s2">for their own sake selfishly and out</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">there if you think of things like</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.280" end="01:03:06.559" style="s2">search engines they are combining their</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.559" end="01:03:09.599" style="s2">copying varying and selecting</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">information and sending it out they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.599" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">going around there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">crawlers going around collecting up</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.000" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">stuff there&#39;s a massive amount now</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:17.839" style="s2">which there wasn&#39;t then of what i would</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">call dreams</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.839" end="01:03:24.799" style="s2">the um the machinery doing itself</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:26.240" style="s2">this becomes a an argument about</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.799" end="01:03:27.920" style="s2">the difference between artificial</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.240" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">intelligence that is distributed</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.920" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">and out there and self-evolving and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:33.119" style="s2">kind of artificial intelligence that</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">most people seem to be scared of</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:36.880" style="s2">which is something that we have created</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">and put into a relatively limited thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.880" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">like a robot or a computer or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.960" style="s2">and you could turn it off</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.839" end="01:03:44.960" style="s2">potentially you know you can&#39;t turn off</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.960" end="01:03:46.480" style="s2">evolved entities if there are evolved</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">entities i mean my guess looking at</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.480" end="01:03:50.240" style="s2">biological processes</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:51.440" style="s2">evolutionary processes is that out there</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.240" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">in the cloud</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.440" end="01:03:54.880" style="s2">there will be entities that collect</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:56.319" style="s2">together um</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.880" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">that protect themselves because they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.319" end="01:04:01.119" style="s2">thrive better than bits of</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:03.039" style="s2">dreams that don&#39;t get into groups same</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.119" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">way religions do same way biology</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.039" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">things do and there will be those</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">entities out there competing</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:09.520" style="s2">and they&#39;ll be partly using our brains</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">to you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.520" end="01:04:13.280" style="s2">keep going the machinery they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:14.720" style="s2">using our resources</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.280" end="01:04:17.200" style="s2">this is threatening to the planet</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.720" end="01:04:18.079" style="s2">because if you think about how much</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.200" end="01:04:20.640" style="s2">fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.079" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">are being devoted on this planet to</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.640" end="01:04:23.920" style="s2">creating all this machinery</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s increasing very fast all the time</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.920" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">and just transmitting stuff backwards</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">and forwards</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:29.359" style="s2">you know every email we send has a</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">carbon cost</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.359" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">and and if that is proliferating as</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:35.359" style="s2">evolutionary processes do</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:36.640" style="s2">then we ought to be understanding the</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.359" end="01:04:37.920" style="s2">problems of ai</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.640" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">and what&#39;s happening in the world in</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.920" end="01:04:41.760" style="s2">that way so to me it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:43.359" style="s2">a challenge to people to either show</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.760" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">that i&#39;m wrong about that and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.359" end="01:04:47.359" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:48.400" style="s2">nice idea but wrong okay well just silly</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.359" end="01:04:50.559" style="s2">bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.400" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">or to start looking at whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.559" end="01:04:53.760" style="s2">really happening</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:54.720" style="s2">where it&#39;s happening how it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.760" end="01:04:57.839" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.720" end="01:04:59.599" style="s2">and and try and answer the question in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.839" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">world with three replicators</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.599" end="01:05:05.280" style="s2">what is the role of us human beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s an interesting and difficult</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.280" end="01:05:07.520" style="s2">question i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">rather leave it there than with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.520" end="01:05:11.680" style="s2">difference but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a good one</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:13.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a good one to have raised and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.680" end="01:05:13.599" style="s2">definitely something that i think we</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.039" end="01:05:16.079" style="s2">should all</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.599" end="01:05:18.000" style="s2">yeah give some thought to uh so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.079" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">sorry to keep you into your wine time</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.000" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">um i&#39;m just going to say thank you ever</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:24.799" style="s2">so much for answering and being so</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">um so gracious and paying such close</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.799" end="01:05:27.760" style="s2">attention to what we&#39;re all asking</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re a bit muddled but</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.760" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">you know we&#39;re kind of in awe of you so</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">or at least i&#39;ll speak for myself</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.079" end="01:05:36.079" style="s2">um i&#39;ll pass it back to peter uh he has</p>
