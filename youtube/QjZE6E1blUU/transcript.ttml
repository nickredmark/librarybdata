<p begin="00:02:20.939" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">happen because we are gonna get so much</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.489" end="00:02:28.769" style="s2">more innovation and so much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">creativity and discovery when we give</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">accepting of mistakes that has both</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.370" end="00:03:00.569" style="s2">individually meaning we get to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:02.819" style="s2">mistakes other people get to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.569" end="00:03:08.459" style="s2">mistakes and as a whole together we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:03:14.609" end="00:03:22.190" style="s2">they do do something that is truly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.669" end="00:03:26.310" style="s2">how do we help them make it right</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.190" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">without shame without blame or by</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.310" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">minimizing those because that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:33.780" style="s2">have done so far on this planet and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:37.139" style="s2">has led to disconnection and addiction</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.780" end="00:03:40.440" style="s2">and although most of us have clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.139" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">been okay at fitting in it doesn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.440" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">us a sense of belonging and that sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.220" end="00:03:53.579" style="s2">of belonging empowers us to create all</p>

<p begin="00:03:53.579" end="00:03:58.019" style="s2">is why our first project is gonna be one</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.859" end="00:04:00.150" style="s2">of connection and communication because</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.019" end="00:04:03.810" style="s2">is the foundation of everything that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.150" end="00:04:05.269" style="s2">do creating a space that all you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:08.909" style="s2">do is bring yourself to the table</p>
