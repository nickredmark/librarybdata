<p begin="00:04:32.580" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">portion of the eighth livestream with me</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.750" end="00:04:40.770" style="s2">Brett Weinstein dr. Heather hanging to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.630" style="s2">my right shall we get to the questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.770" end="00:04:45.090" style="s2">let&#39;s get to the questions you guys</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.630" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">wrote a lot in and we are as we</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.090" end="00:04:48.990" style="s2">mentioned in the first livestream going</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">to change our tactics here a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">we&#39;ve simply gone through and ranked</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:57.900" style="s2">them by amount and we&#39;ve got 20 up high</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:04:59.910" style="s2">here that we&#39;re going to try to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.900" end="00:05:01.260" style="s2">through in this first half an hour which</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.910" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">means we&#39;ll miss a lot of your questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.260" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">for which we apologize and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:08.130" style="s2">switch in this in the second half hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:11.220" style="s2">of this Q&amp;A livestream to answering</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.130" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">questions that you write in for this</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.220" end="00:05:16.199" style="s2">second livestream so without further ado</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">is it possible to somehow cultivate a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.199" end="00:05:19.139" style="s2">strain of the virus that arts less</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:21.419" style="s2">damaging that could be used for herd</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.139" end="00:05:23.599" style="s2">immunity can the genetic mutations of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.419" end="00:05:26.180" style="s2">the virus play a role in the symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.599" end="00:05:28.919" style="s2">yeah I mean I would say that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.180" end="00:05:34.500" style="s2">one of the primary strategies of how a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.919" end="00:05:37.710" style="s2">vaccine works so an attenuated virus</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.500" end="00:05:40.409" style="s2">might be used to trigger immunity</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.710" end="00:05:41.880" style="s2">I guess the question differs slightly in</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.409" end="00:05:43.530" style="s2">the sense of something that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.880" end="00:05:45.720" style="s2">transmitted person-to-person and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.530" end="00:05:49.139" style="s2">basically like a contagious vaccine I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.720" end="00:05:51.720" style="s2">would say I don&#39;t know of that being a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.139" end="00:05:53.580" style="s2">strategy that has been employed yet I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.720" end="00:05:56.520" style="s2">could be ignorant to something but my</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.580" end="00:05:58.979" style="s2">guess is is just far too dangerous to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.520" end="00:06:01.620" style="s2">set something loose that can then change</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.979" end="00:06:03.300" style="s2">under evolutionary pressure even</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.620" end="00:06:06.949" style="s2">potentially recombine with the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.300" end="00:06:12.510" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to immunize people from so</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.949" end="00:06:16.529" style="s2">it&#39;s not inconceivable but it would</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.510" end="00:06:18.450" style="s2">require a lot of thinking good next</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.529" end="00:06:22.230" style="s2">question can the ongoing sanitization</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.450" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">result in a super bug yes it could</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.230" end="00:06:25.320" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go the other way on this wine</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:28.410" style="s2">I feel like we may have had this</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.320" end="00:06:31.590" style="s2">question at earlier Q&amp;A yeah I hear this</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.410" end="00:06:34.950" style="s2">one periodically I would say the it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.590" end="00:06:38.870" style="s2">depends what you mean if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.950" end="00:06:43.530" style="s2">about the sanitization with alcohol and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.870" end="00:06:46.920" style="s2">UV light I would say that these things</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.530" end="00:06:49.260" style="s2">do not tend to select for highly</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.920" end="00:06:52.890" style="s2">resistant bugs that would then be</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.260" end="00:06:55.200" style="s2">difficult to challenge and if you did if</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.890" end="00:06:58.140" style="s2">you did have that effect you could drive</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.200" end="00:07:00.900" style="s2">the percentage of alcohol up rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.140" end="00:07:02.280" style="s2">rather easily to address the problem so</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:03.390" style="s2">I don&#39;t you think if you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:05.190" style="s2">happening if you knew there was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.390" end="00:07:08.180" style="s2">problem happening yeah I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.190" end="00:07:10.710" style="s2">that this runs the same risk is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.180" end="00:07:12.420" style="s2">antibacterial soaps presumably many</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.710" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">people especially since for instance</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.420" end="00:07:16.650" style="s2">isopropyl alcohol became unavailable</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:19.200" style="s2">very early in this many people are still</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.650" end="00:07:21.060" style="s2">using these antibacterial soaps which we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.200" end="00:07:24.419" style="s2">know widespread use of has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:26.010" style="s2">correlated with increase in allergies</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.419" end="00:07:27.990" style="s2">and autoimmune disorders and children</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.010" end="00:07:31.880" style="s2">right right which is different than a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.990" end="00:07:35.640" style="s2">super bug so there there is the hygiene</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.880" end="00:07:40.110" style="s2">hypothesis for allergies which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.640" end="00:07:42.360" style="s2">credible but a virus is not a bacterium</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.110" end="00:07:44.970" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have the same vulnerabilities</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.360" end="00:07:46.919" style="s2">and so we will address them differently</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.970" end="00:07:48.780" style="s2">but my basic feeling from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.919" end="00:07:54.120" style="s2">has been actually you&#39;re relatively safe</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.780" end="00:07:55.530" style="s2">with with alcohol as a disinfectant and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.120" end="00:08:00.270" style="s2">it will it&#39;s not going to create a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.530" end="00:08:01.290" style="s2">superbug good next question could you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.270" end="00:08:03.540" style="s2">explain the personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.290" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">vortex more detailed than in your TED</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.540" end="00:08:06.930" style="s2">talk Brett I did not understand the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:08.550" style="s2">similarity between individual and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.930" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">company choices since companies are</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.550" end="00:08:13.169" style="s2">losing income based on their decisions</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:14.910" style="s2">whereas consumers don&#39;t I can&#39;t do a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.169" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">better job than in the TED talk that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.910" end="00:08:20.610" style="s2">a 12 minute talk and we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:23.070" style="s2">kind of time but I will say people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.610" end="00:08:26.010" style="s2">in an analogous position to corporations</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.070" end="00:08:29.760" style="s2">in the sense that if they spend based on</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.010" end="00:08:32.570" style="s2">let&#39;s say say you buy organic shampoo</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.760" end="00:08:36.229" style="s2">which has no</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.570" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">extra value over a cheaper inorganic</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.229" end="00:08:42.979" style="s2">shampoo then you are spending more to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:47.000" style="s2">make the world better and you therefore</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.979" end="00:08:49.130" style="s2">have less resource to for example send</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.000" end="00:08:50.660" style="s2">your kid to a higher quality school well</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.130" end="00:08:52.940" style="s2">there they will network with more</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.660" end="00:08:55.250" style="s2">powerful people and the folks next door</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.940" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">who bought a shampoo that works just as</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.250" end="00:09:00.860" style="s2">well but cost less have extra income to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:02.660" style="s2">spend on their kids their kids go to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.860" end="00:09:04.760" style="s2">better schools they have more influence</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.660" end="00:09:07.250" style="s2">over government the world begins to look</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.760" end="00:09:08.660" style="s2">more like the one they would have us</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.250" end="00:09:11.150" style="s2">live in than the one you would have us</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.660" end="00:09:12.830" style="s2">live in so the organic shampoo turns out</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.150" end="00:09:14.270" style="s2">not to be assuming it doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.830" end="00:09:18.530" style="s2">health benefit which I would assume</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.270" end="00:09:21.070" style="s2">organic shampoos don&#39;t it will the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.530" end="00:09:24.050" style="s2">would look more like your competitors</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.070" end="00:09:25.580" style="s2">dream world and less like yours so</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.050" end="00:09:27.530" style="s2">anyway I&#39;m sure that confused matters</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.580" end="00:09:29.000" style="s2">more than it needed to but maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.530" end="00:09:30.620" style="s2">link to your TED talk as well in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.000" end="00:09:33.650" style="s2">description of this episode fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.620" end="00:09:34.970" style="s2">it&#39;s very clear I think that is a decent</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.650" end="00:09:36.470" style="s2">segue to the next question what does a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.970" end="00:09:38.210" style="s2">normal day of eating look like for you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.470" end="00:09:41.900" style="s2">two well as you now know we don&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.210" end="00:09:43.820" style="s2">organic shampoo right yeah not at all if</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.900" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">we were gonna eat shampoo I would insist</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.820" end="00:09:48.050" style="s2">that it be organic absolutely especially</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:51.830" style="s2">for the children do you want to you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.050" end="00:09:53.930" style="s2">gonna feel this or uh geez I mean let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.830" end="00:09:56.540" style="s2">say you know we live in the Pacific</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.930" end="00:09:59.570" style="s2">Northwest which is surprisingly great</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.540" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">for raw ingredients we now live in</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.570" end="00:10:05.300" style="s2">Portland which is surprisingly great for</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:09.530" style="s2">prepared foods as well we do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.300" end="00:10:10.910" style="s2">cooking at home now I mean now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.530" end="00:10:12.200" style="s2">doing all of our cooking at home right</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.910" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">so we&#39;ve eaten nothing prepared by</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.200" end="00:10:16.730" style="s2">anyone else for over a month at this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:24.500" style="s2">point yep I would say we are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.730" end="00:10:26.390" style="s2">strict about organic produce we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.500" end="00:10:28.280" style="s2">been I mean this this war it&#39;s a much</p>

<p begin="00:10:55.570" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">and veg and a lot of good protein yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:03.940" style="s2">air conditioning does it increase the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:05.830" style="s2">spread of virus because of air</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.940" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">circulation doesn&#39;t mean no centralized</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:11.290" style="s2">work so we actually you know you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.610" end="00:11:12.940" style="s2">know that we were going to go there but</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.290" end="00:11:17.350" style="s2">we we got there at the end of the last</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.940" end="00:11:19.450" style="s2">live stream I have not heard of filters</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.350" end="00:11:21.400" style="s2">being put in place but I feel like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.450" end="00:11:24.210" style="s2">is an obvious place for our need to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.400" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">ramping up and you know viruses are</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.210" end="00:11:28.810" style="s2">viruses range quite a bit in size but</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:30.790" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously quite small compared</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.810" end="00:11:33.700" style="s2">to the kind of stuff that often gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.790" end="00:11:35.230" style="s2">collected in filters so I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.700" end="00:11:38.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the state of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.230" end="00:11:40.630" style="s2">research might be let&#39;s just say there</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.380" end="00:11:42.370" style="s2">are filters that can do it in general I</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.630" end="00:11:46.600" style="s2">mean there&#39;s a rating system I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.370" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">it&#39;s Merv mu r v4 particle size</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.600" end="00:11:52.120" style="s2">filtration anyway look into it there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:56.440" style="s2">also filters that do contain UV</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.120" end="00:12:00.280" style="s2">sanitizers found to be helpful but</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.440" end="00:12:01.780" style="s2">anyway I think the UV sanitizing is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.280" end="00:12:03.850" style="s2">in the filter itself but it&#39;s like in</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.780" end="00:12:06.550" style="s2">the in the larger unit so it requires</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.850" end="00:12:08.710" style="s2">would require a redo of the unit that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.550" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">you&#39;re using actually often it can just</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.710" end="00:12:15.010" style="s2">be inserted at the air handler you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:16.570" style="s2">just basically swap a box in for some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.010" end="00:12:18.850" style="s2">the sheet metal that would be there and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.570" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how well it works but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.850" end="00:12:23.980" style="s2">it has been studied to an extent it</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:26.770" style="s2">would be great to have data on how this</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.980" end="00:12:30.220" style="s2">particular pathogen interacts with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.770" end="00:12:31.750" style="s2">data proved to be useful is there a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.220" end="00:12:33.490" style="s2">possibility that the amount of male and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.750" end="00:12:35.380" style="s2">female sperm a male produces is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.490" end="00:12:37.240" style="s2">dependent on the ratio of men and women</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.380" end="00:12:42.580" style="s2">around them which could explain the male</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.580" end="00:12:50.980" style="s2">versus Y bearing yeah so this is a this</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.510" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">is a a possible mechanism for the</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:58.300" style="s2">in some ways right without it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.300" end="00:13:01.810" style="s2">Traverse was our undergraduate adviser</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.670" end="00:13:17.709" style="s2">likely to produce more males as</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.130" end="00:13:19.180" style="s2">offspring and those who are in poorer</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.709" end="00:13:20.589" style="s2">health or otherwise lower ranking or</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.180" end="00:13:22.830" style="s2">more likely to produce females and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.589" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">sounds like an appalling prediction</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.830" end="00:13:27.640" style="s2">until you think about what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:29.410" style="s2">high-quality males can do in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.640" end="00:13:32.260" style="s2">and just stop thinking about humans at</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.410" end="00:13:34.660" style="s2">all for a moment and imagine a moose</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.260" end="00:13:37.060" style="s2">high quality moose male moose is more</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.660" end="00:13:39.370" style="s2">likely to get matings whereas all female</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.060" end="00:13:41.709" style="s2">moose are likely to be able to go on to</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.370" end="00:13:45.130" style="s2">reproduce so that&#39;s the basic hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.709" end="00:13:48.339" style="s2">trevor&#39;s Willard that that quality of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.130" end="00:13:53.610" style="s2">our screen just went blank Zack quality</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.339" end="00:13:56.230" style="s2">of okay you go Brett basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.610" end="00:13:58.660" style="s2">evolutionarily you don&#39;t want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.230" end="00:14:02.709" style="s2">loser mail because loser males don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.660" end="00:14:04.390" style="s2">tend to reproduce and therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.709" end="00:14:06.430" style="s2">would only want to produce males were</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.390" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">you going to produce a male who was well</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.430" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">positioned to be successful so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:14.110" style="s2">you would expect Tobias I see no reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:16.540" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t have a mechanism like</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.110" end="00:14:20.110" style="s2">the one you described and my Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.540" end="00:14:22.750" style="s2">again being a sperm ratio of male to</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.620" end="00:14:35.220" style="s2">proposed here yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.279" end="00:14:37.240" style="s2">conceivable yeah so to speak nice</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.220" end="00:14:38.790" style="s2">question seven how would you advise a</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.670" end="00:14:55.180" style="s2">question at some level I used to know</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.390" end="00:14:56.640" style="s2">this really great little public liberal</p>

<p begin="00:15:09.420" end="00:15:15.430" style="s2">you will get more attention and more</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.220" end="00:18:27.610" style="s2">have any advice for dyslexics to learn</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.020" end="00:18:29.950" style="s2">communication with normies who all</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.610" end="00:18:31.660" style="s2">seemed autistic I can&#39;t work around the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.950" end="00:18:33.550" style="s2">reading writing issues got a BA and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.660" end="00:18:36.240" style="s2">applied linguistics but all the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.550" end="00:18:39.220" style="s2">effects of dyslexia seem insurmountable</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.240" end="00:18:41.950" style="s2">so what do you think yeah so Brett</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.220" end="00:18:44.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve said on this show before that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.950" end="00:18:48.520" style="s2">are dyslexic although we both object to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.680" end="00:18:50.230" style="s2">the yeah pathologizing of this condition</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.520" end="00:18:53.050" style="s2">but what do you think he&#39;s referring to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.230" end="00:18:54.370" style="s2">as the other effects of dyslexia other</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.050" end="00:18:56.800" style="s2">than reading your writing issues I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.370" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">know I should say I would be dyslexic if</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.800" end="00:19:01.150" style="s2">there was such a thing but it&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">of a garbage category again the problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.150" end="00:19:07.150" style="s2">with the binary yeah you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:11.460" style="s2">know what to tell you the my experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.150" end="00:19:14.500" style="s2">has been I had to do a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.460" end="00:19:17.080" style="s2">some other way and it didn&#39;t always go</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.500" end="00:19:20.770" style="s2">well in fact it went terribly for most</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.080" end="00:19:24.490" style="s2">of my early schooling but I wouldn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.770" end="00:19:26.680" style="s2">back and become non dyslexic if I could</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.490" end="00:19:28.690" style="s2">too many of the things that I think are</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.680" end="00:19:31.710" style="s2">good about the way I think and function</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.690" end="00:19:33.659" style="s2">came from what I learned to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.710" end="00:19:36.149" style="s2">to compensate for the things I didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.659" end="00:19:38.490" style="s2">as well as other people and so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.149" end="00:19:40.440" style="s2">would say the best thing you can do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.490" end="00:19:42.179" style="s2">figure out where you might have an</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.440" end="00:19:46.380" style="s2">advantage and figure out how to play to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.179" end="00:19:49.080" style="s2">it next question relating to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.380" end="00:19:50.549" style="s2">metaphorical truth and cultural memes do</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.080" end="00:19:52.500" style="s2">you two think there was any relation to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.549" end="00:19:54.299" style="s2">the diseases spread by bats and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.500" end="00:20:00.210" style="s2">cultural memes that relate bats to death</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.299" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">and vampires that is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.210" end="00:20:06.809" style="s2">question let us address the vampire if</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:09.750" style="s2">you first sort of it easier bats were</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.809" end="00:20:12.450" style="s2">not helped by the fact that when when</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.750" end="00:20:15.870" style="s2">European science got to the new world</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.450" end="00:20:19.649" style="s2">there were a couple of kind of bats that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.870" end="00:20:21.270" style="s2">did drink blood and they drink blood</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.649" end="00:20:25.100" style="s2">that they lap off the surface of an</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.270" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">animal who they&#39;ve sliced open and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.100" end="00:20:29.880" style="s2">actually it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:34.230" style="s2">many of the fruit bats in the new world</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.880" end="00:20:36.120" style="s2">are miss named Vampira actually vampire</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.230" end="00:20:38.669" style="s2">was not a fruit bat it&#39;s a carnivore but</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.120" end="00:20:39.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not a blood drinking bat same house</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.669" end="00:20:41.850" style="s2">empresa</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.720" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">and protease all there were all of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.850" end="00:20:46.529" style="s2">bats that are named as if they drank</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:48.870" style="s2">blood that don&#39;t that I have always</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.529" end="00:20:50.970" style="s2">taken to be the panic response of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.870" end="00:20:52.350" style="s2">Europeans naming bats that they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.970" end="00:20:59.880" style="s2">quite identify and assuming everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.350" end="00:21:03.240" style="s2">was a vampire but in any case the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.880" end="00:21:05.720" style="s2">connection of bats to vampire stories I</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.240" end="00:21:08.549" style="s2">think the vampire stories predates the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.720" end="00:21:11.610" style="s2">European discovery of bats that drink</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.549" end="00:21:15.120" style="s2">blood and so the label vampire was</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.610" end="00:21:18.899" style="s2">grafted onto the bats and that may have</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.120" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">something to do with it but I also think</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.899" end="00:21:25.399" style="s2">that you know night is spooky because we</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:30.289" style="s2">have diurnal eyes and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.399" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">creatures that fly around at night and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.289" end="00:21:35.730" style="s2">you know appear to be like they are not</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:38.250" style="s2">rodents but appear to be like rodents</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.730" end="00:21:39.870" style="s2">with a special power it all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.250" end="00:21:42.580" style="s2">naturally points in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.870" end="00:21:44.590" style="s2">something mysterious and otherworldly</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.580" end="00:21:45.880" style="s2">even I mean even we have been spooked I</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.590" end="00:21:50.350" style="s2">haven&#39;t been one of our first times in</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.880" end="00:21:51.970" style="s2">Madagascar we walked up to a tree and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.350" end="00:21:54.279" style="s2">think it was before dawn we were waiting</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.970" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">for a taxi Bruce this is terrible mode</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.279" end="00:21:58.149" style="s2">of transit ground transportation in</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:22:00.519" style="s2">Madagascar and we heard some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.149" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">wrestling and walked up to it and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.519" end="00:22:04.690" style="s2">turned out to be completely filled with</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">these mega bats these giant fruit bats</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.690" end="00:22:10.149" style="s2">who poured out the tree and caused us to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:11.950" style="s2">do yeah this and all the malla gauzy in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.149" end="00:22:14.289" style="s2">the neighborhood we&#39;re laughing at us</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.950" end="00:22:17.950" style="s2">for being such ridiculous fahza you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.289" end="00:22:19.929" style="s2">and as foreigners so you know that at</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.950" end="00:22:21.220" style="s2">night when you hear something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.929" end="00:22:24.100" style="s2">recognize and especially if it then</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.220" end="00:22:26.980" style="s2">comes at you just because it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.100" end="00:22:29.710" style="s2">spooked and it&#39;s trying to get away it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.980" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">is it is scary but you know do you what</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.710" end="00:22:33.820" style="s2">do you think the likelihood is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:37.210" style="s2">there have been back to human viruses</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.820" end="00:22:38.799" style="s2">being spread before now I mean if before</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.210" end="00:22:40.809" style="s2">you answer that if it has been happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.799" end="00:22:42.669" style="s2">it&#39;s been very localized yeah because we</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.809" end="00:22:44.529" style="s2">live in an era of globalization which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.669" end="00:22:46.630" style="s2">why this thing has spread so rapidly it</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.529" end="00:22:48.039" style="s2">would have been localized to whoever had</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.630" end="00:22:50.049" style="s2">the bat soup or what you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.039" end="00:22:53.380" style="s2">the mechanism might have been it has</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.049" end="00:22:55.630" style="s2">happened with rabies occasionally but</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.380" end="00:23:02.289" style="s2">I&#39;m not maybe some virus I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.630" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">convinced that this is a a proper case</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.289" end="00:23:11.860" style="s2">of the meme Konoe ting a epidemiological</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:16.389" style="s2">problem yeah I just I just don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.860" end="00:23:18.159" style="s2">so I think night is spooky and also</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.389" end="00:23:21.010" style="s2">probably the fact that bats hang upside</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.159" end="00:23:25.630" style="s2">down mm-hmm makes them hard to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.010" end="00:23:27.070" style="s2">yeah yeah have the two of you or Eric</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.630" end="00:23:28.450" style="s2">consider trying to make your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.070" end="00:23:30.190" style="s2">research grant to at least provide some</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.450" end="00:23:31.960" style="s2">tiny measure of freedom from the corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.190" end="00:23:34.179" style="s2">academic system to researchers that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.960" end="00:23:35.350" style="s2">think deserves support well that would</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.179" end="00:23:37.389" style="s2">be great if we were independently</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.350" end="00:23:38.769" style="s2">wealthy but none of us are so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.389" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">good yeah we&#39;re not even dependently</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.769" end="00:23:46.179" style="s2">well yeah I mean so the idea of some</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:48.760" style="s2">sort of organization you know something</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.179" end="00:23:52.510" style="s2">philanthropic as opposed to governmental</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.760" end="00:23:54.070" style="s2">and to some degree predatory like NIH</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.510" end="00:23:58.210" style="s2">and NSF are</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.070" end="00:24:01.810" style="s2">NSF are seems terrific and in fact there</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.210" end="00:24:04.120" style="s2">are plenty of smaller organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.810" end="00:24:07.180" style="s2">do give grants for research all of which</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.120" end="00:24:08.770" style="s2">have different roles one rule that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.180" end="00:24:09.970" style="s2">consistent between almost all of them is</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.770" end="00:24:13.080" style="s2">that you have to have an institutional</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.970" end="00:24:18.030" style="s2">affiliation so that&#39;s that&#39;s a rule that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.080" end="00:24:21.040" style="s2">is unfortunately pretty universal but</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.030" end="00:24:24.220" style="s2">yeah I think you know we need more more</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.040" end="00:24:25.750" style="s2">sources of funding all of us but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.220" end="00:24:27.100" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna be any of the three of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.750" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">that the money is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.100" end="00:24:32.230" style="s2">unfortunately unless things change right</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:33.670" style="s2">if we were to visit another planet with</p>

<p begin="00:24:33.670" end="00:24:37.300" style="s2">potentially be able to eat the plant</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:38.530" style="s2">animal analogues we find there okay I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.300" end="00:24:41.110" style="s2">want to take this one because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.530" end="00:24:44.470" style="s2">addressed this exactly I considered this</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.110" end="00:24:48.100" style="s2">question quite a bit in a book I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.470" end="00:24:51.270" style="s2">written that I have I have shelved for</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.100" end="00:24:53.770" style="s2">the moment but a science fiction novel</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.270" end="00:24:55.870" style="s2">about the search for other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.770" end="00:24:58.090" style="s2">consciousness in the galaxy in which</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.870" end="00:25:06.310" style="s2">exactly this question of course comes up</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.090" end="00:25:08.350" style="s2">and I clearly we would be able to take</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.310" end="00:25:10.830" style="s2">the plant animal analogues that we find</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.350" end="00:25:13.720" style="s2">there into its components and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.830" end="00:25:15.430" style="s2">restructure into something that we could</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.720" end="00:25:21.390" style="s2">eat but could we eat what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.430" end="00:25:24.550" style="s2">there it rather depends on exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.390" end="00:25:27.130" style="s2">evolution happened there but it seems at</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.550" end="00:25:31.000" style="s2">first pass to me somewhat unlikely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.130" end="00:25:32.290" style="s2">I think it&#39;s almost certainly known what</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.000" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">are your thoughts on the claims that</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.290" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">kovat 19 sorry I keep on losing it what</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:38.140" style="s2">are your thoughts on the claims that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:40.540" style="s2">kovat 19 may be disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.140" end="00:25:41.980" style="s2">affecting people of color if - do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.540" end="00:25:44.860" style="s2">think this could be biological or</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.980" end="00:25:49.210" style="s2">societal or both that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.860" end="00:25:52.210" style="s2">yep I would say it is it almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.210" end="00:25:56.310" style="s2">certainly has a societal component it</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.210" end="00:25:58.810" style="s2">may have a biological component I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.310" end="00:26:01.390" style="s2">caution you about that term I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.810" end="00:26:03.670" style="s2">argue that culture is equally biological</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.390" end="00:26:06.010" style="s2">as genes but it is certainly toxic</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.670" end="00:26:06.800" style="s2">component it could well have a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.010" end="00:26:10.850" style="s2">component many</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.800" end="00:26:13.310" style="s2">medical phenomena do but I very much</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.850" end="00:26:17.090" style="s2">want to see and maybe these already</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.310" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">exist there are compelling datasets that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.090" end="00:26:22.970" style="s2">suggest a disproportionate effect on</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:27.500" style="s2">particularly African Americans I would</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.970" end="00:26:30.860" style="s2">like to see a correction for economic</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.500" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">status and location right because lots</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.860" end="00:26:36.860" style="s2">of things may go along with what your</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:38.900" style="s2">racial group is and it would be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.860" end="00:26:40.550" style="s2">know causally whether these things could</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.900" end="00:26:42.560" style="s2">be to use Department yeah no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.550" end="00:26:46.370" style="s2">exactly the analysis that I want to see</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.560" end="00:26:48.410" style="s2">it they the claims look legitimate but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.370" end="00:26:50.630" style="s2">have seen nothing separating out</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.410" end="00:26:56.180" style="s2">specifically socioeconomic status and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.630" end="00:26:58.010" style="s2">and geography do animals have perception</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.180" end="00:26:59.660" style="s2">mechanisms and labeling them to infer</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.010" end="00:27:01.250" style="s2">that one animal from another species</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.660" end="00:27:03.560" style="s2">their plan to eat or share territory</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.250" end="00:27:07.480" style="s2">with is an asymptomatic carrier of a</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.480" end="00:27:16.070" style="s2">almost by definition not I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.690" end="00:27:18.920" style="s2">and in fact the very fact of many</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.070" end="00:27:22.580" style="s2">creatures that eat meat being unwilling</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.920" end="00:27:24.470" style="s2">to eat a dead animal and the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.580" end="00:27:26.860" style="s2">fact of many animals were some animals</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.470" end="00:27:29.000" style="s2">playing dead to avoid being eaten</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.860" end="00:27:33.260" style="s2">suggests an aversion to animals that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.000" end="00:27:35.240" style="s2">might be sick but in a symptomatic case</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.260" end="00:27:36.560" style="s2">how would they know I mean almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.240" end="00:27:40.850" style="s2">anything that would allow them to know</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.560" end="00:27:42.620" style="s2">would be a symptom right so again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.850" end="00:27:45.770" style="s2">wrestling with this definition of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.620" end="00:27:46.910" style="s2">asymptomatic at some level in</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.770" end="00:27:48.410" style="s2">environments where people have</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.910" end="00:27:50.180" style="s2">historically died young and made it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.410" end="00:27:52.070" style="s2">early like Africa are people less</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.180" end="00:27:54.260" style="s2">selected for fitness in their old age do</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.070" end="00:27:58.940" style="s2">they have longer telomeres telomeres and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.260" end="00:28:01.460" style="s2">are they more at risk of cancer you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.940" end="00:28:04.010" style="s2">got one of the factors reverse it will</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.460" end="00:28:06.290" style="s2">certainly be true that in any</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.010" end="00:28:08.030" style="s2">environment where you are unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.290" end="00:28:12.140" style="s2">live to old age</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.030" end="00:28:14.660" style="s2">that the alternative to old age which we</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.140" end="00:28:17.890" style="s2">call youthful vigor will be favored at</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.660" end="00:28:17.890" style="s2">some cost to longevity</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.380" end="00:28:24.150" style="s2">so in any case it is quite plausible I</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.020" end="00:28:27.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether your assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.150" end="00:28:29.070" style="s2">about Africa are accurate but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.570" end="00:28:31.980" style="s2">say as a general matter having nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.070" end="00:28:35.160" style="s2">to do with human beings environments</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.980" end="00:28:38.310" style="s2">that allow you to grow to old age reveal</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.160" end="00:28:39.900" style="s2">they basically show selection negative</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.310" end="00:28:41.850" style="s2">effects that happen late in life and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.900" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">selection purges those negative effects</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.850" end="00:28:48.570" style="s2">so you&#39;d get greater longevity our cats</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.200" end="00:28:51.000" style="s2">genetically predisposed to sit in boxes</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.570" end="00:28:52.650" style="s2">are some human behaviors genetically</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.000" end="00:28:53.040" style="s2">influenced how this is three questions</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.650" end="00:28:55.020" style="s2">in one</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.040" end="00:28:57.420" style="s2">how did genetically influence behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.020" end="00:28:59.790" style="s2">get encoded in DNA if not during ones</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.420" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">lifetime so first you would want to rule</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.790" end="00:29:04.710" style="s2">out the possibility that the boxes are</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:07.110" style="s2">predisposed to sit under cats and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.710" end="00:29:11.150" style="s2">just an obvious competing hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.110" end="00:29:14.660" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a confound for sure yep</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.150" end="00:29:17.880" style="s2">yeah you can have behaviors that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.660" end="00:29:23.670" style="s2">genetically influenced and these things</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.880" end="00:29:27.650" style="s2">will be the result of relatively simple</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.670" end="00:29:30.120" style="s2">cascades of effects that in other words</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.650" end="00:29:33.300" style="s2">you&#39;re imagining the wrong thing if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.120" end="00:29:35.940" style="s2">think the DNA has a program in it for</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.300" end="00:29:38.910" style="s2">organizing neurons for some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.940" end="00:29:43.170" style="s2">subjective preference it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.910" end="00:29:45.480" style="s2">likely to be a bias that results in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.170" end="00:29:48.530" style="s2">triggering of a reward mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.480" end="00:29:55.740" style="s2">then results in that behavior becoming</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.530" end="00:29:58.830" style="s2">ingrained over developmental time humans</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.740" end="00:30:00.300" style="s2">are unique we can recognize the game</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.830" end="00:30:02.400" style="s2">we&#39;re playing and choose not to play it</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.300" end="00:30:04.350" style="s2">that&#39;s in quotes how does this make</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.400" end="00:30:06.120" style="s2">sense in light of evolution it allows</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.350" end="00:30:10.620" style="s2">pursuit of things not in the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.120" end="00:30:13.350" style="s2">genes yes we can decide not to play the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.620" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">game unfortunately when we decide not to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.350" end="00:30:17.700" style="s2">play the game we give an advantage to</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:19.770" style="s2">those who decide to continue to play the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.700" end="00:30:21.510" style="s2">game and therefore tend to sideline</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.770" end="00:30:23.850" style="s2">ourselves evolutionarily now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.510" end="00:30:26.220" style="s2">arguing that that has to be the case in</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.850" end="00:30:28.590" style="s2">fact I would argue we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.220" end="00:30:31.260" style="s2">how to stand down that dynamic if we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.590" end="00:30:31.860" style="s2">to escape the peril we create for</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.260" end="00:30:35.160" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.860" end="00:30:38.010" style="s2">in the 21st century but by and large if</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.160" end="00:30:40.740" style="s2">you take the example of can you decide</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.010" end="00:30:42.210" style="s2">to resist the evolutionary drive to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.740" end="00:30:44.429" style="s2">reproduce of course you can and many</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.210" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">people do they tend to be out reproduced</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.429" end="00:30:48.510" style="s2">by those who didn&#39;t though and so at a</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:50.460" style="s2">competitive level it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.510" end="00:30:53.940" style="s2">actually defeated the game you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.460" end="00:30:56.330" style="s2">sidelined yourself so there are ways out</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.940" end="00:31:01.140" style="s2">thinking about how they might work is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.330" end="00:31:03.000" style="s2">well worth the effort so three more</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.140" end="00:31:05.850" style="s2">questions in this and then we&#39;ll go to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.000" end="00:31:08.669" style="s2">the super chat questions from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.850" end="00:31:10.049" style="s2">current live stream years ago I jokingly</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.669" end="00:31:11.370" style="s2">told my college girlfriend that my</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.049" end="00:31:13.080" style="s2">uncouth behavior was not my</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.370" end="00:31:14.610" style="s2">responsibility because generations of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.080" end="00:31:17.130" style="s2">women had selected for the kind of man</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.610" end="00:31:23.309" style="s2">that I had become in hindsight was i</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.130" end="00:31:25.820" style="s2">right No oh I was gonna say yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.309" end="00:31:28.080" style="s2">course you were right yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.820" end="00:31:31.290" style="s2">unfortunately it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.080" end="00:31:37.799" style="s2">well uncouth behavior is not not</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.290" end="00:31:39.000" style="s2">heritable mostly at the genetic level it</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.799" end="00:31:41.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be genetic though</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.000" end="00:31:45.419" style="s2">because the fact is to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.700" end="00:31:47.880" style="s2">men are rewarded for bad behavior they</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.419" end="00:31:52.470" style="s2">tend to propagate that bad behavior to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.880" end="00:31:54.600" style="s2">their sons and male collaborators and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.470" end="00:31:56.370" style="s2">all now lots of terrible things can</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.600" end="00:31:58.440" style="s2">spread this way to having nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.370" end="00:32:01.440" style="s2">with females selecting for them so males</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.440" end="00:32:03.419" style="s2">overriding female choices is the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.440" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a viable strategy that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.419" end="00:32:09.690" style="s2">abhorrent and and you also have no</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:11.309" style="s2">cultural pleiotropy so effectively where</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.690" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff that people put</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.309" end="00:32:14.520" style="s2">up with because it seems to come with</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">the whole package yep and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.520" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s been selected for it</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:20.970" style="s2">means it&#39;s a hanger-on I tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:22.559" style="s2">let&#39;s deal with this proactively instead</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.970" end="00:32:25.260" style="s2">of talking about responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.559" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">past can we just simply employ our</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.260" end="00:32:32.580" style="s2">female followers to stop sleeping with</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:34.119" style="s2">assholes all right good I think we</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.580" end="00:32:36.009" style="s2">covered that okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.119" end="00:32:38.169" style="s2">what would be the evolutionary idea and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.009" end="00:32:41.139" style="s2">why some people can lucid dream yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.169" end="00:32:43.509" style="s2">it&#39;s good I would look at this a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.139" end="00:32:45.999" style="s2">different way some fraction of dreams</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.509" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">are lucid it&#39;s a rare phenomenon in</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.999" end="00:32:49.569" style="s2">normal dreaming but it happens that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:51.969" style="s2">lucid dreams being dreams in which you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.569" end="00:32:53.289" style="s2">are aware you are conscious inside of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.969" end="00:32:56.459" style="s2">your dream that you are dreaming and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.289" end="00:32:59.729" style="s2">some of us who have dabbled in this have</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.459" end="00:33:03.069" style="s2">developed a capacity to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.729" end="00:33:06.039" style="s2">consciously to an extent so the question</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.069" end="00:33:09.339" style="s2">really I think has to do with why the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.039" end="00:33:13.419" style="s2">border between conscious waking thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.339" end="00:33:16.269" style="s2">and unconscious sleeping dreams is</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.419" end="00:33:19.479" style="s2">porous and I will just leave you with</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.269" end="00:33:21.639" style="s2">the following thought sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.479" end="00:33:24.219" style="s2">content of dreams which your conscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.639" end="00:33:26.949" style="s2">mind would not have good access to is</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.219" end="00:33:28.809" style="s2">actually handed across that border upon</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.949" end="00:33:31.149" style="s2">waking those of us who do some</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.809" end="00:33:33.729" style="s2">problem-solving in our dreams sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.149" end="00:33:35.709" style="s2">find a thought is almost handed to our</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.729" end="00:33:37.959" style="s2">conscious mind by our unconscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.709" end="00:33:40.779" style="s2">at the point of natural waking and very</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.959" end="00:33:43.059" style="s2">rarely if ever happens when the alarm</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.779" end="00:33:44.409" style="s2">goes off and jars you awake but if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.059" end="00:33:45.669" style="s2">allow yourself to awake naturally</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.409" end="00:33:47.769" style="s2">there&#39;s a point you arrive at in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.669" end="00:33:49.989" style="s2">dream the conclusion of the dream may be</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.769" end="00:33:52.809" style="s2">of some significance and then your</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.989" end="00:33:54.909" style="s2">subconscious mind hands it off to your</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.809" end="00:33:56.439" style="s2">conscious mind you say aha that problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.909" end="00:34:01.119" style="s2">I&#39;ve been struggling with I think I know</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.439" end="00:34:05.949" style="s2">the answer so that I think hints at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.119" end="00:34:09.669" style="s2">the conclusion which is that the border</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.949" end="00:34:12.279" style="s2">is not a hard and fast rule because</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.669" end="00:34:14.289" style="s2">sometimes it is useful to bend it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.279" end="00:34:17.529" style="s2">then people being able to develop the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.289" end="00:34:19.989" style="s2">capacity to bend it at will is another</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.529" end="00:34:22.089" style="s2">question is that useful or not I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.989" end="00:34:25.329" style="s2">just add one caveat you said those of us</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.089" end="00:34:27.639" style="s2">who problem-solve in our dreams I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.329" end="00:34:29.529" style="s2">think that all of us every one of us</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.639" end="00:34:31.629" style="s2">problem solves in our dreams but some of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.529" end="00:34:33.329" style="s2">us do not have explicit handoffs from</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.629" end="00:34:37.329" style="s2">the unconscious to the conscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.329" end="00:34:41.309" style="s2">but we we wake better able to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.329" end="00:34:44.349" style="s2">something be it skiing or math or</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.309" end="00:34:45.999" style="s2">knitting or whatever it might be then we</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.349" end="00:34:47.530" style="s2">were able to do before we went to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.999" end="00:34:49.120" style="s2">so there&#39;s problem-solving there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.530" end="00:34:51.399" style="s2">which are different but I think both</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.120" end="00:34:53.169" style="s2">things happen for everyone in their</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.399" end="00:34:56.200" style="s2">sleep although not everyone experiences</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.169" end="00:34:59.140" style="s2">a conscious Eureka moment upon waking</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.200" end="00:35:02.380" style="s2">ever yeah I guess the reason I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.140" end="00:35:04.360" style="s2">saying dreams stand any chance of being</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.380" end="00:35:08.290" style="s2">other than adaptive and useful</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.360" end="00:35:10.510" style="s2">cognitively but some of us have had the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.290" end="00:35:13.150" style="s2">experience of some particular thing with</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.510" end="00:35:14.590" style="s2">which we are struggling that we went to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.150" end="00:35:16.300" style="s2">sleep without the answer and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.590" end="00:35:18.400" style="s2">awoken with the answer and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.300" end="00:35:20.650" style="s2">clearly is the result of processing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.400" end="00:35:24.010" style="s2">took place during that time the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.650" end="00:35:26.530" style="s2">experience of you know I get better at X</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.010" end="00:35:28.930" style="s2">Y or Z thing even when I&#39;m not paying</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.530" end="00:35:30.970" style="s2">attention to it and dreams are a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.930" end="00:35:33.400" style="s2">strong contender for the place where</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.970" end="00:35:35.650" style="s2">that occurs I guess I&#39;m just using</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.400" end="00:35:38.380" style="s2">problem solving narrowly rather than</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.650" end="00:35:39.100" style="s2">broadly mmm-hmm oh and dreams and also</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.380" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">non REM sleep</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.100" end="00:35:43.380" style="s2">appears to be a place where a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:45.670" style="s2">physical learning is happening actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.380" end="00:35:47.110" style="s2">great ok so one more question and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.670" end="00:35:50.710" style="s2">we&#39;ll switch to the questions in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.110" end="00:35:52.540" style="s2">next live chat livestream rather how</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.710" end="00:35:54.370" style="s2">does suicide and depression fit in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.540" end="00:35:56.410" style="s2">evolutionary model are they not</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.370" end="00:36:00.340" style="s2">antitheses of survival instinct or just</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.410" end="00:36:04.150" style="s2">non adaptive evolutionary byproducts you</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.340" end="00:36:08.320" style="s2">know I have long wanted to advance the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.150" end="00:36:10.980" style="s2">argument that suicide as we find it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.320" end="00:36:14.830" style="s2">modern circumstances is largely</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.980" end="00:36:17.710" style="s2">maladaptive but that the tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.830" end="00:36:20.470" style="s2">have that option available is utterly</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.710" end="00:36:21.940" style="s2">adaptive and in an ancestral context you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.470" end="00:36:27.190" style="s2">would find it deployed almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.940" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">exclusively adaptively my friend David</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.190" end="00:36:32.620" style="s2">Lodi and I once filed an abstract to</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:38.400" style="s2">give a talk on this very topic and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.620" end="00:36:40.870" style="s2">was rejected I can&#39;t even recall</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">abstract being rejected for it I give a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.870" end="00:36:44.590" style="s2">talk at a conference that both qualified</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:46.750" style="s2">dear give the talk but anyway um</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.590" end="00:36:49.110" style="s2">certainly Lodi was your co-author on</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.750" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">your evolution of morality paper yep</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.110" end="00:36:55.120" style="s2">he&#39;s a good friend so anyway let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:56.680" style="s2">say this topic needs very careful</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.120" end="00:36:59.260" style="s2">thinking lots of things are</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.680" end="00:37:00.049" style="s2">transmissible evolutionarily that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.260" end="00:37:02.719" style="s2">at first</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.049" end="00:37:06.499" style="s2">to be maladaptive but have a hidden</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.719" end="00:37:08.539" style="s2">logic to them and so suicide and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.499" end="00:37:11.809" style="s2">depression are both strong candidates</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.539" end="00:37:13.819" style="s2">for this Randy necie who was a mentor of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.809" end="00:37:15.349" style="s2">mine many years ago has done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.819" end="00:37:23.359" style="s2">work on the question of depression</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.349" end="00:37:32.119" style="s2">mm-hmm okay Zach are we looking you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.359" end="00:37:33.529" style="s2">wait what is this here we go so</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.119" end="00:37:35.029" style="s2">everything is in grant having a hard</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.529" end="00:37:44.630" style="s2">time reading this cuz it&#39;s all grayed</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.029" end="00:37:45.439" style="s2">out yep so I&#39;m gonna pull on you Brett</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.630" end="00:37:49.449" style="s2">oh there we go</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.439" end="00:37:54.769" style="s2">that&#39;s helpful but where do I start</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.449" end="00:37:56.179" style="s2">fifty-seven right here he says okay so</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.769" end="00:37:57.439" style="s2">we&#39;ll spend a half an hour just going</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.179" end="00:37:59.979" style="s2">through these in the order they came in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.439" end="00:38:02.929" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll stop when we stop okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.979" end="00:38:05.209" style="s2">first question are you aware of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.929" end="00:38:08.420" style="s2">historical epidemics for the category of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.209" end="00:38:10.479" style="s2">asymptomatic has been has been</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.420" end="00:38:12.859" style="s2">eventually revised to something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.479" end="00:38:15.259" style="s2">symptomatic in a way that hasn&#39;t as of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.859" end="00:38:16.939" style="s2">yet been identified as relevant it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.259" end="00:38:18.199" style="s2">super interesting question I am not</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.939" end="00:38:21.319" style="s2">aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.199" end="00:38:26.059" style="s2">I feel like this this pandemic has the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.319" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">greatest chance of of recategorize in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.059" end="00:38:31.160" style="s2">symptomatic in that way especially as</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:32.779" style="s2">these you know we&#39;ve got like chilblains</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.160" end="00:38:35.329" style="s2">which i think is the technical term for</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.779" end="00:38:38.869" style="s2">this you know these really swollen red</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.329" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">toes and fingertips which is a which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.869" end="00:38:42.380" style="s2">a symptom in quote-unquote otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:44.689" style="s2">asymptomatic carriers we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.380" end="00:38:45.319" style="s2">anosmia the loss of sense of smell and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.689" end="00:38:47.150" style="s2">taste</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.319" end="00:38:49.579" style="s2">there are presumably others of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.150" end="00:38:51.259" style="s2">things where oh you&#39;re asymptomatic but</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.579" end="00:38:52.759" style="s2">you just are experiencing something</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.259" end="00:38:55.219" style="s2">weird well maybe that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.759" end="00:38:59.089" style="s2">symptom that isn&#39;t yet diagnosed yeah</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.309" end="00:39:05.869" style="s2">cases because would we even call that</p>

<p begin="00:46:03.490" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">written is going to be mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.970" end="00:46:11.860" style="s2">explicit and evolutionarily relevant</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:14.860" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a lot of good stuff but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.860" end="00:46:17.020" style="s2">problem is you want to pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.860" end="00:46:21.790" style="s2">without allowing it to constrain what</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.020" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">you&#39;re capable of contemplating toxic</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.790" end="00:46:25.300" style="s2">sunset question what is the difference</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:27.700" style="s2">between deductive and inductive</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.300" end="00:46:29.500" style="s2">reasoning could you illustrate these two</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.700" end="00:46:32.470" style="s2">concepts with examples that relate to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.500" end="00:46:35.980" style="s2">the scientific method what is a toxic</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.470" end="00:46:38.100" style="s2">sunset question yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.980" end="00:46:41.380" style="s2">know I mean you know we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.100" end="00:46:47.170" style="s2">inductive and deductive and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.380" end="00:46:47.820" style="s2">the scientific method uses both well no</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.170" end="00:46:51.100" style="s2">not really</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.820" end="00:46:53.050" style="s2">for one thing I always confuse the two</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.100" end="00:46:54.580" style="s2">but what what brings me what what does</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.050" end="00:46:56.200" style="s2">my pneumonic for it is remembering that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.580" end="00:46:58.710" style="s2">the scientific method is best understood</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.200" end="00:47:01.390" style="s2">at least in a pop arian sense as</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.710" end="00:47:03.430" style="s2">hypothetical deductive yeah in which</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.390" end="00:47:06.370" style="s2">hypothesis is the stand-in for inductive</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.430" end="00:47:10.300" style="s2">reasoning where the hypothesis is taking</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.370" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">general observations and or is it this</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.300" end="00:47:14.350" style="s2">is this is where I get confused general</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:16.750" style="s2">observations and positing a particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.350" end="00:47:18.460" style="s2">meaning for them as a hypothesis and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.750" end="00:47:21.550" style="s2">deduction that follows would be taking</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.460" end="00:47:24.370" style="s2">the particular testing it etc taking the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.550" end="00:47:26.680" style="s2">particular and generalizing from it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.370" end="00:47:31.570" style="s2">claiming that there&#39;s a general truth</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.680" end="00:47:35.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s still very broad and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.570" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">theoretical but the the to the reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.080" end="00:47:38.230" style="s2">from general to specific and reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:38.920" style="s2">from specific to general need to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.230" end="00:47:41.650" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.920" end="00:47:44.170" style="s2">you know simultaneously practically or</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.650" end="00:47:45.820" style="s2">at least both within any process they</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.170" end="00:47:48.070" style="s2">need to be trading back and for treating</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.820" end="00:47:50.590" style="s2">back and forth that&#39;s matter and both</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.070" end="00:47:53.620" style="s2">both need to be happening in order for</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.590" end="00:47:55.260" style="s2">the complete scientific discovery loop</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.620" end="00:47:58.090" style="s2">to happen yep</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.260" end="00:48:00.040" style="s2">yes the wim HOF method it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.090" end="00:48:03.070" style="s2">nobody mentioned wim HOF this time fixed</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.040" end="00:48:05.770" style="s2">okay mentioned our ethics committees as</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.070" end="00:48:07.540" style="s2">corrupt as the peer review complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.770" end="00:48:08.890" style="s2">what can be done about it our ethics</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.540" end="00:48:12.970" style="s2">committees as corrupt as the peer review</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.890" end="00:48:16.360" style="s2">complex I know less about how epics</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.970" end="00:48:17.770" style="s2">committees are constructed and I and but</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.360" end="00:48:19.960" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about the kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.770" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">that&#39;s happening over in diversity</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.960" end="00:48:28.150" style="s2">inclusion equity space for sure and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:28.840" style="s2">in some ways even more so what can be</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.150" end="00:48:33.180" style="s2">done about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.840" end="00:48:35.550" style="s2">we can stop funding all of the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.180" end="00:48:37.480" style="s2"> that&#39;s happening in academia</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.550" end="00:48:40.390" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing that can be done about</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.480" end="00:48:41.890" style="s2">it that would be good yeah thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.390" end="00:48:43.510" style="s2">doing this at a time I am awake and able</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.890" end="00:48:45.550" style="s2">to watch live from Scotland</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.510" end="00:48:46.990" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome you have referred to some</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.550" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">Scottish data a couple of times now</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.990" end="00:48:50.980" style="s2">could you talk a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:53.260" style="s2">this you&#39;ve referenced this I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.980" end="00:48:55.600" style="s2">know catching me a little off-guard I</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.260" end="00:48:59.590" style="s2">don&#39;t have the paper here but I believe</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.600" end="00:49:02.350" style="s2">this was a fairly large-scale study that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.590" end="00:49:04.930" style="s2">sampled the population at random to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.350" end="00:49:06.730" style="s2">assess how many people had had kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.930" end="00:49:07.690" style="s2">cross Scotland or an ed murrow or</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.730" end="00:49:10.120" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.690" end="00:49:13.570" style="s2">it was a subset but I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.120" end="00:49:16.180" style="s2">okay I can&#39;t remember where the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.570" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">sampling was done but it appeared to</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.180" end="00:49:22.060" style="s2">reflect a fairly high rate of infection</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:26.320" style="s2">relative to the already known rate of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.060" end="00:49:29.560" style="s2">mortality it was something like one</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.320" end="00:49:31.660" style="s2">percent of cases were detected okay um</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.560" end="00:49:32.890" style="s2">maybe Zac if you would flag that one and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.660" end="00:49:36.040" style="s2">what maybe people try to find the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.890" end="00:49:39.420" style="s2">scottish data to either post in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.040" end="00:49:44.080" style="s2">description or mention next time</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.420" end="00:49:46.630" style="s2">sixty-five thank you for this</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.080" end="00:49:48.340" style="s2">I read opposite opinions on if you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.630" end="00:49:50.650" style="s2">or should boost the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.340" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">thoughts also mutiny please know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.650" end="00:49:57.970" style="s2">cannot live with four more years of anti</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:50:00.550" style="s2">science Trump that&#39;s to boost of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.970" end="00:50:02.860" style="s2">immune system yeah I I every time I hear</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.550" end="00:50:06.070" style="s2">somebody talk about boosting immunity I</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.860" end="00:50:08.470" style="s2">kind of glaze over because in general</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.070" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s not how immunity works right you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.470" end="00:50:13.960" style="s2">can inform the immune system about a</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:17.349" style="s2">particular hazard you can depress the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.960" end="00:50:20.089" style="s2">immune system by</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.349" end="00:50:23.809" style="s2">throwing challenges at it that overwhelm</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.089" end="00:50:27.559" style="s2">it but boosting immunity is one of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.809" end="00:50:30.619" style="s2">phrases that gets invoked that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.559" end="00:50:32.660" style="s2">think is particularly meaningful that</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.619" end="00:50:34.579" style="s2">said because I for the first time have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.660" end="00:50:38.510" style="s2">computer in front of me I just found</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.579" end="00:50:42.230" style="s2">this paper Luo at all 2020 don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.510" end="00:50:43.460" style="s2">put the screen on Zach that was it</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.230" end="00:50:46.599" style="s2">published this year but it was peer</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.460" end="00:50:48.980" style="s2">reviewed so it was in the it was in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.599" end="00:50:50.599" style="s2">publication pipeline for a while but</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.980" end="00:50:52.910" style="s2">found that in pigs</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.599" end="00:50:54.710" style="s2">early life enrichment versus being</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.910" end="00:50:56.329" style="s2">housed in barren cages is correlated</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.710" end="00:50:58.280" style="s2">with enhanced immunoglobulin G</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.329" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">production in response to exposure to</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.280" end="00:51:02.750" style="s2">particular antigens later later life</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:04.190" style="s2">enrichment does not have such effects so</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.750" end="00:51:06.440" style="s2">I was thinking we talk about this a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.190" end="00:51:08.510" style="s2">little bit on the next live stream which</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.440" end="00:51:10.250" style="s2">we may still but it was the first time</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.510" end="00:51:13.540" style="s2">so I just pulled that up from my notes</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.250" end="00:51:16.339" style="s2">for for next time but I saw something</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.540" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">environmental being correlated with a a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.339" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">boost right and i GG for for exposure to</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:26.180" style="s2">particular antigens yes but it also</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.839" end="00:51:29.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t distinguish you know is it that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.180" end="00:51:31.520" style="s2">pigs in a non enriched environment have</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.030" end="00:51:33.680" style="s2">depressed immunity and that this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.520" end="00:51:36.109" style="s2">restoring the immunity and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:41.480" style="s2">gonna be yes so what is baseline yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.109" end="00:51:44.059" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s see deniers of Wuhan lab</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.480" end="00:51:46.040" style="s2">Theory the virus is organic and origin</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.059" end="00:51:47.720" style="s2">can it be cultivated in populations of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.040" end="00:51:50.990" style="s2">bats to make sure the virus can jump to</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.720" end="00:51:56.599" style="s2">humans can it be cultivated to look like</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.990" end="00:52:01.640" style="s2">organic I&#39;m just going to say and I saw</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.599" end="00:52:04.970" style="s2">Eric tweeting about this today the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.640" end="00:52:07.609" style="s2">that the Wuhan lab was somehow involved</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.970" end="00:52:11.510" style="s2">is not synonymous with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.609" end="00:52:15.049" style="s2">this virus was created or altered by</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.510" end="00:52:20.680" style="s2">people that is of course possible but</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.049" end="00:52:23.809" style="s2">the chances of this virus being organic</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.680" end="00:52:26.990" style="s2">being in the lab under study for</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.809" end="00:52:28.760" style="s2">whatever reason and escaping is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.990" end="00:52:31.730" style="s2">more likely</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.760" end="00:52:34.700" style="s2">what we know so far then that this was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.730" end="00:52:37.580" style="s2">synthetic virus that was would have had</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.700" end="00:52:40.130" style="s2">to be assembled out of a virus from some</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.580" end="00:52:43.670" style="s2">creature presumably a bat but in any</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.130" end="00:52:46.790" style="s2">case I think people are just simply</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.670" end="00:52:49.370" style="s2">synonymous the idea of a synthetic or</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.790" end="00:52:52.460" style="s2">altered virus with the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.370" end="00:52:55.180" style="s2">virus was in the lab under study which</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.460" end="00:52:57.830" style="s2">we don&#39;t know but is seems highly likely</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.180" end="00:52:59.600" style="s2">since there were bat coronavirus is</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.830" end="00:53:02.450" style="s2">apparently being studied at this lab so</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.600" end="00:53:04.070" style="s2">anyway don&#39;t leap to the conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.450" end="00:53:07.880" style="s2">it&#39;s synthetic even if you believe that</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.070" end="00:53:09.590" style="s2">the laboratory was likely involved how</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.880" end="00:53:12.230" style="s2">does depression function evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.590" end="00:53:13.700" style="s2">I think we already addressed this if it</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.230" end="00:53:15.170" style="s2">signifies needs are not being met then</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.700" end="00:53:15.590" style="s2">why is it so difficult to meet those</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.170" end="00:53:21.530" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.590" end="00:53:24.200" style="s2">when depressed not bandwidth enough here</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.530" end="00:53:27.410" style="s2">to take to take care of the question</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.200" end="00:53:30.680" style="s2">fully but I would say the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.410" end="00:53:34.040" style="s2">depression being maladaptive in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.680" end="00:53:36.380" style="s2">milieu does not mean that it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.040" end="00:53:38.710" style="s2">modification of something that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.380" end="00:53:42.590" style="s2">adaptive in a different context so we</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.710" end="00:53:44.210" style="s2">have a an ultra novel environment that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.590" end="00:53:46.730" style="s2">is taking all sorts of things that would</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.210" end="00:53:49.430" style="s2">ordinarily be adaptive like for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.730" end="00:53:51.590" style="s2">our ability to store excess food energy</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.430" end="00:53:53.930" style="s2">that we encounter during some seasons</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.590" end="00:53:55.730" style="s2">for use in other seasons that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.930" end="00:53:57.290" style="s2">gets out of control very easily when</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.730" end="00:54:00.830" style="s2">there&#39;s just too much food resource</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.290" end="00:54:04.130" style="s2">available so does that mean storing fat</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.830" end="00:54:06.020" style="s2">is maladaptive no but in many cases it</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.130" end="00:54:07.670" style="s2">becomes maladaptive because the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.020" end="00:54:10.370" style="s2">regulators on it aren&#39;t built for our</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.670" end="00:54:12.980" style="s2">environment okay so it looks like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.370" end="00:54:14.930" style="s2">got 50 minutes we got five questions</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.980" end="00:54:16.550" style="s2">left here and if we have a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.930" end="00:54:18.730" style="s2">more time we&#39;ll go back into the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.550" end="00:54:21.050" style="s2">super channel that we probably want</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.730" end="00:54:25.370" style="s2">suggestions of good material on lucid</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.050" end="00:54:27.590" style="s2">dreaming I don&#39;t know any texts um this</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.370" end="00:54:28.940" style="s2">is a long time ago but when I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.590" end="00:54:31.430" style="s2">experimenting with lucid dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.940" end="00:54:34.520" style="s2">I believe the Stanford sleep Research</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.430" end="00:54:37.580" style="s2">Center was mecca for that sort of work</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.520" end="00:54:39.559" style="s2">and they had materials available</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.580" end="00:54:41.269" style="s2">including some</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.559" end="00:54:45.289" style="s2">stuff on how to train yourself to loose</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.269" end="00:54:48.019" style="s2">a dream I found it useful certainly fun</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.289" end="00:54:49.849" style="s2">if a bit exhausting but anyway I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.019" end="00:54:54.259" style="s2">see you did you feel less rested after</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.849" end="00:54:56.269" style="s2">lucid dreaming yeah often yeah it was it</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.259" end="00:54:59.930" style="s2">might steal from some of the important</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.269" end="00:55:01.219" style="s2">benefits of sleep and dream I would say</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.930" end="00:55:03.140" style="s2">it was a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.219" end="00:55:05.449" style="s2">they were definitely it was very</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.140" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">enjoyable fascinating but also a bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.449" end="00:55:10.039" style="s2">exhausting okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:11.539" style="s2">follow-up to not playing the game you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.039" end="00:55:13.759" style="s2">mentioned this being necessary in order</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.539" end="00:55:16.849" style="s2">to navigate to a better world how would</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.759" end="00:55:19.039" style="s2">this ability have evolved the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.849" end="00:55:22.430" style="s2">step out of the game yeah well the thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.039" end="00:55:25.039" style="s2">is what if you see a bigger game right</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.430" end="00:55:27.469" style="s2">so I don&#39;t want to go too deep in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.039" end="00:55:30.009" style="s2">weeds here but let&#39;s just say as I said</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.469" end="00:55:35.089" style="s2">in some of the early live streams</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.009" end="00:55:37.609" style="s2">evolutions objective for each species is</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.089" end="00:55:40.219" style="s2">to get it as deeply into the future as</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.609" end="00:55:44.089" style="s2">it can what if you recognize that by</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.219" end="00:55:46.549" style="s2">playing a game local to our era we were</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.089" end="00:55:50.449" style="s2">effectively guaranteeing our extinction</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.549" end="00:55:53.329" style="s2">in the next 150 years and that in order</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.449" end="00:55:54.380" style="s2">to get into an era 500 years from now or</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.329" end="00:55:56.390" style="s2">a thousand years from now you</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.380" end="00:55:59.589" style="s2">effectively had to stop playing the game</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.390" end="00:56:02.479" style="s2">that you were trapped in in 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.589" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">could you do it the answer is not an</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.479" end="00:56:06.439" style="s2">obvious yes but it is a plausible yes in</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:09.589" style="s2">other words human beings are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.439" end="00:56:11.359" style="s2">abstracting the game and saying yes if</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.589" end="00:56:14.119" style="s2">we keep doing this thing it will result</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:17.630" style="s2">in that that we do not want what can we</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.119" end="00:56:19.989" style="s2">do to re our Kotak incentives such that</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.630" end="00:56:23.869" style="s2">we can get past that roadblock and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.989" end="00:56:28.579" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no obstacle to it other</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.869" end="00:56:32.269" style="s2">than the recognition of the bind and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.579" end="00:56:34.939" style="s2">ability to compel a sufficient number of</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.269" end="00:56:39.249" style="s2">people that I mean look it&#39;s it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.939" end="00:56:41.959" style="s2">different than the wisdom that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.249" end="00:56:45.709" style="s2">accompanies a recognition of delayed</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.959" end="00:56:48.799" style="s2">gratification we are all born into a</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.709" end="00:56:52.900" style="s2">state where you know we see and we want</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.799" end="00:56:54.730" style="s2">and then we learn that actually you</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.900" end="00:56:57.160" style="s2">get things that are better than that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.730" end="00:57:02.470" style="s2">can reach out and touch if you are</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.160" end="00:57:04.990" style="s2">willing to to wait and to plan and so we</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.470" end="00:57:08.110" style="s2">do that and so it&#39;s easier to do as an</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.990" end="00:57:10.300" style="s2">individual than it is to do as a society</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.110" end="00:57:13.000" style="s2">but it is possible at both levels we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.300" end="00:57:16.390" style="s2">seen it at both levels and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.000" end="00:57:19.600" style="s2">really the thing is we have to agree</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.390" end="00:57:22.990" style="s2">about the peril and we have to agree</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.600" end="00:57:25.390" style="s2">that the steps necessary to avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.990" end="00:57:27.940" style="s2">peril are worth it and I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.390" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">took that project seriously we would</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.940" end="00:57:32.170" style="s2">also discover that there were great</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:39.280" style="s2">rewards even in the short term once we</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.170" end="00:57:41.290" style="s2">begin with that project wonderful can</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.280" end="00:57:43.300" style="s2">you provide details on how a virus such</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.290" end="00:57:45.820" style="s2">as the current one is determined to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.300" end="00:57:47.680" style="s2">natural versus engineered so one of our</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.820" end="00:57:50.070" style="s2">early live streams we talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.680" end="00:57:55.780" style="s2">paper that it concluded that it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.070" end="00:57:57.070" style="s2">natural quote-unquote organic and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.780" end="00:57:58.750" style="s2">still working on going back through</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.070" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">those early live streams and putting the</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.750" end="00:58:05.620" style="s2">papers that we mentioned in the show</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.190" end="00:58:08.230" style="s2">notes the video notes but um is it how</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.620" end="00:58:10.000" style="s2">close a match is it to extant</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.230" end="00:58:12.610" style="s2">viruses that are already known and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.000" end="00:58:14.050" style="s2">sequenced and there are these databases</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.610" end="00:58:15.100" style="s2">at some point on one of these we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.050" end="00:58:17.350" style="s2">going to talk a little bit about names</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.100" end="00:58:20.110" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna walk us through the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.350" end="00:58:23.530" style="s2">various levels of nested sets in which</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.110" end="00:58:27.730" style="s2">this virus exists and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.530" end="00:58:32.800" style="s2">match that&#39;s really really close to an</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.730" end="00:58:35.920" style="s2">existing virus it you know it still may</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.800" end="00:58:38.650" style="s2">be recombinant it may be that to humans</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.920" end="00:58:42.850" style="s2">combined to extant viruses but it</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.650" end="00:58:44.970" style="s2">appears to be based on the existing</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.850" end="00:58:46.810" style="s2">viruses and then there&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.970" end="00:58:49.780" style="s2">this is a place where we slightly</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.810" end="00:58:52.810" style="s2">disagreed the authors were saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.780" end="00:58:55.060" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t look like the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.810" end="00:58:57.430" style="s2">changes that someone who is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.060" end="00:58:59.620" style="s2">engineer a virus would have made because</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.430" end="00:59:02.650" style="s2">these aren&#39;t the obvious changes to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.620" end="00:59:04.210" style="s2">to other corona viruses and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.650" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">well if you were actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.210" end="00:59:07.009" style="s2">engineer</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:09.409" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you actually make some choices</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.009" end="00:59:12.469" style="s2">that weren&#39;t obvious so as exactly to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.409" end="00:59:13.699" style="s2">put people off of your trail but there</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.469" end="00:59:15.679" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.699" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">that you and I don&#39;t know about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.679" end="00:59:18.739" style="s2">difficulty of you know dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:21.349" style="s2">protein code versus you know the spiked</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.739" end="00:59:25.489" style="s2">protein and you know all of the vagaries</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.349" end="00:59:31.309" style="s2">of viruses yeah I would say the key</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.489" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">piece of evidence would be a in this</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.309" end="00:59:37.309" style="s2">case it would be RNA code for which</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:39.769" style="s2">there was no plausible mechanism for it</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.309" end="00:59:43.819" style="s2">to have gotten into a corona virus but</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.769" end="00:59:47.689" style="s2">human metal so a recombinant organism</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.819" end="00:59:49.939" style="s2">where a recombinant virus that is corona</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.689" end="00:59:53.299" style="s2">virus but then has something from</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.939" end="00:59:55.249" style="s2">another known animal genome and or</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.299" end="00:59:57.140" style="s2">fungal genome or something and we have</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.249" end="00:59:58.609" style="s2">no known mechanism for how it could have</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.140" end="01:00:00.409" style="s2">gotten there yeah and even whereas we</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.609" end="01:00:02.659" style="s2">have this and we know that these like</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.409" end="01:00:06.140" style="s2">we&#39;re common at bat pengal and viruses</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.659" end="01:00:08.150" style="s2">exist for instance and people have put</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.140" end="01:00:10.849" style="s2">together plausible stories for how that</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.150" end="01:00:12.769" style="s2">might have happened organically yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.849" end="01:00:14.900" style="s2">you have to be cautious just because you</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.769" end="01:00:19.369" style="s2">don&#39;t know the mechanism by which some</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.900" end="01:00:21.469" style="s2">sequence found its way into into this</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.369" end="01:00:23.749" style="s2">virus it doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.469" end="01:00:27.099" style="s2">one but yeah the fact that this virus</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.749" end="01:00:30.979" style="s2">does not integrate into the genome</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.099" end="01:00:33.619" style="s2">actually limits to an extent what it</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.979" end="01:00:35.029" style="s2">could have picked up in its own you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.619" end="01:00:37.640" style="s2">there may be mechanisms that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.029" end="01:00:39.679" style="s2">know or that I don&#39;t know but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.640" end="01:00:41.809" style="s2">hopping into the genome and then hopping</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.679" end="01:00:43.939" style="s2">out and capable of taking anything that</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.809" end="01:00:46.130" style="s2">it might find there with it as a result</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.939" end="01:00:47.929" style="s2">of a different edit mm-hmm because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.130" end="01:00:50.929" style="s2">not integrating it&#39;s not in a position</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.929" end="01:00:53.630" style="s2">to collect that stuff so anyway I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.929" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">I would you know look for something that</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.630" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">was just so improbable that it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">have landed there by any normal</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:04.519" style="s2">mechanism and the second thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:09.140" style="s2">capacity that had been tacked on to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.519" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">virus would have to provide some value</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.140" end="01:01:13.369" style="s2">from the perspective of the humans that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:14.679" style="s2">would have done the engineering so in</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.369" end="01:01:18.060" style="s2">other words of some sequence that</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.679" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">additive the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.060" end="01:01:24.240" style="s2">the coronavirus that would make it</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:26.610" style="s2">harder to defeat for example would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.240" end="01:01:30.480" style="s2">suggestive but I have yet to see</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.610" end="01:01:33.150" style="s2">anything of this sort yep okay two more</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.480" end="01:01:37.070" style="s2">questions one what are the most</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.150" end="01:01:37.070" style="s2">important criteria of a game beef</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.260" end="01:01:40.260" style="s2">there are two ways to answer this</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:43.530" style="s2">because it&#39;s not really clear what</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.260" end="01:01:47.220" style="s2">important means in that question one and</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.530" end="01:01:50.670" style="s2">I would say the primary one is that it</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.220" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">has to be competitively superior to game</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.670" end="01:01:58.560" style="s2">a in game A&#39;s terms in order for it to</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:02:00.660" style="s2">be viable but in saying that there might</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.560" end="01:02:04.380" style="s2">be lots of things that are superior to a</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.660" end="01:02:06.360" style="s2">game a and wouldn&#39;t be a true game B</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.380" end="01:02:09.330" style="s2">because they wouldn&#39;t produce any of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.360" end="01:02:12.660" style="s2">virtues of the hypothesized game B</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.330" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">environment so I would say high on my</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.660" end="01:02:17.900" style="s2">list for things that a game B would have</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:22.050" style="s2">to include it would have to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.900" end="01:02:24.810" style="s2">sustainable it would have to be fair it</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.050" end="01:02:27.240" style="s2">would have to be liberating those would</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.810" end="01:02:29.640" style="s2">be high on the list of characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.240" end="01:02:32.610" style="s2">of a game B world and something that had</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.640" end="01:02:35.310" style="s2">those characteristics and was</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.610" end="01:02:39.200" style="s2">competitively superior to game a and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.310" end="01:02:41.520" style="s2">game A&#39;s terms so also I would argue</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.200" end="01:02:43.830" style="s2">resistant to capture or another way of</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.520" end="01:02:45.780" style="s2">saying it would be an evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.830" end="01:02:47.810" style="s2">stable strategy that is to say a</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.780" end="01:02:50.670" style="s2">strategy that maintained its superiority</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.810" end="01:02:56.580" style="s2">and could not be invaded by something</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.670" end="01:02:58.020" style="s2">that that was corrupt wonderful the last</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.580" end="01:03:00.360" style="s2">question is a comment from which maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.020" end="01:03:02.430" style="s2">we can riff a tiny bit before signing</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.360" end="01:03:04.590" style="s2">off for today lots of talk about how we</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.430" end="01:03:07.290" style="s2">perform healthcare politics etc when the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.590" end="01:03:09.240" style="s2">pandemic is over but like changing one</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.290" end="01:03:12.650" style="s2">comma and the tax code there are winners</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.240" end="01:03:12.650" style="s2">and losers from any change</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:19.890" style="s2">yeah there gonna be a lot of winners and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.930" end="01:03:23.550" style="s2">losers when this is over just based on</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.890" end="01:03:26.600" style="s2">what we will have learned and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.550" end="01:03:29.950" style="s2">there is almost no way</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.600" end="01:03:33.140" style="s2">to deal with that it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.950" end="01:03:36.520" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to even know what metaphor to</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.140" end="01:03:41.150" style="s2">invoke it&#39;s going to be a gigantic</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.520" end="01:03:44.150" style="s2">earthquake of change that said it does</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.150" end="01:03:46.000" style="s2">point to the necessity of having a</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.150" end="01:03:48.080" style="s2">system that protects you from</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.000" end="01:03:49.430" style="s2">unpredictable giant earthquakes of</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.080" end="01:03:51.650" style="s2">change and I&#39;m not saying that a</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.430" end="01:03:56.690" style="s2">pandemic was unpredictable but the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.650" end="01:03:59.540" style="s2">particulars of it clearly was so this</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.690" end="01:04:02.030" style="s2">tells us that we need a system that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.540" end="01:04:04.850" style="s2">built for the next one of these whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.030" end="01:04:07.190" style="s2">it is and that immunizes people from</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.850" end="01:04:09.980" style="s2">having their lives turned upside down</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.190" end="01:04:13.280" style="s2">their ability to earn suddenly ended</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.980" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">that cannot be maintained because the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.280" end="01:04:20.080" style="s2">volatility and danger in the system that</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:23.090" style="s2">was installed with none of our approval</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.080" end="01:04:25.960" style="s2">right all of that fragility was built in</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.090" end="01:04:29.000" style="s2">some of it intentionally some of it by</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.960" end="01:04:32.600" style="s2">forces of evolution some of it by bad</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.000" end="01:04:34.640" style="s2">choice making but the fact is we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.600" end="01:04:36.320" style="s2">design it and we are now at risk of</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.640" end="01:04:38.900" style="s2">suffering from it we have to build a</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.320" end="01:04:41.420" style="s2">system that protects us from those kinds</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.900" end="01:04:43.730" style="s2">of consequences and so yes there are</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.420" end="01:04:46.520" style="s2">going to be winners and losers but the</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.730" end="01:04:48.890" style="s2">system works best when the losers are</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.520" end="01:04:51.320" style="s2">people who are suffering from their own</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.890" end="01:04:53.060" style="s2">bad decision making and the winners are</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.320" end="01:04:55.100" style="s2">people who are profiting from their good</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.060" end="01:04:57.410" style="s2">decision making and good and bad are</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.100" end="01:05:00.020" style="s2">defined such that when somebody makes a</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.410" end="01:05:01.400" style="s2">good decision it enhances well-being on</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.020" end="01:05:03.590" style="s2">planet Earth and when somebody makes a</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.400" end="01:05:05.030" style="s2">bad decision it&#39;s one that does harm to</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.590" end="01:05:07.760" style="s2">well-being and those are the things that</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.030" end="01:05:10.130" style="s2">come back to haunt you so again this</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.760" end="01:05:11.840" style="s2">goes to the question of game B we need a</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.130" end="01:05:16.070" style="s2">system in which those feedbacks are</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.840" end="01:05:20.180" style="s2">tight enough that the system evolves</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.070" end="01:05:24.260" style="s2">towards desirable ends and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.180" end="01:05:26.840" style="s2">that system at the moment all right all</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.260" end="01:05:31.190" style="s2">right well this has been great we will</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.840" end="01:05:34.160" style="s2">do a live stream number nine sooner</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.190" end="01:05:36.990" style="s2">rather than later probably a.m. Pacific</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.160" end="01:05:39.450" style="s2">Tuesday 3:30</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.990" end="01:05:41.160" style="s2">and hopefully we will have further</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.450" end="01:05:43.980" style="s2">technical issues solved</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.160" end="01:05:46.160" style="s2">we appreciate you bearing with us in the</p>
