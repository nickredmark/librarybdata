<p begin="00:00:11.880" end="00:00:18.510" style="s2">so we&#39;ll continue with our union<br />analysis of the Lion King today we ended</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.510" end="00:00:25.570" style="s2">at the point where remember Mufasa had<br />taken Simba up to the top of Pride Rock</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.570" end="00:00:31.900" style="s2">and described to him the fact that his<br />kingdom essentially constituted</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.900" end="00:00:36.309" style="s2">everything that the light touched and<br />you can think about that as the domain</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.309" end="00:00:40.629" style="s2">of the roughly speaking of the great<br />father with the domain of the great</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.629" end="00:00:44.379" style="s2">mother on the outside of that being<br />symbolically equivalent to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.379" end="00:00:49.210" style="s2">underworld or to death or to nature all<br />of those things seem to be approximately</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.210" end="00:00:55.150" style="s2">equally true and he forbade Simba from<br />going to investigate what was beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.150" end="00:01:00.040" style="s2">confines of the light and in some sense<br />that&#39;s exactly what a tradition does for</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.040" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">you it because the tradition is<br />precisely what defines the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:09.130" style="s2">light and to be moral from the<br />perspective of the tradition it&#39;s akin</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.130" end="00:01:13.810" style="s2">to playing a piagetian game but only<br />adhering to the rules you know how</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.810" end="00:01:17.710" style="s2">Piaget described the fact that when kids<br />first master a game they learned they</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.710" end="00:01:21.340" style="s2">learn how to act it out and then they<br />learn what the rules are and then they</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.340" end="00:01:26.229" style="s2">regard the rules in some sense as sacred<br />you can&#39;t go outside the rules and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.229" end="00:01:29.469" style="s2">later in moral development if they get<br />to that stage then they start to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.469" end="00:01:34.299" style="s2">recognize themselves also as formulators<br />of the rule or formulators of the game</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.299" end="00:01:38.859" style="s2">and culture tells you don&#39;t go beyond<br />the rules that&#39;s the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.859" end="00:01:42.579" style="s2">morality within the box of culture and<br />you don&#39;t go outside of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.579" end="00:01:47.979" style="s2">that&#39;s why Mufasa plays that particular<br />role and it&#39;s wise because if you go</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.979" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">outside the domain of what you already<br />understand then it&#39;s dangerous out there</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:57.429" style="s2">clearly it&#39;s dangerous out there but the<br />downside of that particular message and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.429" end="00:02:02.380" style="s2">this is perhaps this is the mythological<br />reason why Mufasa isn&#39;t as aware as he</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.380" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">could be of scar<br />you know his knowledge is bounded and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.209" style="s2">he&#39;s no I&#39;m not aware enough of what<br />lies outside of that in this realm let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.209" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">say of death and destruction and so scar<br />is he is able to overcome his his</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:22.630" style="s2">brother one you see this sort of thing<br />happening to people very frequently for</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:25.450" style="s2">example who developed post-traumatic<br />stress disorder</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:28.629" style="s2">and one of the things that&#39;s not as well<br />known about post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.629" end="00:02:33.819" style="s2">disorder as might be known is a it<br />happens to you if you encounter an</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.819" end="00:02:37.629" style="s2">experience that sort of blows out the<br />axioms of your knowledge system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.629" end="00:02:42.130" style="s2">one way of looking at it it&#39;s so<br />unexpected that you can&#39;t account for it</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.130" end="00:02:46.060" style="s2">within the confines of this of the<br />system that you&#39;re using to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.060" end="00:02:49.569" style="s2">the world that often happens to people<br />when they encounter something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.569" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">truly malevolent and that can be within<br />them or it can be in the form of someone</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.810" style="s2">else who is genuinely out to hurt them<br />they&#39;re often people who develop PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.810" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">are often but not always somewhat naive<br />and they&#39;re not aware of the full</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:10.090" style="s2">catastrophe of the world that might be<br />one way of looking at it and then they</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.090" end="00:03:16.390" style="s2">encounter someone who&#39;s truly out to<br />hurt them and they can detect that even</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.390" end="00:03:20.950" style="s2">in in the way the person&#39;s face looks or<br />they encounter a part of them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.950" end="00:03:25.540" style="s2">much more malevolent than they had ever<br />imagined it could possibly be and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.540" end="00:03:28.780" style="s2">they do something terrible and then they<br />don&#39;t know what to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.780" end="00:03:35.049" style="s2">so delay or the the Canadian General<br />wrote a book called shake hands with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.049" end="00:03:38.829" style="s2">devil and it was about what happened to<br />him in Rwanda when he was stationed</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.829" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">there as a UN warrior or a UN soldier<br />and I mean Dallaire was not naive but</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:51.100" style="s2">what he encountered was truly malevolent<br />and it just blew him into pieces and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.100" end="00:03:56.260" style="s2">that that&#39;s what happens and so there&#39;s<br />real utility and staying within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.260" end="00:04:00.609" style="s2">bounded domain but the problem is is<br />that there may be information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.609" end="00:04:04.329" style="s2">outside of that domain that you<br />absolutely need to know and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.329" end="00:04:09.700" style="s2">the problem with being alive is that you<br />have to continually determine how much</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.700" end="00:04:13.380" style="s2">you&#39;re going to maintain your stability<br />and how much you&#39;re going to explore and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.380" end="00:04:18.459" style="s2">you have to explore because the stable<br />part of you gets outdated but if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.459" end="00:04:24.789" style="s2">explore too much or too too unwisely<br />then you can encounter things that flip</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.789" end="00:04:28.060" style="s2">you upside down it&#39;s actually one of the<br />problems with being high and trade</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.060" end="00:04:31.660" style="s2">openness especially if you&#39;re also high<br />in neuroticism because if you&#39;re open</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.660" end="00:04:35.140" style="s2">you&#39;re creative you&#39;re always looking<br />for for ideas that are outside of your</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.140" end="00:04:39.249" style="s2">current systematic way of thinking but<br />if you&#39;re high in eroticism so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.249" end="00:04:42.339" style="s2">parents a lot of anxiety and emotional<br />pain and that sort of thing you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.339" end="00:04:46.539" style="s2">continually upset your own apple cart<br />now the other thing that you might want</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.539" end="00:04:49.869" style="s2">to think about this is really useful as<br />far as I&#39;m concerned is you might want</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.869" end="00:04:53.589" style="s2">to think about this politically and<br />we&#39;ve been doing a lot of work I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.589" end="00:04:55.779" style="s2">have one of my graduate students<br />actually come and talk to you about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.779" end="00:04:59.229" style="s2">work we&#39;ve been doing on personality and<br />Paul and political belief so what</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.229" end="00:05:02.979" style="s2">happens with political belief is that if<br />you&#39;re high in openness and low in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.979" end="00:05:06.129" style="s2">conscientiousness you tend to be a<br />liberal the openness being the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.129" end="00:05:09.519" style="s2">particularly important part of that and<br />if you&#39;re low in openness and high in</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.519" end="00:05:14.110" style="s2">conscientiousness especially orderliness<br />you tend to be a conservative now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.110" end="00:05:17.110" style="s2">kind of strange because openness and<br />conscientiousness aren&#39;t very highly</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.110" end="00:05:22.539" style="s2">correlated so it&#39;s not obvious why those<br />two traits would combine to determine</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.539" end="00:05:25.689" style="s2">political belief and and the<br />relationship is actually quite strong</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.689" end="00:05:28.329" style="s2">between temperament and political belief<br />if you measure political belief</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.329" end="00:05:33.009" style="s2">comprehensively but it seems to me that<br />the fundamental distinction and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.009" end="00:05:36.969" style="s2">the political game at least along the<br />liberal conservative axis this boils</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.969" end="00:05:41.709" style="s2">down to one thing it boils down to how<br />open borders should be compared to how</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.709" end="00:05:46.329" style="s2">close they should be and you know you<br />can see that reflected for example in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.329" end="00:05:50.349" style="s2">the attractiveness of Trump to a large<br />part of the general population because</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.349" end="00:05:55.329" style="s2">he&#39;s going to close the borders build a<br />wall and fortify the borders and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.329" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">conservatives like that they like to<br />have borders between things stay tight</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:04.149" style="s2">and they don&#39;t even care if it&#39;s state<br />borders or political borders or town</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.149" end="00:06:09.129" style="s2">borders or ethnic borders or borders<br />between ideas or borders between sexual</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.129" end="00:06:13.479" style="s2">identities conservatives like to have<br />things stay in the damn box where they</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.479" end="00:06:15.729" style="s2">belong<br />partly because they&#39;re orderly and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.729" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">partly because they&#39;re lone openness<br />they don&#39;t get any real they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:23.169" style="s2">interested in what happens if you free<br />up your conceptions all they see in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.169" end="00:06:28.239" style="s2">is the probability of disorder whereas<br />liberals who are high in openness and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.239" end="00:06:32.619" style="s2">low and conscientiousness slash<br />orderliness they get a real charge out</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.619" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">of letting things out of the box so that<br />they can creatively interplay now the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:42.489" style="s2">issue is who&#39;s correct and the answer is<br />you don&#39;t know because the environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.489" end="00:06:46.629" style="s2">underneath the political landscape moves<br />and so sometimes the right answer is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.629" end="00:06:50.649" style="s2">tighten up the borders and fortify and<br />sometimes the right answer is no no</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.649" end="00:06:53.169" style="s2">loosen things up because everything&#39;s<br />good</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.169" end="00:06:58.569" style="s2">to static and tight and we need more<br />information and the dialogue that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.569" end="00:07:02.340" style="s2">in the political landscape with this is<br />why dialogue is so important is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.340" end="00:07:07.270" style="s2">fundamentally between these two opposing<br />views of borders and because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.270" end="00:07:12.159" style="s2">say with certainty which one is right at<br />any given time an open dialogue has to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.159" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">maintain itself so that the entire<br />political State can maneuver properly</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:22.060" style="s2">along that moving line it&#39;s absolutely<br />crucial it&#39;s really really really useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.060" end="00:07:27.129" style="s2">to know that people vote their damn<br />temperament it gets you it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.129" end="00:07:30.610" style="s2">more of an understanding at least in<br />principle of your of those who sit on</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.610" end="00:07:34.599" style="s2">the other side of you on the political<br />fence and there&#39;s been recent newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.599" end="00:07:39.819" style="s2">articles quite interesting I tweeted a<br />couple of them about this company and UK</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.819" end="00:07:43.930" style="s2">called Cambridge analytics and they&#39;re<br />using the damn big five they can extract</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.930" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">out big five information from your<br />Facebook Likes they&#39;ve got a model of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:53.349" style="s2">every single person in the United States<br />big five personality and they help Trump</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.349" end="00:07:57.759" style="s2">craft political messages right down to<br />the level of apartment buildings to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.759" end="00:08:02.770" style="s2">appeal to people based on their Big Five<br />temperament and that&#39;s all recent work</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.770" end="00:08:06.580" style="s2">and so one of the things that&#39;s very<br />interesting is we are teaching computers</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:11.710" style="s2">to understand us so fast you can&#39;t<br />believe it and we really do risk walking</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.710" end="00:08:16.360" style="s2">into an electronic world where you will<br />only see what you want to see I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.360" end="00:08:19.719" style="s2">obviously the marketers are trying to do<br />that as fast as possible right they only</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.719" end="00:08:23.229" style="s2">want to send you ads that you&#39;re going<br />to be interested in because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.229" end="00:08:26.710" style="s2">expensive and foolish to send you<br />anything that will annoy you or that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.710" end="00:08:31.779" style="s2">you&#39;ll ignore and so the marketers are<br />trying like mad to map who you are even</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.779" end="00:08:35.890" style="s2">by watching your eyes they&#39;re trying to<br />figure out who you are so they can send</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.890" end="00:08:39.099" style="s2">you the right information but the danger<br />is that that will happen say in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.099" end="00:08:43.060" style="s2">domain of news and broader information<br />increasing this tendency for people to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.060" end="00:08:47.050" style="s2">be siloed in their exposure to the<br />external world it&#39;s a big sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.050" end="00:08:53.050" style="s2">each of us is becoming a micro celebrity<br />surrounded by electronic sycophants who</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.050" end="00:08:56.740" style="s2">do nothing but tell us exactly what we<br />want to hear it&#39;s a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.740" end="00:09:00.760" style="s2">Karl Popper a famous philosopher science<br />said that one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.760" end="00:09:04.990" style="s2">should do and this is akin to the PIA<br />jetty and view is you should always look</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.990" end="00:09:07.030" style="s2">for information that contradicts your<br />cur</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.030" end="00:09:10.450" style="s2">viewpoint now that&#39;s painful right<br />because who wants their axioms</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.450" end="00:09:14.890" style="s2">contradicted it can take you apart but<br />it&#39;s the only way that you can ensure</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.890" end="00:09:18.190" style="s2">that you&#39;re learning at the same time<br />that you&#39;re maintaining your stability</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.190" end="00:09:22.210" style="s2">and that&#39;s another reason why it&#39;s<br />really necessary to engage in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.210" end="00:09:25.690" style="s2">with people that you do not agree with<br />because they&#39;re the ones who will tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.690" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">you things that you don&#39;t know it&#39;s crew<br />it&#39;s crucial importance in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:32.770" style="s2">maintenance of your own stability the<br />worst thing that can happen to a person</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.770" end="00:09:36.340" style="s2">know because there&#39;s many horrible<br />things that can happen to a person but</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.340" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">one of the worst things that can happen<br />is that you find yourself in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:44.710" style="s2">where no one is offering you corrective<br />feedback anymore because you rely on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.710" end="00:09:48.760" style="s2">corrective feedback provided by other<br />people to keep yourself sane to keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.760" end="00:09:52.450" style="s2">moving in the ever-changing environment<br />and if you cut yourself off from that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.450" end="00:09:58.330" style="s2">feedback then well then you end up<br />static and shrinking it&#39;s really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.330" end="00:10:01.390" style="s2">really not good you get less and less<br />competent you get less and less</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.390" end="00:10:06.040" style="s2">confident and the threats outside of you<br />loom larger and larger so that&#39;s all to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.040" end="00:10:13.300" style="s2">do with the you know the domain outside<br />the light see young would also say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.300" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">out in this domain that sort of beyond<br />what you understand that&#39;s also where</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.310" style="s2">you encounter the archetypes of the<br />collective unconscious now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.310" end="00:10:25.930" style="s2">really really complicated idea but what<br />he means by that is that if you&#39;re put</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.930" end="00:10:31.150" style="s2">outside the domain of your competence<br />you&#39;re going to start to use fantasy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.150" end="00:10:36.550" style="s2">organize your world so I can give you an<br />example of that so you you I presume</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.550" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">most of you are old enough to have a<br />conscious memory of when the Twin Towers</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:45.130" style="s2">came crashing down and so everybody in<br />the days after that was wandering around</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.130" end="00:10:48.310" style="s2">like they were in the days and the<br />reason they were in the days is because</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.310" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">well it wasn&#39;t exactly clear what fell<br />right there was the physical towers fell</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:10:57.190" style="s2">but that was only a tiny bit of the<br />problem because those physical towers</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.190" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">were embedded in a network of meaning<br />like a very very sophisticated network</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.000" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">of meaning but also a political network<br />and an economic network and a military</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:09.130" style="s2">network and like they&#39;re they&#39;re nodes<br />inside a very complex system and so when</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.130" end="00:11:13.630" style="s2">they come crashing down you don&#39;t know<br />what&#39;s come crashing down right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.630" end="00:11:16.990" style="s2">you&#39;re out there in the unknown and and<br />wondering what&#39;s going on and wandering</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.990" end="00:11:20.590" style="s2">around in the days which is exactly what<br />happened to people and then what bush</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.590" end="00:11:23.380" style="s2">did<br />George W was immediately turned that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.380" end="00:11:28.420" style="s2">into a good versus evil drama instantly<br />and that&#39;s an archetypal idea so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.420" end="00:11:33.010" style="s2">when he came up with the idea of the<br />axis of evil I think that was Iran North</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.010" end="00:11:38.080" style="s2">Korea and I don&#39;t remember the other one<br />at the moment but but he yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.080" end="00:11:41.230" style="s2">immediately turned the political<br />landscape into a good versus evil drama</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.230" end="00:11:44.230" style="s2">and he said to everyone in the world<br />that they were either with him or</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.230" end="00:11:49.270" style="s2">against him fundamentally and that was<br />the that was part of the retreating into</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.270" end="00:11:53.740" style="s2">a I guess a more protected landscape<br />that&#39;s one of the ways that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.740" end="00:11:58.570" style="s2">deal with the encounter with a traumatic<br />threat and so the reason you meet the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.570" end="00:12:02.830" style="s2">unconscious and even the collective<br />unconscious on the border of your</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.830" end="00:12:06.670" style="s2">knowledge is because when you hit the<br />border of your knowledge you start to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.670" end="00:12:12.400" style="s2">use fantasy in order to bring the the<br />newest form of order out of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.400" end="00:12:16.410" style="s2">so that you can start to make sense out<br />of it and that&#39;s what artists always do</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.410" end="00:12:20.830" style="s2">that&#39;s what they do and so from the<br />Union perspective people who are engaged</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.830" end="00:12:24.640" style="s2">in creative art are the ones who are on<br />the perimeter of knowledge structures</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.640" end="00:12:28.710" style="s2">and so what they&#39;re doing is taking the<br />absolute unknown which would be in</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.710" end="00:12:34.060" style="s2">Rumsfeld terms they&#39;re unknown unknowns<br />and turning them into partially known</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.060" end="00:12:39.190" style="s2">unknowns that&#39;s what an artist does and<br />and especially the more classical</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.190" end="00:12:42.490" style="s2">artists who deal with mythological and<br />religious themes which was the case for</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.490" end="00:12:45.820" style="s2">art right up until really until the late<br />20th century</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.820" end="00:12:50.470" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re using these mythological<br />ideas to sort of extend the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.470" end="00:12:55.800" style="s2">human knowledge out beyond its current<br />parameters and so artists do that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.800" end="00:13:01.150" style="s2">literary people do that and and<br />dramatists do that and they help us</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.150" end="00:13:05.470" style="s2">extend our knowledge now that&#39;s where<br />open people live that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.470" end="00:13:08.410" style="s2">thinking about so think about it this<br />way so you&#39;re in a city you know what</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.410" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">and the city has parts of it that<br />degenerate and so you could think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">that as order degenerating into chaos<br />and then the open people who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:20.380" style="s2">creative come along and they find places<br />in the city that have degenerated but</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.380" end="00:13:24.550" style="s2">that still have interesting potential<br />right and then they move in there where</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.550" end="00:13:28.510" style="s2">it&#39;s cheap to and they start producing<br />art they start producing galleries and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.510" end="00:13:31.900" style="s2">then the coffee shops move in and then<br />the thing starts to get civilized and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.900" end="00:13:36.490" style="s2">then of course the more<br />all conservative types move in those</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.490" end="00:13:40.390" style="s2">would be the yuppies roughly speaking so<br />they&#39;re they&#39;re much more conservative</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.390" end="00:13:43.930" style="s2">than the artists but they&#39;re still<br />liberal compared to the bulk of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.930" end="00:13:48.460" style="s2">population and so the more daring people<br />move in after the artists have civilized</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.460" end="00:13:52.270" style="s2">it and then after that you know then the<br />chain stores start to move in and soon</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.270" end="00:13:56.380" style="s2">it&#39;s completely turned into Zellers or<br />something like that and then the artists</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.380" end="00:14:00.370" style="s2">have to go somewhere else and find<br />another place on the boundary where they</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.370" end="00:14:05.230" style="s2">can live and it&#39;s a fizzy elizacass much<br />as a mental boundary and so you because</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.230" end="00:14:09.220" style="s2">you think each of those personality<br />traits there&#39;s five dimensions each of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.220" end="00:14:13.480" style="s2">them represent the possibility of<br />inhabiting a kind of niche right an</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.480" end="00:14:17.770" style="s2">ecological niche so if you&#39;re an<br />extroverted person your niche is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.770" end="00:14:21.370" style="s2">social environment if you&#39;re an<br />introverted person the niches I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.370" end="00:14:24.820" style="s2">nature I don&#39;t know that for sure<br />because I&#39;ve never figured out exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.820" end="00:14:29.770" style="s2">what introverts are adapted to but it&#39;s<br />not exactly the social world if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.770" end="00:14:33.790" style="s2">agreeable then your niches relationships<br />if you&#39;re disagreeable your niches</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.790" end="00:14:39.490" style="s2">competition if you&#39;re conscientious your<br />niche is duty and effort and so and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.490" end="00:14:44.230" style="s2">that those niches are partly social<br />because so much of our environment is</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.230" end="00:14:48.370" style="s2">social but they&#39;re also partly natural<br />because our social being is nested</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.370" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">inside the natural world and so you can<br />think about the big five traits as</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.900" style="s2">different kinds of adaptations to<br />different kinds of niches and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.900" end="00:15:02.890" style="s2">niche that the open people the open<br />exploratory types occupy so that seems</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.890" end="00:15:06.250" style="s2">to make a higher-order super factor<br />extraversion and openness called</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.250" end="00:15:10.630" style="s2">plasticity as opposed to stability which<br />is conscientiousness agreeableness and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.630" end="00:15:14.740" style="s2">emotional stability and there&#39;s a play<br />off between those two things because the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.740" end="00:15:20.050" style="s2">stable people obviously are stable but<br />the plastic types of people are more</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.050" end="00:15:23.380" style="s2">dynamic and they&#39;re they&#39;re more<br />concerned with transformation and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.380" end="00:15:28.780" style="s2">order to get a system optimally stable<br />and dynamic you have to have a continual</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.780" end="00:15:32.890" style="s2">interplay of those of those factors<br />because static doesn&#39;t work because</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.890" end="00:15:36.940" style="s2">everything changes that&#39;s the problem<br />with conservatism and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.940" end="00:15:40.839" style="s2">liberalism fundamentally is yes<br />everything changes but you have to bring</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.839" end="00:15:45.610" style="s2">forward some structures from the past so<br />it&#39;s very it&#39;s very very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.610" end="00:15:51.790" style="s2">get that balance correct so<br />all right so anyways out there in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.790" end="00:15:56.380" style="s2">underworld in the place beyond your<br />current conceptualizations that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.380" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">place of death and nature and it&#39;s<br />beyond the light and it&#39;s also the place</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:04.450" style="s2">of Hell and that&#39;s what you see here and<br />what do you how do you conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.450" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">that well one of the things you&#39;ll see<br />if you&#39;re interested in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.470" end="00:16:13.420" style="s2">thing if you ever go read the writings<br />of the Columbine killers the teens</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.420" end="00:16:17.769" style="s2">they&#39;re very interesting they&#39;re very<br />much worth reading especially I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.769" end="00:16:21.430" style="s2">it&#39;s Dylan Klebold who was the more<br />literate of the two but he tells you</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.430" end="00:16:26.829" style="s2">exactly where he went after brooding and<br />brooding and brooding on his his</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.829" end="00:16:31.959" style="s2">isolation and segregation from mankind<br />so he&#39;s out there beyond he&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.959" end="00:16:35.860" style="s2">in a chaotic domain and because he&#39;s<br />tortured by that his thoughts take an</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.860" end="00:16:41.079" style="s2">unbelievably dark turn like it&#39;s<br />unimaginably dark if you&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.079" end="00:16:43.510" style="s2">in that sort of thing you could read<br />that there&#39;s another book you could read</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.510" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">called panzram PA and Zed ra m and it&#39;s<br />a fascinating book it&#39;s about this guy</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:54.310" style="s2">who I think he raped 1200 men so that<br />sort of tells you what sort of guy he</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.310" end="00:16:59.500" style="s2">was extraordinarily physically powerful<br />and brutal and malevolent and he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.500" end="00:17:03.250" style="s2">kind of a juvenile delinquent type and<br />they put him in a reform school and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.250" end="00:17:07.179" style="s2">was not well treated in that reform<br />school it&#39;s sort of like the worst of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.179" end="00:17:11.770" style="s2">the Canadian residential schools and<br />when he came out he was not a happy boy</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.770" end="00:17:16.510" style="s2">and so he spent the rest of his life<br />trying to be as destructive as he could</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.510" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">possibly imagine and purely consciously<br />with malevolent intent and then and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:26.589" style="s2">believe me he was pretty destructive he<br />kept track of the dollar value of all</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.589" end="00:17:29.620" style="s2">the buildings he burned down he tried to<br />start a war between Britain and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.620" end="00:17:35.050" style="s2">United States like he was all out for<br />all-out mayhem his dying words they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.050" end="00:17:39.970" style="s2">gonna hang him he told the guy who was<br />going to hang him he said hurry up you</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.970" end="00:17:43.720" style="s2">who&#39;s your bastard I could kill 12 men<br />in the time it takes you to hang me and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.720" end="00:17:48.220" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the sort of person he was<br />and he made friends with this physician</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.220" end="00:17:52.750" style="s2">in the in the prison who he thought was<br />like the first person who ever did</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.750" end="00:17:56.140" style="s2">something nice for him gave him a dollar<br />for cigarettes if I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.140" end="00:18:00.040" style="s2">and the physician encouraged him to<br />write his autobiography and so he did</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.040" end="00:18:05.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s available and so if you<br />want a view because you know you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.080" end="00:18:08.830" style="s2">always think of people you think well<br />people have good intentions you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.830" end="00:18:12.970" style="s2">that you especially think that if you&#39;re<br />naive and agreeable so all of you who</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.970" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">are sitting there out there thinking<br />people have good intentions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.940" end="00:18:19.260" style="s2">probably high in agreeableness but<br />that&#39;s not always the case</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.260" end="00:18:25.030" style="s2">people can have very dark motivations<br />that are fully conscious and very well</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.030" end="00:18:30.130" style="s2">elaborated and panzram was know he was<br />smart and his book is very well written</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.130" end="00:18:34.300" style="s2">and he tells you exactly why he thought<br />the way he thought and so it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.300" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">glimpse of exactly this sort of thing<br />where you can get to if you want to by</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:43.180" style="s2">brooding on your specific misfortune you<br />know and his his basic credo was that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.180" end="00:18:46.180" style="s2">human beings were so reprehensible that<br />they should just be eliminated and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.180" end="00:18:50.500" style="s2">believe me that&#39;s what he was trying to<br />do and these people who do terrible</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.500" end="00:18:54.370" style="s2">things like the Columbine shooters<br />that&#39;s exactly what for black of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.370" end="00:18:58.870" style="s2">better word they&#39;re possessed by its<br />sheer malevolence and the Columbine kids</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.870" end="00:19:02.530" style="s2">had a much more spectacular catastrophe<br />planned than the one that actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.530" end="00:19:07.060" style="s2">occurred and they knew it was going to<br />be a full-blown media circus and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.060" end="00:19:11.020" style="s2">these people who engage in those sorts<br />of mass murders they know about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.020" end="00:19:14.770" style="s2">other mass murders and they&#39;re engaged<br />in a competition and the competition is</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.770" end="00:19:19.090" style="s2">who can do the most brutal thing the<br />fastest something like that so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.090" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">just be thinking about people who&#39;ve you<br />know who have good intentions but have</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">somehow gone wrong if you ever meet<br />someone who isn&#39;t like that and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:32.530" style="s2">think that you&#39;re just a tree with ripe<br />fruit to be plucked so you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.530" end="00:19:36.610" style="s2">be in that situation you have to keep<br />your eyes open and so anyways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.610" end="00:19:40.180" style="s2">basically what&#39;s encapsulated in this<br />part of the story now the hyenas go</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.180" end="00:19:44.380" style="s2">after the little lion obviously but they<br />managed to escape</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.890" end="00:19:56.140" style="s2">them so and you know that there&#39;s also a<br />mythological trope there which is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.140" end="00:19:59.860" style="s2">if you go outside your domain of<br />confidence and you encounter something</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.860" end="00:20:03.130" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand the first thing<br />that you&#39;re going to do is look to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.130" end="00:20:06.820" style="s2">knowledge structures that you already<br />possess to explain it right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.820" end="00:20:10.030" style="s2">the you could say from a symbolic<br />perspective that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.030" end="00:20:14.560" style="s2">manifestation of the father as of course<br />that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to do and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.560" end="00:20:17.619" style="s2">you know what&#39;s really interesting<br />- is because I&#39;ve had a lot of clients</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.619" end="00:20:21.909" style="s2">who&#39;ve had PTSD and and without<br />exception every single one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.909" end="00:20:25.989" style="s2">induced by one form of malevolence or<br />another they have to develop a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.989" end="00:20:29.950" style="s2">sophisticated philosophy of good and<br />evil to get out of it because they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.950" end="00:20:33.279" style="s2">a worldview in which those things don&#39;t<br />really exist there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.279" end="00:20:37.899" style="s2">pure malevolence well that&#39;s fine unless<br />you encounter it and then as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.899" end="00:20:42.849" style="s2">encounter it as soon as you encounter it<br />you won&#39;t know what to do and then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.849" end="00:20:46.749" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to get on with your life<br />you&#39;ll do nothing but think about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.749" end="00:20:49.589" style="s2">and think about it and think about it<br />and think about it&#39;ll disrupt your sleep</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.589" end="00:20:54.549" style="s2">it&#39;ll put you into a permanent state of<br />preparation for action because the part</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.549" end="00:20:58.299" style="s2">of your brain that&#39;s detected that which<br />in my estimation by the way is the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.299" end="00:21:03.070" style="s2">part at least in part that detects<br />snakes it&#39;s the same damn circuit once</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.070" end="00:21:06.579" style="s2">it&#39;s seen something like that it is not<br />gonna let you go till you figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.579" end="00:21:10.809" style="s2">and that&#39;s basically what post-traumatic<br />stress disorder is and you know to some</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.809" end="00:21:15.489" style="s2">degree each of you will have experienced<br />that maybe not all of you in here but</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.489" end="00:21:19.570" style="s2">many of you and you can tell that so if<br />you go back and you think about your</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.570" end="00:21:24.369" style="s2">past and you have any memory that&#39;s more<br />than about eighteen months old and when</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.369" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">you think about it it produces a fair<br />bit of negative emotion then that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:32.979" style="s2">a minute that&#39;s like a place where<br />there&#39;s a mini post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.979" end="00:21:37.329" style="s2">problem and what&#39;s happened you remember<br />I showed you that hierarchy moving from</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.329" end="00:21:41.289" style="s2">tiny motor actions all the way up to<br />high order abstractions well you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.289" end="00:21:45.959" style="s2">imagine say you have good person at the<br />top and and you you kind of use that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.959" end="00:21:51.489" style="s2">that scenario to construe other people<br />people are basically good well then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.489" end="00:21:55.839" style="s2">run into someone who is not good and<br />boom the whole bloody system comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.839" end="00:21:58.989" style="s2">tumbling down because it&#39;s violated that<br />highest order axiom</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.989" end="00:22:03.219" style="s2">so that&#39;s post-traumatic stress disorder<br />if something has violated an axiom</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.219" end="00:22:07.599" style="s2">that&#39;s more differentiated you know<br />closer to the actual motor output not</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.599" end="00:22:11.739" style="s2">quite so high in the abstraction chain<br />then all it does is wipe out that part</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.739" end="00:22:15.070" style="s2">of the structure it doesn&#39;t wipe out the<br />whole thing and you can tell if you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.070" end="00:22:21.579" style="s2">holes in your perceptual value structure<br />by checking to see if you have memories</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.579" end="00:22:25.719" style="s2">that are still alive in a negative way<br />that are old enough so that they should</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.719" end="00:22:29.289" style="s2">have been incorporated into your<br />personality and so one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.289" end="00:22:33.429" style="s2">can do<br />you&#39;re doing one of the exercises that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.429" end="00:22:37.419" style="s2">on myself authoring site you guys do the<br />personality analysis but there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.419" end="00:22:41.289" style="s2">program there called the that&#39;s called<br />the past authoring where you write down</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.289" end="00:22:46.269" style="s2">an autobiography and thinking through<br />these things that have happened to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.269" end="00:22:50.289" style="s2">in your past that are negative is a good<br />way of making them go away and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.289" end="00:22:55.389" style="s2">them through kind of means you have to<br />figure out what happened right and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.389" end="00:22:58.419" style="s2">you sort of have to figure out how to<br />make it not happen again what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.419" end="00:23:03.009" style="s2">trying to derive is some kind of causal<br />analysis how is it that I was put into a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.009" end="00:23:07.269" style="s2">situation where I was made vulnerable<br />you know and that could be well because</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.269" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">you&#39;re only four and you couldn&#39;t<br />protect yourself and now it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:14.169" style="s2">update that because you&#39;re a fully<br />functioning adult or there may be things</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.169" end="00:23:17.379" style="s2">that you have to think through and<br />change in your own personality or</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.379" end="00:23:21.730" style="s2">attitudes that you&#39;ve been holding on to<br />since you were tiny I have this client</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.730" end="00:23:27.309" style="s2">once and she came in and told me that<br />she had been sexually assaulted by her</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.309" end="00:23:31.149" style="s2">older brother and she told me the story<br />and I kind of got the impression that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.149" end="00:23:35.470" style="s2">maybe she was like eight and he was like<br />17 or something like that and she was</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.470" end="00:23:39.070" style="s2">about 27 when she came and talked to me<br />and then I found out by further</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.070" end="00:23:44.620" style="s2">questioning that she was 4 and he was 6<br />and I thought she still had this story</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.620" end="00:23:48.879" style="s2">in her head of her being tormented by<br />this older person right that&#39;s how she</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.879" end="00:23:53.230" style="s2">told the story and what I told her was<br />well look another way of looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.230" end="00:23:57.879" style="s2">is that you two were very badly<br />supervised children because I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.879" end="00:24:01.480" style="s2">was 6 for God&#39;s sake you know he&#39;s a<br />little kid that doesn&#39;t mean that what</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.480" end="00:24:07.330" style="s2">happened to her was any less traumatic<br />but but he wasn&#39;t 17 right if the story</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.330" end="00:24:11.259" style="s2">was different than the one she had in<br />her head and you know by the time she</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.259" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">left after we had that conversation it<br />was clear that the way that she was</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:18.429" style="s2">construing the experience had radically<br />shifted and it was very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.429" end="00:24:23.289" style="s2">because you know you think of the past<br />as fixed but and it is in some sense but</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.289" end="00:24:28.059" style="s2">the reason you remember the past isn&#39;t<br />to make an objectively accurate record</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.059" end="00:24:32.980" style="s2">of the past it&#39;s so that you can use the<br />information in the past to prepare you</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.980" end="00:24:37.419" style="s2">for the future and your mind won&#39;t leave<br />you alone unless that has happened so if</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.419" end="00:24:41.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve encountered something that&#39;s<br />negative and you don&#39;t know why and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.500" end="00:24:43.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do about it if that<br />have</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.660" end="00:24:47.770" style="s2">again in the future then that will stay<br />with you and I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.770" end="00:24:51.850" style="s2">that does too is it increases your<br />overall physiological load is actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.850" end="00:24:56.230" style="s2">physiologists who&#39;ve been talking about<br />this I can&#39;t remember the damn phrase</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.230" end="00:24:59.320" style="s2">but you could imagine that your mind is<br />doing something like this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.320" end="00:25:04.990" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s got a record in some<br />sense of your autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.990" end="00:25:09.100" style="s2">experiences and what it&#39;s doing is<br />calculating how frequently you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.100" end="00:25:13.330" style="s2">successful versus unsuccessful and the<br />more frequently that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.330" end="00:25:16.990" style="s2">successful the higher you are up on the<br />dominance hierarchy that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.990" end="00:25:22.120" style="s2">possibility so your serotonin levels go<br />up and you&#39;re calmer but also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.120" end="00:25:25.330" style="s2">reasonable to assume that the<br />environment is less dangerous right</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.330" end="00:25:30.250" style="s2">because that&#39;s sort of what constitutes<br />danger you&#39;re somewhere in and you act</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.250" end="00:25:34.630" style="s2">and and something you don&#39;t want to have<br />happen happens that&#39;s danger and so your</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.630" end="00:25:37.870" style="s2">brain is always trying to figure out how<br />to calibrate how anxious you should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.870" end="00:25:41.290" style="s2">and one of the things that does is by<br />sort of keeping track of your past</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.290" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">success failure ratio and so to the<br />degree that your past has been</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:51.040" style="s2">characterized by will call them failures<br />that those are situations where you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.040" end="00:25:55.780" style="s2">not get what you want then your your<br />body your brain puts your body on</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.780" end="00:25:59.830" style="s2">constant alert because if everything<br />that you&#39;ve done has resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.830" end="00:26:02.530" style="s2">catastrophe<br />then you&#39;re somewhere insanely dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.530" end="00:26:07.330" style="s2">and you should be like like a you know<br />like a prey animal that&#39;s ready to dart</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.330" end="00:26:12.730" style="s2">in any direction and how much you should<br />be a prey animal is dependent on it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.730" end="00:26:18.250" style="s2">estimate partly your trait neuroticism<br />partly your your success as adjudicated</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.250" end="00:26:22.390" style="s2">by other people right because they&#39;ll<br />pop you up the doorman its hierarchy if</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.390" end="00:26:26.380" style="s2">you&#39;ve been successful but also partly<br />on your record of failures and successes</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.380" end="00:26:31.090" style="s2">in the past and so you can go back and<br />you can find out where you have holes in</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.090" end="00:26:34.810" style="s2">your in the structure through which<br />you&#39;re viewing the world that&#39;s one way</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.810" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">of looking at it and you can sew those<br />things up and that&#39;s a very that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:42.160" style="s2">some sense that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing in<br />psychotherapy you know partly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.160" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">exposure to things you&#39;re afraid of and<br />disgusted by and are likely to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:50.380" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge chunk of it but if you go<br />back into your past and you start</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.380" end="00:26:55.210" style="s2">talking those things through it&#39;s really<br />the same thing it&#39;s more abstracted so</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.210" end="00:27:00.340" style="s2">Freud of course was always when<br />he was doing his free association</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.340" end="00:27:05.420" style="s2">process with his clients he&#39;d find that<br />if he just let them talk that their</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.420" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">speech would circle until it hit a place<br />like that where they were confused and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:14.360" style="s2">doubtful and then their speech would<br />sort of wander around that and and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.360" end="00:27:17.930" style="s2">they&#39;d have an emotional expression that<br />was a consequence of that he thought the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.930" end="00:27:21.830" style="s2">emotional expression was what was<br />curative it was cathartic in his terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.830" end="00:27:27.860" style="s2">but later James Pennebaker upon whom<br />these writing exercises I described his</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.860" end="00:27:33.530" style="s2">research it is based on that my read my<br />exercises are based on his research he</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.530" end="00:27:37.400" style="s2">found that if you brought college<br />students into the to the lab and you had</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.400" end="00:27:41.960" style="s2">them write for 15 minutes three times<br />over three days about the worst thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.960" end="00:27:45.230" style="s2">that had ever happened to them or the<br />worst thing they ever did if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.230" end="00:27:49.040" style="s2">correctly they got worse in the short<br />term but better in the long run for</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.040" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">example they went visited the doctor<br />less and markers of their physical</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:58.010" style="s2">health improved and so I think the<br />reason for that is because what does</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.010" end="00:28:02.360" style="s2">that called is called something load<br />just about it got it right from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.360" end="00:28:07.430" style="s2">physiologist it doesn&#39;t matter<br />they got healthier as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.430" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">because they basically calmed down once<br />they had gone through the negative</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:16.550" style="s2">memory and sorted it out properly and<br />told a properly articulated story and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.550" end="00:28:23.330" style="s2">figured out how to deal with it then<br />their physiology calmed down and so then</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.330" end="00:28:26.900" style="s2">they weren&#39;t as stressed they weren&#39;t<br />producing as much cortisol and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.900" end="00:28:30.290" style="s2">cortisol suppresses your immune function<br />and so they were more likely to stay</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.290" end="00:28:36.110" style="s2">healthy and so well so that&#39;s all very<br />much we&#39;re thinking about that&#39;s all in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.110" end="00:28:39.740" style="s2">the domain outside of the light that&#39;s<br />one way of thinking about it now of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.740" end="00:28:43.490" style="s2">course Simba and his and what&#39;s the<br />girl&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.490" end="00:28:48.380" style="s2">mala yeah they&#39;re you know pretty cowed<br />about what has happened because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.380" end="00:28:53.450" style="s2">sort of stumbled stupidly out into the<br />unknown they stumbled foolishly out into</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.450" end="00:28:57.710" style="s2">the unknown and this actually highlights<br />another union archetype and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.710" end="00:29:01.070" style="s2">archetype of the trickster and the<br />trickster is like the Joker in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.070" end="00:29:05.630" style="s2">king&#39;s court and the trickster is<br />someone who will be or play the fool and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.630" end="00:29:09.410" style="s2">the thing about the fool is that the<br />fool is close to the truth because you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.410" end="00:29:11.480" style="s2">can&#39;t learn anything new unless you&#39;re<br />willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.480" end="00:29:15.950" style="s2">fool right you know what that&#39;s like you<br />you know exactly what that&#39;s like your</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.950" end="00:29:19.850" style="s2">chart you have to master a new skill but<br />you&#39;re avoiding it because you know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.850" end="00:29:23.330" style="s2">you&#39;ll be bad at it when you first do it<br />and if you&#39;re perfectionistic you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.330" end="00:29:27.260" style="s2">gonna say well I can&#39;t allow myself to<br />be bad at anything I can&#39;t allow myself</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.260" end="00:29:31.370" style="s2">to be a fool and no wonder but the<br />problem is is when you try something new</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.370" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">you&#39;re always a fool and so unless<br />you&#39;re willing to be a fool you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:38.600" style="s2">learn anything new and that&#39;s also why<br />you can regarded the trickster as the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.600" end="00:29:42.770" style="s2">precursor to the Savior architect Lee<br />speaking is because you cannot do the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.770" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">right thing unless you&#39;re willing to be<br />a fool first and that&#39;s really worth</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:51.320" style="s2">knowing lots of times you guys are gonna<br />make a stage transition in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.320" end="00:29:54.770" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna feel like an imposter when<br />you get a new job or when you get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.770" end="00:29:58.430" style="s2">promotion or something like that you&#39;re<br />gonna feel like an imposter and you are</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.430" end="00:30:03.050" style="s2">because what do you know when you make<br />that first transition right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.050" end="00:30:06.800" style="s2">gonna make you embarrassed and it&#39;s<br />gonna make you ashamed and all of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.800" end="00:30:10.340" style="s2">things but you have to understand that<br />you are a fool when you first try</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.340" end="00:30:14.540" style="s2">something new but you&#39;re a worse fool if<br />you don&#39;t try it now that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.540" end="00:30:18.260" style="s2">you should you know make like you know<br />everything as soon as you&#39;re promoted or</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.260" end="00:30:23.330" style="s2">you have some transition in status<br />that&#39;s that&#39;s foolish of the wrong sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.330" end="00:30:29.420" style="s2">but to know that to know that you have<br />to be fallible in order to progress is</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.420" end="00:30:33.650" style="s2">an unbelievably useful thing it can free<br />you up you know what I was talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.650" end="00:30:37.820" style="s2">writer the other day about his process<br />for beginning writing he&#39;s written many</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.820" end="00:30:43.430" style="s2">books he writes a very very very bad<br />first draft right and that&#39;s a good way</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.430" end="00:30:46.250" style="s2">to think about things is throughout your<br />life you&#39;re gonna be doing that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.250" end="00:30:52.070" style="s2">writing the next draft of you and it&#39;s<br />pretty bad to begin with but that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.070" end="00:30:55.880" style="s2">because it isn&#39;t gonna get any better<br />unless you put yourself out into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.880" end="00:30:59.630" style="s2">domain of the unknown to begin with and<br />you know you might you might it might go</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.630" end="00:31:03.460" style="s2">badly I mean that&#39;s what happens here</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.780" end="00:31:10.850" style="s2">anyways Mufasa has a chat with Simba and<br />you know tells him that he&#39;s he did what</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.850" end="00:31:16.600" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t supposed to do although you<br />know even in that situation with fauces</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.600" end="00:31:21.410" style="s2">discipline is paradoxical because<br />there&#39;s part of him because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.410" end="00:31:24.500" style="s2">reasonably wise that knows that breaking<br />the rules like that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.500" end="00:31:27.350" style="s2">necessary<br />even though you still have to say play</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.350" end="00:31:30.919" style="s2">by the damn rules you know you have to<br />leave that door open so that the rules</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.919" end="00:31:35.870" style="s2">can be broken an appropriate amount so<br />he forgives him and and and peace is</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.870" end="00:31:41.330" style="s2">made between them and then they&#39;re there<br />they involve themselves in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.330" end="00:31:45.049" style="s2">gazing at the night sky and so the two<br />of them do that together and the night</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.049" end="00:31:48.409" style="s2">sky is an interesting place you know<br />because that&#39;s where the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.409" end="00:31:53.960" style="s2">unknown resides and one of the things<br />young wrote a lot about was astrology</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.960" end="00:31:58.759" style="s2">strangely enough slash astronomy and one<br />of young contentions this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.759" end="00:32:02.870" style="s2">interesting one was that because the<br />night sky was completely unknown people</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.870" end="00:32:06.549" style="s2">could project their fantasies into it<br />and that&#39;s what they did without with</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.549" end="00:32:11.629" style="s2">astrology so astrology is this<br />cumulative fantasy that&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.629" end="00:32:16.100" style="s2">the in that roughly speaking in the deep<br />unconscious projected on to the sky and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.100" end="00:32:20.690" style="s2">so if you analyze old astrological<br />writings what you&#39;re really doing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.690" end="00:32:24.440" style="s2">analyzing old fantasies and because of<br />that you could develop some insight into</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.440" end="00:32:28.610" style="s2">the structure of the mind and so he did<br />the same thing with alchemy and his</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.610" end="00:32:32.090" style="s2">later writings which are very very<br />difficult to understand but extremely</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.090" end="00:32:37.669" style="s2">worthwhile ok so anyways back to the to<br />the hellish domain now I told you that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.669" end="00:32:40.970" style="s2">that domain that&#39;s outside of knowledge<br />you could think about that as the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.970" end="00:32:44.360" style="s2">underworld or you can think about it as<br />nature the negative element of nature in</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.360" end="00:32:48.860" style="s2">particular and so I mentioned that one<br />element of that is hellish and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.860" end="00:32:53.450" style="s2">exactly what the movie explains next it<br />does exactly that we go back out to this</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.450" end="00:32:58.399" style="s2">domain that scar the adversary or the<br />negative king that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.399" end="00:33:05.480" style="s2">looking at him this is his his the<br />domain over which he rules and so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.480" end="00:33:09.590" style="s2">can see him there surrounded in fire<br />same ideas the you know as the hyenas</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.590" end="00:33:13.070" style="s2">surrounded by fire earlier although this<br />is green fire and smoke which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.070" end="00:33:19.419" style="s2">even worse and this is where the movie<br />starts to draw on essentially Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.419" end="00:33:24.110" style="s2">symbolism at least the symbolism of<br />totalitarian states and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.110" end="00:33:27.470" style="s2">think about you think about a<br />totalitarian state you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.470" end="00:33:30.980" style="s2">Nazis and they&#39;re goose-stepping<br />what&#39;s happening is that every single</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.980" end="00:33:35.389" style="s2">person in the military becomes an<br />identical unit right a unit they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.389" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">uniform and they&#39;re all in some sense<br />imitating</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:44.779" style="s2">The Dictator in in an absolutely perfect<br />way and so the dictator wants to impose</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.779" end="00:33:50.570" style="s2">strict uniformity on the entire<br />population that&#39;s order order and one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.570" end="00:33:56.179" style="s2">the things we&#39;ve discovered that&#39;s<br />really interesting is that discussed</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.179" end="00:34:00.710" style="s2">sensitivity is associated with<br />orderliness and that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.710" end="00:34:03.799" style="s2">conscientiousness and one of the things<br />about Hitler was that he was very</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.799" end="00:34:09.020" style="s2">disgust sensitive and a lot of his<br />hatred for non-aryans so imagine inside</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.020" end="00:34:13.099" style="s2">the aryan box it was all uniform outside<br />it was all parasites and predators and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.099" end="00:34:17.899" style="s2">so and that was a manifestation of<br />disgust not of fear it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.899" end="00:34:20.990" style="s2">different thing<br />and if you read Hitler&#39;s table talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.990" end="00:34:26.569" style="s2">which is a collection of his spontaneous<br />dinner speeches from 1939 to 1940 - it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.569" end="00:34:32.389" style="s2">a very interesting book you see that his<br />metaphor for the Aryan race was a body a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.389" end="00:34:36.139" style="s2">pure body<br />unof salted by parasites or predators</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.139" end="00:34:40.099" style="s2">and that he was trying to erect a border<br />around it to keep all of that away</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.099" end="00:34:45.260" style="s2">so it&#39;s an immunological disgust like<br />metaphor and there&#39;s some recent work</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.260" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">that was published in PLoS ONE about<br />three years ago showing that brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:52.909" style="s2">study should have got much more<br />attention showing that if you went</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.909" end="00:34:57.349" style="s2">around and looked and sampled political<br />attitudes in different countries or even</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.349" end="00:35:02.150" style="s2">within the same country what you found<br />was that the higher the prevalence of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.150" end="00:35:06.770" style="s2">infectious diseases the higher the<br />probability of totalitarian political</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.770" end="00:35:11.180" style="s2">attitudes at the local level and you can<br />imagine well what happens if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.180" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">infectious diseases is you want to put<br />borders around everything you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:18.109" style="s2">free movement between ideas or people<br />because that&#39;s partly how the disease</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.109" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">spreads you&#39;re going to have much more<br />strict sexual rules for example because</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:27.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a great way for diseases to be<br />transmitted and before Hitler went on</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.710" end="00:35:32.779" style="s2">his rampage against the non-aryans he&#39;d<br />cleaned up all the factories and like he</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.779" end="00:35:36.470" style="s2">went in there and fumigated them it was<br />part of the law he went on a public</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.470" end="00:35:39.859" style="s2">health campaign to get rid of<br />tuberculosis and he got rid of the bugs</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.859" end="00:35:45.079" style="s2">in the factories as well he used cyclone<br />B that&#39;s an insecticide and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.079" end="00:35:48.740" style="s2">gas that he used in the gas chambers<br />eventually so first it was the bugs in</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.740" end="00:35:52.790" style="s2">the rats and then it was people who were<br />then it was euthanasia that was the neck</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.790" end="00:35:58.790" style="s2">move and forced you euthanasia and the<br />the rationale for that was compassion by</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.790" end="00:36:03.890" style="s2">the way just so you all know it&#39;s it&#39;s<br />it&#39;s merciful to put these people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.890" end="00:36:08.410" style="s2">are burdensome to themselves and their<br />families and the state who are living</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.410" end="00:36:13.610" style="s2">second-rate lives its merciful to<br />euthanize them and that was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.610" end="00:36:20.270" style="s2">campaign in Germany it was after that<br />that the more racial purifications began</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.270" end="00:36:26.530" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the disgust thing that&#39;s<br />unbelievably important it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.530" end="00:36:30.740" style="s2">because lots of times people think that<br />conservatives are more anxiety sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.740" end="00:36:34.520" style="s2">than liberals and that&#39;s why they&#39;re<br />closed in terms of their ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.520" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look right<br />first of all conservatives are less</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:40.580" style="s2">neurotic than liberals although the<br />effect isn&#39;t that big so it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.580" end="00:36:44.390" style="s2">and they actually are there they score<br />higher in measures of well-being the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.390" end="00:36:51.050" style="s2">most unhappy people are liberal men by<br />the way so but you know people are often</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.050" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">accused if they&#39;re conservative of being<br />fearful and that&#39;s why they you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">suppress other people&#39;s viewpoints but<br />that doesn&#39;t look right it&#39;s low</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:01.820" style="s2">openness and high orderliness and that<br />looks like it&#39;s associated with disgust</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.820" end="00:37:05.780" style="s2">and that looks like it&#39;s associated with<br />something called the extended immune</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.780" end="00:37:09.500" style="s2">system which is the proclivity of people<br />to to keep themselves away from</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.500" end="00:37:13.700" style="s2">potential sources of contamination it&#39;s<br />really terrifying because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.700" end="00:37:17.360" style="s2">things people often said about Germany<br />was that you know it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.360" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">civilized country and yet it descended<br />into barbarity</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:26.060" style="s2">but conscientiousness is a very good<br />predictor of long-term success and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.060" end="00:37:30.500" style="s2">you could say well conscientious<br />societies are more civilized but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.500" end="00:37:33.980" style="s2">also more orderly and that makes them<br />more discussed sensitive and so what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.980" end="00:37:38.210" style="s2">might have easily might have easily been<br />in Germany was that it was an excess of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.210" end="00:37:42.860" style="s2">civilization rather than its lack that<br />produced exactly these consequences and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.860" end="00:37:45.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a far more frightening<br />proposition and one that&#39;s I believe</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.980" end="00:37:51.050" style="s2">much more likely to be true Hitler<br />bathed four times a day and he was also</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.050" end="00:37:54.590" style="s2">an admirer of willpower so he could<br />stand like this for eight hours in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.590" end="00:37:57.590" style="s2">back of a car and the thing about<br />conscientious people is they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.590" end="00:38:02.410" style="s2">willpower oriented and so if you&#39;re<br />unfortunate enough to be sick</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.410" end="00:38:06.200" style="s2">chronically in the house of someone<br />who&#39;s conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.200" end="00:38:09.589" style="s2">if it&#39;s a mental illness you&#39;re more<br />likely to relapse because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.589" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">conscientious person is going to be<br />judgmental and they&#39;re going to say to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:15.050" style="s2">you if you&#39;re schizophrenic they&#39;re<br />going to say well if you just organize</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.050" end="00:38:17.720" style="s2">yourself and get up in the morning and<br />try a little harder</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.720" end="00:38:22.070" style="s2">you could overcome this which is of<br />course true except you can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.070" end="00:38:26.150" style="s2">you&#39;re schizophrenic and so the pressure<br />put on you by the anger and the contempt</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.150" end="00:38:30.980" style="s2">is going to increase the probability<br />that you&#39;ll relapse so orderly people</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.980" end="00:38:35.210" style="s2">are very judgmental and you know<br />orderliness is very highly associated</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.210" end="00:38:39.619" style="s2">with things like anorexia and the<br />anorexic is basically someone who&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.619" end="00:38:44.119" style="s2">disgust sensitive that they become<br />unable to tolerate their own body and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.119" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">they see it as a source of corruption<br />and imperfection which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:53.410" style="s2">exactly right it is and it&#39;s very<br />difficult thing to maintain order around</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.410" end="00:38:59.810" style="s2">so anyways so what happens out here in<br />this terrible domain where scar rules is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.810" end="00:39:04.430" style="s2">that things turn into a totalitarian<br />state you know and he&#39;s presented here</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.430" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">as as a Nazi like leader and see there&#39;s<br />another thing that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:13.369" style="s2">this even deeper than this from a<br />mythological perspective I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.369" end="00:39:18.380" style="s2">I can even go into it well not really I<br />guess what I&#39;ll have to do is satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.380" end="00:39:23.990" style="s2">myself with this observation there&#39;s<br />always been some antagonism for example</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.990" end="00:39:27.950" style="s2">between the Catholic Church and<br />rationalism and everyone knows that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.950" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">a very long-standing antagonism that<br />sort of runs its way through at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:37.670" style="s2">the last thousand years or so of Western<br />civilization and the people who regarded</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.670" end="00:39:40.730" style="s2">kaathal catholics as antithetical to<br />science</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.730" end="00:39:45.650" style="s2">take the Catholics to task for that and<br />describing it as prejudicial and super</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.650" end="00:39:49.190" style="s2">and superstitious and fair enough<br />but there&#39;s something else going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.190" end="00:39:53.030" style="s2">there that&#39;s more important and that&#39;s<br />the observation and this is at a deep</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.030" end="00:39:59.660" style="s2">level again the observation that<br />rationality has one big problem so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.660" end="00:40:04.460" style="s2">it can easily become arrogant and<br />believe in its own theories so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.460" end="00:40:07.609" style="s2">smart and there&#39;s gonna be some of you<br />people who are like that to some of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.609" end="00:40:12.050" style="s2">your primary the primary trait that<br />distinguishes you from other people over</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.050" end="00:40:15.530" style="s2">the course of your whole life was that<br />you are more intelligent than most and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.530" end="00:40:20.059" style="s2">you may have staked your identity on<br />that and an over value</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.059" end="00:40:23.689" style="s2">and rationality and the problem with<br />that is that you you make a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.689" end="00:40:27.949" style="s2">the world and then you tend to assume<br />that it&#39;s 100% correct that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.949" end="00:40:31.400" style="s2">tendency to fall in love with your own<br />theories and that&#39;s what a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.400" end="00:40:36.589" style="s2">does the totalitarian says here&#39;s the<br />damn theory and it&#39;s exactly right and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.589" end="00:40:41.719" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna act it out exactly and if<br />you don&#39;t well we&#39;ve got some special</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.719" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">treats in mind for you and one of the<br />most terrible things that that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:49.039" style="s2">encountered while reading about<br />totalitarianism and this was even more</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.039" end="00:40:54.799" style="s2">true of the Soviet Union under Stalin<br />was that the true believers and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.799" end="00:41:00.109" style="s2">there were many of them we&#39;re in a<br />terrible position because according to</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.109" end="00:41:03.410" style="s2">their own doctrine they&#39;re already<br />involved in the process that was going</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.410" end="00:41:07.400" style="s2">to bring utopia to mankind the problems<br />had already been solved but many of them</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.400" end="00:41:11.660" style="s2">were still suffering terribly as<br />individuals but if you&#39;re a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.660" end="00:41:16.519" style="s2">believer in Utopia your own suffering<br />becomes heretical right because your</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.519" end="00:41:20.479" style="s2">suffering is an indication that the damn<br />theory isn&#39;t correct and so then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.479" end="00:41:23.479" style="s2">in a terrible position because you<br />either admit that the theory isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.479" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">correct and fall apart because of that<br />and maybe face terrible punishment as</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:33.589" style="s2">well or you have to separate yourself<br />from your own suffering and lie about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.589" end="00:41:36.559" style="s2">fundamentally and of course that&#39;s<br />exactly what happened in places like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.559" end="00:41:40.910" style="s2">Soviet Union where everyone lied about<br />everything all of the time to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.910" end="00:41:46.219" style="s2">to their family members to their friends<br />the entire system was completely</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.219" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">permeated by lies and so you get this<br />terrible place that scars the ruler over</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:58.369" style="s2">which is totalitarian and brutal and<br />murderous and resentful and deceitful</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.369" end="00:42:07.670" style="s2">and arrogant all at the same time and<br />that&#39;s brought about so mmm-hmm the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.670" end="00:42:11.779" style="s2">columbine guys for example when they&#39;re<br />justifying their murderous nests and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.779" end="00:42:17.449" style="s2">their plans to shoot up the schools they<br />keep making reference to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.449" end="00:42:22.309" style="s2">people had slighted them for example you<br />know and insulted them and that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.309" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">were alienated they weren&#39;t bullied<br />exactly the way the press made it out I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:28.670" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they were bullied anymore<br />than people usually are in high school</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.670" end="00:42:33.740" style="s2">but they took their alienation<br />personally and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.740" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">guarded that their isolation from common<br />humanity as indication of the pathology</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:43.460" style="s2">of everything and then they went out to<br />destroy and that&#39;s exactly what this</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.460" end="00:42:47.150" style="s2">sort of thing represents that&#39;s the<br />uniformity and you see he&#39;s got this</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.150" end="00:42:52.790" style="s2">kind of vicious grin on his face which<br />is malicious and and pleased all at the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.790" end="00:42:57.400" style="s2">same time there&#39;s no fear in that<br />it&#39;sit&#39;s quite quite the opposite and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.400" end="00:43:01.970" style="s2">there&#39;s another image of you know using<br />what&#39;s essentially imagery of Hell which</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.970" end="00:43:06.050" style="s2">everyone understands strangely enough<br />and that associates him with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.050" end="00:43:10.280" style="s2">crescent moon and the crescent moon is<br />well it&#39;s a symbol of darkness and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.280" end="00:43:16.730" style="s2">the underworld fundamentally so all<br />right so anyway so that&#39;s we see the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.730" end="00:43:20.119" style="s2">underworld we see that which bullet lies<br />beyond the light and in there we see a</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.119" end="00:43:23.330" style="s2">fragment of that that&#39;s basically<br />hellish and all of that&#39;s incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.330" end="00:43:28.010" style="s2">into the story and everyone understands<br />that when they see it even without I</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.010" end="00:43:33.530" style="s2">would say the overt references to Nazism<br />okay so now scar has a plan he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.530" end="00:43:39.410" style="s2">to kill the king and he&#39;s going to do<br />that by putting what the King loves in</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.410" end="00:43:47.950" style="s2">danger and so scar feigning sympathy has<br />enticed Simba down into this ravine and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.950" end="00:43:53.900" style="s2">scars minions are going to cause a<br />wildebeest stampede right so a mindless</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.900" end="00:44:01.780" style="s2">stampede to to to put to put Simba in<br />danger and so that&#39;s what happens here</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.780" end="00:44:09.260" style="s2">the Whale debate start to march into the<br />ravine and everyone is making a scar</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.260" end="00:44:14.900" style="s2">tells Mufasa that Simba is down in that<br />ravine and entices him down there and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.900" end="00:44:22.010" style="s2">they&#39;re all off running to see if they<br />can save Simba and then you see Mufasa</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.010" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">running in front of the wildebeest herd<br />trying to try to find his son and trying</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:32.750" style="s2">to stay ahead of them the mad mob that&#39;s<br />put his son in danger and so he tries to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.750" end="00:44:37.460" style="s2">escape climbing up the Butte which is<br />almost a sheer cliff and when it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.460" end="00:44:43.609" style="s2">the top mmm his brother is waiting for<br />him there and he asks him to pull him up</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.609" end="00:44:49.370" style="s2">and scar basically before he<br />indicates that he&#39;s betraying him and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.370" end="00:44:56.060" style="s2">puts his claws into Moo fusses paws and<br />throws him off the cliff and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.060" end="00:44:59.840" style="s2">that and it&#39;s a sad part of the story<br />it&#39;s a hard part that&#39;s very hard on</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.840" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">kids because the father has died and you<br />know it&#39;s a rare kid who won&#39;t cry about</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:09.230" style="s2">that scene in particular where you see<br />Simba very upset and his father dying</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.230" end="00:45:13.850" style="s2">now this is a hard part of the story to<br />interpret and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.850" end="00:45:16.850" style="s2">because of my lack of ability to<br />interpret her because the story takes a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.850" end="00:45:21.830" style="s2">weird twist here but there-there is this<br />confusion in the story about whether</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.830" end="00:45:26.750" style="s2">Simba is an innocent victim who set up<br />for the murder of his father or whether</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.750" end="00:45:31.370" style="s2">he actually bears some guilt for it you<br />know and he&#39;s broken some rules and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.370" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">that and and so on so he&#39;s not exactly<br />placed in the position of innocence but</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:40.730" style="s2">of course he&#39;s also been set up by scar<br />in any case scar tells him that it&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.730" end="00:45:44.990" style="s2">fault pure and pure and that because of<br />that he&#39;s going to have to leave he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.990" end="00:45:54.730" style="s2">gonna have to be banished beyond the<br />kingdom now you see this motif quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.730" end="00:46:00.920" style="s2">quite frequently in heroes stories where<br />the hero has to be raised outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.920" end="00:46:06.110" style="s2">kingdom that happens with King Arthur<br />for example and it happens with Harry</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.110" end="00:46:09.260" style="s2">Potter right because Harry Potter is<br />raised by muggles instead of being</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.260" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">inside the Magic Kingdom so it&#39;s a very<br />common theme and partly what it means is</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:18.890" style="s2">that it means two things one is that you<br />do grow up alienated from your culture</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.890" end="00:46:22.550" style="s2">to some degree there&#39;s no way around<br />that because the culture doesn&#39;t match</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.550" end="00:46:27.170" style="s2">you perfectly and it doesn&#39;t work for<br />you perfectly and it&#39;s old and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.170" end="00:46:31.220" style="s2">of corrupt and it alienates you as it&#39;s<br />shaping you and so you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.220" end="00:46:36.590" style="s2">develop some separation from it and you<br />see that in intergenerational rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.590" end="00:46:39.710" style="s2">you know we&#39;re the new generation has<br />the proclivity to blame the previous</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.710" end="00:46:43.850" style="s2">generation for everything that&#39;s wrong<br />with the current system and fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.850" end="00:46:47.840" style="s2">you know because you do inherit<br />everything that&#39;s wrong of course you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.840" end="00:46:51.110" style="s2">also inherit everything that&#39;s going<br />well which is a good thing to also</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.110" end="00:46:57.170" style="s2">notice but the idea is that you can&#39;t<br />help but be alienated from let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.170" end="00:47:01.220" style="s2">the patriarchy for for lack of a better<br />word because it&#39;s got a tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.220" end="00:47:06.170" style="s2">element and because it&#39;s not matched<br />well to you so but then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.170" end="00:47:12.500" style="s2">this other issue which is well maybe<br />you&#39;re not being successful by the terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.500" end="00:47:16.309" style="s2">that are by the values that are<br />instantiated in the current system and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.309" end="00:47:20.359" style="s2">you might say well that&#39;s because the<br />system is set up in an unfair manner and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.359" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">fair enough but it&#39;s also possibly<br />because you&#39;re just not very good at</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:28.280" style="s2">acting out those values right so part of<br />the reason you get alienated from your</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.280" end="00:47:31.640" style="s2">culture is because the culture is<br />corrupt but another part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.640" end="00:47:36.440" style="s2">is you&#39;re just not doing as well as you<br />could be you&#39;re not playing by the rules</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.440" end="00:47:40.700" style="s2">properly and so you get alienated and<br />you&#39;re unsuccessful because of your own</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.700" end="00:47:46.700" style="s2">inadequacies and so the movie plays both<br />of those it&#39;s obviously Simba is set up</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.700" end="00:47:52.369" style="s2">but there is an intimation that he&#39;s not<br />entirely blameless as well anyways he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.369" end="00:47:56.990" style="s2">very broken up about this and no wonder<br />it&#39;s also partly a story of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.990" end="00:48:01.039" style="s2">emergence of adolescence because you<br />know when you&#39;re a child and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.039" end="00:48:05.930" style="s2">ensconced right inside the familial<br />framework then you sort of exist within</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.930" end="00:48:10.010" style="s2">that system of rules like you would<br />under the piagetian scheme but when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.010" end="00:48:14.420" style="s2">become an adolescent then there&#39;s much<br />more of a proclivity to break free and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.420" end="00:48:19.490" style="s2">to start breaking rules and so that&#39;s<br />also akin in some sense to the death of</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.490" end="00:48:26.150" style="s2">the father and that&#39;s a necessary<br />developmental stage anyway scar comes</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.150" end="00:48:29.960" style="s2">down into the ravine it&#39;s all foggy now<br />because that goes along with the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.960" end="00:48:35.809" style="s2">murkiness of death and tells Simba that<br />it&#39;s his fault and that he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.809" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">have to leave he&#39;s going to have to<br />leave the kingdom of his father which</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:44.359" style="s2">makes sense now his father&#39;s dead so how<br />are you gonna once your father has died</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.359" end="00:48:49.700" style="s2">how are you going to stay around in his<br />kingdom so to speak so and then scar</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.700" end="00:48:58.190" style="s2">tries to get these hyenas to go track<br />Simba down and kill him so and Zazu goes</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.190" end="00:49:02.510" style="s2">back to tell all the rest of the Lions<br />that Mufasa is dead and that Simba has</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.510" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">disappeared and then scar takes over<br />Pride Rock and so what&#39;s happened now is</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:14.810" style="s2">the malevolent element of the King has<br />obtained control over</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.810" end="00:49:21.100" style="s2">state right and so this is the king the<br />wise King wasn&#39;t paying enough attention</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.100" end="00:49:25.550" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of looking at it and so<br />the malevolent part of the state has now</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.550" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">got control this is a very very old idea<br />I&#39;ve traced it back at least several</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:35.300" style="s2">thousand years in its in its<br />representation in stories you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.300" end="00:49:39.680" style="s2">in Egyptian mythology for example so the<br />idea is that as the social structure</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.680" end="00:49:43.850" style="s2">builds in complexity it offers you the<br />protection of a functioning complex</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.850" end="00:49:48.440" style="s2">system but it also becomes increasingly<br />likely to turn into a tyranny and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.440" end="00:49:51.950" style="s2">because it&#39;s more and more powerful the<br />fact of its potential for tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.950" end="00:49:57.050" style="s2">becomes more and more of a danger and so<br />then the question is well what are the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.050" end="00:50:02.420" style="s2">factors that encourages it turning into<br />a tyranny and one factor would be the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.420" end="00:50:06.830" style="s2">wise part of it is not paying enough<br />attention to the malevolent part of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.830" end="00:50:10.520" style="s2">and you could say that&#39;s true at the<br />state level it&#39;s also true at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.520" end="00:50:14.810" style="s2">individual level right you have to watch<br />your own proclivity to upset yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.810" end="00:50:19.490" style="s2">and other people and and take that into<br />account and pay careful attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.490" end="00:50:23.150" style="s2">because otherwise it can gain control<br />especially because you&#39;re gonna avoid</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.150" end="00:50:28.550" style="s2">looking at it and one of the<br />characteristics of the wise King who</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.550" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">gets overthrown by the tyrant is that he<br />has an evil brother and he won&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:37.700" style="s2">enough attention to him he avoids he<br />doesn&#39;t look and so the the evil King</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.700" end="00:50:41.270" style="s2">gets the upper hand and that&#39;s what&#39;s<br />happened here and so notice now he takes</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.270" end="00:50:47.750" style="s2">possession of Pride Rock not in full<br />daylight right but at night so that ties</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.750" end="00:50:52.720" style="s2">his rule into the rule of unconscious<br />processes and and malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:58.670" style="s2">alright so Simba runs away from the<br />kingdom out into the desert now why is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.670" end="00:51:02.690" style="s2">that well you remember maybe you<br />remember and maybe you don&#39;t maybe don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.690" end="00:51:06.560" style="s2">know it the story of Exodus when Moses<br />takes the Hebrews out of Egypt they end</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.560" end="00:51:12.830" style="s2">up in a desert well why well it&#39;s<br />because when you leave Kingdom no matter</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.830" end="00:51:17.870" style="s2">how ironical you still fall into<br />disorder you&#39;re out in a place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.870" end="00:51:23.030" style="s2">desert there&#39;s no civilization there you<br />know that&#39;s what happened to Iraq after</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.030" end="00:51:26.150" style="s2">the Americans went in you know the the<br />Americans the neo-cons were all</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.150" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">convinced that the Iraqis would Oh<br />welcome</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:32.539" style="s2">with open arms and there would be this<br />smooth transition to democracy same idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.539" end="00:51:37.220" style="s2">and Libya it&#39;s like no that&#39;s not what<br />happens what happens is the state</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.220" end="00:51:43.339" style="s2">devolves into a desert chaos and maybe<br />then you can make order but probably not</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.339" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">and so Simba has left the kingdom and<br />the first thing that happens is he damn</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:52.970" style="s2">near dies in the desert and so you know<br />if you have an old belief system and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.970" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not working very well and you<br />abandon it well good for you because</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.960" end="00:52:00.859" style="s2">you&#39;re out of the old belief system but<br />now you&#39;re nowhere one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.859" end="00:52:04.910" style="s2">that happens to alcoholics for example<br />and and draw a draw other drug addicts</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.910" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">as well so imagine that you&#39;re trying to<br />stop drinking alright fine maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:16.039" style="s2">have to undergo some medical treatment<br />so when you first stop you don&#39;t die of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.039" end="00:52:20.390" style="s2">seizures because that often happens to<br />people who are addicted to alcohol so</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.390" end="00:52:23.630" style="s2">and then they get valium or something<br />like that from a doctor to see them</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.630" end="00:52:31.339" style="s2">through the first bits of what do you<br />call it well of sobering-up and so they</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.339" end="00:52:35.059" style="s2">get through it and then then maybe two<br />weeks later they&#39;re not physiologically</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.059" end="00:52:40.910" style="s2">dependent on alcohol anymore<br />the same thing is true of cocaine but if</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.910" end="00:52:44.269" style="s2">you take them back and you put them in<br />their environment say they go back out</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.269" end="00:52:47.960" style="s2">of the treatment center back into the<br />normal world they start drinking or</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.960" end="00:52:51.170" style="s2">using right away again and the reason<br />for that is that well let&#39;s say you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.170" end="00:52:56.839" style="s2">been an alcoholic for 20 years okay<br />first of all that&#39;s all you do for</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.839" end="00:53:05.180" style="s2">entertainment you drink and all your<br />friends are alcoholics right and so if</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.180" end="00:53:17.990" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna stop drinking not only do<br />you have to rid yourself of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.990" end="00:53:21.640" style="s2">physiological addiction but you have to<br />completely learn a new way of living</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.640" end="00:53:25.069" style="s2">because what do you know you have to get<br />rid of all your friends because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.069" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">all drunks pretty much or if they&#39;re not<br />there at least people who are</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:31.759" style="s2">facilitating your drinking so you have<br />to build a whole new social network you</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.759" end="00:53:35.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to amuse yourself because<br />of course the way you&#39;ve done that is by</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.210" end="00:53:38.660" style="s2">going to the bar sitting at home<br />drinking and so there&#39;s a huge hole in</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.660" end="00:53:42.340" style="s2">your life you abandon the previous<br />pathological mode</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.340" end="00:53:47.170" style="s2">a patient but that just leaves you with<br />nothing and then you have to rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.170" end="00:53:51.490" style="s2">that thing from from from from scratch<br />it&#39;s extraordinarily difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.490" end="00:53:53.770" style="s2">that&#39;s why so many people fail when<br />they&#39;re trying to overcome a major</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.770" end="00:53:59.470" style="s2">addiction so alright so anyways<br />Simba&#39;s out there in the desert he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.470" end="00:54:05.590" style="s2">left his family and the comforts of home<br />and he&#39;s he&#39;s discovered by these by</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.590" end="00:54:11.110" style="s2">Pumbaa and who&#39;s a little rats named Tim<br />Timon</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.110" end="00:54:16.600" style="s2">yes he&#39;s a meerkat right which are very<br />cool things and they discover him and</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.600" end="00:54:20.770" style="s2">this is sort of his transition into<br />adolescence and he he kind of finds and</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.770" end="00:54:25.270" style="s2">this is I would say more typical of the<br />male transition into adolescence because</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.270" end="00:54:28.900" style="s2">females of course hit puberty so much<br />younger the males who aren&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.900" end="00:54:34.090" style="s2">attractive when they&#39;re young like and<br />just starting to undergo puberty they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.090" end="00:54:38.170" style="s2">not very attractive to females they tend<br />to clump together in in gangs and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.170" end="00:54:43.840" style="s2">and manage the transition over what<br />could be seven years so and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.840" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">happens here is Simba joins this little<br />gang of you know these guys are alright</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:52.540" style="s2">but you know they&#39;re a little on the<br />primordial side you might say you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.540" end="00:54:57.160" style="s2">one of them is basically just a walking<br />gastrointestinal tract and the other one</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.160" end="00:55:00.820" style="s2">is he&#39;s not so bad but he&#39;s like you<br />know a foot high really what good is he</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.820" end="00:55:05.080" style="s2">and so he he&#39;s got some second-rate<br />companions out here past the desert but</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.080" end="00:55:08.950" style="s2">he enters he&#39;s out of childhood now and<br />now he enters the adolescent world and</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.950" end="00:55:12.670" style="s2">what happens here is that very quickly<br />in the film he goes from being a little</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.670" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">cub to a full full adolescence and<br />there&#39;s about a five minute transition</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:20.500" style="s2">and so it&#39;s the next stage in his<br />development and now he&#39;s out there in</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.500" end="00:55:24.220" style="s2">this paradise which is kind of strange<br />because adolescence really is no no</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.220" end="00:55:28.270" style="s2">picnic but the idea here is that he<br />really doesn&#39;t have any responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.270" end="00:55:33.430" style="s2">right none and that is one thing about<br />adolescences and even the stage of life</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.430" end="00:55:37.540" style="s2">that you guys are out is you have lots<br />to do but you&#39;re not really responsible</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.540" end="00:55:41.530" style="s2">for anyone other than yourself and so<br />even though you might be quite burdened</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.530" end="00:55:45.910" style="s2">with your current responsibilities it&#39;s<br />nothing compared to what it will be like</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.910" end="00:55:49.420" style="s2">when you you know you have<br />responsibilities for four children for</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.420" end="00:55:52.870" style="s2">example or for the people that are<br />working for you or or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.870" end="00:55:58.660" style="s2">so anyways out here it&#39;s a kind of<br />of place as well and adolescence is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.660" end="00:56:03.940" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had high school students try<br />to do the future authoring program you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.940" end="00:56:07.030" style="s2">know where they have to think three to<br />five years down the road it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.030" end="00:56:11.170" style="s2">forget that they just can&#39;t do it and<br />I&#39;ve watched them and what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.170" end="00:56:14.710" style="s2">you you immediately become aware of just<br />how little high school students know</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.710" end="00:56:18.369" style="s2">when they&#39;re like fifteen or sixteen<br />three to five years forget it</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.369" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the world knowledge to<br />project themselves out that far in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:26.109" style="s2">future not even close and so we&#39;ve built<br />a high school version that helps them</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.109" end="00:56:29.109" style="s2">design a better future three to six<br />months down the road and even that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.109" end="00:56:32.619" style="s2">really pushing it but you know<br />adolescents are more impulsive and they</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.619" end="00:56:38.799" style="s2">live more for the moment and there&#39;s<br />some utility in that I mean being</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.799" end="00:56:41.619" style="s2">impulsive and living for the moment is<br />one of the things that gets you pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.619" end="00:56:45.339" style="s2">as a teenager and that is certainly one<br />way that the species has managed to</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.339" end="00:56:51.220" style="s2">propagate itself and so positive emotion<br />and impulsivity are very tightly linked</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.220" end="00:56:58.089" style="s2">and so he&#39;s out there in this adolescent<br />delusional fantasy that might be one way</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.089" end="00:57:01.930" style="s2">of thinking about it but more important<br />he&#39;s out there where he&#39;s in a domain</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.930" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">now where the impulses of the moment<br />basically take precedence and so and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:15.220" style="s2">think they sing some song about yeah<br />Hakuna Matata right which basically</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.220" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">means do whatever you do whatever you<br />want and tomorrow will take care of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:22.480" style="s2">itself or something like that so it&#39;s<br />very impulsive and lacks all</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.480" end="00:57:26.710" style="s2">responsibilities one of the things that<br />I would recommend to you if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.710" end="00:57:31.720" style="s2">protect yourself from ideological<br />possession shall we say is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.720" end="00:57:35.410" style="s2">hear people speak politically and they<br />don&#39;t say anything about your</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.410" end="00:57:39.790" style="s2">responsibilities you should probably<br />stop listening to them because whenever</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.790" end="00:57:43.059" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to offer you something if<br />it doesn&#39;t come along with an equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.059" end="00:57:47.470" style="s2">cost there&#39;s something being hidden from<br />you and they&#39;re appealing to the part of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.470" end="00:57:52.630" style="s2">you that&#39;s well I would say at best<br />adolescent so alright so anyways he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.630" end="00:57:58.119" style="s2">out there in his little adolescent<br />paradise and with his dopey chums and</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.119" end="00:58:06.510" style="s2">back at at Pride Rock things are not<br />good right Skaar who&#39;s arrogant and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.510" end="00:58:11.470" style="s2">refuses to learn and who will not<br />establish a reasonable relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.470" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">the females all he does is tyrannize<br />over them he ends up ruling over a</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:19.390" style="s2">completely barren landscape and that&#39;s<br />really what happens in totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.390" end="00:58:23.530" style="s2">states and we also know quite<br />interestingly is that one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.530" end="00:58:27.610" style="s2">predictors of economic development in a<br />state is the degree to which they extend</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.610" end="00:58:32.110" style="s2">rights to women it&#39;s one of the best<br />predictors and I would say well if</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.110" end="00:58:34.870" style="s2">you&#39;re going to terrorize your own women<br />you&#39;re gonna Tarin eyes everything</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.870" end="00:58:38.830" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna Terran eyes ideas you&#39;re<br />gonna Terran eyes structures like if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.830" end="00:58:43.530" style="s2">have to enslave your own women you&#39;re<br />you&#39;ve del adapted a pretty damn</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.530" end="00:58:47.830" style="s2">pathological view of the world and the<br />probability that that narrow constrained</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.830" end="00:58:51.700" style="s2">restricted viewpoint is going to pay off<br />for you economically is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.700" end="00:58:56.290" style="s2">low so anyways Skaar it&#39;s like what<br />happened in the Soviet Union no part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.290" end="00:59:02.410" style="s2">the reason it collapsed by 1989 is that<br />it just could not move any farther it</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.410" end="00:59:07.000" style="s2">was like this really complicated motor<br />that was worn completely out that no one</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.000" end="00:59:10.510" style="s2">had ever taken care of and it&#39;s just<br />ground to a halt</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.510" end="00:59:16.180" style="s2">it just stopped working because it<br />because it didn&#39;t work and so if your</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.180" end="00:59:20.620" style="s2">totalitarian and you won&#39;t update your<br />system and adjust it then it wears out</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.620" end="00:59:25.870" style="s2">and grinds to a halt and everything<br />becomes unproductive no it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.870" end="00:59:29.320" style="s2">easy to figure out what makes a society<br />productive because you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.320" end="00:59:33.700" style="s2">it&#39;s Natural Resources or something like<br />that first of all natural resources are</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.700" end="00:59:37.960" style="s2">very often a curse to a country because<br />they produce corruption they call that</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.960" end="00:59:40.780" style="s2">the Dutch disease there&#39;s a reason for<br />that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.780" end="00:59:45.790" style="s2">you can look it up but natural resources<br />in and of themselves are by no means</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.790" end="00:59:49.540" style="s2">sufficient to guarantee the well-being<br />of a country Japan has virtually no</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.540" end="00:59:54.760" style="s2">natural resources at all and it&#39;s really<br />rich and one of the prime natural</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.760" end="00:59:59.890" style="s2">resources actually seems maybe there&#39;s<br />two one is honesty another is trust and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.890" end="01:00:03.640" style="s2">if you can set up a society where people<br />are roughly honest which means they do</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.640" end="01:00:08.770" style="s2">what they say they&#39;re going to do and<br />where the default bargaining position on</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.770" end="01:00:12.880" style="s2">both sides is trust then the probability<br />that that culture will become wealthy is</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.880" end="01:00:18.330" style="s2">very very high so and a functional legal<br />system is also a natural resource of</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.330" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">tremendous tremendous value you know<br />it&#39;s partly why people in China for</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:26.740" style="s2">example wealthy people in China are<br />dumping their money into the real estate</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.740" end="01:00:30.760" style="s2">market in North America like mad because<br />one of the things you do know if you buy</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.760" end="01:00:34.660" style="s2">real estate in North America is you<br />actually own it it&#39;s still gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.660" end="01:00:38.650" style="s2">yours 20 years in the future 30 years in<br />the future there&#39;s no doubt about that</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.650" end="01:00:42.730" style="s2">and so that fact of ownership is<br />embedded in the functioning legal system</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.730" end="01:00:47.589" style="s2">and that&#39;s what gives those sorts of<br />properties crazy value you know much to</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.589" end="01:00:53.829" style="s2">the much to the problematic situation<br />for all of you people who are at some</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.829" end="01:00:57.010" style="s2">point most of you are gonna try to buy<br />property in Toronto and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.010" end="01:01:01.809" style="s2">going to be entertaining so now look the<br />the other thing about scars he&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.809" end="01:01:05.800" style="s2">little bird locked up right that&#39;s the<br />vision of the king well he doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.800" end="01:01:08.500" style="s2">to know anything he already knows<br />everything so why does he need this</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.500" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">stupid bird flying around telling him<br />what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.200" end="01:01:16.780" style="s2">the last thing he wants to know is<br />what&#39;s going on yeah Stalin I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.780" end="01:01:21.160" style="s2">God he gave that guy bad news or good<br />news he was going to have you killed</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.160" end="01:01:25.780" style="s2">it kept the bad news to a minimum and<br />that&#39;s a real problem right because if</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.780" end="01:01:28.780" style="s2">you torture people who bring you bad<br />news then you&#39;re never going to learn</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.780" end="01:01:32.770" style="s2">anything well you don&#39;t have to if you<br />already know everything anyways and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.770" end="01:01:38.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the situation here well his<br />little minions the hyenas are getting</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.890" end="01:01:41.829" style="s2">pretty unhappy because they haven&#39;t had<br />anything to eat and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.829" end="01:01:47.109" style="s2">is they&#39;ve just stripped the landscape<br />bare right I mean and I read at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.109" end="01:01:50.829" style="s2">demise of the Soviet Union that<br />something like 10 to 15 percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.829" end="01:01:55.270" style="s2">entire land mass of the Soviet Union had<br />been rendered permanently uninhabitable</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.270" end="01:02:00.430" style="s2">by industrial pollution so you know that<br />I don&#39;t remember if that included</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.430" end="01:02:04.119" style="s2">Chernobyl you know where that terrible<br />nuclear accident took place but but</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.119" end="01:02:08.349" style="s2">there were massive domains of<br />devastation and in those countries that</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.349" end="01:02:14.619" style="s2">you know will take hundreds of years to<br />fix so anyways when scar rules everyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.619" end="01:02:17.980" style="s2">starves that&#39;s a good way of thinking<br />about it or everyone dies but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.980" end="01:02:20.859" style="s2">okay because that&#39;s really what he&#39;s<br />after anyway so that works out quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.859" end="01:02:25.089" style="s2">nicely now back out here in paradise I<br />mean look at him how pathetic can you</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.089" end="01:02:29.829" style="s2">get look at the expression on that<br />creatures face you know he&#39;s he selfs</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.829" end="01:02:34.450" style="s2">he&#39;s sated like someone who&#39;s just eaten<br />a gallon of ice cream and he&#39;s got this</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.450" end="01:02:37.230" style="s2">pathetic</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.660" end="01:02:44.390" style="s2">self-satisfied naive clueless<br />unconscious grin on his face which the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.390" end="01:02:47.359" style="s2">animators did a very nice job of<br />capturing like that&#39;s a complicated</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.359" end="01:02:51.530" style="s2">expression and you just want to slap him<br />and that&#39;s exactly what should happen</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.530" end="01:02:55.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what does happen so<br />anyways he&#39;s out there be an unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.520" end="01:03:00.020" style="s2">dingbat well his society is degenerating<br />and that&#39;s bloody well worth thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.020" end="01:03:03.890" style="s2">about because that&#39;s an archetypal trope<br />right it&#39;s like things are sinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.890" end="01:03:07.670" style="s2">around you the question is what are you<br />doing about it you know are you just</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.670" end="01:03:11.540" style="s2">staying in kind of a blithe<br />unconsciousness because you can get your</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.540" end="01:03:15.230" style="s2">next meal are you gonna wake up and do<br />something about it well that&#39;s the call</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.230" end="01:03:20.420" style="s2">of the self so now we go back to two<br />Rafiki here and he knows what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.420" end="01:03:24.710" style="s2">in the kingdom he&#39;s a symbol of the self<br />and he also has some inkling that Simba</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.710" end="01:03:29.839" style="s2">is still alive<br />so so the son of the king is still alive</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.839" end="01:03:35.510" style="s2">despite the fact that the land has<br />become ruled by a tyrant and the son is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.510" end="01:03:40.280" style="s2">absent he&#39;s still around somehow and so<br />in a union from the Union perspective</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.280" end="01:03:46.910" style="s2">there isn&#39;t much distinction between the<br />self and the and the and the child the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.910" end="01:03:51.560" style="s2">self is the sum total of all possibility<br />and the child is possibility itself and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.560" end="01:03:57.080" style="s2">so so let&#39;s say you&#39;ve become an<br />adolescent you&#39;re all cynical right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.080" end="01:04:01.460" style="s2">everything&#39;s falling apart around you<br />which is the typical state of human</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.460" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">beings right because adolescents are<br />cynical generally speaking and</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:08.150" style="s2">everything&#39;s falling around falling<br />apart around them generally speaking and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.150" end="01:04:13.849" style="s2">so what do you have to do in order to to<br />do something about that well one is you</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.849" end="01:04:17.540" style="s2">have to be drawn by the call of wisdom<br />and the other part is that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.540" end="01:04:22.460" style="s2">rediscover that part of yourself that&#39;s<br />a childlike part that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.460" end="01:04:26.810" style="s2">the son and associated with that early<br />you know the early exposure of Simba to</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.810" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">the son you have to find that again and<br />then trust that some childlike</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:35.570" style="s2">exploration and a bit of manifestation<br />of faith might get you to the next place</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.570" end="01:04:40.250" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here with<br />a little you know the baboon and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.250" end="01:04:43.880" style="s2">tree and the and the drawing so anyways<br />he knows that Simba is alive now</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.880" end="01:04:48.589" style="s2">and so he goes off to find him and<br />meanwhile Simba and his dopey companions</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.589" end="01:04:52.819" style="s2">are out hunting for bugs<br />you know because he&#39;s a lion you know he</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.819" end="01:04:56.959" style="s2">should meet bugs for crying out loud but<br />they&#39;re easy and so you see this scene</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.959" end="01:05:01.880" style="s2">where Pumbaa goes after this bug and<br />then another lion shows up and chases</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.880" end="01:05:07.999" style="s2">him so she&#39;s gonna kill him and eat him<br />and ha see that&#39;s an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.999" end="01:05:12.979" style="s2">because one of the things that happens I<br />suppose you could think about this one</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.979" end="01:05:16.969" style="s2">of the things that happens in late<br />adolescence is that the formation of</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.969" end="01:05:22.130" style="s2">male gangs is often broken up by the<br />proclivity of one or more members of</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.130" end="01:05:26.359" style="s2">that gang to get involved in an<br />individual romantic relationship and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.359" end="01:05:32.839" style="s2">the idea that the female lion is the<br />carnivore the female is the carnivore</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.839" end="01:05:38.419" style="s2">that will devour the group is exactly<br />right and so what a girl will do often</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.419" end="01:05:43.729" style="s2">if she&#39;s in relationship with you know<br />somebody like a young man or an older</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.729" end="01:05:47.719" style="s2">adolescent is she&#39;ll try to separate him<br />from his dopey friends and like no</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.719" end="01:05:51.409" style="s2">wonder you know why wouldn&#39;t she do that<br />because he does have dopey friends and</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.409" end="01:05:55.579" style="s2">it&#39;d be better for him if he could get<br />beyond them and so anyways they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.579" end="01:06:00.109" style="s2">pretty freaked out about this and so<br />then Simba goes out and has a fight with</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.109" end="01:06:04.519" style="s2">this lion to protect his dopey chums and<br />I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t need any explanation</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.519" end="01:06:10.579" style="s2">about what that means and they have this<br />huge fight and neljä who it turns out to</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.579" end="01:06:15.049" style="s2">be pins him and so that goes back to the<br />beginning of the story where when he</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.049" end="01:06:19.640" style="s2">first encountered her she pinned him all<br />the time she&#39;s an animal figure right</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.640" end="01:06:25.219" style="s2">and now what she does immediately is<br />shame him so she he&#39;s an atom a figure</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.219" end="01:06:28.489" style="s2">in part she&#39;s an animal figure in part<br />because she actually does shame him</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.489" end="01:06:32.390" style="s2">right so she&#39;s the gateway to higher<br />consciousness she makes him</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.390" end="01:06:37.729" style="s2">self-conscious and rightly so but he&#39;s<br />also a she&#39;s also a psychological figure</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.729" end="01:06:41.299" style="s2">because he imagined that when a young<br />man is establishing a relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.299" end="01:06:46.189" style="s2">a young woman and he&#39;s he&#39;s enamored of<br />her he&#39;s falling in love he projects an</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.189" end="01:06:49.819" style="s2">idea onto her and that ideal is going to<br />be partially fulfilled by the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.819" end="01:06:53.749" style="s2">relationship the degree to which is<br />unspecified and sometimes it&#39;ll collapse</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.749" end="01:06:57.829" style="s2">completely but he projects an ideal on<br />to her because otherwise he wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.829" end="01:07:01.880" style="s2">attracted to her and then the ideal<br />judges him and so that makes him feel</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.880" end="01:07:06.720" style="s2">all self-conscious and and useful<br />which is useful because he is useless</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.720" end="01:07:12.060" style="s2">and should feel that way and so it&#39;s<br />part of the impetus to growing up so and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.060" end="01:07:18.510" style="s2">of course one of the you need necessity<br />in order to mature you because to mature</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.510" end="01:07:23.900" style="s2">is to take on responsibility and you&#39;re<br />not going to feel that impetus unless</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.900" end="01:07:28.830" style="s2">adopting the responsibility has some<br />sort of payoff and women tend to mate</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.830" end="01:07:32.700" style="s2">across an up dominance hierarchy so they<br />tend to actually like men who are useful</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.700" end="01:07:37.740" style="s2">and so if they encounter a man who isn&#39;t<br />useful at all they&#39;re gonna that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.740" end="01:07:42.330" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s going to happen they&#39;re<br />gonna not be happy about that in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.330" end="01:07:47.250" style="s2">least and so and no wonder and I think<br />the reason for that it&#39;s an economic and</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.250" end="01:07:51.600" style="s2">a biological reason the reason is is<br />that women are in the position of having</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.600" end="01:07:57.450" style="s2">to take care of infants primarily and an<br />infant is a very heavy load and so even</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.450" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">a woman who&#39;s extraordinarily competent<br />is going to find herself substantially</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:05.700" style="s2">limited in her possibilities if she has<br />an infant and so then she&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.700" end="01:08:08.820" style="s2">around for someone who&#39;ll pick up part<br />of the load it&#39;s perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.820" end="01:08:12.770" style="s2">and you&#39;re not gonna pick up part of the<br />load if you&#39;re completely useless and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.770" end="01:08:19.290" style="s2">it&#39;s in the woman&#39;s best interest not to<br />have two children roughly speaking so</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.290" end="01:08:23.400" style="s2">anyway she pins him and then he&#39;s all<br />resentful about it immediately because</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.400" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">she&#39;s calling him on his stupid friends<br />and the fact that he&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:29.670" style="s2">gallivanting impulsively in paradise<br />when there&#39;s real problems to be solved</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.670" end="01:08:34.710" style="s2">and so look at him he&#39;s all resentful<br />and useless and and you know feeling put</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.710" end="01:08:38.460" style="s2">upon and picked upon and you just you<br />got to slap him again fundamentally and</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.460" end="01:08:42.320" style="s2">she&#39;s just completely stunned by that<br />it&#39;s like and tells them you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.320" end="01:08:47.730" style="s2">where&#39;s the sim buy used to know right<br />well he&#39;s a little doubtful about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.730" end="01:08:52.680" style="s2">whole situation there the animators do a<br />very nice job of this part of the movie</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.680" end="01:08:55.500" style="s2">because one of the things you see is<br />that his eyebrows are always pointing up</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.500" end="01:08:58.890" style="s2">in the middle whereas his father&#39;s<br />eyebrows were pointing down in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.890" end="01:09:01.680" style="s2">middle and so that&#39;s the difference<br />between this which is sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.680" end="01:09:05.700" style="s2">things are happening to me and this<br />which is more like I&#39;m imposing my will</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.700" end="01:09:10.140" style="s2">on things and that&#39;s an immature face<br />and and the animators capture that</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.140" end="01:09:15.030" style="s2">brilliantly so here&#39;s where she shames<br />him again she tells him how much she</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.030" end="01:09:18.520" style="s2">liked him when he was little and you<br />know a potential king and</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.520" end="01:09:25.359" style="s2">how hurt she is that he&#39;s this useless<br />you know wide-eyed naive impulsive</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.359" end="01:09:32.200" style="s2">pleasure-seeking adolescent and she<br />tells him that she missed him and god</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.200" end="01:09:37.810" style="s2">only knows why because look at him again<br />it&#39;s like completely appalling palling</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.810" end="01:09:43.690" style="s2">creature and this is when Pumbaa and<br />Timon sing that song about the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.690" end="01:09:48.819" style="s2">you know their friends doomed because<br />you know this girl&#39;s got him and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.819" end="01:09:52.600" style="s2">then they switch into another archetypal<br />scene and so they&#39;re falling in love</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.600" end="01:09:57.490" style="s2">here and so the paradisal imagery is<br />really highlighted in the movie and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.490" end="01:10:02.560" style="s2">they go off and have this like romp<br />self-reflective romp through this new</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.560" end="01:10:11.530" style="s2">paradise and they wrestle around and and<br />play and then he pins her more or less</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.530" end="01:10:16.530" style="s2">and she licks him that&#39;s that&#39;s not so<br />good</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.530" end="01:10:22.060" style="s2">and this is one of the most brilliant<br />shots I think that the animators manage</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.060" end="01:10:26.980" style="s2">because she&#39;s obviously pushing this a<br />little bit farther than he knows what to</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.980" end="01:10:31.990" style="s2">do with and so they&#39;re wrestling and he<br />she licks them and then she lays down</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.990" end="01:10:36.160" style="s2">and makes this face which is every<br />single class I&#39;ve ever showed this to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.160" end="01:10:41.230" style="s2">all laugh when they see that image and<br />that&#39;s a good example so Freud said that</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.230" end="01:10:46.120" style="s2">jokes were a good route into the<br />unconscious so the question is and this</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.120" end="01:10:49.780" style="s2">is an archetypal facial expression and<br />everyone knows exactly what it means</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.780" end="01:10:53.710" style="s2">there&#39;s something sexually seductive<br />about it and something very sexually</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.710" end="01:10:58.360" style="s2">seductive about it despite the fact that<br />it&#39;s a lioness and the animators do an</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.360" end="01:11:02.230" style="s2">extraordinarily good job of capturing<br />that and so that has a huge effect on</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.230" end="01:11:07.780" style="s2">him while these guys know that hey the<br />game&#39;s up man it&#39;s like they know</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.780" end="01:11:12.850" style="s2">they&#39;re dead whatever attractions they<br />can offer are paling in comparison to</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.850" end="01:11:19.600" style="s2">this so so anyways things don&#39;t really<br />progress past out but you know he gets a</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.600" end="01:11:24.190" style="s2">hint of her longing for him what&#39;s<br />waiting for him if he grows up and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.190" end="01:11:27.160" style="s2">fact that she&#39;s completely disappointed<br />in him because he&#39;s so completely</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.160" end="01:11:32.320" style="s2">useless and so now he&#39;s lounging about<br />you know like some basement</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.320" end="01:11:38.500" style="s2">with cheeto dust all over his chest and<br />and trying to justify his absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.500" end="01:11:42.880" style="s2">useless life and you know saying that he<br />doesn&#39;t have any responsibility to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.880" end="01:11:46.929" style="s2">devastated Kingdom and he&#39;s out there<br />where Hakuna Matata you know I can just</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.929" end="01:11:50.980" style="s2">do whatever I want and and follow my<br />impulsive pleasures and she thinks he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.980" end="01:11:54.670" style="s2">pretty pathetic and the reason for that<br />is because he is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.670" end="01:11:59.110" style="s2">pathetic and she she tells him that you<br />know she&#39;s extraordinarily disappointed</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.110" end="01:12:04.210" style="s2">he gets all pouty about it I mean even<br />here you see when he when he&#39;s got kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.210" end="01:12:07.719" style="s2">of an aggressive look on his face<br />there&#39;s still nothing about it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.719" end="01:12:12.969" style="s2">commanding it&#39;s petulant right it&#39;s like<br />well now I&#39;m irritated but he&#39;s got no</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.969" end="01:12:18.909" style="s2">force and and still completely appalling<br />in this in this particular situation so</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.909" end="01:12:23.949" style="s2">she judges him very harshly and leaves<br />and that makes him think yeah he make</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.949" end="01:12:28.599" style="s2">gets all self-conscious because this<br />female that he admires wants to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.599" end="01:12:32.020" style="s2">nothing to do with him<br />and so he&#39;s first of all then he thinks</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.020" end="01:12:34.949" style="s2">well maybe I&#39;ll just hate all women<br />which is you know pretty pathetic</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.949" end="01:12:39.579" style="s2">conclusion and but a very common one and<br />the next is well maybe there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.579" end="01:12:43.929" style="s2">something wrong with him right which is<br />a very painful bit of self-reflection so</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.929" end="01:12:48.250" style="s2">he he had he notes that there&#39;s<br />something wrong with him and then he</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.250" end="01:12:51.130" style="s2">calls out to his father and says look<br />you said you were always going to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.130" end="01:12:56.020" style="s2">here for me and you&#39;re not and so what&#39;s<br />happening is that he&#39;s become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.020" end="01:12:59.949" style="s2">the insufficiency of his current<br />adolescent value structure and he wants</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.949" end="01:13:03.130" style="s2">something beyond it which would be<br />associated with identification with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.130" end="01:13:07.719" style="s2">father but he can&#39;t he can&#39;t find the<br />father the father&#39;s dead it&#39;s like when</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.719" end="01:13:10.929" style="s2">Pinocchio goes down to the bottom of the<br />ocean to bring Geppetto up from the</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.929" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">depths right that&#39;s the situation that<br />that Simba finds himself in right now</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.000" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">the father&#39;s gone and has to be brought<br />up from the depths so this is where the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.840" end="01:13:26.980" style="s2">movie takes the the archetypal pathway<br />of an initiation ceremony so he says he</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.980" end="01:13:31.540" style="s2">wants to change now one of the things<br />Carl Rogers one of the clinicians that</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.540" end="01:13:34.449" style="s2">will talk about pointed out was that if<br />if someone was going to come to</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.449" end="01:13:37.690" style="s2">psychotherapy there&#39;s some things that<br />had to happen before they went into</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.690" end="01:13:41.530" style="s2">psychotherapy and one thing that had to<br />happen was that they had to admit that</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.530" end="01:13:45.550" style="s2">there was something wrong and they had<br />to want to change you had to have that</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.550" end="01:13:47.380" style="s2">before<br />went into the psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.380" end="01:13:51.910" style="s2">situation and what happens here is Simba<br />is actually he&#39;s dropped his arrogance</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.910" end="01:13:57.160" style="s2">and he&#39;s looking upward kind of like<br />Geppetto wishing on the star in</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.160" end="01:14:01.930" style="s2">Pinocchio he&#39;s looking upwards he<br />looking towards something higher and he</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.930" end="01:14:06.250" style="s2">wants to transform himself so he&#39;s asked<br />the question how can I change for the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.250" end="01:14:13.450" style="s2">better and he doesn&#39;t get an answer and<br />then Rafiki shows up so what does that</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.450" end="01:14:18.070" style="s2">mean it means that as soon as you know<br />you&#39;re wrong about something as soon as</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.070" end="01:14:22.210" style="s2">you admit that you&#39;re wrong about<br />something and you open the door to</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.210" end="01:14:27.130" style="s2">potential change that part of you will<br />respond so and you know this because</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.130" end="01:14:33.280" style="s2">think about this you&#39;re thinking so you<br />ask yourself a question because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.280" end="01:14:36.040" style="s2">what you do when you&#39;re thinking and<br />then you generate some answers it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.040" end="01:14:39.790" style="s2">it&#39;s very strange the thinking will<br />actually work you can actually come up</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.790" end="01:14:43.330" style="s2">with answers if you think about<br />something and so this square this issue</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.330" end="01:14:48.400" style="s2">is okay I thought I was real good in my<br />little impulsive paradise but then it</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.400" end="01:14:52.180" style="s2">turns out that I&#39;m just a half-wit and I<br />noticed that and I want to do something</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.180" end="01:14:57.160" style="s2">about so the question is now the<br />question is has now been posed and what</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.160" end="01:15:00.940" style="s2">young would say is the deeper part of<br />yourself the part that still contains</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.940" end="01:15:06.910" style="s2">your undeveloped potential will respond<br />to that posed question and change the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.910" end="01:15:10.240" style="s2">way that you look at things and change<br />the way that you act it&#39;ll start it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.240" end="01:15:14.860" style="s2">start changing things so that you can<br />tap those parts of yourself that are not</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.860" end="01:15:18.580" style="s2">yet developed and you certainly do that<br />in psychotherapy but you can do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.580" end="01:15:22.390" style="s2">young said that psychotherapy could be<br />replaced by a supreme moral effort and</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.390" end="01:15:26.320" style="s2">by that he meant was that if you really<br />wanted things to be better if you wanted</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.320" end="01:15:29.890" style="s2">to get your act together and you<br />admitted that you were insufficient in</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.890" end="01:15:34.840" style="s2">your current state and you meditated on<br />the issue and tried to figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.840" end="01:15:38.770" style="s2">you should do next to make to put<br />yourself together that you would be able</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.770" end="01:15:42.160" style="s2">to find out that there&#39;s something in<br />you that guides the process of</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.160" end="01:15:46.480" style="s2">development that&#39;s the self that&#39;s a<br />higher its the higher self in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.480" end="01:15:51.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that remains constant<br />across transformations you know because</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.520" end="01:15:54.610" style="s2">you&#39;re somewhere then you fall apart<br />then you get somewhere else but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.610" end="01:15:58.510" style="s2">something outside of that that&#39;s guiding<br />that process and that&#39;s that&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.510" end="01:16:02.620" style="s2">self that&#39;s what you<br />would be and you can communicate in some</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.620" end="01:16:06.790" style="s2">sense with what you could be and that&#39;s<br />a very strange thing about human beings</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.790" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">anyways Rafiki shows up and Simba is<br />sitting by the water self reflecting</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a little pebble that drops into<br />the pool to attract his attention and up</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:20.590" style="s2">pops the self and Rafik he&#39;s a trickster<br />he tells him weird jokes and he hits him</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.590" end="01:16:25.090" style="s2">with a stick a bunch of times thank God<br />because someone really needs to and he</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.090" end="01:16:30.909" style="s2">he makes some stupid jokes about bananas<br />and kind of entices Simba into following</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.909" end="01:16:35.110" style="s2">him right he lets him know that he has a<br />secret and he entices Simba into</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.110" end="01:16:39.610" style="s2">following him so simha&#39;s all of a sudden<br />become interested in something so if you</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.610" end="01:16:43.270" style="s2">ask yourself what the next developmental<br />stages and you really want to know that</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.270" end="01:16:46.150" style="s2">all of a sudden you&#39;re going to become<br />interested in things that might move you</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.150" end="01:16:51.250" style="s2">to the next stage and that&#39;ll happen<br />more or less unconsciously so anyways</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.250" end="01:16:57.460" style="s2">Rafiki entices him and then runs away<br />and Simba follows him and well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.460" end="01:17:03.400" style="s2">where he reveals himself as a sage and<br />then he tells Simba to follow him and he</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.400" end="01:17:07.480" style="s2">goes underground and this is the<br />initiation scene right which we talked</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.480" end="01:17:11.500" style="s2">about at the beginning of the class this<br />is the descent into the underworld and</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.500" end="01:17:18.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a prerequisite to radical<br />personality transformation so anyways he</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.310" end="01:17:22.780" style="s2">goes through this horrifying underground<br />tunnel system where everything&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.780" end="01:17:27.489" style="s2">tangled up which is you know if you ever<br />fall into chaos that everything down</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.489" end="01:17:32.469" style="s2">there in chaos is tangled up it&#39;s a<br />tangled mess and he&#39;s quite and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.469" end="01:17:35.800" style="s2">horrifying music going on in the<br />background and he goes deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.800" end="01:17:41.290" style="s2">until Rafiki says he finds a pool in the<br />middle of the chaos a deep pool and</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.290" end="01:17:45.250" style="s2">that&#39;s another symbol of the self it&#39;s<br />it&#39;s the deep unconscious to something</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.250" end="01:17:50.110" style="s2">down there that&#39;s alive that can be<br />drawn up to the surface and so Rafiki</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.110" end="01:17:55.690" style="s2">shows him the pool and Simba who&#39;s quite<br />terrified at this point looks in it and</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.690" end="01:17:59.800" style="s2">the first thing he sees is he only sees<br />himself he only sees his own reflection</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.800" end="01:18:04.960" style="s2">and Rafiki says look deeper now you see<br />what the animators do here it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.960" end="01:18:07.900" style="s2">cool<br />so there&#39;s Simba and there&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.900" end="01:18:11.260" style="s2">reflection but you see that is already<br />half is farther and you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.260" end="01:18:16.719" style="s2">difference in the eyebrows and the<br />so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a tightness of jaw</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.719" end="01:18:21.250" style="s2">and a firmness of face that&#39;s starting<br />to manifest itself there and that means</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.250" end="01:18:26.050" style="s2">that he&#39;s starting to see the man he<br />could be beyond the adolescent that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.050" end="01:18:28.780" style="s2">good way of thinking about it and then<br />all of a sudden well they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.780" end="01:18:34.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different face right<br />that&#39;s a seriously different face that</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.500" end="01:18:38.739" style="s2">everything&#39;s going in and that it&#39;s like<br />get out of my way because things are</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.739" end="01:18:42.730" style="s2">going to happen around me very<br />judgmental as well so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.730" end="01:18:47.290" style="s2">naive by any stretch of the imagination<br />but you know we know as far there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.290" end="01:18:51.820" style="s2">good guy and so there&#39;s something<br />archetypal about this and so he sees the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.820" end="01:18:55.660" style="s2">man he could be reflected back to him<br />and then that&#39;s which is that actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.660" end="01:18:59.050" style="s2">becomes a cosmic event and we switch up<br />to the sky instead</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.050" end="01:19:07.540" style="s2">and so Mufasa manifests himself<br />basically as a solar deity and he tells</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.540" end="01:19:13.840" style="s2">Simba that he&#39;s forgotten who he is<br />which is the son of a king and that he</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.840" end="01:19:16.480" style="s2">should remember that and start acting<br />like it</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.480" end="01:19:22.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s an archetypal idea so if<br />you&#39;re just a useless adolescent then</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.180" end="01:19:26.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve forgotten who you are and the<br />consequence of that is that the state is</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.410" end="01:19:30.160" style="s2">going to fall around fall apart around<br />you and you&#39;re not going to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.160" end="01:19:32.800" style="s2">to fix it and you&#39;re not going to be<br />good for anything and no one&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.800" end="01:19:36.940" style="s2">able to rely on you and you&#39;re gonna be<br />all whiny and resentful and then after</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.940" end="01:19:41.590" style="s2">that it even gets worse and so that&#39;s<br />basically what Mufasa tells him and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.590" end="01:19:46.960" style="s2">Simba is like blown away by this vision<br />right because he sees what he could be</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.960" end="01:19:54.460" style="s2">and also what he&#39;s not which is pretty<br />damn horrifying so anyways the storm so</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.460" end="01:19:59.170" style="s2">to speak clears and Rafiki comes up and<br />and Simba&#39;s a lot more thoughtful and</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.170" end="01:20:06.219" style="s2">not quite as whiny and resentful anymore<br />and Rafiki leaves and so Simba now knows</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.219" end="01:20:10.469" style="s2">what he&#39;s supposed to do he&#39;s supposed<br />to stop being useless and take on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.469" end="01:20:16.750" style="s2">moral requirements of setting the<br />Kingdom straight and so he runs back</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.750" end="01:20:20.500" style="s2">across the desert there&#39;s all sorts of<br />impressive music happening and then he</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.500" end="01:20:24.070" style="s2">comes back to his kingdom and it&#39;s not<br />looking so good and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.070" end="01:20:27.770" style="s2">consequence of his his abandonment of it<br />that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.770" end="01:20:32.090" style="s2">part of it so now it&#39;s dead but also his<br />abandonment of it - nothing but</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.090" end="01:20:38.750" style="s2">malevolence and chaos and so he&#39;s pretty<br />taken aback and what&#39;s happened and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.750" end="01:20:46.310" style="s2">he exaggerates his guilt or it should<br />anyways and neljä shows up and and they</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.310" end="01:20:51.220" style="s2">decide they&#39;re gonna do something about<br />this so in the meantime</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.580" end="01:20:55.400" style="s2">Simba&#39;s mother is complaining about the<br />fact that there&#39;s no food in the kingdom</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.400" end="01:20:58.460" style="s2">anymore and that they&#39;ve gone as far as<br />they can and Skaar doesn&#39;t want to hear</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.460" end="01:21:05.450" style="s2">this so he he attacks her and Simba<br />decides to go to war and so this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.450" end="01:21:10.190" style="s2">where he wakes up and he&#39;s willing to<br />encounter the shadow at this point and</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.190" end="01:21:15.320" style="s2">so he confronts scar and scars very<br />concerned about this because actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.320" end="01:21:19.640" style="s2">Simba is looking pretty impressive now<br />and he thought he was dead besides and</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.640" end="01:21:26.300" style="s2">so he tries to use treachery and whiny<br />Nessun and subordination to excuse</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.300" end="01:21:33.680" style="s2">himself but he&#39;s planning to overthrow<br />Simba nonetheless to resist him so he</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.680" end="01:21:38.420" style="s2">tells scar to leave he&#39;s going to banish<br />him to the nether regions outside of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.420" end="01:21:45.320" style="s2">kingdom like scar did to him and scar<br />basically refuses and then a storm</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.320" end="01:21:52.040" style="s2">gathers right and lights the Deadwood<br />around the rock on fire so we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.040" end="01:21:56.600" style="s2">another kind of descent into hell seen<br />here very common in Disney movies this</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.600" end="01:22:01.100" style="s2">this this notion of the hero fighting<br />the evil force on the edge of something</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.100" end="01:22:03.890" style="s2">that&#39;s burning it&#39;s quite a common motif<br />you see it in Sleeping Beauty for</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.890" end="01:22:09.530" style="s2">example so they have a big war and scar<br />ends up putting Simba in the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.530" end="01:22:13.310" style="s2">position that Mufasa was in and then he<br />whispers to him that he killed his</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.310" end="01:22:17.600" style="s2">father so Simba has been thinking all<br />along that it was only his fault and it</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.600" end="01:22:21.140" style="s2">is sort of his fault but he didn&#39;t know<br />that there was a more archetypal theme</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.140" end="01:22:26.720" style="s2">playing out in the background which is<br />that societies are always endangered by</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.720" end="01:22:30.470" style="s2">malevolence always and that&#39;s<br />independent to some degree of Simba&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.470" end="01:22:34.610" style="s2">decisions and his and his lack thereof<br />anyways scar tells him because he thinks</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.610" end="01:22:40.940" style="s2">he&#39;s won and that energizes Simba to<br />have this sort of final battle he leaps</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.940" end="01:22:45.380" style="s2">out from the<br />and they have a big fight and he pins</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.380" end="01:22:52.820" style="s2">him basically and the female lioness has<br />come to his aid and Simba tells him that</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.820" end="01:22:56.630" style="s2">again that he has to leave and so they<br />have a big fight that&#39;s a particularly</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.630" end="01:23:01.789" style="s2">good bit of animation so there&#39;s real<br />demonic aspect to scar they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.789" end="01:23:09.079" style="s2">King of Hell imagery and but he loses<br />and then ha he blames his minions he</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.079" end="01:23:11.929" style="s2">blames the hyenas for everything<br />terrible this happening forgetting that</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.929" end="01:23:15.979" style="s2">they can hear him and then he falls off<br />the cliff and the hyenas go in and</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.979" end="01:23:19.969" style="s2">finish him off<br />so it&#39;s pretty brutal ending for poor</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.969" end="01:23:27.349" style="s2">old scar eaten by his own minions and<br />then scars dead and Simba has one and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.349" end="01:23:30.289" style="s2">the rains come immediately and so what<br />does that mean well it means that when</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.289" end="01:23:33.979" style="s2">proper order is restored in a kingdom<br />then everything starts to flourish again</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.979" end="01:23:42.920" style="s2">and so the rains come and then while<br />it&#39;s raining Simba climbs up to the top</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.920" end="01:23:46.579" style="s2">of the rock and now he&#39;s completely<br />mature right that the facial the</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.579" end="01:23:49.610" style="s2">pathetic facial expression disappears<br />entirely knee straightens himself up</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.610" end="01:23:54.019" style="s2">because now he&#39;s full of serotonin after<br />having defeated good old scar and all</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.019" end="01:24:00.380" style="s2">the lionesses are roaring and he climbs<br />up Pride Rock and they roar at him which</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.380" end="01:24:03.710" style="s2">is good they&#39;re tough and he&#39;s tough and<br />they showing their teeth it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.710" end="01:24:10.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not a society of naive and harmless<br />creatures it&#39;s it&#39;s something that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.820" end="01:24:15.769" style="s2">some bite and the rains come and then<br />the next thing you see is the</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.769" end="01:24:19.280" style="s2">restoration of the kingdom and so<br />basically that what that means is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.280" end="01:24:24.139" style="s2">if the individual is willing to confront<br />their own shadow and then to take on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.139" end="01:24:28.550" style="s2">malevolent forces that continually<br />undermine society then harmony can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.550" end="01:24:33.739" style="s2">restored and everyone can do well and so<br />then we have a return to the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.739" end="01:24:41.440" style="s2">right and so Simba and nella are now a<br />couple along with Pumbaa and Timon and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.440" end="01:24:52.960" style="s2">they have a baby and Rafiki shows up and<br />does the same thing you know he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.960" end="01:24:57.980" style="s2">present the baby to the Sun and have all<br />the animals bow again and and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.980" end="01:25:03.340" style="s2">end of the movie so that&#39;s all packed</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.950" end="01:25:10.820" style="s2">that&#39;s all packed into an archetypal<br />tale and and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.820" end="01:25:16.130" style="s2">young would point out is that you all<br />understood this right while you were</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.130" end="01:25:21.739" style="s2">watching it because otherwise at some<br />level all these things made sense they</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.739" end="01:25:25.250" style="s2">all cohered and the narrative appeared<br />to be an appropriate narrative even when</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.250" end="01:25:30.620" style="s2">you&#39;re a little kid it because it<br />strikes a chord inside you and well that</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.620" end="01:25:34.730" style="s2">chord the thing that it strikes inside<br />you that&#39;s the archetype because if</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.730" end="01:25:38.390" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t something inside of you so<br />to speak that this could communicate</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.390" end="01:25:43.489" style="s2">with and it would fall on deaf ears and<br />it speaks to the part of you that&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.489" end="01:25:49.040" style="s2">particularly human and it&#39;s a story of<br />the development of the sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.040" end="01:25:51.650" style="s2">individual that&#39;s that&#39;s the right way<br />to think about it&#39;s a hero archetype</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.650" end="01:25:56.120" style="s2">that&#39;s another way of thinking about it<br />and people are going to get that story</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.120" end="01:26:00.860" style="s2">one way or another and now and then a<br />piece of public art comes along like</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.860" end="01:26:03.469" style="s2">this that does a good job of<br />encapsulating and it captures everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.469" end="01:26:08.719" style="s2">imagination and so that&#39;s why you&#39;ve all<br />seen it and why I presume you all</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.719" end="01:26:17.450" style="s2">enjoyed it when you were kids and maybe<br />still enjoy it now so well that was</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.450" end="01:26:20.180" style="s2">actually faster than I thought it would<br />be today so this is what I&#39;m gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.180" end="01:26:24.650" style="s2">we&#39;ve got 20 minutes so why don&#39;t you<br />think for a minute or two and I&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.650" end="01:26:28.610" style="s2">some questions which I don&#39;t often do<br />but and they can be any questions about</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.610" end="01:26:38.890" style="s2">anything we&#39;ve covered in class so take<br />a minute and yes</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.600" end="01:26:48.820" style="s2">- movie<br />you feel like you know the character but</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.820" end="01:26:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not exactly that character like<br />become so - you know can</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.760" end="01:27:02.719" style="s2">like it feels like you know for a wise<br />old man</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.719" end="01:27:08.550" style="s2">archetype yeah yeah well there&#39;s not<br />much difference between Gandalf and</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.550" end="01:27:12.390" style="s2">who&#39;s the wizard in Harry Potter<br />Dumbledore they could be the same guy</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.390" end="01:27:18.210" style="s2">it&#39;s right right and so well that that<br />is precisely the indication of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.210" end="01:27:23.610" style="s2">existence of an archetype it&#39;s like an a<br />movie one time a student asked me well</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.610" end="01:27:26.489" style="s2">if if there are these archetypes why<br />don&#39;t we just tell the archetype over</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.489" end="01:27:30.270" style="s2">and over why do we need fiction for<br />example which is like a bridge if</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.270" end="01:27:33.270" style="s2">there&#39;s individuals here and the<br />archetype is up here you know at a high</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.270" end="01:27:37.440" style="s2">level of abstraction fiction sort of<br />fills the gap between them and so what</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.440" end="01:27:41.400" style="s2">you want is a story that&#39;s archetypal so<br />that you understand its basic structure</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.400" end="01:27:45.150" style="s2">but you want enough variation and<br />specificity so that it&#39;s new and</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.150" end="01:27:49.530" style="s2">interesting and also applicable to you<br />so you have to humanize the archetype to</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.530" end="01:27:53.969" style="s2">some degree otherwise it&#39;s so abstract<br />you can&#39;t you can&#39;t relate to it and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.969" end="01:27:57.920" style="s2">good stories really do that they bridge<br />the gap and some of them are more</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.920" end="01:28:02.520" style="s2">personal and less archetypal but if<br />they&#39;re completely non archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.520" end="01:28:06.239" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing about them that captures<br />you it doesn&#39;t have any force and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.239" end="01:28:09.420" style="s2">if it&#39;s two archetypal well it gets to<br />be too abstract and you can&#39;t relate to</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.420" end="01:28:15.750" style="s2">it so good fiction writers and and good<br />purveyors of dramatic entertainment we</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.750" end="01:28:18.900" style="s2">think about it as entertainment are<br />really good at occupying that middle</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.900" end="01:28:23.940" style="s2">position so yeah and they reveal the<br />archetype through the individual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.940" end="01:28:28.590" style="s2">one way of thinking about it and and<br />that keeps it fresh and you know one of</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.590" end="01:28:33.870" style="s2">the things that you pointed out to was<br />that you&#39;re you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.870" end="01:28:36.750" style="s2">manifesting archetypal patterns of<br />behavior in your life whether you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.750" end="01:28:39.719" style="s2">it or not<br />even when you do something like fall in</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.719" end="01:28:43.920" style="s2">love because that&#39;s going to be a very<br />particular experience for you but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.920" end="01:28:49.620" style="s2">also a very common experience at the<br />same time right and and romance is older</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.620" end="01:28:54.870" style="s2">than people that&#39;s one way of looking<br />about looking at it I mean because sex</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.870" end="01:28:59.219" style="s2">is older than human beings and so you&#39;re<br />in the grip of something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.219" end="01:29:05.280" style="s2">ancient but at the same time it&#39;s really<br />personal and so a good novelist or a</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.280" end="01:29:08.760" style="s2">writer of fiction is able to capture<br />both the personal element of that to</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.760" end="01:29:14.489" style="s2">show show the transpersonal within the<br />personal and so and in some sense your</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.489" end="01:29:18.090" style="s2">destiny property<br />study from a union perspective is to</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.090" end="01:29:23.010" style="s2">consciously express an archetype and so<br />be the archetype there&#39;s a bunch of them</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.010" end="01:29:25.229" style="s2">but one of them would be the archetype<br />of the hero and you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.229" end="01:29:29.099" style="s2">manifest that in the conditions of your<br />own life so that makes the archetype</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.099" end="01:29:34.050" style="s2">real in the conditions of your own life<br />and Jung would also say that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.050" end="01:29:38.789" style="s2">doing that your experience will manifest<br />itself as meaningful and so it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.789" end="01:29:41.489" style="s2">in some sense you&#39;re acting in<br />accordance with your deepest instincts</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.489" end="01:29:45.929" style="s2">technically speaking right you&#39;re you&#39;re<br />acting out what it means to be human in</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.929" end="01:29:54.619" style="s2">the world and you&#39;re gonna find that<br />meaningful so yes</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.920" end="01:30:04.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.260" end="01:30:19.200" style="s2">like I just like because it&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.440" end="01:30:27.059" style="s2">process from life<br />like happy but is like appreciating to</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.059" end="01:30:30.199" style="s2">help so like</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.320" end="01:30:36.260" style="s2">you know like love and subsidies</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.970" end="01:30:45.270" style="s2">okay so the question is about the<br />relationship between the shadow and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.270" end="01:30:53.489" style="s2">okay so the first thing you have to<br />understand with regards to trying to</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.489" end="01:30:56.790" style="s2">come to terms with the conception of the<br />shadow is to understand the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.790" end="01:31:02.160" style="s2">persona and persona is the you that you<br />present when you want people to accept</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.160" end="01:31:13.920" style="s2">and like you often like let&#39;s say that<br />you go to a party and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.920" end="01:31:17.160" style="s2">impress the people that are there and<br />you&#39;re trying to get them to like you</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.160" end="01:31:23.460" style="s2">and so you maybe get jabbed out a little<br />bit and you laugh and you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.460" end="01:31:27.180" style="s2">you go along with everyone so that they<br />like you and then you go home and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.180" end="01:31:31.260" style="s2">bitterly resentful about the way that<br />you were put down at this party and</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.260" end="01:31:35.190" style="s2">that&#39;s going to make all sorts of<br />aggressive I wish I could have said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.190" end="01:31:39.360" style="s2">gonna make all sorts of aggressive and<br />vengeful thoughts sort of flashed</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.360" end="01:31:44.970" style="s2">through your imagination well the first<br />part of the problem is that you were too</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.970" end="01:31:48.750" style="s2">much persona right you sacrificed<br />yourself in some sense at the party so</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.750" end="01:31:54.180" style="s2">that people would like you and in the<br />second part you&#39;re refusing to admit to</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.180" end="01:31:57.930" style="s2">the existence of those elements of you<br />that would have actually protected you</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.930" end="01:32:01.920" style="s2">from doing that so let&#39;s say you go home<br />and you&#39;re all bitter and resentful and</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.920" end="01:32:07.200" style="s2">you have fantasies of revenge I mean<br />that reveals to you the shadow part of</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.200" end="01:32:11.100" style="s2">you that&#39;s aggressive and the thing is<br />you actually need that because if you</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.100" end="01:32:14.670" style="s2">would have integrated that more<br />successfully into your personality when</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.670" end="01:32:17.790" style="s2">you went to the party you wouldn&#39;t have<br />had lit you wouldn&#39;t have had to let</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.790" end="01:32:21.780" style="s2">people put you down to get them to like<br />you you know instead of having a face</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.780" end="01:32:27.060" style="s2">like this which says I&#39;ll take anything<br />that&#39;s coming my way you know you have a</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.060" end="01:32:31.830" style="s2">face and a stance that&#39;s more determined<br />and assertive and if you manifest that</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.830" end="01:32:34.160" style="s2">properly people aren&#39;t gonna mess with<br />you to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.160" end="01:32:38.250" style="s2">but you know you may have already<br />adopted a morality that says well I have</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.250" end="01:32:41.700" style="s2">to be likeable and I shouldn&#39;t do<br />anything that causes any conflict and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.700" end="01:32:46.200" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t ever you know hurt anybody&#39;s<br />feelings and so you&#39;re just to present</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.200" end="01:32:50.219" style="s2">yourself as a punching bag and you think<br />that that makes you a good person but it</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.219" end="01:32:54.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t and there&#39;s no integration of<br />the shadow in that situation</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.300" end="01:32:59.020" style="s2">so you see that at the end of the movie<br />we know I mentioned this when Simba</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.020" end="01:33:02.560" style="s2">climbs up the rock to take control of it<br />all the female lionesses bare their</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.560" end="01:33:07.420" style="s2">teeth and he roars it&#39;s like that<br />aggressiveness is integrated into him</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.420" end="01:33:13.239" style="s2">and so resentment is a really good<br />emotion for making contact with the</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.239" end="01:33:17.949" style="s2">shadow side because if you&#39;re resentful<br />about something it basically reveals two</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.949" end="01:33:22.150" style="s2">things it either means that you&#39;re<br />immature and you should stop whining and</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.150" end="01:33:26.140" style="s2">get on with things you know someone&#39;s<br />ass this often happens with adolescents</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.140" end="01:33:29.500" style="s2">who are asked say by their mother to<br />clean up the room they get all resentful</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.500" end="01:33:33.280" style="s2">about it it&#39;s like shut up and clean up<br />your room you know it&#39;s not that much to</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.280" end="01:33:40.020" style="s2">ask or so that can be a gateway into the<br />observation of your own immaturity or</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.020" end="01:33:44.560" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re resentful<br />because people really have been poking</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.560" end="01:33:49.510" style="s2">at you too much and taking and and<br />taking shots at you and oppressing you</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.510" end="01:33:53.770" style="s2">but what that means is that you&#39;ve got<br />some things to say that you haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.770" end="01:33:58.270" style="s2">willing to say or don&#39;t know how to say<br />right you can&#39;t stand up for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.270" end="01:34:02.830" style="s2">properly and in order to do that you<br />have to grow some teeth and be willing</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.830" end="01:34:06.190" style="s2">to use them and again that&#39;s something<br />that might violate your morality because</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.190" end="01:34:11.739" style="s2">you might say well I shouldn&#39;t be able<br />to bite people and the thing is yes you</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.739" end="01:34:15.580" style="s2">should be able to bite people hard and<br />if you&#39;re able to bite them then</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.580" end="01:34:19.690" style="s2">generally you don&#39;t have to but they<br />need to know that you can because</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.690" end="01:34:23.260" style="s2">otherwise especially people who are<br />badly socialized they&#39;ll just keep</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.260" end="01:34:26.469" style="s2">encroaching on you and encroaching on<br />you and encroaching on you and</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.469" end="01:34:31.510" style="s2">encroaching on you until you you put up<br />a wall like someone who&#39;s really well</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.510" end="01:34:37.420" style="s2">put together won&#39;t do that you know<br />because they&#39;re sophisticated but if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.420" end="01:34:41.710" style="s2">run into people who only have boundaries<br />because other people impose them on them</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.710" end="01:34:46.300" style="s2">and you won&#39;t do it you&#39;re gonna be the<br />bullied one in the office for example</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.300" end="01:34:50.380" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get a raise people<br />aren&#39;t gonna credit you with your own</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.380" end="01:34:54.130" style="s2">work other people are gonna take credit<br />for it you know and you&#39;re gonna go home</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.130" end="01:34:57.460" style="s2">angry because you&#39;re doing your best and<br />you&#39;re trying to get along with everyone</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.460" end="01:35:03.400" style="s2">and nothing ever goes your way well it&#39;s<br />because you&#39;re a pushover and you think</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.400" end="01:35:07.780" style="s2">that&#39;s good because you confuse<br />harmlessness with with with</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.780" end="01:35:11.860" style="s2">reality it&#39;s it&#39;s about it&#39;s not right<br />just because you can&#39;t do any damage</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.860" end="01:35:16.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean your morale just means your<br />you don&#39;t have the capability for mayhem</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.330" end="01:35:21.850" style="s2">and that makes you a pushover I mean the<br />yogya stuff is very very dark you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.850" end="01:35:27.340" style="s2">it&#39;s very dark because his notion of<br />what constitutes a moral human being is</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.340" end="01:35:32.620" style="s2">much different from the typical view he<br />really thinks you get that horrible side</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.620" end="01:35:36.340" style="s2">of yourself integrated so it&#39;s up there<br />where you can use it because otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.340" end="01:35:43.150" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re dangerous you can&#39;t say no<br />to people and you&#39;ll go along with the</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.150" end="01:35:46.810" style="s2">crowd and then if the crowd does<br />something particularly pathological</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.810" end="01:35:50.800" style="s2">which it&#39;s liable to do you won&#39;t be<br />able to resist it you won&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.800" end="01:35:57.040" style="s2">strength of character and so then you&#39;ll<br />fall prey to to crowd pathology and</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.040" end="01:36:01.180" style="s2">it&#39;ll be because you&#39;re too agreeable<br />with a you know with a shadow resentful</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.180" end="01:36:15.940" style="s2">side that the crowd and its murderous<br />intent is gonna act out so yes yes so</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.940" end="01:36:20.410" style="s2">the question is the relationship between<br />archetype archetypes and the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.410" end="01:36:25.090" style="s2">memes well<br />oh yeah that&#39;s a complicated one so</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.090" end="01:36:28.390" style="s2">Richard Dawkins was the guy who<br />originated the idea of meme and his</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.390" end="01:36:33.700" style="s2">notion was that you could produce an<br />idea or a set of ideas that had the</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.700" end="01:36:38.800" style="s2">capacity to propagate across minds for<br />whatever reason it was catchy let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.800" end="01:36:44.500" style="s2">like a like a song that gets stuck in<br />your head you know it and that those he</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.500" end="01:36:51.010" style="s2">called those memes which was sort of a<br />play on the idea of genes so there are</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.010" end="01:36:56.500" style="s2">these stable sets of ideas that can be<br />transferred across minds well I&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.500" end="01:36:59.590" style="s2">thought when I was reading Dawkins that<br />if he would have kept thinking he would</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.590" end="01:37:03.940" style="s2">have turned into Carl Jung because an<br />archetype is a meme but it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.940" end="01:37:08.230" style="s2">really really deep meme so you can<br />imagine that an idea has been sold</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.230" end="01:37:14.350" style="s2">around for so long and that people have<br />acted out for so long that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.350" end="01:37:21.240" style="s2">become part of the landscape that does<br />the selection so think about it this way</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.770" end="01:37:32.450" style="s2">so it&#39;s more or less a truism that if<br />you take a male dominance hierarchy the</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.450" end="01:37:35.930" style="s2">probability that the men at the top of<br />the hierarchy will leave offspring is</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.930" end="01:37:38.660" style="s2">much higher than the probability that<br />the men at the bottom will leave</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.660" end="01:37:42.650" style="s2">offspring and it&#39;s true in many many<br />species now there&#39;s a much higher</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.650" end="01:37:47.020" style="s2">probability of the average female<br />leaving offspring than the average man</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.020" end="01:37:53.840" style="s2">so so now then imagine that there&#39;s<br />characteristics that push a man up a</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.840" end="01:37:57.890" style="s2">dominance hierarchy okay and then<br />imagine that there are characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.890" end="01:38:03.950" style="s2">that push a man up a set of dominance<br />hierarchies so that each dominance</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.950" end="01:38:06.800" style="s2">hierarchy has something in common with<br />all of the others it&#39;s sort of like the</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.800" end="01:38:13.340" style="s2">idea of a good player of a game being a<br />good sport across games so then imagine</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.340" end="01:38:22.550" style="s2">that the idea of the successful male<br />starts to become encapsulated in in in</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.550" end="01:38:27.560" style="s2">biology because this species is going to<br />the male part of the species at least is</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.560" end="01:38:32.450" style="s2">going to be adapting to the selection<br />pressures placed on the male by the male</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.450" end="01:38:36.170" style="s2">dominance hierarchy so what happens is<br />you have a competition between men the</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.170" end="01:38:39.260" style="s2">men that win the competition find<br />partners in mate</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.260" end="01:38:45.230" style="s2">so the the male is going to start to<br />adapt to the fact of the selection</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.230" end="01:38:48.680" style="s2">that&#39;s implemented by the dominance<br />hierarchy then you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.680" end="01:38:52.630" style="s2">that&#39;s going to take case take place<br />across dominance hierarchies because</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.630" end="01:38:58.250" style="s2">this is happening in many many<br />situations spread across time and so</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.250" end="01:39:05.510" style="s2">then the idea of how the proper man<br />should act starts to become incorporated</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.510" end="01:39:09.830" style="s2">in the biology and also in the<br />expectations of the society and then</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.830" end="01:39:14.380" style="s2">that starts to loop so as the<br />expectations become clearer and clearer</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.380" end="01:39:19.370" style="s2">the notion of what it constitutes<br />success becomes clearer and clearer as</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.370" end="01:39:23.870" style="s2">well and the two things get tangled<br />together now and I think you can see</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.870" end="01:39:30.110" style="s2">that a manifestation of that whenever<br />you go watch a movie because you</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.110" end="01:39:35.210" style="s2">immediately identify the hero and you<br />identify with them it&#39;s like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.210" end="01:39:40.400" style="s2">the person that your mythological<br />imagination grasps on to and you play</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.400" end="01:39:44.750" style="s2">that out using your body as a<br />representational platform when you watch</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.750" end="01:39:49.820" style="s2">the movie and so maybe you admire the<br />hero if he&#39;s a successful hero you do</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.820" end="01:39:53.719" style="s2">well that admiration is the<br />manifestation of the instinct that</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.719" end="01:39:58.460" style="s2">drives you towards that kind of behavior<br />and not only can you manifest it in</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.460" end="01:40:01.969" style="s2">which case you&#39;re likely to feel good<br />about yourself because you know that</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.969" end="01:40:05.810" style="s2">sometimes you can feel good about<br />yourself and sometimes not but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.810" end="01:40:09.440" style="s2">also going to be able to recognize it<br />when you see it in the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.440" end="01:40:13.160" style="s2">going to manifest itself in admiration<br />and admiration is the proclivity to</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.160" end="01:40:21.890" style="s2">imitate so the meme can be soul so you<br />can imagine dominance hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.890" end="01:40:24.739" style="s2">very very old they&#39;re like 300 million<br />years old</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.739" end="01:40:29.540" style="s2">they&#39;ve been around a very long time and<br />the idea that we have an image of what</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.540" end="01:40:35.239" style="s2">it takes to climb the dominant targets<br />it&#39;s more or less self-evident because</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.239" end="01:40:40.670" style="s2">that&#39;s the landscape that selected us<br />and at the same time you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.670" end="01:40:45.830" style="s2">archetype the pattern that propagates<br />you up the dominant arc is also the same</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.830" end="01:40:50.440" style="s2">pattern that makes you attractive to<br />women they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.440" end="01:40:56.120" style="s2">so and of course that&#39;s a massively<br />powerful selection mechanism and sexual</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.120" end="01:41:00.260" style="s2">selection has really shaped human beings<br />it&#39;s turned us into what we are and</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.260" end="01:41:04.219" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting thing too because<br />you know this is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.219" end="01:41:10.690" style="s2">really bothers me about the emphasis of<br />evolutionary scientists on randomness</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.690" end="01:41:15.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like the the general mutation<br />generation process is random or quasi</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.770" end="01:41:19.190" style="s2">random we don&#39;t know that for sure<br />because there is evidence now that you</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.190" end="01:41:23.540" style="s2">can inherit acquired characteristics and<br />that was nobody thought that was</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.540" end="01:41:27.770" style="s2">possible 20 years ago so things are have<br />taken a very weird twist in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.770" end="01:41:31.670" style="s2">Darwinian world but for the sake of<br />argument we could say that the mutation</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.670" end="01:41:36.980" style="s2">process is random but the selection<br />process isn&#39;t random it&#39;s not even close</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.980" end="01:41:42.110" style="s2">to random ever since creatures have been<br />able to evaluate one another the</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.110" end="01:41:47.570" style="s2">selection process hasn&#39;t been random and<br />so basically we&#39;re selected by you could</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.570" end="01:41:51.410" style="s2">say by the manifestation of<br />mind in the world unless you believe</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.410" end="01:41:55.970" style="s2">that women for example exercise no<br />conscious choice in their made selection</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.970" end="01:42:00.560" style="s2">which seems completely absurd first of<br />all men consciously choose who&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.560" end="01:42:04.400" style="s2">to lead them at least in part you know<br />who&#39;s going to succeed in a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.400" end="01:42:09.080" style="s2">and women consciously choose their<br />sexual partners so the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.080" end="01:42:14.240" style="s2">selection process that the evolutionary<br />process is random is it&#39;s an absurd</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.240" end="01:42:18.500" style="s2">proposition sexual selection makes it<br />non-random and Darwin knew that he</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.500" end="01:42:23.030" style="s2">emphasized sexual selection a lot but<br />modern biologists since the time of</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.030" end="01:42:27.620" style="s2">Darwin except for the last about twenty<br />years down played the role of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.620" end="01:42:33.280" style="s2">selection and I think the reason for<br />that is that it brings mind into the</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.280" end="01:42:38.300" style="s2">evolutionary process in a way that they<br />don&#39;t like and no wonder it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.300" end="01:42:42.230" style="s2">complicated you know it&#39;s like to some<br />degree we&#39;re consciously directing our</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.230" end="01:42:48.550" style="s2">own evolution at least through the<br />mechanism of selection so</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.080" end="01:43:00.340" style="s2">yes yes well Dawkins just thought of<br />memes is something that weren&#39;t he never</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.340" end="01:43:03.190" style="s2">thought about them is something that<br />could last long enough to play a role in</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.190" end="01:43:08.380" style="s2">selection itself you know he thought<br />about the Moroz parasitical cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.380" end="01:43:12.610" style="s2">entities I would say that just sort of<br />floated on the surface of the mental</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.610" end="01:43:18.070" style="s2">landscape he never he never grappled<br />with the idea that a meme could be</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.070" end="01:43:24.990" style="s2">something that could last for hundreds<br />of millions of years roughly speaking so</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.160" end="01:43:34.570" style="s2">we got time for one more question if<br />anybody has yes yes from a political</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.570" end="01:43:38.140" style="s2">perspective like if you divide people by<br />their political affiliation it looks</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.140" end="01:43:45.280" style="s2">like liberal men are the most unhappy<br />they&#39;re higher in neuroticism</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.280" end="01:43:49.720" style="s2">I think the openness probably<br />contributes to it as well but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.720" end="01:43:53.560" style="s2">and also possibly the low<br />conscientiousness when my graduate</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.560" end="01:43:56.440" style="s2">students come in or one of the many ways<br />we&#39;re gonna talk about this in some</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.440" end="01:43:59.590" style="s2">detail because she&#39;s going to tell you<br />because we&#39;ve also looked at the</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.590" end="01:44:02.980" style="s2">personality predictors of political<br />correctness which is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.980" end="01:44:06.910" style="s2">interesting as well because it doesn&#39;t<br />really seem to fall exactly on the</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.910" end="01:44:11.800" style="s2">liberal conservative continuum so we&#39;ll<br />talk more about that when we get into</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.800" end="01:44:17.020" style="s2">the Big Five part of the course okay<br />good we&#39;ll see you on Thursday when</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.020" end="01:44:25.530" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do a speed review of<br />Freud</p>
