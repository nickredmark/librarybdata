so we'll continue with our unionanalysis of the Lion King today we ended
at the point where remember Mufasa hadtaken Simba up to the top of Pride Rock
and described to him the fact that hiskingdom essentially constituted
everything that the light touched andyou can think about that as the domain
of the roughly speaking of the greatfather with the domain of the great
mother on the outside of that beingsymbolically equivalent to the
underworld or to death or to nature allof those things seem to be approximately
equally true and he forbade Simba fromgoing to investigate what was beyond the
confines of the light and in some sensethat's exactly what a tradition does for
you it because the tradition isprecisely what defines the domain of the
light and to be moral from theperspective of the tradition it's akin
to playing a piagetian game but onlyadhering to the rules you know how
Piaget described the fact that when kidsfirst master a game they learned they
learn how to act it out and then theylearn what the rules are and then they
regard the rules in some sense as sacredyou can't go outside the rules and then
later in moral development if they getto that stage then they start to
recognize themselves also as formulatorsof the rule or formulators of the game
and culture tells you don't go beyondthe rules that's the definition of
morality within the box of culture andyou don't go outside of that and so
that's why Mufasa plays that particularrole and it's wise because if you go
outside the domain of what you alreadyunderstand then it's dangerous out there
clearly it's dangerous out there but thedownside of that particular message and
this is perhaps this is the mythologicalreason why Mufasa isn't as aware as he
could be of scaryou know his knowledge is bounded and
he's no I'm not aware enough of whatlies outside of that in this realm let's
say of death and destruction and so scaris he is able to overcome his his
brother one you see this sort of thinghappening to people very frequently for
example who developed post-traumaticstress disorder
and one of the things that's not as wellknown about post-traumatic stress
disorder as might be known is a ithappens to you if you encounter an
experience that sort of blows out theaxioms of your knowledge system that's
one way of looking at it it's sounexpected that you can't account for it
within the confines of this of thesystem that you're using to interpret
the world that often happens to peoplewhen they encounter something that's
truly malevolent and that can be withinthem or it can be in the form of someone
else who is genuinely out to hurt themthey're often people who develop PTSD
are often but not always somewhat naiveand they're not aware of the full
catastrophe of the world that might beone way of looking at it and then they
encounter someone who's truly out tohurt them and they can detect that even
in in the way the person's face looks orthey encounter a part of them that's
much more malevolent than they had everimagined it could possibly be and then
they do something terrible and then theydon't know what to do about it
so delay or the the Canadian Generalwrote a book called shake hands with the
devil and it was about what happened tohim in Rwanda when he was stationed
there as a UN warrior or a UN soldierand I mean Dallaire was not naive but
what he encountered was truly malevolentand it just blew him into pieces and and
that that's what happens and so there'sreal utility and staying within the
bounded domain but the problem is isthat there may be information that's
outside of that domain that youabsolutely need to know and so part of
the problem with being alive is that youhave to continually determine how much
you're going to maintain your stabilityand how much you're going to explore and
you have to explore because the stablepart of you gets outdated but if you
explore too much or too too unwiselythen you can encounter things that flip
you upside down it's actually one of theproblems with being high and trade
openness especially if you're also highin neuroticism because if you're open
you're creative you're always lookingfor for ideas that are outside of your
current systematic way of thinking butif you're high in eroticism so you
parents a lot of anxiety and emotionalpain and that sort of thing you can
continually upset your own apple cartnow the other thing that you might want
to think about this is really useful asfar as I'm concerned is you might want
to think about this politically andwe've been doing a lot of work I'm gonna
have one of my graduate studentsactually come and talk to you about the
work we've been doing on personality andPaul and political belief so what
happens with political belief is that ifyou're high in openness and low in
conscientiousness you tend to be aliberal the openness being the
particularly important part of that andif you're low in openness and high in
conscientiousness especially orderlinessyou tend to be a conservative now it's
kind of strange because openness andconscientiousness aren't very highly
correlated so it's not obvious why thosetwo traits would combine to determine
political belief and and therelationship is actually quite strong
between temperament and political beliefif you measure political belief
comprehensively but it seems to me thatthe fundamental distinction and this is
the political game at least along theliberal conservative axis this boils
down to one thing it boils down to howopen borders should be compared to how
close they should be and you know youcan see that reflected for example in
the attractiveness of Trump to a largepart of the general population because
he's going to close the borders build awall and fortify the borders and
conservatives like that they like tohave borders between things stay tight
and they don't even care if it's stateborders or political borders or town
borders or ethnic borders or bordersbetween ideas or borders between sexual
identities conservatives like to havethings stay in the damn box where they
belongpartly because they're orderly and
partly because they're lone opennessthey don't get any real they're not
interested in what happens if you freeup your conceptions all they see in that
is the probability of disorder whereasliberals who are high in openness and
low and conscientiousness slashorderliness they get a real charge out
of letting things out of the box so thatthey can creatively interplay now the
issue is who's correct and the answer isyou don't know because the environment
underneath the political landscape movesand so sometimes the right answer is
tighten up the borders and fortify andsometimes the right answer is no no
loosen things up because everything'sgood
to static and tight and we need moreinformation and the dialogue that occurs
in the political landscape with this iswhy dialogue is so important is
fundamentally between these two opposingviews of borders and because you can't
say with certainty which one is right atany given time an open dialogue has to
maintain itself so that the entirepolitical State can maneuver properly
along that moving line it's absolutelycrucial it's really really really useful
to know that people vote their damntemperament it gets you it gives you
more of an understanding at least inprinciple of your of those who sit on
the other side of you on the politicalfence and there's been recent newspaper
articles quite interesting I tweeted acouple of them about this company and UK
called Cambridge analytics and they'reusing the damn big five they can extract
out big five information from yourFacebook Likes they've got a model of
every single person in the United Statesbig five personality and they help Trump
craft political messages right down tothe level of apartment buildings to
appeal to people based on their Big Fivetemperament and that's all recent work
and so one of the things that's veryinteresting is we are teaching computers
to understand us so fast you can'tbelieve it and we really do risk walking
into an electronic world where you willonly see what you want to see I mean
obviously the marketers are trying to dothat as fast as possible right they only
want to send you ads that you're goingto be interested in because it's
expensive and foolish to send youanything that will annoy you or that
you'll ignore and so the marketers aretrying like mad to map who you are even
by watching your eyes they're trying tofigure out who you are so they can send
you the right information but the dangeris that that will happen say in the
domain of news and broader informationincreasing this tendency for people to
be siloed in their exposure to theexternal world it's a big sort of like
each of us is becoming a micro celebritysurrounded by electronic sycophants who
do nothing but tell us exactly what wewant to hear it's a real problem
Karl Popper a famous philosopher sciencesaid that one of the things that you
should do and this is akin to the PIAjetty and view is you should always look
for information that contradicts yourcur
viewpoint now that's painful rightbecause who wants their axioms
contradicted it can take you apart butit's the only way that you can ensure
that you're learning at the same timethat you're maintaining your stability
and that's another reason why it'sreally necessary to engage in dialogue
with people that you do not agree withbecause they're the ones who will tell
you things that you don't know it's crewit's crucial importance in the
maintenance of your own stability theworst thing that can happen to a person
know because there's many horriblethings that can happen to a person but
one of the worst things that can happenis that you find yourself in a situation
where no one is offering you correctivefeedback anymore because you rely on the
corrective feedback provided by otherpeople to keep yourself sane to keep
moving in the ever-changing environmentand if you cut yourself off from that
feedback then well then you end upstatic and shrinking it's really it's
really not good you get less and lesscompetent you get less and less
confident and the threats outside of youloom larger and larger so that's all to
do with the you know the domain outsidethe light see young would also say that
out in this domain that sort of beyondwhat you understand that's also where
you encounter the archetypes of thecollective unconscious now that's a
really really complicated idea but whathe means by that is that if you're put
outside the domain of your competenceyou're going to start to use fantasy to
organize your world so I can give you anexample of that so you you I presume
most of you are old enough to have aconscious memory of when the Twin Towers
came crashing down and so everybody inthe days after that was wandering around
like they were in the days and thereason they were in the days is because
well it wasn't exactly clear what fellright there was the physical towers fell
but that was only a tiny bit of theproblem because those physical towers
were embedded in a network of meaninglike a very very sophisticated network
of meaning but also a political networkand an economic network and a military
network and like they're they're nodesinside a very complex system and so when
they come crashing down you don't knowwhat's come crashing down right so
you're out there in the unknown and andwondering what's going on and wandering
around in the days which is exactly whathappened to people and then what bush
didGeorge W was immediately turned that
into a good versus evil drama instantlyand that's an archetypal idea so that's
when he came up with the idea of theaxis of evil I think that was Iran North
Korea and I don't remember the other oneat the moment but but he yeah he
immediately turned the politicallandscape into a good versus evil drama
and he said to everyone in the worldthat they were either with him or
against him fundamentally and that wasthe that was part of the retreating into
a I guess a more protected landscapethat's one of the ways that human beings
deal with the encounter with a traumaticthreat and so the reason you meet the
unconscious and even the collectiveunconscious on the border of your
knowledge is because when you hit theborder of your knowledge you start to
use fantasy in order to bring the thenewest form of order out of the unknown
so that you can start to make sense outof it and that's what artists always do
that's what they do and so from theUnion perspective people who are engaged
in creative art are the ones who are onthe perimeter of knowledge structures
and so what they're doing is taking theabsolute unknown which would be in
Rumsfeld terms they're unknown unknownsand turning them into partially known
unknowns that's what an artist does andand especially the more classical
artists who deal with mythological andreligious themes which was the case for
art right up until really until the late20th century
they're they're using these mythologicalideas to sort of extend the domain of
human knowledge out beyond its currentparameters and so artists do that and
literary people do that and anddramatists do that and they help us
extend our knowledge now that's whereopen people live that's another way of
thinking about so think about it thisway so you're in a city you know what
and the city has parts of it thatdegenerate and so you could think about
that as order degenerating into chaosand then the open people who are
creative come along and they find placesin the city that have degenerated but
that still have interesting potentialright and then they move in there where
it's cheap to and they start producingart they start producing galleries and
then the coffee shops move in and thenthe thing starts to get civilized and
then of course the moreall conservative types move in those
would be the yuppies roughly speaking sothey're they're much more conservative
than the artists but they're stillliberal compared to the bulk of the
population and so the more daring peoplemove in after the artists have civilized
it and then after that you know then thechain stores start to move in and soon
it's completely turned into Zellers orsomething like that and then the artists
have to go somewhere else and findanother place on the boundary where they
can live and it's a fizzy elizacass muchas a mental boundary and so you because
you think each of those personalitytraits there's five dimensions each of
them represent the possibility ofinhabiting a kind of niche right an
ecological niche so if you're anextroverted person your niche is the
social environment if you're anintroverted person the niches I think
nature I don't know that for surebecause I've never figured out exactly
what introverts are adapted to but it'snot exactly the social world if you're
agreeable then your niches relationshipsif you're disagreeable your niches
competition if you're conscientious yourniche is duty and effort and so and and
that those niches are partly socialbecause so much of our environment is
social but they're also partly naturalbecause our social being is nested
inside the natural world and so you canthink about the big five traits as
different kinds of adaptations todifferent kinds of niches and that's the
niche that the open people the openexploratory types occupy so that seems
to make a higher-order super factorextraversion and openness called
plasticity as opposed to stability whichis conscientiousness agreeableness and
emotional stability and there's a playoff between those two things because the
stable people obviously are stable butthe plastic types of people are more
dynamic and they're they're moreconcerned with transformation and in
order to get a system optimally stableand dynamic you have to have a continual
interplay of those of those factorsbecause static doesn't work because
everything changes that's the problemwith conservatism and the problem with
liberalism fundamentally is yeseverything changes but you have to bring
forward some structures from the past soit's very it's very very difficult to
get that balance correct soall right so anyways out there in the
underworld in the place beyond yourcurrent conceptualizations that's the
place of death and nature and it'sbeyond the light and it's also the place
of Hell and that's what you see here andwhat do you how do you conceptualize
that well one of the things you'll seeif you're interested in this sort of
thing if you ever go read the writingsof the Columbine killers the teens
they're very interesting they're verymuch worth reading especially I think
it's Dylan Klebold who was the moreliterate of the two but he tells you
exactly where he went after brooding andbrooding and brooding on his his
isolation and segregation from mankindso he's out there beyond he's out there
in a chaotic domain and because he'stortured by that his thoughts take an
unbelievably dark turn like it'sunimaginably dark if you're interested
in that sort of thing you could readthat there's another book you could read
called panzram PA and Zed ra m and it'sa fascinating book it's about this guy
who I think he raped 1200 men so thatsort of tells you what sort of guy he
was extraordinarily physically powerfuland brutal and malevolent and he was
kind of a juvenile delinquent type andthey put him in a reform school and he
was not well treated in that reformschool it's sort of like the worst of
the Canadian residential schools andwhen he came out he was not a happy boy
and so he spent the rest of his lifetrying to be as destructive as he could
possibly imagine and purely consciouslywith malevolent intent and then and and
believe me he was pretty destructive hekept track of the dollar value of all
the buildings he burned down he tried tostart a war between Britain and the
United States like he was all out forall-out mayhem his dying words they're
gonna hang him he told the guy who wasgoing to hang him he said hurry up you
who's your bastard I could kill 12 menin the time it takes you to hang me and
that's exactly the sort of person he wasand he made friends with this physician
in the in the prison who he thought waslike the first person who ever did
something nice for him gave him a dollarfor cigarettes if I remember correctly
and the physician encouraged him towrite his autobiography and so he did
and it's it's available and so if youwant a view because you know you you
always think of people you think wellpeople have good intentions you know
that you especially think that if you'renaive and agreeable so all of you who
are sitting there out there thinkingpeople have good intentions you're
probably high in agreeableness butthat's not always the case
people can have very dark motivationsthat are fully conscious and very well
elaborated and panzram was know he wassmart and his book is very well written
and he tells you exactly why he thoughtthe way he thought and so it's a good
glimpse of exactly this sort of thingwhere you can get to if you want to by
brooding on your specific misfortune youknow and his his basic credo was that
human beings were so reprehensible thatthey should just be eliminated and
believe me that's what he was trying todo and these people who do terrible
things like the Columbine shootersthat's exactly what for black of a
better word they're possessed by itssheer malevolence and the Columbine kids
had a much more spectacular catastropheplanned than the one that actually
occurred and they knew it was going tobe a full-blown media circus and lots of
these people who engage in those sortsof mass murders they know about the
other mass murders and they're engagedin a competition and the competition is
who can do the most brutal thing thefastest something like that so you can't
just be thinking about people who've youknow who have good intentions but have
somehow gone wrong if you ever meetsomeone who isn't like that and you
think that you're just a tree with ripefruit to be plucked so you don't want to
be in that situation you have to keepyour eyes open and so anyways that's
basically what's encapsulated in thispart of the story now the hyenas go
after the little lion obviously but theymanaged to escape
it's very malevolent scene and Mufasashows up at the last minute to rescue
them so and you know that there's also amythological trope there which is that
if you go outside your domain ofconfidence and you encounter something
you don't understand the first thingthat you're going to do is look to the
knowledge structures that you alreadypossess to explain it right and that's
the you could say from a symbolicperspective that that's the
manifestation of the father as of coursethat's what you're going to do and you
you know what's really interesting- is because I've had a lot of clients
who've had PTSD and and withoutexception every single one of them was
induced by one form of malevolence oranother they have to develop a very
sophisticated philosophy of good andevil to get out of it because they have
a worldview in which those things don'treally exist there's no such thing as
pure malevolence well that's fine unlessyou encounter it and then as soon as you
encounter it as soon as you encounter ityou won't know what to do and then you
won't be able to get on with your lifeyou'll do nothing but think about that
and think about it and think about itand think about it'll disrupt your sleep
it'll put you into a permanent state ofpreparation for action because the part
of your brain that's detected that whichin my estimation by the way is the same
part at least in part that detectssnakes it's the same damn circuit once
it's seen something like that it is notgonna let you go till you figure it out
and that's basically what post-traumaticstress disorder is and you know to some
degree each of you will have experiencedthat maybe not all of you in here but
many of you and you can tell that so ifyou go back and you think about your
past and you have any memory that's morethan about eighteen months old and when
you think about it it produces a fairbit of negative emotion then that's like
a minute that's like a place wherethere's a mini post-traumatic stress
problem and what's happened you rememberI showed you that hierarchy moving from
tiny motor actions all the way up tohigh order abstractions well you can
imagine say you have good person at thetop and and you you kind of use that
that scenario to construe other peoplepeople are basically good well then you
run into someone who is not good andboom the whole bloody system comes
tumbling down because it's violated thathighest order axiom
so that's post-traumatic stress disorderif something has violated an axiom
that's more differentiated you knowcloser to the actual motor output not
quite so high in the abstraction chainthen all it does is wipe out that part
of the structure it doesn't wipe out thewhole thing and you can tell if you have
holes in your perceptual value structureby checking to see if you have memories
that are still alive in a negative waythat are old enough so that they should
have been incorporated into yourpersonality and so one of the things you
can doyou're doing one of the exercises that's
on myself authoring site you guys do thepersonality analysis but there's another
program there called the that's calledthe past authoring where you write down
an autobiography and thinking throughthese things that have happened to you
in your past that are negative is a goodway of making them go away and thinking
them through kind of means you have tofigure out what happened right and then
you sort of have to figure out how tomake it not happen again what you're
trying to derive is some kind of causalanalysis how is it that I was put into a
situation where I was made vulnerableyou know and that could be well because
you're only four and you couldn'tprotect yourself and now it's time to
update that because you're a fullyfunctioning adult or there may be things
that you have to think through andchange in your own personality or
attitudes that you've been holding on tosince you were tiny I have this client
once and she came in and told me thatshe had been sexually assaulted by her
older brother and she told me the storyand I kind of got the impression that
maybe she was like eight and he was like17 or something like that and she was
about 27 when she came and talked to meand then I found out by further
questioning that she was 4 and he was 6and I thought she still had this story
in her head of her being tormented bythis older person right that's how she
told the story and what I told her waswell look another way of looking at this
is that you two were very badlysupervised children because I mean he
was 6 for God's sake you know he's alittle kid that doesn't mean that what
happened to her was any less traumaticbut but he wasn't 17 right if the story
was different than the one she had inher head and you know by the time she
left after we had that conversation itwas clear that the way that she was
construing the experience had radicallyshifted and it was very interesting
because you know you think of the pastas fixed but and it is in some sense but
the reason you remember the past isn'tto make an objectively accurate record
of the past it's so that you can use theinformation in the past to prepare you
for the future and your mind won't leaveyou alone unless that has happened so if
you've encountered something that'snegative and you don't know why and you
don't know what to do about it if thathave
again in the future then that will staywith you and I think one of the things
that does too is it increases youroverall physiological load is actually
physiologists who've been talking aboutthis I can't remember the damn phrase
but you could imagine that your mind isdoing something like this all the time
it's it's it's it's got a record in somesense of your autobiographical
experiences and what it's doing iscalculating how frequently you've been
successful versus unsuccessful and themore frequently that you've been
successful the higher you are up on thedominance hierarchy that's one
possibility so your serotonin levels goup and you're calmer but also it's
reasonable to assume that theenvironment is less dangerous right
because that's sort of what constitutesdanger you're somewhere in and you act
and and something you don't want to havehappen happens that's danger and so your
brain is always trying to figure out howto calibrate how anxious you should be
and one of the things that does is bysort of keeping track of your past
success failure ratio and so to thedegree that your past has been
characterized by will call them failuresthat those are situations where you do
not get what you want then your yourbody your brain puts your body on
constant alert because if everythingthat you've done has resulted in
catastrophethen you're somewhere insanely dangerous
and you should be like like a you knowlike a prey animal that's ready to dart
in any direction and how much you shouldbe a prey animal is dependent on it's an
estimate partly your trait neuroticismpartly your your success as adjudicated
by other people right because they'llpop you up the doorman its hierarchy if
you've been successful but also partlyon your record of failures and successes
in the past and so you can go back andyou can find out where you have holes in
your in the structure through whichyou're viewing the world that's one way
of looking at it and you can sew thosethings up and that's a very that's in
some sense that's what you're doing inpsychotherapy you know partly it's
exposure to things you're afraid of anddisgusted by and are likely to avoid
that's a huge chunk of it but if you goback into your past and you start
talking those things through it's reallythe same thing it's more abstracted so
Freud of course was always whenhe was doing his free association
process with his clients he'd find thatif he just let them talk that their
speech would circle until it hit a placelike that where they were confused and
doubtful and then their speech wouldsort of wander around that and and then
they'd have an emotional expression thatwas a consequence of that he thought the
emotional expression was what wascurative it was cathartic in his terms
but later James Pennebaker upon whomthese writing exercises I described his
research it is based on that my read myexercises are based on his research he
found that if you brought collegestudents into the to the lab and you had
them write for 15 minutes three timesover three days about the worst thing
that had ever happened to them or theworst thing they ever did if I remember
correctly they got worse in the shortterm but better in the long run for
example they went visited the doctorless and markers of their physical
health improved and so I think thereason for that is because what does
that called is called something loadjust about it got it right from the
physiologist it doesn't matterthey got healthier as far as I can tell
because they basically calmed down oncethey had gone through the negative
memory and sorted it out properly andtold a properly articulated story and
figured out how to deal with it thentheir physiology calmed down and so then
they weren't as stressed they weren'tproducing as much cortisol and so
cortisol suppresses your immune functionand so they were more likely to stay
healthy and so well so that's all verymuch we're thinking about that's all in
the domain outside of the light that'sone way of thinking about it now of
course Simba and his and what's thegirl's name
mala yeah they're you know pretty cowedabout what has happened because they
sort of stumbled stupidly out into theunknown they stumbled foolishly out into
the unknown and this actually highlightsanother union archetype and that's the
archetype of the trickster and thetrickster is like the Joker in the
king's court and the trickster issomeone who will be or play the fool and
the thing about the fool is that thefool is close to the truth because you
can't learn anything new unless you'rewilling to be
fool right you know what that's like youyou know exactly what that's like your
chart you have to master a new skill butyou're avoiding it because you know that
you'll be bad at it when you first do itand if you're perfectionistic you're
gonna say well I can't allow myself tobe bad at anything I can't allow myself
to be a fool and no wonder but theproblem is is when you try something new
you're always a fool and so unlessyou're willing to be a fool you can't
learn anything new and that's also whyyou can regarded the trickster as the
precursor to the Savior architect Leespeaking is because you cannot do the
right thing unless you're willing to bea fool first and that's really worth
knowing lots of times you guys are gonnamake a stage transition in your life and
you're gonna feel like an imposter whenyou get a new job or when you get a
promotion or something like that you'regonna feel like an imposter and you are
because what do you know when you makethat first transition right but it's
gonna make you embarrassed and it'sgonna make you ashamed and all of those
things but you have to understand thatyou are a fool when you first try
something new but you're a worse fool ifyou don't try it now that doesn't mean
you should you know make like you knoweverything as soon as you're promoted or
you have some transition in statusthat's that's foolish of the wrong sort
but to know that to know that you haveto be fallible in order to progress is
an unbelievably useful thing it can freeyou up you know what I was talking to a
writer the other day about his processfor beginning writing he's written many
books he writes a very very very badfirst draft right and that's a good way
to think about things is throughout yourlife you're gonna be doing that is
writing the next draft of you and it'spretty bad to begin with but that's okay
because it isn't gonna get any betterunless you put yourself out into the
domain of the unknown to begin with andyou know you might you might it might go
badly I mean that's what happens here
anyways Mufasa has a chat with Simba andyou know tells him that he's he did what
he wasn't supposed to do although youknow even in that situation with fauces
discipline is paradoxical becausethere's part of him because he's
reasonably wise that knows that breakingthe rules like that is actually
necessaryeven though you still have to say play
by the damn rules you know you have toleave that door open so that the rules
can be broken an appropriate amount sohe forgives him and and and peace is
made between them and then they're therethey involve themselves in sort of
gazing at the night sky and so the twoof them do that together and the night
sky is an interesting place you knowbecause that's where the absolute
unknown resides and one of the thingsyoung wrote a lot about was astrology
strangely enough slash astronomy and oneof young contentions this is a very
interesting one was that because thenight sky was completely unknown people
could project their fantasies into itand that's what they did without with
astrology so astrology is thiscumulative fantasy that's going on in
the in that roughly speaking in the deepunconscious projected on to the sky and
so if you analyze old astrologicalwritings what you're really doing is
analyzing old fantasies and because ofthat you could develop some insight into
the structure of the mind and so he didthe same thing with alchemy and his
later writings which are very verydifficult to understand but extremely
worthwhile ok so anyways back to the tothe hellish domain now I told you that
that domain that's outside of knowledgeyou could think about that as the
underworld or you can think about it asnature the negative element of nature in
particular and so I mentioned that oneelement of that is hellish and that's
exactly what the movie explains next itdoes exactly that we go back out to this
domain that scar the adversary or thenegative king that's another way of
looking at him this is his his thedomain over which he rules and so you
can see him there surrounded in firesame ideas the you know as the hyenas
surrounded by fire earlier although thisis green fire and smoke which I think is
even worse and this is where the moviestarts to draw on essentially Nazi
symbolism at least the symbolism oftotalitarian states and you know you
think about you think about atotalitarian state you think about the
Nazis and they're goose-steppingwhat's happening is that every single
person in the military becomes anidentical unit right a unit they're all
uniform and they're all in some senseimitating
The Dictator in in an absolutely perfectway and so the dictator wants to impose
strict uniformity on the entirepopulation that's order order and one of
the things we've discovered that'sreally interesting is that discussed
sensitivity is associated withorderliness and that's associated with
conscientiousness and one of the thingsabout Hitler was that he was very
disgust sensitive and a lot of hishatred for non-aryans so imagine inside
the aryan box it was all uniform outsideit was all parasites and predators and
so and that was a manifestation ofdisgust not of fear it's a whole
different thingand if you read Hitler's table talk
which is a collection of his spontaneousdinner speeches from 1939 to 1940 - it's
a very interesting book you see that hismetaphor for the Aryan race was a body a
pure bodyunof salted by parasites or predators
and that he was trying to erect a borderaround it to keep all of that away
so it's an immunological disgust likemetaphor and there's some recent work
that was published in PLoS ONE aboutthree years ago showing that brilliant
study should have got much moreattention showing that if you went
around and looked and sampled politicalattitudes in different countries or even
within the same country what you foundwas that the higher the prevalence of
infectious diseases the higher theprobability of totalitarian political
attitudes at the local level and you canimagine well what happens if there's
infectious diseases is you want to putborders around everything you don't want
free movement between ideas or peoplebecause that's partly how the disease
spreads you're going to have much morestrict sexual rules for example because
that's a great way for diseases to betransmitted and before Hitler went on
his rampage against the non-aryans he'dcleaned up all the factories and like he
went in there and fumigated them it waspart of the law he went on a public
health campaign to get rid oftuberculosis and he got rid of the bugs
in the factories as well he used cycloneB that's an insecticide and that's the
gas that he used in the gas chamberseventually so first it was the bugs in
the rats and then it was people who werethen it was euthanasia that was the neck
move and forced you euthanasia and thethe rationale for that was compassion by
the way just so you all know it's it'sit's merciful to put these people who
are burdensome to themselves and theirfamilies and the state who are living
second-rate lives its merciful toeuthanize them and that was a huge
campaign in Germany it was after thatthat the more racial purifications began
and so that's the disgust thing that'sunbelievably important it's it's it's
because lots of times people think thatconservatives are more anxiety sensitive
than liberals and that's why they'reclosed in terms of their ideas that
doesn't look rightfirst of all conservatives are less
neurotic than liberals although theeffect isn't that big so it doesn't look
and they actually are there they scorehigher in measures of well-being the
most unhappy people are liberal men bythe way so but you know people are often
accused if they're conservative of beingfearful and that's why they you know
suppress other people's viewpoints butthat doesn't look right it's low
openness and high orderliness and thatlooks like it's associated with disgust
and that looks like it's associated withsomething called the extended immune
system which is the proclivity of peopleto to keep themselves away from
potential sources of contamination it'sreally terrifying because one of the
things people often said about Germanywas that you know it was a very
civilized country and yet it descendedinto barbarity
but conscientiousness is a very goodpredictor of long-term success and so
you could say well conscientioussocieties are more civilized but they're
also more orderly and that makes themmore discussed sensitive and so what it
might have easily might have easily beenin Germany was that it was an excess of
civilization rather than its lack thatproduced exactly these consequences and
that's a far more frighteningproposition and one that's I believe
much more likely to be true Hitlerbathed four times a day and he was also
an admirer of willpower so he couldstand like this for eight hours in the
back of a car and the thing aboutconscientious people is they're very
willpower oriented and so if you'reunfortunate enough to be sick
chronically in the house of someonewho's conscientious
if it's a mental illness you're morelikely to relapse because the
conscientious person is going to bejudgmental and they're going to say to
you if you're schizophrenic they'regoing to say well if you just organize
yourself and get up in the morning andtry a little harder
you could overcome this which is ofcourse true except you can't because
you're schizophrenic and so the pressureput on you by the anger and the contempt
is going to increase the probabilitythat you'll relapse so orderly people
are very judgmental and you knoworderliness is very highly associated
with things like anorexia and theanorexic is basically someone who's so
disgust sensitive that they becomeunable to tolerate their own body and
they see it as a source of corruptionand imperfection which of course is
exactly right it is and it's verydifficult thing to maintain order around
so anyways so what happens out here inthis terrible domain where scar rules is
that things turn into a totalitarianstate you know and he's presented here
as as a Nazi like leader and see there'sanother thing that's really interesting
this even deeper than this from amythological perspective I don't know if
I can even go into it well not really Iguess what I'll have to do is satisfy
myself with this observation there'salways been some antagonism for example
between the Catholic Church andrationalism and everyone knows that it's
a very long-standing antagonism thatsort of runs its way through at least
the last thousand years or so of Westerncivilization and the people who regarded
kaathal catholics as antithetical toscience
take the Catholics to task for that anddescribing it as prejudicial and super
and superstitious and fair enoughbut there's something else going on
there that's more important and that'sthe observation and this is at a deep
level again the observation thatrationality has one big problem so it's
it can easily become arrogant andbelieve in its own theories so if you're
smart and there's gonna be some of youpeople who are like that to some of you
your primary the primary trait thatdistinguishes you from other people over
the course of your whole life was thatyou are more intelligent than most and
you may have staked your identity onthat and an over value
and rationality and the problem withthat is that you you make a theory of
the world and then you tend to assumethat it's 100% correct that's the
tendency to fall in love with your owntheories and that's what a totalitarian
does the totalitarian says here's thedamn theory and it's exactly right and
you're gonna act it out exactly and ifyou don't well we've got some special
treats in mind for you and one of themost terrible things that that I
encountered while reading abouttotalitarianism and this was even more
true of the Soviet Union under Stalinwas that the true believers and and
there were many of them we're in aterrible position because according to
their own doctrine they're alreadyinvolved in the process that was going
to bring utopia to mankind the problemshad already been solved but many of them
were still suffering terribly asindividuals but if you're a totalitarian
believer in Utopia your own sufferingbecomes heretical right because your
suffering is an indication that the damntheory isn't correct and so then you're
in a terrible position because youeither admit that the theory isn't
correct and fall apart because of thatand maybe face terrible punishment as
well or you have to separate yourselffrom your own suffering and lie about it
fundamentally and of course that'sexactly what happened in places like the
Soviet Union where everyone lied abouteverything all of the time to themselves
to their family members to their friendsthe entire system was completely
permeated by lies and so you get thisterrible place that scars the ruler over
which is totalitarian and brutal andmurderous and resentful and deceitful
and arrogant all at the same time andthat's brought about so mmm-hmm the
columbine guys for example when they'rejustifying their murderous nests and
their plans to shoot up the schools theykeep making reference to the fact that
people had slighted them for example youknow and insulted them and that they
were alienated they weren't bulliedexactly the way the press made it out I
don't know if they were bullied anymorethan people usually are in high school
but they took their alienationpersonally and we
guarded that their isolation from commonhumanity as indication of the pathology
of everything and then they went out todestroy and that's exactly what this
sort of thing represents that's theuniformity and you see he's got this
kind of vicious grin on his face whichis malicious and and pleased all at the
same time there's no fear in thatit'sit's quite quite the opposite and
there's another image of you know usingwhat's essentially imagery of Hell which
everyone understands strangely enoughand that associates him with the
crescent moon and the crescent moon iswell it's a symbol of darkness and and
the underworld fundamentally so allright so anyway so that's we see the the
underworld we see that which bullet liesbeyond the light and in there we see a
fragment of that that's basicallyhellish and all of that's incorporated
into the story and everyone understandsthat when they see it even without I
would say the overt references to Nazismokay so now scar has a plan he's going
to kill the king and he's going to dothat by putting what the King loves in
danger and so scar feigning sympathy hasenticed Simba down into this ravine and
scars minions are going to cause awildebeest stampede right so a mindless
stampede to to to put to put Simba indanger and so that's what happens here
the Whale debate start to march into theravine and everyone is making a scar
tells Mufasa that Simba is down in thatravine and entices him down there and so
they're all off running to see if theycan save Simba and then you see Mufasa
running in front of the wildebeest herdtrying to try to find his son and trying
to stay ahead of them the mad mob that'sput his son in danger and so he tries to
escape climbing up the Butte which isalmost a sheer cliff and when it gets to
the top mmm his brother is waiting forhim there and he asks him to pull him up
and scar basically before heindicates that he's betraying him and
puts his claws into Moo fusses paws andthrows him off the cliff and so that's
that and it's a sad part of the storyit's a hard part that's very hard on
kids because the father has died and youknow it's a rare kid who won't cry about
that scene in particular where you seeSimba very upset and his father dying
now this is a hard part of the story tointerpret and I don't know if it's
because of my lack of ability tointerpret her because the story takes a
weird twist here but there-there is thisconfusion in the story about whether
Simba is an innocent victim who set upfor the murder of his father or whether
he actually bears some guilt for it youknow and he's broken some rules and and
that and and so on so he's not exactlyplaced in the position of innocence but
of course he's also been set up by scarin any case scar tells him that it's his
fault pure and pure and that because ofthat he's going to have to leave he's
gonna have to be banished beyond thekingdom now you see this motif quite
quite frequently in heroes stories wherethe hero has to be raised outside of the
kingdom that happens with King Arthurfor example and it happens with Harry
Potter right because Harry Potter israised by muggles instead of being
inside the Magic Kingdom so it's a verycommon theme and partly what it means is
that it means two things one is that youdo grow up alienated from your culture
to some degree there's no way aroundthat because the culture doesn't match
you perfectly and it doesn't work foryou perfectly and it's old and it's kind
of corrupt and it alienates you as it'sshaping you and so you're going to
develop some separation from it and yousee that in intergenerational rhetoric
you know we're the new generation hasthe proclivity to blame the previous
generation for everything that's wrongwith the current system and fair enough
you know because you do inheriteverything that's wrong of course you
also inherit everything that's goingwell which is a good thing to also
notice but the idea is that you can'thelp but be alienated from let's call it
the patriarchy for for lack of a betterword because it's got a tyrannical
element and because it's not matchedwell to you so but then there's also
this other issue which is well maybeyou're not being successful by the terms
that are by the values that areinstantiated in the current system and
you might say well that's because thesystem is set up in an unfair manner and
fair enough but it's also possiblybecause you're just not very good at
acting out those values right so part ofthe reason you get alienated from your
culture is because the culture iscorrupt but another part of the reason
is you're just not doing as well as youcould be you're not playing by the rules
properly and so you get alienated andyou're unsuccessful because of your own
inadequacies and so the movie plays bothof those it's obviously Simba is set up
but there is an intimation that he's notentirely blameless as well anyways he's
very broken up about this and no wonderit's also partly a story of the
emergence of adolescence because youknow when you're a child and you're
ensconced right inside the familialframework then you sort of exist within
that system of rules like you wouldunder the piagetian scheme but when you
become an adolescent then there's muchmore of a proclivity to break free and
to start breaking rules and so that'salso akin in some sense to the death of
the father and that's a necessarydevelopmental stage anyway scar comes
down into the ravine it's all foggy nowbecause that goes along with the sort of
murkiness of death and tells Simba thatit's his fault and that he's going to
have to leave he's going to have toleave the kingdom of his father which
makes sense now his father's dead so howare you gonna once your father has died
how are you going to stay around in hiskingdom so to speak so and then scar
tries to get these hyenas to go trackSimba down and kill him so and Zazu goes
back to tell all the rest of the Lionsthat Mufasa is dead and that Simba has
disappeared and then scar takes overPride Rock and so what's happened now is
the malevolent element of the King hasobtained control over
state right and so this is the king thewise King wasn't paying enough attention
that's one way of looking at it and sothe malevolent part of the state has now
got control this is a very very old ideaI've traced it back at least several
thousand years in its in itsrepresentation in stories you can see it
in Egyptian mythology for example so theidea is that as the social structure
builds in complexity it offers you theprotection of a functioning complex
system but it also becomes increasinglylikely to turn into a tyranny and
because it's more and more powerful thefact of its potential for tyranny
becomes more and more of a danger and sothen the question is well what are the
factors that encourages it turning intoa tyranny and one factor would be the
wise part of it is not paying enoughattention to the malevolent part of it
and you could say that's true at thestate level it's also true at the
individual level right you have to watchyour own proclivity to upset yourself
and other people and and take that intoaccount and pay careful attention to it
because otherwise it can gain controlespecially because you're gonna avoid
looking at it and one of thecharacteristics of the wise King who
gets overthrown by the tyrant is that hehas an evil brother and he won't pay
enough attention to him he avoids hedoesn't look and so the the evil King
gets the upper hand and that's what'shappened here and so notice now he takes
possession of Pride Rock not in fulldaylight right but at night so that ties
his rule into the rule of unconsciousprocesses and and malevolence
alright so Simba runs away from thekingdom out into the desert now why is
that well you remember maybe youremember and maybe you don't maybe don't
know it the story of Exodus when Mosestakes the Hebrews out of Egypt they end
up in a desert well why well it'sbecause when you leave Kingdom no matter
how ironical you still fall intodisorder you're out in a place that's
desert there's no civilization there youknow that's what happened to Iraq after
the Americans went in you know the theAmericans the neo-cons were all
convinced that the Iraqis would Ohwelcome
with open arms and there would be thissmooth transition to democracy same idea
and Libya it's like no that's not whathappens what happens is the state
devolves into a desert chaos and maybethen you can make order but probably not
and so Simba has left the kingdom andthe first thing that happens is he damn
near dies in the desert and so you knowif you have an old belief system and
it's not working very well and youabandon it well good for you because
you're out of the old belief system butnow you're nowhere one of the things
that happens to alcoholics for exampleand and draw a draw other drug addicts
as well so imagine that you're trying tostop drinking alright fine maybe you
have to undergo some medical treatmentso when you first stop you don't die of
seizures because that often happens topeople who are addicted to alcohol so
and then they get valium or somethinglike that from a doctor to see them
through the first bits of what do youcall it well of sobering-up and so they
get through it and then then maybe twoweeks later they're not physiologically
dependent on alcohol anymorethe same thing is true of cocaine but if
you take them back and you put them intheir environment say they go back out
of the treatment center back into thenormal world they start drinking or
using right away again and the reasonfor that is that well let's say you've
been an alcoholic for 20 years okayfirst of all that's all you do for
entertainment you drink and all yourfriends are alcoholics right and so if
you're gonna stop drinking not only doyou have to rid yourself of the of the
physiological addiction but you have tocompletely learn a new way of living
because what do you know you have to getrid of all your friends because they're
all drunks pretty much or if they're notthere at least people who are
facilitating your drinking so you haveto build a whole new social network you
don't know how to amuse yourself becauseof course the way you've done that is by
going to the bar sitting at homedrinking and so there's a huge hole in
your life you abandon the previouspathological mode
a patient but that just leaves you withnothing and then you have to rebuild
that thing from from from from scratchit's extraordinarily difficult and
that's why so many people fail whenthey're trying to overcome a major
addiction so alright so anywaysSimba's out there in the desert he's
left his family and the comforts of homeand he's he's discovered by these by
Pumbaa and who's a little rats named TimTimon
yes he's a meerkat right which are verycool things and they discover him and
this is sort of his transition intoadolescence and he he kind of finds and
this is I would say more typical of themale transition into adolescence because
females of course hit puberty so muchyounger the males who aren't very
attractive when they're young like andjust starting to undergo puberty they're
not very attractive to females they tendto clump together in in gangs and and
and manage the transition over whatcould be seven years so and that's what
happens here is Simba joins this littlegang of you know these guys are alright
but you know they're a little on theprimordial side you might say you know
one of them is basically just a walkinggastrointestinal tract and the other one
is he's not so bad but he's like youknow a foot high really what good is he
and so he he's got some second-ratecompanions out here past the desert but
he enters he's out of childhood now andnow he enters the adolescent world and
what happens here is that very quicklyin the film he goes from being a little
cub to a full full adolescence andthere's about a five minute transition
and so it's the next stage in hisdevelopment and now he's out there in
this paradise which is kind of strangebecause adolescence really is no no
picnic but the idea here is that hereally doesn't have any responsibilities
right none and that is one thing aboutadolescences and even the stage of life
that you guys are out is you have lotsto do but you're not really responsible
for anyone other than yourself and soeven though you might be quite burdened
with your current responsibilities it'snothing compared to what it will be like
when you you know you haveresponsibilities for four children for
example or for the people that areworking for you or or whatever
so anyways out here it's a kind ofof place as well and adolescence is like
that we've had high school students tryto do the future authoring program you
know where they have to think three tofive years down the road it's like
forget that they just can't do it andI've watched them and what happens is
you you immediately become aware of justhow little high school students know
when they're like fifteen or sixteenthree to five years forget it
they don't have the world knowledge toproject themselves out that far in the
future not even close and so we've builta high school version that helps them
design a better future three to sixmonths down the road and even that's
really pushing it but you knowadolescents are more impulsive and they
live more for the moment and there'ssome utility in that I mean being
impulsive and living for the moment isone of the things that gets you pregnant
as a teenager and that is certainly oneway that the species has managed to
propagate itself and so positive emotionand impulsivity are very tightly linked
and so he's out there in this adolescentdelusional fantasy that might be one way
of thinking about it but more importanthe's out there where he's in a domain
now where the impulses of the momentbasically take precedence and so and I
think they sing some song about yeahHakuna Matata right which basically
means do whatever you do whatever youwant and tomorrow will take care of
itself or something like that so it'svery impulsive and lacks all
responsibilities one of the things thatI would recommend to you if you want to
protect yourself from ideologicalpossession shall we say is that when you
hear people speak politically and theydon't say anything about your
responsibilities you should probablystop listening to them because whenever
they're trying to offer you something ifit doesn't come along with an equivalent
cost there's something being hidden fromyou and they're appealing to the part of
you that's well I would say at bestadolescent so alright so anyways he's
out there in his little adolescentparadise and with his dopey chums and
back at at Pride Rock things are notgood right Skaar who's arrogant and
refuses to learn and who will notestablish a reasonable relationship with
the females all he does is tyrannizeover them he ends up ruling over a
completely barren landscape and that'sreally what happens in totalitarian
states and we also know quiteinterestingly is that one of the best
predictors of economic development in astate is the degree to which they extend
rights to women it's one of the bestpredictors and I would say well if
you're going to terrorize your own womenyou're gonna Tarin eyes everything
you're gonna Terran eyes ideas you'regonna Terran eyes structures like if you
have to enslave your own women you'reyou've del adapted a pretty damn
pathological view of the world and theprobability that that narrow constrained
restricted viewpoint is going to pay offfor you economically is extraordinarily
low so anyways Skaar it's like whathappened in the Soviet Union no part of
the reason it collapsed by 1989 is thatit just could not move any farther it
was like this really complicated motorthat was worn completely out that no one
had ever taken care of and it's justground to a halt
it just stopped working because itbecause it didn't work and so if your
totalitarian and you won't update yoursystem and adjust it then it wears out
and grinds to a halt and everythingbecomes unproductive no it's it's not
easy to figure out what makes a societyproductive because you might say well
it's Natural Resources or something likethat first of all natural resources are
very often a curse to a country becausethey produce corruption they call that
the Dutch disease there's a reason forthat
you can look it up but natural resourcesin and of themselves are by no means
sufficient to guarantee the well-beingof a country Japan has virtually no
natural resources at all and it's reallyrich and one of the prime natural
resources actually seems maybe there'stwo one is honesty another is trust and
if you can set up a society where peopleare roughly honest which means they do
what they say they're going to do andwhere the default bargaining position on
both sides is trust then the probabilitythat that culture will become wealthy is
very very high so and a functional legalsystem is also a natural resource of
tremendous tremendous value you knowit's partly why people in China for
example wealthy people in China aredumping their money into the real estate
market in North America like mad becauseone of the things you do know if you buy
real estate in North America is youactually own it it's still gonna be
yours 20 years in the future 30 years inthe future there's no doubt about that
and so that fact of ownership isembedded in the functioning legal system
and that's what gives those sorts ofproperties crazy value you know much to
the much to the problematic situationfor all of you people who are at some
point most of you are gonna try to buyproperty in Toronto and that's really
going to be entertaining so now look thethe other thing about scars he's got the
little bird locked up right that's thevision of the king well he doesn't want
to know anything he already knowseverything so why does he need this
stupid bird flying around telling himwhat's going on
the last thing he wants to know iswhat's going on yeah Stalin I mean
God he gave that guy bad news or goodnews he was going to have you killed
it kept the bad news to a minimum andthat's a real problem right because if
you torture people who bring you badnews then you're never going to learn
anything well you don't have to if youalready know everything anyways and so
that's the situation here well hislittle minions the hyenas are getting
pretty unhappy because they haven't hadanything to eat and the reason for that
is they've just stripped the landscapebare right I mean and I read at the
demise of the Soviet Union thatsomething like 10 to 15 percent of the
entire land mass of the Soviet Union hadbeen rendered permanently uninhabitable
by industrial pollution so you know thatI don't remember if that included
Chernobyl you know where that terriblenuclear accident took place but but
there were massive domains ofdevastation and in those countries that
you know will take hundreds of years tofix so anyways when scar rules everyone
starves that's a good way of thinkingabout it or everyone dies but that's
okay because that's really what he'safter anyway so that works out quite
nicely now back out here in paradise Imean look at him how pathetic can you
get look at the expression on thatcreatures face you know he's he selfs
he's sated like someone who's just eatena gallon of ice cream and he's got this
pathetic
self-satisfied naive cluelessunconscious grin on his face which the
animators did a very nice job ofcapturing like that's a complicated
expression and you just want to slap himand that's exactly what should happen
and that's exactly what does happen soanyways he's out there be an unconscious
dingbat well his society is degeneratingand that's bloody well worth thinking
about because that's an archetypal troperight it's like things are sinking
around you the question is what are youdoing about it you know are you just
staying in kind of a blitheunconsciousness because you can get your
next meal are you gonna wake up and dosomething about it well that's the call
of the self so now we go back to twoRafiki here and he knows what's going on
in the kingdom he's a symbol of the selfand he also has some inkling that Simba
is still aliveso so the son of the king is still alive
despite the fact that the land hasbecome ruled by a tyrant and the son is
absent he's still around somehow and soin a union from the Union perspective
there isn't much distinction between theself and the and the and the child the
self is the sum total of all possibilityand the child is possibility itself and
so so let's say you've become anadolescent you're all cynical right and
everything's falling apart around youwhich is the typical state of human
beings right because adolescents arecynical generally speaking and
everything's falling around fallingapart around them generally speaking and
so what do you have to do in order to todo something about that well one is you
have to be drawn by the call of wisdomand the other part is that you have to
rediscover that part of yourself that'sa childlike part that's associated with
the son and associated with that earlyyou know the early exposure of Simba to
the son you have to find that again andthen trust that some childlike
exploration and a bit of manifestationof faith might get you to the next place
and so that's what's happening here witha little you know the baboon and the
tree and the and the drawing so anywayshe knows that Simba is alive now
and so he goes off to find him andmeanwhile Simba and his dopey companions
are out hunting for bugsyou know because he's a lion you know he
should meet bugs for crying out loud butthey're easy and so you see this scene
where Pumbaa goes after this bug andthen another lion shows up and chases
him so she's gonna kill him and eat himand ha see that's an interesting thing
because one of the things that happens Isuppose you could think about this one
of the things that happens in lateadolescence is that the formation of
male gangs is often broken up by theproclivity of one or more members of
that gang to get involved in anindividual romantic relationship and so
the idea that the female lion is thecarnivore the female is the carnivore
that will devour the group is exactlyright and so what a girl will do often
if she's in relationship with you knowsomebody like a young man or an older
adolescent is she'll try to separate himfrom his dopey friends and like no
wonder you know why wouldn't she do thatbecause he does have dopey friends and
it'd be better for him if he could getbeyond them and so anyways they're
pretty freaked out about this and sothen Simba goes out and has a fight with
this lion to protect his dopey chums andI'm sure you don't need any explanation
about what that means and they have thishuge fight and neljä who it turns out to
be pins him and so that goes back to thebeginning of the story where when he
first encountered her she pinned him allthe time she's an animal figure right
and now what she does immediately isshame him so she he's an atom a figure
in part she's an animal figure in partbecause she actually does shame him
right so she's the gateway to higherconsciousness she makes him
self-conscious and rightly so but he'salso a she's also a psychological figure
because he imagined that when a youngman is establishing a relationship with
a young woman and he's he's enamored ofher he's falling in love he projects an
idea onto her and that ideal is going tobe partially fulfilled by the
relationship the degree to which isunspecified and sometimes it'll collapse
completely but he projects an ideal onto her because otherwise he wouldn't be
attracted to her and then the idealjudges him and so that makes him feel
all self-conscious and and usefulwhich is useful because he is useless
and should feel that way and so it'spart of the impetus to growing up so and
of course one of the you need necessityin order to mature you because to mature
is to take on responsibility and you'renot going to feel that impetus unless
adopting the responsibility has somesort of payoff and women tend to mate
across an up dominance hierarchy so theytend to actually like men who are useful
and so if they encounter a man who isn'tuseful at all they're gonna that's
exactly what's going to happen they'regonna not be happy about that in the
least and so and no wonder and I thinkthe reason for that it's an economic and
a biological reason the reason is isthat women are in the position of having
to take care of infants primarily and aninfant is a very heavy load and so even
a woman who's extraordinarily competentis going to find herself substantially
limited in her possibilities if she hasan infant and so then she's looking
around for someone who'll pick up partof the load it's perfectly reasonable
and you're not gonna pick up part of theload if you're completely useless and so
it's in the woman's best interest not tohave two children roughly speaking so
anyway she pins him and then he's allresentful about it immediately because
she's calling him on his stupid friendsand the fact that he's out there
gallivanting impulsively in paradisewhen there's real problems to be solved
and so look at him he's all resentfuland useless and and you know feeling put
upon and picked upon and you just yougot to slap him again fundamentally and
she's just completely stunned by thatit's like and tells them you know
where's the sim buy used to know rightwell he's a little doubtful about the
whole situation there the animators do avery nice job of this part of the movie
because one of the things you see isthat his eyebrows are always pointing up
in the middle whereas his father'seyebrows were pointing down in the
middle and so that's the differencebetween this which is sort of like
things are happening to me and thiswhich is more like I'm imposing my will
on things and that's an immature faceand and the animators capture that
brilliantly so here's where she shameshim again she tells him how much she
liked him when he was little and youknow a potential king and
how hurt she is that he's this uselessyou know wide-eyed naive impulsive
pleasure-seeking adolescent and shetells him that she missed him and god
only knows why because look at him againit's like completely appalling palling
creature and this is when Pumbaa andTimon sing that song about the fact that
you know their friends doomed becauseyou know this girl's got him and and
then they switch into another archetypalscene and so they're falling in love
here and so the paradisal imagery isreally highlighted in the movie and so
they go off and have this like rompself-reflective romp through this new
paradise and they wrestle around and andplay and then he pins her more or less
and she licks him that's that's not sogood
and this is one of the most brilliantshots I think that the animators manage
because she's obviously pushing this alittle bit farther than he knows what to
do with and so they're wrestling and heshe licks them and then she lays down
and makes this face which is everysingle class I've ever showed this to
all laugh when they see that image andthat's a good example so Freud said that
jokes were a good route into theunconscious so the question is and this
is an archetypal facial expression andeveryone knows exactly what it means
there's something sexually seductiveabout it and something very sexually
seductive about it despite the fact thatit's a lioness and the animators do an
extraordinarily good job of capturingthat and so that has a huge effect on
him while these guys know that hey thegame's up man it's like they know
they're dead whatever attractions theycan offer are paling in comparison to
this so so anyways things don't reallyprogress past out but you know he gets a
hint of her longing for him what'swaiting for him if he grows up and the
fact that she's completely disappointedin him because he's so completely
useless and so now he's lounging aboutyou know like some basement
with cheeto dust all over his chest andand trying to justify his absolutely
useless life and you know saying that hedoesn't have any responsibility to the
devastated Kingdom and he's out therewhere Hakuna Matata you know I can just
do whatever I want and and follow myimpulsive pleasures and she thinks he's
pretty pathetic and the reason for thatis because he is actually pretty
pathetic and she she tells him that youknow she's extraordinarily disappointed
he gets all pouty about it I mean evenhere you see when he when he's got kind
of an aggressive look on his facethere's still nothing about it that's
commanding it's petulant right it's likewell now I'm irritated but he's got no
force and and still completely appallingin this in this particular situation so
she judges him very harshly and leavesand that makes him think yeah he make
gets all self-conscious because thisfemale that he admires wants to have
nothing to do with himand so he's first of all then he thinks
well maybe I'll just hate all womenwhich is you know pretty pathetic
conclusion and but a very common one andthe next is well maybe there's actually
something wrong with him right which isa very painful bit of self-reflection so
he he had he notes that there'ssomething wrong with him and then he
calls out to his father and says lookyou said you were always going to be
here for me and you're not and so what'shappening is that he's become aware of
the insufficiency of his currentadolescent value structure and he wants
something beyond it which would beassociated with identification with the
father but he can't he can't find thefather the father's dead it's like when
Pinocchio goes down to the bottom of theocean to bring Geppetto up from the
depths right that's the situation thatthat Simba finds himself in right now
the father's gone and has to be broughtup from the depths so this is where the
movie takes the the archetypal pathwayof an initiation ceremony so he says he
wants to change now one of the thingsCarl Rogers one of the clinicians that
will talk about pointed out was that ifif someone was going to come to
psychotherapy there's some things thathad to happen before they went into
psychotherapy and one thing that had tohappen was that they had to admit that
there was something wrong and they hadto want to change you had to have that
beforewent into the psychotherapeutic
situation and what happens here is Simbais actually he's dropped his arrogance
and he's looking upward kind of likeGeppetto wishing on the star in
Pinocchio he's looking upwards helooking towards something higher and he
wants to transform himself so he's askedthe question how can I change for the
better and he doesn't get an answer andthen Rafiki shows up so what does that
mean it means that as soon as you knowyou're wrong about something as soon as
you admit that you're wrong aboutsomething and you open the door to
potential change that part of you willrespond so and you know this because
think about this you're thinking so youask yourself a question because that's
what you do when you're thinking andthen you generate some answers it's like
it's very strange the thinking willactually work you can actually come up
with answers if you think aboutsomething and so this square this issue
is okay I thought I was real good in mylittle impulsive paradise but then it
turns out that I'm just a half-wit and Inoticed that and I want to do something
about so the question is now thequestion is has now been posed and what
young would say is the deeper part ofyourself the part that still contains
your undeveloped potential will respondto that posed question and change the
way that you look at things and changethe way that you act it'll start it'll
start changing things so that you cantap those parts of yourself that are not
yet developed and you certainly do thatin psychotherapy but you can do that
young said that psychotherapy could bereplaced by a supreme moral effort and
by that he meant was that if you reallywanted things to be better if you wanted
to get your act together and youadmitted that you were insufficient in
your current state and you meditated onthe issue and tried to figure out what
you should do next to make to putyourself together that you would be able
to find out that there's something inyou that guides the process of
development that's the self that's ahigher its the higher self in some sense
it's the thing that remains constantacross transformations you know because
you're somewhere then you fall apartthen you get somewhere else but there's
something outside of that that's guidingthat process and that's that's also the
self that's what youwould be and you can communicate in some
sense with what you could be and that'sa very strange thing about human beings
anyways Rafiki shows up and Simba issitting by the water self reflecting
there's a little pebble that drops intothe pool to attract his attention and up
pops the self and Rafik he's a tricksterhe tells him weird jokes and he hits him
with a stick a bunch of times thank Godbecause someone really needs to and he
he makes some stupid jokes about bananasand kind of entices Simba into following
him right he lets him know that he has asecret and he entices Simba into
following him so simha's all of a suddenbecome interested in something so if you
ask yourself what the next developmentalstages and you really want to know that
all of a sudden you're going to becomeinterested in things that might move you
to the next stage and that'll happenmore or less unconsciously so anyways
Rafiki entices him and then runs awayand Simba follows him and well that's
where he reveals himself as a sage andthen he tells Simba to follow him and he
goes underground and this is theinitiation scene right which we talked
about at the beginning of the class thisis the descent into the underworld and
it's a it's a prerequisite to radicalpersonality transformation so anyways he
goes through this horrifying undergroundtunnel system where everything's all
tangled up which is you know if you everfall into chaos that everything down
there in chaos is tangled up it's atangled mess and he's quite and there's
horrifying music going on in thebackground and he goes deeper and deeper
until Rafiki says he finds a pool in themiddle of the chaos a deep pool and
that's another symbol of the self it'sit's the deep unconscious to something
down there that's alive that can bedrawn up to the surface and so Rafiki
shows him the pool and Simba who's quiteterrified at this point looks in it and
the first thing he sees is he only seeshimself he only sees his own reflection
and Rafiki says look deeper now you seewhat the animators do here it's very
coolso there's Simba and there's his
reflection but you see that is alreadyhalf is farther and you look at the
difference in the eyebrows and theso there's a there's a tightness of jaw
and a firmness of face that's startingto manifest itself there and that means
that he's starting to see the man hecould be beyond the adolescent that's a
good way of thinking about it and thenall of a sudden well they're you know
that's a whole different face rightthat's a seriously different face that
everything's going in and that it's likeget out of my way because things are
going to happen around me veryjudgmental as well so it's not it's not
naive by any stretch of the imaginationbut you know we know as far there's a
good guy and so there's somethingarchetypal about this and so he sees the
man he could be reflected back to himand then that's which is that actually
becomes a cosmic event and we switch upto the sky instead
and so Mufasa manifests himselfbasically as a solar deity and he tells
Simba that he's forgotten who he iswhich is the son of a king and that he
should remember that and start actinglike it
and that's an archetypal idea so ifyou're just a useless adolescent then
you've forgotten who you are and theconsequence of that is that the state is
going to fall around fall apart aroundyou and you're not going to do anything
to fix it and you're not going to begood for anything and no one's gonna be
able to rely on you and you're gonna beall whiny and resentful and then after
that it even gets worse and so that'sbasically what Mufasa tells him and so
Simba is like blown away by this visionright because he sees what he could be
and also what he's not which is prettydamn horrifying so anyways the storm so
to speak clears and Rafiki comes up andand Simba's a lot more thoughtful and
not quite as whiny and resentful anymoreand Rafiki leaves and so Simba now knows
what he's supposed to do he's supposedto stop being useless and take on the
moral requirements of setting theKingdom straight and so he runs back
across the desert there's all sorts ofimpressive music happening and then he
comes back to his kingdom and it's notlooking so good and that's the
consequence of his his abandonment of itthat's a big
part of it so now it's dead but also hisabandonment of it - nothing but
malevolence and chaos and so he's prettytaken aback and what's happened and that
he exaggerates his guilt or it shouldanyways and neljä shows up and and they
decide they're gonna do something aboutthis so in the meantime
Simba's mother is complaining about thefact that there's no food in the kingdom
anymore and that they've gone as far asthey can and Skaar doesn't want to hear
this so he he attacks her and Simbadecides to go to war and so this is
where he wakes up and he's willing toencounter the shadow at this point and
so he confronts scar and scars veryconcerned about this because actually
Simba is looking pretty impressive nowand he thought he was dead besides and
so he tries to use treachery and whinyNessun and subordination to excuse
himself but he's planning to overthrowSimba nonetheless to resist him so he
tells scar to leave he's going to banishhim to the nether regions outside of the
kingdom like scar did to him and scarbasically refuses and then a storm
gathers right and lights the Deadwoodaround the rock on fire so we have
another kind of descent into hell seenhere very common in Disney movies this
this this notion of the hero fightingthe evil force on the edge of something
that's burning it's quite a common motifyou see it in Sleeping Beauty for
example so they have a big war and scarends up putting Simba in the same
position that Mufasa was in and then hewhispers to him that he killed his
father so Simba has been thinking allalong that it was only his fault and it
is sort of his fault but he didn't knowthat there was a more archetypal theme
playing out in the background which isthat societies are always endangered by
malevolence always and that'sindependent to some degree of Simba's
decisions and his and his lack thereofanyways scar tells him because he thinks
he's won and that energizes Simba tohave this sort of final battle he leaps
out from theand they have a big fight and he pins
him basically and the female lioness hascome to his aid and Simba tells him that
again that he has to leave and so theyhave a big fight that's a particularly
good bit of animation so there's realdemonic aspect to scar they're sort of
King of Hell imagery and but he losesand then ha he blames his minions he
blames the hyenas for everythingterrible this happening forgetting that
they can hear him and then he falls offthe cliff and the hyenas go in and
finish him offso it's pretty brutal ending for poor
old scar eaten by his own minions andthen scars dead and Simba has one and so
the rains come immediately and so whatdoes that mean well it means that when
proper order is restored in a kingdomthen everything starts to flourish again
and so the rains come and then whileit's raining Simba climbs up to the top
of the rock and now he's completelymature right that the facial the
pathetic facial expression disappearsentirely knee straightens himself up
because now he's full of serotonin afterhaving defeated good old scar and all
the lionesses are roaring and he climbsup Pride Rock and they roar at him which
is good they're tough and he's tough andthey showing their teeth it's it's not
it's not a society of naive and harmlesscreatures it's it's something that's got
some bite and the rains come and thenthe next thing you see is the
restoration of the kingdom and sobasically that what that means is that
if the individual is willing to confronttheir own shadow and then to take on the
malevolent forces that continuallyundermine society then harmony can be
restored and everyone can do well and sothen we have a return to the beginning
right and so Simba and nella are now acouple along with Pumbaa and Timon and
they have a baby and Rafiki shows up anddoes the same thing you know he's gonna
present the baby to the Sun and have allthe animals bow again and and that's the
end of the movie so that's all packed
that's all packed into an archetypaltale and and so one of the things that
young would point out is that you allunderstood this right while you were
watching it because otherwise at somelevel all these things made sense they
all cohered and the narrative appearedto be an appropriate narrative even when
you're a little kid it because itstrikes a chord inside you and well that
chord the thing that it strikes insideyou that's the archetype because if
there wasn't something inside of you soto speak that this could communicate
with and it would fall on deaf ears andit speaks to the part of you that's most
particularly human and it's a story ofthe development of the sovereign
individual that's that's the right wayto think about it's a hero archetype
that's another way of thinking about itand people are going to get that story
one way or another and now and then apiece of public art comes along like
this that does a good job ofencapsulating and it captures everyone's
imagination and so that's why you've allseen it and why I presume you all
enjoyed it when you were kids and maybestill enjoy it now so well that was
actually faster than I thought it wouldbe today so this is what I'm gonna do
we've got 20 minutes so why don't youthink for a minute or two and I'll take
some questions which I don't often dobut and they can be any questions about
anything we've covered in class so takea minute and yes
- movieyou feel like you know the character but
it's not exactly that character likebecome so - you know can
like it feels like you know for a wiseold man
archetype yeah yeah well there's notmuch difference between Gandalf and
who's the wizard in Harry PotterDumbledore they could be the same guy
it's right right and so well that thatis precisely the indication of the
existence of an archetype it's like an amovie one time a student asked me well
if if there are these archetypes whydon't we just tell the archetype over
and over why do we need fiction forexample which is like a bridge if
there's individuals here and thearchetype is up here you know at a high
level of abstraction fiction sort offills the gap between them and so what
you want is a story that's archetypal sothat you understand its basic structure
but you want enough variation andspecificity so that it's new and
interesting and also applicable to youso you have to humanize the archetype to
some degree otherwise it's so abstractyou can't you can't relate to it and and
good stories really do that they bridgethe gap and some of them are more
personal and less archetypal but ifthey're completely non archetypal
there's nothing about them that capturesyou it doesn't have any force and then
if it's two archetypal well it gets tobe too abstract and you can't relate to
it so good fiction writers and and goodpurveyors of dramatic entertainment we
think about it as entertainment arereally good at occupying that middle
position so yeah and they reveal thearchetype through the individual that's
one way of thinking about it and andthat keeps it fresh and you know one of
the things that you pointed out to wasthat you're you're going to be
manifesting archetypal patterns ofbehavior in your life whether you know
it or noteven when you do something like fall in
love because that's going to be a veryparticular experience for you but it's
also a very common experience at thesame time right and and romance is older
than people that's one way of lookingabout looking at it I mean because sex
is older than human beings and so you'rein the grip of something that's really
ancient but at the same time it's reallypersonal and so a good novelist or a
writer of fiction is able to captureboth the personal element of that to
show show the transpersonal within thepersonal and so and in some sense your
destiny propertystudy from a union perspective is to
consciously express an archetype and sobe the archetype there's a bunch of them
but one of them would be the archetypeof the hero and you're supposed to
manifest that in the conditions of yourown life so that makes the archetype
real in the conditions of your own lifeand Jung would also say that when you're
doing that your experience will manifestitself as meaningful and so it's because
in some sense you're acting inaccordance with your deepest instincts
technically speaking right you're you'reacting out what it means to be human in
the world and you're gonna find thatmeaningful so yes
like
like I just like because it's mine
process from lifelike happy but is like appreciating to
help so like
you know like love and subsidies
okay so the question is about therelationship between the shadow and the
okay so the first thing you have tounderstand with regards to trying to
come to terms with the conception of theshadow is to understand the idea of
persona and persona is the you that youpresent when you want people to accept
and like you often like let's say thatyou go to a party and you're trying to
impress the people that are there andyou're trying to get them to like you
and so you maybe get jabbed out a littlebit and you laugh and you know you're
you go along with everyone so that theylike you and then you go home and you're
bitterly resentful about the way thatyou were put down at this party and
that's going to make all sorts ofaggressive I wish I could have said it's
gonna make all sorts of aggressive andvengeful thoughts sort of flashed
through your imagination well the firstpart of the problem is that you were too
much persona right you sacrificedyourself in some sense at the party so
that people would like you and in thesecond part you're refusing to admit to
the existence of those elements of youthat would have actually protected you
from doing that so let's say you go homeand you're all bitter and resentful and
you have fantasies of revenge I meanthat reveals to you the shadow part of
you that's aggressive and the thing isyou actually need that because if you
would have integrated that moresuccessfully into your personality when
you went to the party you wouldn't havehad lit you wouldn't have had to let
people put you down to get them to likeyou you know instead of having a face
like this which says I'll take anythingthat's coming my way you know you have a
face and a stance that's more determinedand assertive and if you manifest that
properly people aren't gonna mess withyou to begin with
but you know you may have alreadyadopted a morality that says well I have
to be likeable and I shouldn't doanything that causes any conflict and I
shouldn't ever you know hurt anybody'sfeelings and so you're just to present
yourself as a punching bag and you thinkthat that makes you a good person but it
doesn't and there's no integration ofthe shadow in that situation
so you see that at the end of the moviewe know I mentioned this when Simba
climbs up the rock to take control of itall the female lionesses bare their
teeth and he roars it's like thataggressiveness is integrated into him
and so resentment is a really goodemotion for making contact with the
shadow side because if you're resentfulabout something it basically reveals two
things it either means that you'reimmature and you should stop whining and
get on with things you know someone'sass this often happens with adolescents
who are asked say by their mother toclean up the room they get all resentful
about it it's like shut up and clean upyour room you know it's not that much to
ask or so that can be a gateway into theobservation of your own immaturity or
it's possible that you're resentfulbecause people really have been poking
at you too much and taking and andtaking shots at you and oppressing you
but what that means is that you've gotsome things to say that you haven't been
willing to say or don't know how to sayright you can't stand up for yourself
properly and in order to do that youhave to grow some teeth and be willing
to use them and again that's somethingthat might violate your morality because
you might say well I shouldn't be ableto bite people and the thing is yes you
should be able to bite people hard andif you're able to bite them then
generally you don't have to but theyneed to know that you can because
otherwise especially people who arebadly socialized they'll just keep
encroaching on you and encroaching onyou and encroaching on you and
encroaching on you until you you put upa wall like someone who's really well
put together won't do that you knowbecause they're sophisticated but if you
run into people who only have boundariesbecause other people impose them on them
and you won't do it you're gonna be thebullied one in the office for example
you're not gonna get a raise peoplearen't gonna credit you with your own
work other people are gonna take creditfor it you know and you're gonna go home
angry because you're doing your best andyou're trying to get along with everyone
and nothing ever goes your way well it'sbecause you're a pushover and you think
that's good because you confuseharmlessness with with with
reality it's it's about it's not rightjust because you can't do any damage
doesn't mean your morale just means youryou don't have the capability for mayhem
and that makes you a pushover I mean theyogya stuff is very very dark you know
it's very dark because his notion ofwhat constitutes a moral human being is
much different from the typical view hereally thinks you get that horrible side
of yourself integrated so it's up therewhere you can use it because otherwise
you're you're dangerous you can't say noto people and you'll go along with the
crowd and then if the crowd doessomething particularly pathological
which it's liable to do you won't beable to resist it you won't have the
strength of character and so then you'llfall prey to to crowd pathology and
it'll be because you're too agreeablewith a you know with a shadow resentful
side that the crowd and its murderousintent is gonna act out so yes yes so
the question is the relationship betweenarchetype archetypes and the idea of
memes welloh yeah that's a complicated one so
Richard Dawkins was the guy whooriginated the idea of meme and his
notion was that you could produce anidea or a set of ideas that had the
capacity to propagate across minds forwhatever reason it was catchy let's say
like a like a song that gets stuck inyour head you know it and that those he
called those memes which was sort of aplay on the idea of genes so there are
these stable sets of ideas that can betransferred across minds well I've often
thought when I was reading Dawkins thatif he would have kept thinking he would
have turned into Carl Jung because anarchetype is a meme but it's a really
really really deep meme so you canimagine that an idea has been sold
around for so long and that people haveacted out for so long that it's actually
become part of the landscape that doesthe selection so think about it this way
so it's more or less a truism that ifyou take a male dominance hierarchy the
probability that the men at the top ofthe hierarchy will leave offspring is
much higher than the probability thatthe men at the bottom will leave
offspring and it's true in many manyspecies now there's a much higher
probability of the average femaleleaving offspring than the average man
so so now then imagine that there'scharacteristics that push a man up a
dominance hierarchy okay and thenimagine that there are characteristics
that push a man up a set of dominancehierarchies so that each dominance
hierarchy has something in common withall of the others it's sort of like the
idea of a good player of a game being agood sport across games so then imagine
that the idea of the successful malestarts to become encapsulated in in in
biology because this species is going tothe male part of the species at least is
going to be adapting to the selectionpressures placed on the male by the male
dominance hierarchy so what happens isyou have a competition between men the
men that win the competition findpartners in mate
so the the male is going to start toadapt to the fact of the selection
that's implemented by the dominancehierarchy then you can imagine that
that's going to take case take placeacross dominance hierarchies because
this is happening in many manysituations spread across time and so
then the idea of how the proper manshould act starts to become incorporated
in the biology and also in theexpectations of the society and then
that starts to loop so as theexpectations become clearer and clearer
the notion of what it constitutessuccess becomes clearer and clearer as
well and the two things get tangledtogether now and I think you can see
that a manifestation of that wheneveryou go watch a movie because you
immediately identify the hero and youidentify with them it's like he's
the person that your mythologicalimagination grasps on to and you play
that out using your body as arepresentational platform when you watch
the movie and so maybe you admire thehero if he's a successful hero you do
well that admiration is themanifestation of the instinct that
drives you towards that kind of behaviorand not only can you manifest it in
which case you're likely to feel goodabout yourself because you know that
sometimes you can feel good aboutyourself and sometimes not but you're
also going to be able to recognize itwhen you see it in the world and that's
going to manifest itself in admirationand admiration is the proclivity to
imitate so the meme can be soul so youcan imagine dominance hierarchies are
very very old they're like 300 millionyears old
they've been around a very long time andthe idea that we have an image of what
it takes to climb the dominant targetsit's more or less self-evident because
that's the landscape that selected usand at the same time you know the the
archetype the pattern that propagatesyou up the dominant arc is also the same
pattern that makes you attractive towomen they're the same thing
so and of course that's a massivelypowerful selection mechanism and sexual
selection has really shaped human beingsit's turned us into what we are and
that's an interesting thing too becauseyou know this is one of the things that
really bothers me about the emphasis ofevolutionary scientists on randomness
it's like the the general mutationgeneration process is random or quasi
random we don't know that for surebecause there is evidence now that you
can inherit acquired characteristics andthat was nobody thought that was
possible 20 years ago so things are havetaken a very weird twist in the
Darwinian world but for the sake ofargument we could say that the mutation
process is random but the selectionprocess isn't random it's not even close
to random ever since creatures have beenable to evaluate one another the
selection process hasn't been random andso basically we're selected by you could
say by the manifestation ofmind in the world unless you believe
that women for example exercise noconscious choice in their made selection
which seems completely absurd first ofall men consciously choose who's going
to lead them at least in part you knowwho's going to succeed in a hierarchy
and women consciously choose theirsexual partners so the idea that the
selection process that the evolutionaryprocess is random is it's an absurd
proposition sexual selection makes itnon-random and Darwin knew that he
emphasized sexual selection a lot butmodern biologists since the time of
Darwin except for the last about twentyyears down played the role of sexual
selection and I think the reason forthat is that it brings mind into the
evolutionary process in a way that theydon't like and no wonder it's
complicated you know it's like to somedegree we're consciously directing our
own evolution at least through themechanism of selection so
yes yes well Dawkins just thought ofmemes is something that weren't he never
thought about them is something thatcould last long enough to play a role in
selection itself you know he thoughtabout the Moroz parasitical cognitive
entities I would say that just sort offloated on the surface of the mental
landscape he never he never grappledwith the idea that a meme could be
something that could last for hundredsof millions of years roughly speaking so
we got time for one more question ifanybody has yes yes from a political
perspective like if you divide people bytheir political affiliation it looks
like liberal men are the most unhappythey're higher in neuroticism
I think the openness probablycontributes to it as well but we don't
and also possibly the lowconscientiousness when my graduate
students come in or one of the many wayswe're gonna talk about this in some
detail because she's going to tell youbecause we've also looked at the
personality predictors of politicalcorrectness which is extraordinarily
interesting as well because it doesn'treally seem to fall exactly on the
liberal conservative continuum so we'lltalk more about that when we get into
the Big Five part of the course okaygood we'll see you on Thursday when
we're going to do a speed review ofFreud
