<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">some kind of a steady agenda</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:24.689" style="s2">I do remember okay so the typical way</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.849" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">what&#39;s changed since last time what</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.920" end="00:00:33.260" style="s2">we&#39;re working on and then after that we</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.260" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">one of us is sort of having issues with</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">it maybe we want to bounce off the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.250" end="00:00:49.829" style="s2">others so did one of you who won your</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:51.510" style="s2">horse I usually all right person so</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.829" end="00:00:55.500" style="s2">my project is</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.510" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">wiki election that has been going okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">but focusing a little bit more over the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">last two weeks on this on you know DMV</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">projects on together tech whatever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">being called and yesterday we actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">did a session on showing off the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.240" end="00:01:16.820" style="s2">prototype for project tracker just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:19.049" style="s2">show the online profiles and work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.820" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">earnest help that&#39;s needed that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">thing I had been working on the specs</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:27.450" style="s2">for wiki election my goal is in the next</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">I&#39;d say a week or two to start having</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.450" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">someone actually start to code the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:33.869" style="s2">really really early version of it just</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:36.619" style="s2">so I can actually start having a real</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.869" end="00:01:40.409" style="s2">thing online because it can be hard to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.619" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">conceptualize and going forward with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.409" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">weekly live streams I actually have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">one possibly two people attending today</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:52.460" style="s2">which will be nice I think that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:52.460" style="s2">it for work election</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.289" end="00:02:10.780" style="s2">okay so as opposed to the previous</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.039" end="00:02:17.590" style="s2">update I made last week which was about</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.780" end="00:02:20.620" style="s2">this little webpage designed to schedule</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.590" end="00:02:24.040" style="s2">meetings there is another project I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.620" end="00:02:27.269" style="s2">been working on so past many years</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">actually it&#39;s like a pet project of mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.269" end="00:02:39.220" style="s2">and it started as an attempt to map all</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.180" end="00:02:41.829" style="s2">the people organizations projects and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.220" end="00:02:44.620" style="s2">everything it seems like everyone does</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.829" end="00:02:49.500" style="s2">it actually I heard about at least three</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.620" end="00:02:54.459" style="s2">or four senior projects even in space</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.500" end="00:02:56.769" style="s2">but my idea was a sort of cross between</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.459" end="00:03:02.079" style="s2">project management software and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.769" end="00:03:04.750" style="s2">database and actually last week I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.079" end="00:03:09.880" style="s2">able to get it to the point where I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.750" end="00:03:14.019" style="s2">not only speak of what it is and how I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.880" end="00:03:18.040" style="s2">see it I think I am now able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.019" end="00:03:23.919" style="s2">show it and it&#39;s very early prototype</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.040" end="00:03:28.510" style="s2">but I think that shows what what can</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.919" end="00:03:30.819" style="s2">happen in this project so what I need at</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.510" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">this point for someone to tell me if</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.819" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">it&#39;s really it would make sense or not</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:44.099" style="s2">if it&#39;s a same idea or not and basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">as you discussed in one of the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.099" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">meetings about how to proceed with</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:54.519" style="s2">propositions of projects it would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:56.859" style="s2">good for someone to talk holes in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.519" end="00:03:59.169" style="s2">idea because I had this idea for so long</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.859" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">that I can no longer tell if it&#39;s valid</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.169" end="00:04:04.389" style="s2">or not right so I need someone to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">actually go and yeah this doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.389" end="00:04:11.160" style="s2">sense because oh it does make sense and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">you know at this stage I just I very</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.160" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">really appreciate to some information</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">and feedback about where I should go</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">next with this because my choice is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.500" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">either to start a Kickstarter campaign</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:28.070" style="s2">maybe like this because it would be very</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.070" end="00:04:35.430" style="s2">obviously if it was sustainable enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">for me to work exclusively on this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.430" end="00:04:43.650" style="s2">if not well what to do about about it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:46.740" style="s2">in the future it is going to be useful</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.650" end="00:04:48.570" style="s2">or not that&#39;s a bit cool yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:50.610" style="s2">that sounds like something to revisit</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.570" end="00:04:53.310" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re all we&#39;ve all given</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.610" end="00:04:56.790" style="s2">her updates just up there alright Brad</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.780" end="00:05:10.890" style="s2">have a pet project that&#39;s been going on</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.790" end="00:05:12.480" style="s2">for a long time and it&#39;s a tracking idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.890" end="00:05:17.190" style="s2">as well so I&#39;d love to hear more about</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">really needing to hold my own project</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.930" end="00:07:09.270" style="s2">people who are currently demoing it can</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.700" end="00:07:11.710" style="s2">sort of go in there and do a bit better</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.270" end="00:07:13.450" style="s2">test run with their projects like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.710" end="00:07:14.920" style="s2">think he was gonna add something to help</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.190" end="00:08:12.220" style="s2">most of them don&#39;t work from home and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:14.860" style="s2">now that they do you can tell they all</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.220" end="00:08:17.500" style="s2">had these side projects in mine for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.860" end="00:08:22.780" style="s2">long time and so now that all we reach</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.500" end="00:08:26.920" style="s2">out it&#39;s so nice to finish a project at</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.780" end="00:08:29.260" style="s2">home it&#39;s just so rewarding and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.920" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">actually the answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.260" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">about you know when you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:36.940" style="s2">work what is it that you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:40.780" style="s2">doing because some people that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.940" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">think that if you have no job as such</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.780" end="00:08:46.870" style="s2">you know you&#39;re going to be bored and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:49.090" style="s2">start drinking and baby you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.870" end="00:08:51.970" style="s2">answer to that is obviously there is so</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.090" end="00:08:55.089" style="s2">much you can do and so much you would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.970" end="00:08:57.310" style="s2">doing if you didn&#39;t that work yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.089" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure like five or ten percent of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.310" end="00:09:00.610" style="s2">people might not do</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:02.050" style="s2">something if you don&#39;t given the chance</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.610" end="00:09:03.100" style="s2">that&#39;s fine by me</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.050" end="00:09:04.360" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I want to work with</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.100" end="00:09:10.149" style="s2">somebody that doesn&#39;t want to work</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.360" end="00:09:13.870" style="s2">anyway you know it&#39;s I expect some most</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.149" end="00:09:18.610" style="s2">I don&#39;t know people to take a year or</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.870" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">two of unwinding right I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.610" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">after a long period of doing a job to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:29.170" style="s2">just sustain existence you will need</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:31.209" style="s2">some time to not do anything and to feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:34.209" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have to do anything in</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.209" end="00:09:41.830" style="s2">order to start thinking about what it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.209" end="00:09:43.750" style="s2">you really want to be doing yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.830" end="00:09:45.220" style="s2">right so it sounds like Brad won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.750" end="00:09:47.830" style="s2">able to rejoin he&#39;s having some ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.220" end="00:09:50.529" style="s2">technical issues so I guess we can say</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.830" end="00:09:54.930" style="s2">that the first part is done so if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.529" end="00:10:08.350" style="s2">want to dive into sort of your ask dip</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.930" end="00:10:09.790" style="s2">matheus message if you want to explain a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.350" end="00:10:11.380" style="s2">bit more about the help that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.790" end="00:10:13.630" style="s2">looking for on your project and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.380" end="00:10:16.149" style="s2">like if it&#39;s online also even where it</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.630" end="00:10:23.470" style="s2">is what kind of feedback you&#39;re after</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.149" end="00:10:26.230" style="s2">that&#39;s what it first first of all a</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.470" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">little bit curious right now because mmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.230" end="00:10:36.250" style="s2">I saw well there&#39;s your project about</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:41.649" style="s2">list of projects for that generally can</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.250" end="00:10:44.079" style="s2">be this is a list of projects in Granby</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.649" end="00:10:45.339" style="s2">space that&#39;s the short description but</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:50.290" style="s2">so I know</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.339" end="00:10:53.589" style="s2">mark has an idea of his own then there</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.290" end="00:10:55.690" style="s2">is James who I think working on</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.589" end="00:10:59.730" style="s2">something similar then there was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.690" end="00:11:09.120" style="s2">discussion about fractal organizations</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.730" end="00:11:11.970" style="s2">with the oh sorry I know which is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">Terran which is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.970" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">working on a halo and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:25.050" style="s2">like very similar thing that differences</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:28.259" style="s2">in details but I think it converges at a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.050" end="00:11:31.529" style="s2">design point you need to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.259" end="00:11:36.509" style="s2">have a list of a map of what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.529" end="00:11:40.110" style="s2">and it means both projects but because</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.509" end="00:11:44.879" style="s2">projects are not something on their own</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.110" end="00:11:46.680" style="s2">they are grounded in real problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.879" end="00:11:48.839" style="s2">it was first due to the problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.680" end="00:11:52.230" style="s2">you create projects to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.839" end="00:11:56.279" style="s2">problem and similarly with organizations</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.230" end="00:12:00.779" style="s2">I think it makes more sense to identify</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.279" end="00:12:02.939" style="s2">a problem and create a team entity of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.779" end="00:12:06.930" style="s2">nothing to deal with this particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.939" end="00:12:10.680" style="s2">thing instead of and I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.930" end="00:12:15.269" style="s2">about it for the past couple of days as</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.680" end="00:12:18.420" style="s2">well the difference between game a and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.269" end="00:12:21.809" style="s2">game B the staffing like in game a you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.420" end="00:12:24.059" style="s2">create a company or organization and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.809" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">have something and then you look for</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.059" end="00:12:31.170" style="s2">problems and possibly do I know profits</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:37.379" style="s2">for this entity who created and instead</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.170" end="00:12:39.990" style="s2">maybe the point of attention should be</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.379" end="00:12:45.470" style="s2">should start with okay this is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.990" end="00:12:50.550" style="s2">problem like like we need to provide</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.470" end="00:12:55.490" style="s2">blueprints for a vertical hydroponic</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.550" end="00:12:58.050" style="s2">farm this is the real real problem and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.490" end="00:13:00.559" style="s2">solution to that is going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.050" end="00:13:04.920" style="s2">useful for like everyone in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.559" end="00:13:09.779" style="s2">then you create a team which produces</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.920" end="00:13:12.629" style="s2">the schematics of blueprint of something</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.779" end="00:13:14.910" style="s2">instruction how to be able to this open</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.629" end="00:13:17.670" style="s2">source set and then it&#39;s done and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.910" end="00:13:22.309" style="s2">you can dissolve the team so I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.670" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">this is similar to idea to the fractal</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.309" end="00:13:27.060" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:31.080" style="s2">teams are created when they are needed</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.060" end="00:13:35.730" style="s2">and they can be dissolved when they</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.080" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">cease to be needed they dumb purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.730" end="00:13:49.470" style="s2">then like so okay so my question</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">Magnusson question was how do we deal</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.470" end="00:13:55.410" style="s2">with the situation where we have four</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:57.630" style="s2">very similar projects okay good question</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.410" end="00:13:59.360" style="s2">I&#39;m actually in the same boat somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.630" end="00:14:01.950" style="s2">on the together</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.360" end="00:14:05.010" style="s2">sorry on the wiki election side cuz</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.950" end="00:14:07.830" style="s2">Bentley had reason score one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.010" end="00:14:09.300" style="s2">things that we&#39;re talking about is in</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.830" end="00:14:11.640" style="s2">together tech right you can definitely</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.300" end="00:14:13.080" style="s2">still you know join or be a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.640" end="00:14:14.580" style="s2">if there&#39;s you know four different</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.080" end="00:14:16.680" style="s2">projects that are kind of doing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.580" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">similar thing and this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.680" end="00:14:20.970" style="s2">areas where we want to explore is this</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:22.170" style="s2">is typically an area where in game a you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.970" end="00:14:23.610" style="s2">would be competitors and you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.170" end="00:14:26.700" style="s2">talk to each other you know you would</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.610" end="00:14:29.370" style="s2">have that sort of a thing going and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.700" end="00:14:31.320" style="s2">think there still be a bit of rivalry</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.370" end="00:14:33.209" style="s2">just you know as egos get involved and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.320" end="00:14:35.790" style="s2">people are attached to there probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.209" end="00:14:37.529" style="s2">nicely but one of the concepts that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.790" end="00:14:41.010" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about is having something</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.529" end="00:14:43.500" style="s2">called a co-op Council where as you take</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.010" end="00:14:45.779" style="s2">groups of people who sort of in theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.500" end="00:14:47.670" style="s2">are in competition and you create some</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.779" end="00:14:49.230" style="s2">kind of a council to say hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.670" end="00:14:51.720" style="s2">here&#39;s four different theories for how</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.230" end="00:14:53.400" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna solve this problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.720" end="00:14:55.140" style="s2">you know possibly meet weekly or monthly</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.400" end="00:14:57.570" style="s2">bounce ideas off let&#39;s say what worked</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.140" end="00:14:59.190" style="s2">and what didn&#39;t work is in the end I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.570" end="00:15:02.100" style="s2">trying to solve Miss information with</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.190" end="00:15:03.510" style="s2">wiki election if I join forces or you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.100" end="00:15:05.370" style="s2">know like somewhat with two or three</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.510" end="00:15:08.190" style="s2">people and one of them ends up solving</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.370" end="00:15:09.930" style="s2">it still solved and if you know I</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.190" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">learned some things to help them along</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.930" end="00:15:16.410" style="s2">the way that&#39;s fine by me so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">part of it that being said as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.410" end="00:15:21.089" style="s2">know that book is unwritten like I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:23.010" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of talking about ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.089" end="00:15:25.230" style="s2">think that you know you might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.010" end="00:15:27.660" style="s2">talk about this game B I&#39;m not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.230" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">any existing methodologies or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.660" end="00:15:32.400" style="s2">for this so I think it&#39;s just starting</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.050" style="s2">it and seeing what we learn and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.400" end="00:15:35.430" style="s2">how we step on each other&#39;s toes and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.050" end="00:15:37.260" style="s2">we can help each other and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.430" end="00:15:38.910" style="s2">thing yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.260" end="00:15:42.040" style="s2">I feel this</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.910" end="00:15:44.619" style="s2">means similar kind in different</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.040" end="00:15:45.939" style="s2">companies I worked for even if even</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.619" end="00:15:49.059" style="s2">within the same company</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.939" end="00:15:51.489" style="s2">which in theory is you have competition</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.059" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">between companies but there shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.489" end="00:15:59.350" style="s2">no competition inside you still on all</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:16:03.610" style="s2">levels yeah besides but it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.350" end="00:16:06.579" style="s2">each entity was created be it a company</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.610" end="00:16:12.149" style="s2">or Department we seen a company or even</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.579" end="00:16:14.559" style="s2">team a team B team C once you have this</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.149" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">not sure how to call it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.559" end="00:16:19.389" style="s2">once you have this entity consisting of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:22.509" style="s2">more than one person and in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.389" end="00:16:23.980" style="s2">it&#39;s enough to have two people in order</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.509" end="00:16:26.860" style="s2">to start some sort of competition</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.980" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">because egos and you know my project is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.860" end="00:16:34.269" style="s2">obviously better because it&#39;s my yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:36.850" style="s2">it happens all over the place and even</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.269" end="00:16:41.309" style="s2">in environments where by definition</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.850" end="00:16:45.819" style="s2">should be non-competitive there is still</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.309" end="00:16:47.769" style="s2">eager involved and stuff happens and not</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.819" end="00:16:52.089" style="s2">everyone is happy to work for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.769" end="00:16:55.299" style="s2">greater greater purpose like when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.089" end="00:16:56.350" style="s2">think about cathedrals people who build</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.299" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">cathedrals</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.350" end="00:17:02.350" style="s2">they didn&#39;t even they knew the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:04.809" style="s2">cathedrals were not going to be built we</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.350" end="00:17:06.789" style="s2">see in their lifetimes they didn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.809" end="00:17:08.139" style="s2">if that there is any competition there</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.789" end="00:17:10.329" style="s2">was no competition there was the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.139" end="00:17:14.289" style="s2">blueprint and they just realized that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.329" end="00:17:16.419" style="s2">for like 300 years which is awesome and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.289" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">scary at the same time because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.419" end="00:17:20.919" style="s2">we cannot do this anymore</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.779" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s like that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.919" end="00:17:25.990" style="s2">butcher this proverb but the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.779" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">like you know it shows the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.990" end="00:17:29.740" style="s2">someone or something if they plant trees</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:31.990" style="s2">whose shade they&#39;ll never sit in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.740" end="00:17:33.610" style="s2">what doing work then you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.990" end="00:17:34.600" style="s2">benefit from but you&#39;re still doing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.610" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">work towards it because you know it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.600" end="00:17:38.830" style="s2">needs to be done yes definitely missing</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:40.779" style="s2">now there&#39;s no like that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.830" end="00:17:44.950" style="s2">that is severely lacking in game a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.779" end="00:17:48.610" style="s2">because get game is about you know well</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.950" end="00:17:50.650" style="s2">well the money if I&#39;m gonna plant a tree</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.230" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">right good stuff should talk you much I</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:13.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that those were cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:17.730" style="s2">on laws yeah you can do them indoors on</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.810" end="00:19:21.040" style="s2">sawdust or compost or some other medium</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.730" end="00:19:23.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve I&#39;ve experimented with indoor</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.040" end="00:19:26.170" style="s2">cultivation of blue oysters and lion&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.950" end="00:19:29.230" style="s2">mane and reishi mushrooms really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.170" end="00:19:31.900" style="s2">enjoy growing mushrooms indoors I hope</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.230" end="00:19:34.930" style="s2">they did and then I have some concerns</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.900" end="00:19:37.300" style="s2">my backgrounds in medical Dietetics and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.930" end="00:19:40.360" style="s2">I just had some concerns about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.300" end="00:19:42.250" style="s2">hardiness of the mushrooms and having</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.360" end="00:19:45.310" style="s2">medicinal benefits grown in such a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.250" end="00:19:48.100" style="s2">sterile environment and I&#39;m finding I</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.310" end="00:19:50.290" style="s2">like the outdoor nature of block</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:53.110" style="s2">cultivation however there&#39;s a year lag</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.290" end="00:19:54.580" style="s2">time between where you inoculate the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.110" end="00:19:56.500" style="s2">logs and where they&#39;re actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.580" end="00:19:58.259" style="s2">bear the fruit of the mushroom so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.500" end="00:20:01.590" style="s2">can call them</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.259" end="00:20:04.859" style="s2">they won&#39;t be ready until next year okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.590" end="00:20:05.909" style="s2">is that one where like it&#39;s again the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.859" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">term but where you sort of do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.909" end="00:20:10.109" style="s2">cultivation once and just keep going</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:12.509" style="s2">back to the same spot and getting new</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.109" end="00:20:15.179" style="s2">mushrooms every year yes so it will</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.509" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">there&#39;s different like flushes that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.179" end="00:20:22.049" style="s2">does so you&#39;ll be able to harvest it for</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:26.129" style="s2">three to five years ongoing before our</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.049" end="00:20:29.460" style="s2">potentially need new blogs but my wife</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.129" end="00:20:31.139" style="s2">and I had a very big silver maple tree</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.460" end="00:20:32.909" style="s2">growing right outside our door that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.139" end="00:20:35.729" style="s2">growing into our foundation and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.909" end="00:20:37.889" style="s2">uprooting our patio and it needed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.729" end="00:20:39.809" style="s2">come down so thankfully that is the type</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.889" end="00:20:42.839" style="s2">of wood that you need for sake mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.809" end="00:20:45.839" style="s2">so making good use of the lumber cool</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.839" end="00:20:47.369" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s actually extra cool to hear</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.839" end="00:20:48.599" style="s2">that yeah it&#39;s being salvaged from</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.369" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">something that otherwise might have</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.599" end="00:20:57.169" style="s2">nature if it&#39;s gone to be firewood or</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.159" end="00:20:57.169" style="s2">something okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.409" end="00:21:04.529" style="s2">all right I guess we can return to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.909" end="00:21:08.539" style="s2">previous conversation on what my juice</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.480" end="00:22:28.020" style="s2">I had a separate conversation yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:30.570" style="s2">was the game be coffee talk and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.020" end="00:22:32.220" style="s2">interesting topic came up that I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.570" end="00:22:33.960" style="s2">been really struggling with and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.220" end="00:22:36.260" style="s2">know if anyone else wanted to chime in</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.960" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">with their opinions or perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.260" end="00:22:43.560" style="s2">essentially it was the dynamics between</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">game the discussions and what we</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.560" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">cultivate online as a general direction</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:50.790" style="s2">and framework and then actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:54.060" style="s2">implementing stuff in your own community</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.790" end="00:22:55.530" style="s2">or city I feel like if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.060" end="00:22:58.680" style="s2">incorporating people in your own</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.530" end="00:23:01.020" style="s2">community or city and it could feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.680" end="00:23:03.420" style="s2">really heavy-handed and top-down and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.020" end="00:23:04.980" style="s2">social engineered but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.420" end="00:23:09.210" style="s2">if you live in a commune like mine</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.980" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">they&#39;re not familiar with game B or game</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.210" end="00:23:16.440" style="s2">a or they don&#39;t even have the time to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:19.770" style="s2">read philosophy or things like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.440" end="00:23:22.470" style="s2">so it&#39;s a kind of a paradox that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.770" end="00:23:27.900" style="s2">know how to settle this anyone have</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.470" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">anything to offer for that um there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.900" end="00:23:32.070" style="s2">another project that was dealing with I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:35.370" style="s2">think Mike is intentionally trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.070" end="00:23:36.450" style="s2">build local sort of groups for possibly</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.370" end="00:23:41.340" style="s2">things like this thing was called cult</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.450" end="00:23:44.190" style="s2">culture creator that I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.340" end="00:23:47.490" style="s2">sort of work has been done it since then</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.190" end="00:23:50.400" style="s2">but we had a a talk on that and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.490" end="00:23:52.380" style="s2">ways to possibly generate like a local</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:55.290" style="s2">audience I think that is one unique</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.380" end="00:23:56.730" style="s2">thing about yours is tech projects I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.290" end="00:23:57.990" style="s2">really don&#39;t care if it&#39;s local or not</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.730" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">because as long as you know you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.990" end="00:24:02.580" style="s2">internet and a computer you can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:05.190" style="s2">use it and participate but yours I guess</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.580" end="00:24:09.210" style="s2">is a bit different we can I have to in</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.190" end="00:24:11.400" style="s2">theory have some sort of a setup and I I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.210" end="00:24:12.540" style="s2">imagine it helps to be local what when</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.400" end="00:24:14.010" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about doing physical</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.540" end="00:24:16.140" style="s2">things and showing it showing you like</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.010" end="00:24:19.500" style="s2">hey here&#39;s how you know blogs and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.140" end="00:24:21.550" style="s2">harvest shiitake mushrooms and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.500" end="00:24:25.480" style="s2">of me</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.550" end="00:24:27.700" style="s2">I noticed this and this is a very big</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.480" end="00:24:32.590" style="s2">thing and I think it&#39;s an underestimated</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.700" end="00:24:37.960" style="s2">how big it is I talked to the zeitgeist</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.590" end="00:24:41.890" style="s2">movement in my local country I&#39;m Brown</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.960" end="00:24:44.830" style="s2">branch of it at least and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.890" end="00:24:49.660" style="s2">usually internet projects where you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.830" end="00:24:53.530" style="s2">the zeitgeist movement as big and yet it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.660" end="00:24:55.960" style="s2">seems to exist mostly in in the cloud in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.530" end="00:24:59.560" style="s2">on the internet people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.960" end="00:25:02.230" style="s2">philosophy and about economics and about</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.560" end="00:25:07.720" style="s2">Jacque Fresco&#39;s ideas and there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.230" end="00:25:10.450" style="s2">great ideas but then you have as you</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.720" end="00:25:12.610" style="s2">said philosophy on one side and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.450" end="00:25:15.220" style="s2">great to talk about it but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.610" end="00:25:18.700" style="s2">side you have local communities which</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.220" end="00:25:20.650" style="s2">never heard of gave me Jacque fresco</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.700" end="00:25:26.350" style="s2">like the Venus Project or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.650" end="00:25:28.030" style="s2">that they just do the thing and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.350" end="00:25:31.960" style="s2">there is no communication going between</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.030" end="00:25:34.870" style="s2">like in either direction it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.960" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">to you know we discussed actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.870" end="00:25:40.150" style="s2">something like when you go to a local</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:44.230" style="s2">community to spread your ideas about you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.150" end="00:25:46.530" style="s2">know resource-based economy what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.230" end="00:25:52.530" style="s2">that is that you can say to the people</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.530" end="00:25:56.500" style="s2">who are practicing it and how can you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.530" end="00:26:00.910" style="s2">like does it even make sense to go to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.500" end="00:26:04.030" style="s2">the people and spread to the ideas it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.910" end="00:26:05.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to work I think it makes</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.030" end="00:26:08.430" style="s2">sense but it doesn&#39;t seem to work</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.320" end="00:26:11.290" style="s2">because it looks like some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.430" end="00:26:14.800" style="s2">evangelical you know hello I&#39;m here to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.290" end="00:26:18.760" style="s2">talk about no higher being and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.800" end="00:26:20.800" style="s2">people go like ok nice idea you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.760" end="00:26:24.280" style="s2">there but what does it have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.800" end="00:26:28.060" style="s2">what I am doing and the other right</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.280" end="00:26:30.070" style="s2">direction is when you leave in local</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.060" end="00:26:33.210" style="s2">community I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.070" end="00:26:35.909" style="s2">observation as well on the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.210" end="00:26:40.409" style="s2">you have in front of you and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.909" end="00:26:46.140" style="s2">waste time on getting the feels of you</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.409" end="00:26:49.770" style="s2">cut about it I&#39;ll do you right I think a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.140" end="00:26:51.390" style="s2">lot is have a numbers game personally</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.770" end="00:26:53.149" style="s2">where I think it&#39;s like a small number</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.390" end="00:26:56.340" style="s2">people will be you know the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.149" end="00:26:57.990" style="s2">philosophical trying to solve letters at</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.340" end="00:27:00.390" style="s2">that level and the internet just helps</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.990" end="00:27:02.399" style="s2">them say we can you know coalesce</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.390" end="00:27:04.110" style="s2">regardless where we are and share</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.399" end="00:27:06.570" style="s2">information online</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.110" end="00:27:08.399" style="s2">whereas with that physical work you kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.570" end="00:27:10.110" style="s2">of can only do it in person and some</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.399" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">people that&#39;s just all they like and all</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.110" end="00:27:14.820" style="s2">the day care about or at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.649" style="s2">what will one of their higher priorities</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.820" end="00:27:18.419" style="s2">is doing that kind of physical work</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.649" end="00:27:20.220" style="s2">actually doing things completing things</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.419" end="00:27:22.890" style="s2">you know something that you can hold</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.220" end="00:27:25.980" style="s2">that you can say I made this exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.890" end="00:27:27.750" style="s2">in my experience it does sort of tend to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.980" end="00:27:30.750" style="s2">be some people value one thing or</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.750" end="00:27:32.340" style="s2">another the physical thing it&#39;s harder</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.750" end="00:27:35.610" style="s2">to do online I guess maybe with 3d</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.340" end="00:27:38.130" style="s2">printing and you know and modeling maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.610" end="00:27:39.870" style="s2">a bit but for the most part I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.130" end="00:27:42.690" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.870" end="00:27:45.299" style="s2">separation but interested to hear what</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.690" end="00:27:48.149" style="s2">others have to say am i right in</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.299" end="00:27:50.820" style="s2">thinking that it&#39;s a paradox or am i</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.149" end="00:27:53.179" style="s2">overthinking it because like I said one</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.820" end="00:27:56.820" style="s2">participant yesterday was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.179" end="00:27:58.950" style="s2">game be ish feels better or seems like</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.820" end="00:28:01.649" style="s2">it&#39;s better when it&#39;s co-created and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.950" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">co-evolved by the community members and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.649" end="00:28:09.029" style="s2">not imported from top-down but at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:10.049" style="s2">same time you have to start somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.029" end="00:28:12.029" style="s2">a direction you wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.049" end="00:28:16.289" style="s2">cultivate a community going farther into</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.029" end="00:28:19.289" style="s2">game a and doing more disastrous stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.289" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">so to some extent it seems like you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.289" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">to push it in the direction and almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:27.539" style="s2">cultivate a attractor</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:30.210" style="s2">that&#39;s a greater than game a but at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.539" end="00:28:33.330" style="s2">same time you don&#39;t want to be preaching</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.210" end="00:28:35.390" style="s2">this is the way I don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.330" end="00:28:38.330" style="s2">paradox er again am i overthinking it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.390" end="00:28:40.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not about it looks like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.330" end="00:28:42.510" style="s2">personally don&#39;t see to the paradox I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.380" end="00:28:44.190" style="s2">think we&#39;re missing a step I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.510" end="00:28:46.110" style="s2">like trying continue to take something</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.190" end="00:28:46.590" style="s2">from the conceptual from like okay we</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.110" end="00:28:48.419" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.590" end="00:28:50.460" style="s2">all these great ideas how do we turn it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.419" end="00:28:52.440" style="s2">into something real and in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.460" end="00:28:53.940" style="s2">that involved a different group of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.440" end="00:28:56.610" style="s2">people involved the people who like to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.940" end="00:28:58.860" style="s2">do things you&#39;d like to create and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.610" end="00:29:00.539" style="s2">been noticing in the game be group you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.860" end="00:29:01.980" style="s2">can see those two groups you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.539" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">people who are like they have always</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.980" end="00:29:04.440" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">you know like the these podcasts and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.440" end="00:29:08.370" style="s2">in-depth discussions and they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">interesting to follow both but then</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.370" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">nothing like physical comes out of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">there&#39;s no product of it and then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.020" style="s2">see people who post like you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:17.130" style="s2">they just want to build something they</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.020" end="00:29:19.590" style="s2">want to be a part of that they want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.130" end="00:29:21.809" style="s2">actually go out and do and create and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.590" end="00:29:23.370" style="s2">think that&#39;s one of the things that in</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.809" end="00:29:25.169" style="s2">the game be projects group I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.370" end="00:29:27.480" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons why people</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.169" end="00:29:29.309" style="s2">join because they&#39;re wanting to create</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.480" end="00:29:32.730" style="s2">and I&#39;ve seen probably at least that now</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.309" end="00:29:34.440" style="s2">high posts of people like wanting that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.730" end="00:29:35.880" style="s2">kind of project tracker wanting to know</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.440" end="00:29:37.590" style="s2">what what are all of these things they</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.880" end="00:29:40.980" style="s2">possibly could help with or how they can</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.590" end="00:29:43.830" style="s2">get help and personally I think we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.980" end="00:29:45.870" style="s2">bit too scared of game a tactics and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.830" end="00:29:48.659" style="s2">game a things until we figured out a</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.870" end="00:29:51.299" style="s2">reliable game being way to do it if</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.659" end="00:29:52.380" style="s2">there&#39;s no game be model to process</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.299" end="00:29:53.940" style="s2">ourselves off of it it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.380" end="00:29:56.549" style="s2">everyone is scared of like marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.940" end="00:29:58.860" style="s2">advertising and as soon as you say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.549" end="00:30:00.029" style="s2">that game a does it it seems like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.860" end="00:30:02.309" style="s2">of people are like oh we can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.029" end="00:30:04.770" style="s2">then even if I the only way that we know</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.309" end="00:30:06.779" style="s2">how to right now and like a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.770" end="00:30:07.260" style="s2">with game a we did it because that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.779" end="00:30:09.870" style="s2">it works</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.260" end="00:30:11.070" style="s2">marketing is an inherently game a it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.020" end="00:30:16.890" style="s2">unilateral conversation and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">part that I think a lot like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.890" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">definitely missing the ability to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:23.460" style="s2">that say something that makes sense to a</p>

<p begin="00:30:23.460" end="00:30:27.059" style="s2">terrible at that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.710" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">but that&#39;s marketing I think that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.059" end="00:30:33.330" style="s2">of the things that we&#39;re missing is that</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.330" end="00:30:39.960" style="s2">things and III just said want to be a</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.960" end="00:30:47.909" style="s2">up buddy right interested to hear what</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.899" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">others have to say I think about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.909" end="00:30:52.200" style="s2">saying like for me community is way more</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:56.130" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.200" end="00:30:58.500" style="s2">and yet I&#39;m really disconnected from my</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.130" end="00:30:59.340" style="s2">community I have I live in the country I</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.500" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">moved out here</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.340" end="00:31:05.970" style="s2">and I&#39;ll just say the politics are</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:07.980" style="s2">different here than where I&#39;m from so</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.970" end="00:31:10.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a hard time connecting with</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.980" end="00:31:13.560" style="s2">similar people and I&#39;ve tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.380" end="00:31:15.180" style="s2">things that help build community like I</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.560" end="00:31:17.130" style="s2">tried to do an art project where I</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.180" end="00:31:19.410" style="s2">thought we could create a commons just</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.130" end="00:31:23.040" style="s2">for like a month or two where we could</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.410" end="00:31:26.130" style="s2">get together and solve problems meet</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.040" end="00:31:27.690" style="s2">each other do whatever and I came</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.130" end="00:31:29.880" style="s2">against a lot of people work because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.690" end="00:31:32.310" style="s2">put out flyers that said there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.880" end="00:31:34.710" style="s2">competition this project thing see if</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.310" end="00:31:39.870" style="s2">you&#39;re interested people would come to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.710" end="00:31:41.610" style="s2">me and say like oh I you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.870" end="00:31:43.290" style="s2">expect the community to build your</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.610" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">business I&#39;m like it&#39;s not a business</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.290" end="00:31:47.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like a community center it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:49.230" style="s2">Commons and they&#39;re like well I&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.220" end="00:31:51.570" style="s2">my business myself and I&#39;m like actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.230" end="00:31:53.550" style="s2">you have a hockey stand and you need me</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.570" end="00:31:55.260" style="s2">to come and buy coffee from you or you</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.550" end="00:31:58.290" style="s2">don&#39;t have a business so you didn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.260" end="00:32:00.500" style="s2">build it yourself so they were it was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.290" end="00:32:03.420" style="s2">challenge I remember a lot of friction</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.500" end="00:32:06.210" style="s2">and I&#39;m not very good at introducing</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.420" end="00:32:08.790" style="s2">ideas but I do think that you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.210" end="00:32:12.090" style="s2">you&#39;re right on what we&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.790" end="00:32:14.370" style="s2">it is like we need the game be systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.090" end="00:32:17.610" style="s2">like the systemic structure which in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.370" end="00:32:23.970" style="s2">mind my vision my pet project is that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.610" end="00:32:26.010" style="s2">do have hubs or Commons areas for people</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.970" end="00:32:28.830" style="s2">to connect in every community of seven</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.010" end="00:32:30.780" style="s2">to 10,000 people that are like</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.830" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">legitimately a neutral space where</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.780" end="00:32:34.710" style="s2">people come together with exactly all</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:37.650" style="s2">these things that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.710" end="00:32:41.430" style="s2">now but I think the whole game be</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.650" end="00:32:46.230" style="s2">structure in my mind is a safety net so</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.430" end="00:32:49.580" style="s2">like trying to show a way that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.230" end="00:32:51.450" style="s2">valuable to have this interconnectivity</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.580" end="00:32:53.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a different it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.450" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">obviously you know you&#39;re gave me people</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.160" end="00:32:58.970" style="s2">um but having the actual structure in</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:02.730" style="s2">place so people can come bring their own</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.970" end="00:33:05.250" style="s2">interests and ideas and and meet people</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.730" end="00:33:07.650" style="s2">to solve the problems locally but also</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.250" end="00:33:11.250" style="s2">be able to share it globally and not be</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.650" end="00:33:12.400" style="s2">in competition so it&#39;s kind I think this</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.250" end="00:33:15.040" style="s2">is exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.400" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">trying to build this new thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.040" end="00:33:18.940" style="s2">think it&#39;s very important that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">very grounded in community that every</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.940" end="00:33:24.610" style="s2">community starts to have their own value</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:29.170" style="s2">the resources that they see as</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.610" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">collective as Commons so they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.170" end="00:33:33.970" style="s2">invested like they can see that how</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:35.800" style="s2">they&#39;re invested in the same system I</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.970" end="00:33:38.920" style="s2">mean we can still function with game a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.800" end="00:33:40.840" style="s2">happening but I feel like once we start</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.920" end="00:33:43.990" style="s2">having these structures in my mind we</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.840" end="00:33:47.740" style="s2">have hubs everywhere across the world we</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.990" end="00:33:50.110" style="s2">have our own multi-level value system</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.740" end="00:33:51.880" style="s2">that&#39;s like decentralized so I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.110" end="00:33:53.770" style="s2">control of my value system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.880" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">connecting with all these people just to</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.770" end="00:33:57.970" style="s2">like get that mapping out there see how</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:33:59.980" style="s2">interconnected we are and then we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.970" end="00:34:02.650" style="s2">need top-down structures to fix our</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.980" end="00:34:05.110" style="s2">problems we keep it together no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.650" end="00:34:09.370" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of a rant but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.110" end="00:34:12.360" style="s2">thinking about those things too right I</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.370" end="00:34:14.919" style="s2">think I might add to it as sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.360" end="00:34:16.899" style="s2">people forget so they don&#39;t know because</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.919" end="00:34:19.780" style="s2">they don&#39;t think about it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.899" end="00:34:26.290" style="s2">basis for everything as relations</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.780" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">between people and it&#39;s not than just</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.290" end="00:34:31.840" style="s2">relations between people but on top of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:34.200" style="s2">reactions between people you build</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.840" end="00:34:37.840" style="s2">businesses and then you have this</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.200" end="00:34:40.899" style="s2">imaginary structures as for-profit stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.840" end="00:34:42.730" style="s2">and companies and everything right but</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.899" end="00:34:45.850" style="s2">it starts with person-to-person</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.730" end="00:34:48.970" style="s2">communication even if it&#39;s communication</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.850" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">of the type I sell you listen to I give</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.970" end="00:34:55.240" style="s2">you this and you give me money it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:59.650" style="s2">very particular and specific kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.240" end="00:35:03.940" style="s2">relation but it&#39;s a mistake to assume</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.650" end="00:35:07.950" style="s2">that there is only this type of relation</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.940" end="00:35:10.450" style="s2">which name I seems to be in like</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.950" end="00:35:13.650" style="s2">preferring to think that between people</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.450" end="00:35:17.020" style="s2">what exists is direct this relation of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.650" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">exchange all the time exchanged and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.020" end="00:35:21.720" style="s2">usually is exchanged for money and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:27.330" style="s2">measuring everything in terms of money</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.720" end="00:35:31.650" style="s2">when I moved to where I live now</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.330" end="00:35:34.870" style="s2">and actually started having children I</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.650" end="00:35:41.370" style="s2">found this community of people here</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.870" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">local people and they are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.370" end="00:35:50.500" style="s2">NVC type of non-violent communication</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:54.820" style="s2">which is approach to communication that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.500" end="00:35:58.360" style="s2">involves deeply thinking about what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.820" end="00:36:00.310" style="s2">bring to the table and where your</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.360" end="00:36:03.160" style="s2">thoughts and emotions come from and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.310" end="00:36:05.500" style="s2">understand understanding other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.160" end="00:36:07.510" style="s2">emotions and motivations and everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.500" end="00:36:10.840" style="s2">it&#39;s very like deep sink when it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.510" end="00:36:17.560" style="s2">properly and it&#39;s amazing and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.840" end="00:36:22.780" style="s2">really successful in terms of making the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.560" end="00:36:25.450" style="s2">relations deep and sustainable and like</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.780" end="00:36:27.820" style="s2">I know I can always count on some people</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.450" end="00:36:31.150" style="s2">around me and having this community</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.820" end="00:36:34.030" style="s2">around us just it&#39;s a new quality of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.150" end="00:36:41.140" style="s2">life I have to say so we our communities</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.030" end="00:36:43.420" style="s2">are great that&#39;s what I want to say make</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.140" end="00:36:47.830" style="s2">sense and really if you think about sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.420" end="00:36:49.540" style="s2">of a game a corporation they haven&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.830" end="00:36:50.980" style="s2">massive amount of emphasis on internal</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.540" end="00:36:53.170" style="s2">communication right like that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.980" end="00:36:54.370" style="s2">the main job of managers and executives</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.170" end="00:36:55.780" style="s2">it&#39;s just aligning people and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.370" end="00:36:56.890" style="s2">communicating and making sure everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.780" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">going in the same direction</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.890" end="00:37:01.240" style="s2">mm-hm where I mean we&#39;re seeing with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:02.530" style="s2">whole quarantine thing that people</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.240" end="00:37:03.700" style="s2">saying like well wait why do they care</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.530" end="00:37:04.390" style="s2">if we go back to work if they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.700" end="00:37:05.980" style="s2">it all themselves</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.580" end="00:37:13.120" style="s2">they&#39;re just arranging it which is still</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.170" end="00:37:14.430" style="s2">valuable I think that goes to what</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.120" end="00:37:16.990" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.430" end="00:37:19.450" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:21.430" style="s2">conveying that information and using the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.450" end="00:37:22.930" style="s2">different types of people available and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.430" end="00:37:25.930" style="s2">yelled their different parodies intent</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.930" end="00:37:27.370" style="s2">and skill sets to hopefully achieve the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.930" end="00:37:32.320" style="s2">same goal which again has to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.370" end="00:37:35.500" style="s2">communicated I know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.320" end="00:37:37.570" style="s2">challenges I find is like I lacked the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.500" end="00:37:39.220" style="s2">skill set which is a bit of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.570" end="00:37:40.120" style="s2">where is that I&#39;m not good at marketing</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.220" end="00:37:42.910" style="s2">but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.120" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">also the ability to properly explain</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.910" end="00:37:48.550" style="s2">that kind of conceptual thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:50.440" style="s2">person hearing it also has to have some</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.550" end="00:37:53.800" style="s2">kind of a skill set or some kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.440" end="00:37:55.180" style="s2">interest to understand it like I find</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.800" end="00:37:59.320" style="s2">the same thing we&#39;re trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.180" end="00:38:00.430" style="s2">software like even if I&#39;ve been doing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.320" end="00:38:01.720" style="s2">for years I can be talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.430" end="00:38:03.370" style="s2">developer that&#39;s done it for years</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.720" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">you&#39;re just trying to use words it</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.370" end="00:38:07.300" style="s2">almost always fails you start to like</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:09.070" style="s2">have a sketch like here&#39;s how it looks</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.300" end="00:38:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s where they&#39;re like okay I see</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.070" end="00:38:12.790" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying now even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.720" end="00:38:15.250" style="s2">both extremely technical until you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.790" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">see it and then you can hit oh well</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.250" end="00:38:18.730" style="s2">maybe change that and do that it starts</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:20.680" style="s2">to put everything in place even if they</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.730" end="00:38:23.320" style="s2">don&#39;t agree it gives you that framework</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.680" end="00:38:25.150" style="s2">to to build on and this sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.320" end="00:38:27.400" style="s2">both understand it instead of I say you</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.150" end="00:38:29.200" style="s2">know a box pops up and there you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.400" end="00:38:32.290" style="s2">envisioning something totally different</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.200" end="00:38:33.940" style="s2">I think those two kind of had some</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.290" end="00:38:35.050" style="s2">similarities trying to explain something</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.940" end="00:38:37.660" style="s2">technical or something</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.050" end="00:38:44.140" style="s2">hello Safa chol just trying to use words</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.660" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">is exceptionally hard to pass and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.140" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">again the other person has to understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.650" end="00:38:57.609" style="s2">um so I did want to bring that back as</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.019" end="00:39:00.630" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that we got any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.609" end="00:39:05.859" style="s2">like an action or next steps for</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.630" end="00:39:08.769" style="s2">Medusa&#39;s project before so you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.859" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">people to test it and to sort of help</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.769" end="00:39:12.039" style="s2">move it along so I want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:16.710" style="s2">that we do get sort of some information</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.039" end="00:39:16.710" style="s2">on that and see if we can actually okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.950" end="00:39:26.740" style="s2">right now because I can just show it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.329" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">on the other hand I could populate it</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.740" end="00:39:35.259" style="s2">with some data to be able to better show</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:35.819" style="s2">it in a tomorrow with Sunday but early</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.259" end="00:39:40.380" style="s2">next week</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.819" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">okay maybe it would make sense I mean uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.380" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s correct me if I&#39;m wrong but from</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:49.210" style="s2">the early meetings I understand that if</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:55.299" style="s2">there&#39;s a project that could be</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.210" end="00:39:57.989" style="s2">discussed we could as together attack</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.299" end="00:40:01.029" style="s2">organize a meeting about this thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.989" end="00:40:03.849" style="s2">right yeah it we can do a project</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.029" end="00:40:06.220" style="s2">raising so if you have yeah we can get</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.849" end="00:40:08.200" style="s2">together and it&#39;s a big similar to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.220" end="00:40:09.609" style="s2">except the whole meeting is on a single</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.200" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">project where the person sort of says</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.609" end="00:40:12.609" style="s2">hey here&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:13.900" style="s2">it here&#39;s the information about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.609" end="00:40:16.180" style="s2">project and the other people will ask</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.900" end="00:40:18.670" style="s2">questions give feedback that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.180" end="00:40:23.019" style="s2">thing that would be most useful because</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.670" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">I know I was very good at communicating</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.019" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">ideas and it just might I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:33.069" style="s2">what can be done in 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:35.769" style="s2">especially if this meeting is small</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.069" end="00:40:38.619" style="s2">general so it would be nice to organize</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.769" end="00:40:41.529" style="s2">a specific meeting where I can be happy</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.619" end="00:40:43.930" style="s2">to be grilled and try to do my best to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.529" end="00:40:46.839" style="s2">explain what it is I had in mind when I</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.930" end="00:40:48.789" style="s2">started doing this okay sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.839" end="00:40:50.680" style="s2">if you need any help like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.789" end="00:40:52.559" style="s2">trying to get it to the point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.680" end="00:40:55.239" style="s2">ready to sort of get that early feedback</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.559" end="00:40:57.190" style="s2">I&#39;m happy to help like to take sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.239" end="00:40:58.630" style="s2">you know a sneak peek and maybe give</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.190" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">some feedback into where you can use</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.630" end="00:41:02.619" style="s2">some sample information because I I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:04.690" style="s2">the exact same challenge right I tried</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.619" end="00:41:06.950" style="s2">to show off the current prototype didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.690" end="00:41:08.600" style="s2">have any information didn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.950" end="00:41:10.550" style="s2">it&#39;s still kind of early days and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.600" end="00:41:12.920" style="s2">like I need even more example</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.550" end="00:41:14.030" style="s2">information to really give somebody an</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.920" end="00:41:16.670" style="s2">idea about what it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.030" end="00:41:19.480" style="s2">accomplish and so I think you might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.670" end="00:41:23.270" style="s2">in the same spot it sounds like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.480" end="00:41:27.710" style="s2">concentrated concentrated on building</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.270" end="00:41:30.620" style="s2">this framework and right now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.710" end="00:41:33.140" style="s2">building a house and you have this the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.620" end="00:41:35.810" style="s2">walls and roof but there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:38.180" style="s2">inside so when you show it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.810" end="00:41:41.690" style="s2">okay this is this and this is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.180" end="00:41:44.320" style="s2">to be doing this end and it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.690" end="00:41:48.730" style="s2">easier to show it then to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.320" end="00:41:52.520" style="s2">yeah so I guess I need a day or two to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.730" end="00:41:56.540" style="s2">have some bugs the most obvious ones I</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.520" end="00:42:01.160" style="s2">run out and get some data in so I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.540" end="00:42:03.880" style="s2">better show what it is that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.160" end="00:42:08.990" style="s2">achieved right okay that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.880" end="00:42:10.460" style="s2">cool thank you very much and Brad was</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.990" end="00:42:14.060" style="s2">there anything that you needed help with</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.460" end="00:42:18.920" style="s2">her need this chopping logs um bring out</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.060" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">shopping logs the kind of long-term</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.920" end="00:42:24.080" style="s2">project that needs help on is more</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.440" end="00:42:27.590" style="s2">around that packaging that we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.080" end="00:42:29.930" style="s2">last week but I&#39;m not in a place to kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.590" end="00:42:31.790" style="s2">of research that myself at this time I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.930" end="00:42:34.280" style="s2">need to kind of get these logs going and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.790" end="00:42:36.350" style="s2">then when there&#39;s more of a long time I</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.280" end="00:42:40.370" style="s2">I can kind of revisit the packaging</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.350" end="00:42:42.830" style="s2">right okay um did you see the I want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.370" end="00:42:46.970" style="s2">say solution raising next week on pepper</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.830" end="00:42:49.490" style="s2">noon I did it&#39;s at once day and I be</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.970" end="00:42:55.250" style="s2">working so fortunately I&#39;m gonna be able</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.490" end="00:42:57.260" style="s2">to make that but I&#39;m sorry I actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.250" end="00:42:59.180" style="s2">have some company that kind of came by</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.260" end="00:43:02.450" style="s2">earlier than expected I have to jump off</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.180" end="00:43:04.760" style="s2">so far technical issues and having to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.450" end="00:43:10.030" style="s2">leave or at least notice that&#39;s why all</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.760" end="00:43:10.030" style="s2">right have it thank you take care wait</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.320" end="00:43:21.859" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.549" end="00:43:26.929" style="s2">all right there will be a good example</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.859" end="00:43:29.389" style="s2">of how its of what is needed when</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.929" end="00:43:32.449" style="s2">someone says okay I don&#39;t have time to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.389" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">research companies but maybe someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.449" end="00:43:39.259" style="s2">else has time there&#39;s no like expert</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:42.499" style="s2">knowledge involved in packaging other is</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.259" end="00:43:45.529" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t know but simply to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.499" end="00:43:47.989" style="s2">companies and to check if what processes</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.529" end="00:43:51.619" style="s2">they use and whether they would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.989" end="00:43:55.689" style="s2">willing to share how they do stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.619" end="00:44:02.359" style="s2">just talk to people that takes time and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.689" end="00:44:04.159" style="s2">right now we do have time yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.359" end="00:44:08.869" style="s2">that was a part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.159" end="00:44:10.459" style="s2">because I think as as Brad just said it</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.869" end="00:44:11.779" style="s2">came out of a conversation last week</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.459" end="00:44:14.719" style="s2">where he was talking about like how do I</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.779" end="00:44:16.819" style="s2">have you know sort of all biodegradable</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.719" end="00:44:18.949" style="s2">packaging that&#39;s where we gotten to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.819" end="00:44:21.019" style="s2">help conversation and like could you you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.949" end="00:44:22.339" style="s2">know somehow turn kelp into something</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.019" end="00:44:24.229" style="s2">that you could 3d print so that it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.339" end="00:44:27.139" style="s2">stuff i degradable before and yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.229" end="00:44:30.739" style="s2">got into a whole squirrel conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.139" end="00:44:33.529" style="s2">and then that stack might a bit but that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.739" end="00:44:35.599" style="s2">is kind of a part of the challenge with</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.529" end="00:44:37.069" style="s2">solution raising and project raisings is</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.599" end="00:44:39.619" style="s2">in theory there&#39;s some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.069" end="00:44:41.659" style="s2">expertise involved that seldom people</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.619" end="00:44:43.609" style="s2">involved have like I don&#39;t think anyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.659" end="00:44:45.769" style="s2">actually attending that session has any</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.609" end="00:44:47.839" style="s2">experience in packaging or even in</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.769" end="00:44:49.909" style="s2">manufacture but they&#39;re still gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.839" end="00:44:51.799" style="s2">a conversation because as you just said</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.220" end="00:49:16.660" style="s2">it was banned and who was behind it but</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.890" end="00:49:18.609" style="s2">he may capitalism in the end I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.660" end="00:49:20.230" style="s2">that was just the tool they used it well</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.609" end="00:49:21.670" style="s2">at least for half of the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.230" end="00:49:23.079" style="s2">theories it sounds like that was just</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.670" end="00:49:26.140" style="s2">you know they were able to do it in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.079" end="00:49:26.740" style="s2">way but yeah doable either stepped on</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.140" end="00:49:32.140" style="s2">somebody&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.740" end="00:49:34.150" style="s2">or some sort of racist overtones or the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.140" end="00:49:37.930" style="s2">two that offered any way that you could</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.150" end="00:49:39.970" style="s2">come things some industry wanted a gun</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.930" end="00:49:41.410" style="s2">or you know just cuz Hampton sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.970" end="00:49:43.930" style="s2">world heads-up like the cousin of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.410" end="00:49:45.730" style="s2">marijuana but because they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.930" end="00:49:48.790" style="s2">sort of in the same basket but should</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.730" end="00:49:52.140" style="s2">ban all of it that&#39;s that was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.790" end="00:49:55.450" style="s2">official explanation a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.140" end="00:50:05.950" style="s2">who wanted to grow like a very small</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.450" end="00:50:09.970" style="s2">field off and for think four which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.950" end="00:50:13.000" style="s2">weird because centuries ago we had like</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.970" end="00:50:15.369" style="s2">full fields of the stuff and to just</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.000" end="00:50:19.240" style="s2">using it so now experiment we this</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.369" end="00:50:23.260" style="s2">sounds like weird thing but still she</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.240" end="00:50:27.160" style="s2">had to get like specific official</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.260" end="00:50:33.430" style="s2">permission for just summing this view</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.160" end="00:50:36.040" style="s2">and then the police came in and I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.430" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">they burnt it the order is to be burned</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.040" end="00:50:41.020" style="s2">because it&#39;s helped so you permission</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:43.869" style="s2">you look you have the permission doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.020" end="00:50:46.060" style="s2">matter just burn it because yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.869" end="00:50:50.700" style="s2">know the permission is still burned it</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.060" end="00:50:54.940" style="s2">yes that&#39;s the way it looks here</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.700" end="00:50:57.700" style="s2">so and especially now when you see</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.940" end="00:50:59.650" style="s2">people being beaten up by the police</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:01.810" style="s2">because they go outside because of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.650" end="00:51:08.109" style="s2">virus and that&#39;s the situation is crazy</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.810" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s very great situation to breed</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.109" end="00:51:13.180" style="s2">some of POC series yeah they really</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:17.109" style="s2">haven&#39;t been handling that part well at</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.180" end="00:51:19.030" style="s2">all no no III mean I think a few select</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.109" end="00:51:25.090" style="s2">governments have had doing okay but as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.030" end="00:51:29.020" style="s2">whole it shows how ridiculous this does</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.090" end="00:51:30.720" style="s2">this well everything else we need the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.020" end="00:51:33.420" style="s2">better system</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.720" end="00:51:35.100" style="s2">I&#39;ll have to call it a trust vacuum the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.420" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">the issue that right now because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.100" end="00:51:38.160" style="s2">no single guide like people to across</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:40.050" style="s2">the media people Don trust the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">government&#39;s and some people trust</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.050" end="00:51:43.230" style="s2">experts but if there&#39;s five experts</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:49.740" style="s2">trotted out and they all disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.230" end="00:51:51.540" style="s2">each other who do you listen to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.740" end="00:51:53.430" style="s2">not the time for but unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.540" end="00:51:57.260" style="s2">that&#39;s what appears to be the thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.430" end="00:51:57.260" style="s2">that&#39;s going to highlight the issues so</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.350" end="00:52:02.430" style="s2">just one quick thing that the hemp</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.270" end="00:52:04.890" style="s2">growing I have noticed that there are a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.430" end="00:52:08.040" style="s2">lot of laws changing and especially in</p>

<p begin="00:52:08.040" end="00:52:12.420" style="s2">get permitted or whatever to grow but</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.110" end="00:52:13.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more kept growing and like</p>

<p begin="00:52:16.500" end="00:52:22.470" style="s2">building supplies I think it is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.870" end="00:52:25.170" style="s2">a really big industry and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.470" end="00:52:27.930" style="s2">recently on a couple calls solution</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.940" end="00:53:43.570" style="s2">five minutes I don&#39;t know if anyone has</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.740" end="00:53:43.570" style="s2">any final thoughts before we wrap up I</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.870" end="00:53:52.910" style="s2">will say I think that theme of like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.640" end="00:53:54.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t know frustration is too strong</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.910" end="00:53:56.840" style="s2">of a word but that frustration over the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.620" end="00:53:58.640" style="s2">disconnect between like the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.840" end="00:54:01.730" style="s2">of game being and actually trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:04.970" style="s2">stuff I know I think both sides seem to</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.730" end="00:54:06.320" style="s2">be frustrated with that disconnect be</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.970" end="00:54:07.790" style="s2">between those two groups because they</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.320" end="00:54:13.700" style="s2">don&#39;t tend to overlap that much in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.790" end="00:54:20.420" style="s2">experience and there is it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.700" end="00:54:25.880" style="s2">two islands we yeah and this bit of sea</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.420" end="00:54:27.860" style="s2">between the islands is like you still</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.880" end="00:54:31.010" style="s2">see ships going between and some</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.860" end="00:54:34.220" style="s2">communication happening but it looks</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.010" end="00:54:38.090" style="s2">like you know throwing grenades of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.220" end="00:54:44.330" style="s2">throwing ideas and the land or not and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.090" end="00:54:48.440" style="s2">it&#39;s immature so we need a breach</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.330" end="00:54:50.930" style="s2">definitely some sort of and again this</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.440" end="00:54:56.030" style="s2">is what I&#39;ve been thinking about since</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.930" end="00:55:02.180" style="s2">very long time ago reach consisting of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.030" end="00:55:07.880" style="s2">place a platform where it is possible to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.180" end="00:55:10.100" style="s2">have status as close to physical things</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.880" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">as possible and this would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.100" end="00:55:16.840" style="s2">documentation and project management is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:21.320" style="s2">also involved English and blueprints of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.840" end="00:55:26.600" style="s2">like for example the echo of the side</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.320" end="00:55:28.900" style="s2">that has blueprints for basic tools that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.600" end="00:55:31.100" style="s2">you can use to build your own village</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.900" end="00:55:33.950" style="s2">they have this and this is great because</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.100" end="00:55:37.220" style="s2">it connects physical world to the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.950" end="00:55:40.160" style="s2">of ideas because you have tools which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.220" end="00:55:42.620" style="s2">physical you have the documentation and</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.160" end="00:55:43.460" style="s2">some written stuff about new tools and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.620" end="00:55:47.530" style="s2">then you</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.460" end="00:55:51.560" style="s2">and have some philosophy thrown in like</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.530" end="00:55:53.690" style="s2">trying to be not very suspicious just</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.560" end="00:55:57.470" style="s2">you know stick in some philosophy why</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.690" end="00:55:59.360" style="s2">exactly it is we need the documentation</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.470" end="00:56:00.980" style="s2">for tools and why we need the tools and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.360" end="00:56:06.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not just go to the shop and buy</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.980" end="00:56:11.270" style="s2">them so there&#39;s some potential in such a</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.140" end="00:56:13.700" style="s2">platform to arrive oh yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.270" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the goals of together tech</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.700" end="00:56:17.420" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of something that&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:18.740" style="s2">to be is is at least in my mind a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.420" end="00:56:22.190" style="s2">project is how you take something from</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.740" end="00:56:24.020" style="s2">idea to you know you eat it physical or</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.190" end="00:56:27.770" style="s2">if it&#39;s a digital product you know to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.020" end="00:56:29.570" style="s2">put online that&#39;s the process and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.770" end="00:56:31.940" style="s2">a really vague term like the process</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.570" end="00:56:34.940" style="s2">from taking out an idea to making it but</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.940" end="00:56:36.770" style="s2">projects can be kind of a they go</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.940" end="00:56:38.810" style="s2">through different phases of it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.770" end="00:56:41.030" style="s2">pretty conceptual let&#39;s figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.810" end="00:56:43.450" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna make this - all right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.030" end="00:56:49.090" style="s2">half built where do we go next</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.450" end="00:56:53.240" style="s2">yes mmm it&#39;s like when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.090" end="00:56:57.110" style="s2">different oh it goes back to like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.240" end="00:57:03.110" style="s2">think and you have some physical</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.110" end="00:57:06.140" style="s2">something like and it&#39;s physical but at</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.110" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">the same time there was oh I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.140" end="00:57:11.990" style="s2">refuse of he really but there is an idea</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:15.340" style="s2">behind it right so you have the Magnus</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.990" end="00:57:20.210" style="s2">ver Magnusson which is embodied in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.340" end="00:57:24.740" style="s2">but from the idea to this there is this</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.210" end="00:57:29.870" style="s2">process of manufacturing and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.740" end="00:57:36.020" style="s2">stuff really like conceptual and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.870" end="00:57:39.530" style="s2">words between the idea and we used</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.020" end="00:57:41.840" style="s2">really I think part of the challenge is</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.530" end="00:57:43.970" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about you know trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.840" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">to make mugs well the idea of a mug</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.970" end="00:57:47.600" style="s2">that&#39;s not new so if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:49.880" style="s2">make mugs in do you want to hire people</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.600" end="00:57:51.620" style="s2">you can say hey make this but instead of</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.880" end="00:57:53.480" style="s2">that design I want you know dogs or</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.620" end="00:57:55.010" style="s2">whatever it is you might have a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.480" end="00:57:56.390" style="s2">different idea but it&#39;s generally the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.010" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">same then people can understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.390" end="00:58:01.970" style="s2">and go make it but if you a brand new</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:04.190" style="s2">idea that&#39;s never been made that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.970" end="00:58:05.359" style="s2">bridge that you have to cross first you</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.190" end="00:58:07.940" style="s2">have to make sure that the people that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.359" end="00:58:10.220" style="s2">you want to first hire and then be</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.940" end="00:58:12.710" style="s2">actually trained ahead and is work it to</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.220" end="00:58:15.799" style="s2">understand what they&#39;re making and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.710" end="00:58:16.970" style="s2">generally like starts even hiring or</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.799" end="00:58:18.109" style="s2">getting them involved because they have</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.970" end="00:58:21.039" style="s2">to understand what they&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.109" end="00:58:23.089" style="s2">that can be step one is taking that idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.039" end="00:58:24.230" style="s2">exploiting it enough that somebody wants</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.089" end="00:58:27.890" style="s2">to get involved to actually help you</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.230" end="00:58:29.450" style="s2">make it and that I think are yet</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.890" end="00:58:31.279" style="s2">absolutely worth like that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.450" end="00:58:33.470" style="s2">challenge now it is trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.279" end="00:58:36.260" style="s2">that that idea cuz there&#39;s nothing like</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.470" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">this as far as I know so having that up</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.260" end="00:58:39.289" style="s2">trying to explain it well enough to get</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:41.450" style="s2">some of the interest it&#39;s but they can</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.289" end="00:58:43.809" style="s2">help build something that isn&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.450" end="00:58:46.670" style="s2">hashed out</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.809" end="00:58:48.589" style="s2">there&#39;s a great chance you see local</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.670" end="00:58:52.460" style="s2">people and ok I want to be this</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.589" end="00:58:54.109" style="s2">understand this and they go why right is</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.460" end="00:58:56.359" style="s2">good enough what probably trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.109" end="00:59:00.589" style="s2">solve what what did the mug not do for</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.359" end="00:59:02.269" style="s2">you exactly and a lot like there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.589" end="00:59:03.950" style="s2">old Henry Ford saying where it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.269" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">know if ask people what they wanted they</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.950" end="00:59:08.380" style="s2">just buh-buh-buh-buh-buh and set a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:10.940" style="s2">faster horse yes mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.380" end="00:59:12.710" style="s2">right and it&#39;s I mean and it kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.940" end="00:59:14.839" style="s2">same thing like with the iPhone and</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.710" end="00:59:16.069" style="s2">everything else if you know you ask</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.839" end="00:59:17.869" style="s2">people for a better phone oh maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.069" end="00:59:19.940" style="s2">know a better this and better that Bowl</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.869" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">touchscreen you&#39;re crazy and they&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:30.920" style="s2">non-smart phone what do you look like</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.180" end="00:59:33.140" style="s2">it&#39;s no one is going to use that no idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.920" end="00:59:35.329" style="s2">that was really hard to comprehend at</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.140" end="00:59:38.750" style="s2">birth and to be like that&#39;s never going</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.329" end="00:59:40.190" style="s2">to work and then people doing it we saw</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.750" end="00:59:41.779" style="s2">it we started to understand it that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.190" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">moved it forward and a bit easier to</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.779" end="00:59:47.569" style="s2">iterate iterate iterate an hour where we</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:50.509" style="s2">are now now in place suddenly you find</p>

<p begin="01:00:19.080" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">just said and I feel well as an artist I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.930" end="01:00:29.810" style="s2">have to do exactly what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:32.609" style="s2">about maybe art is a good bridge between</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.810" end="01:00:35.609" style="s2">these you know getting it out there and</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.609" end="01:00:38.030" style="s2">what not even like I started out when I</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.609" end="01:00:40.170" style="s2">learned how to make love let&#39;s say a cup</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.030" end="01:00:41.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge learning curve and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.170" end="01:00:44.790" style="s2">might think just cuz we&#39;ve already made</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.760" end="01:00:46.800" style="s2">them that they&#39;re easy it seems like and</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.790" end="01:00:48.300" style="s2">there are concerns manufacturing ways to</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.800" end="01:00:50.099" style="s2">do it without your hands aren&#39;t involved</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.300" end="01:00:52.580" style="s2">but all open you&#39;re actually learning a</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.099" end="01:00:54.930" style="s2">new skill it takes a lot of time and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.580" end="01:00:57.119" style="s2">after a while you get really bored with</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.930" end="01:00:59.490" style="s2">that one style and you start doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.119" end="01:01:01.020" style="s2">different things but you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.490" end="01:01:03.630" style="s2">you can&#39;t know that until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.020" end="01:01:08.160" style="s2">actually physically doing it so also</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.630" end="01:01:10.290" style="s2">being an artist like my dream is to take</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.160" end="01:01:12.150" style="s2">my art have an art show that&#39;s open to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.290" end="01:01:15.300" style="s2">the public and introduce these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.150" end="01:01:17.640" style="s2">ideas to them through our s just a</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.300" end="01:01:19.109" style="s2">entrance point so that their mind is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.640" end="01:01:21.839" style="s2">little bit more expansive and when</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.109" end="01:01:24.510" style="s2">you&#39;re in an art studio or an art show</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.839" end="01:01:27.750" style="s2">you kind of you imagine be impossible or</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.510" end="01:01:29.580" style="s2">at least you try to write well maybe um</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.750" end="01:01:32.310" style="s2">well that&#39;s my goal</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.580" end="01:01:35.369" style="s2">kind of I think you&#39;re what do you guys</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.310" end="01:01:37.410" style="s2">think yeah because I artists are more</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.369" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">comfortable in the conceptual and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.410" end="01:01:42.540" style="s2">experience and it might take you a bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.839" end="01:01:44.369" style="s2">to align those concepts but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.540" end="01:01:45.869" style="s2">probably going to have a more and if</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.369" end="01:01:47.310" style="s2">they don&#39;t get it they&#39;re probably going</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.869" end="01:01:49.800" style="s2">to be better at sketching where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.310" end="01:01:52.320" style="s2">at like okay is this what you need no</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.800" end="01:01:53.730" style="s2">okay is this what you mean a bit closer</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.320" end="01:01:55.080" style="s2">okay is this what you mean until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.730" end="01:01:56.810" style="s2">at the point or yeah that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.080" end="01:01:59.250" style="s2">cool and then you figure out how that</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.810" end="01:02:01.380" style="s2">sometimes you don&#39;t know like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.250" end="01:02:03.869" style="s2">making art and you don&#39;t know the end</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.380" end="01:02:05.609" style="s2">but you&#39;re in the process and you keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.869" end="01:02:08.099" style="s2">going and going to going until there is</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.609" end="01:02:09.810" style="s2">an end which is really about that trust</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.099" end="01:02:12.540" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.810" end="01:02:14.070" style="s2">don&#39;t have that that&#39;s hard to grasp in</p>

<p begin="01:04:10.740" end="01:04:15.450" style="s2">cybernetic direction of you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.510" end="01:04:20.339" style="s2">computers and technology and not going</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.450" end="01:04:21.990" style="s2">back to the medieval times we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.339" end="01:04:24.750" style="s2">technology because first it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.990" end="01:04:26.490" style="s2">possible and second every time I hear</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.750" end="01:04:30.060" style="s2">someone talking about how good it was</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.490" end="01:04:34.079" style="s2">hundred years ago no it wasn&#39;t it was</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.060" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">totally at least we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.079" end="01:04:38.550" style="s2">computers so yeah oh baby effectively</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:46.680" style="s2">the only people that should ever really</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.550" end="01:04:50.180" style="s2">say that or probably white men some</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.680" end="01:04:52.710" style="s2">countries that and overall and even then</p>

<p begin="01:05:00.359" end="01:05:07.109" style="s2">wasn&#39;t when I read history books about</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.430" end="01:05:09.690" style="s2">that period no no no and when someone</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.109" end="01:05:13.020" style="s2">says okay I it would be nice to live in</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.690" end="01:05:15.450" style="s2">go back to the beautiful types of nature</p>

<p begin="01:05:15.450" end="01:05:28.520" style="s2">peaceful nature it&#39;s not what you think</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.369" end="01:05:28.520" style="s2">it is right so yeah but we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.089" end="01:05:40.170" style="s2">mixing technology with nature and in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.660" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">graceful way in a very subtle way so you</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.170" end="01:05:50.310" style="s2">have nature and very respect for nature</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:53.450" style="s2">and what goes inside is also like</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.310" end="01:05:56.280" style="s2">Dharmakara culture like growing</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.450" end="01:06:00.089" style="s2">beautiful gardens and you know caring</p>

<p begin="01:06:00.089" end="01:06:04.920" style="s2">emphasis on the end result if they take</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.300" end="01:06:07.020" style="s2">technology to get there great if we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.920" end="01:06:09.020" style="s2">do it naturally great but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.020" end="01:06:10.230" style="s2">like technology for technology&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.020" end="01:06:12.180" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.230" end="01:06:14.099" style="s2">which you know is kind of or technology</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.180" end="01:06:16.310" style="s2">for profit sick which just means making</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.099" end="01:06:19.530" style="s2">it as much as possible you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.310" end="01:06:21.930" style="s2">quick quick iterations maybe it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.530" end="01:06:24.930" style="s2">last that long the opposite of all that</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.930" end="01:06:26.900" style="s2">it&#39;s much better when it doesn&#39;t last</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.930" end="01:06:28.310" style="s2">long because then you can sell another</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.900" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.310" end="01:06:33.270" style="s2">in-game a totally yeah you know why they</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:34.230" style="s2">do that now right because did that part</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.270" end="01:06:36.089" style="s2">where like they don&#39;t build them like</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.230" end="01:06:37.650" style="s2">they used to in some cases that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.089" end="01:06:40.020" style="s2">in some cases they&#39;re there&#39;s reasons</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.650" end="01:06:41.730" style="s2">but in a lot of things it&#39;s yeah just so</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.020" end="01:06:44.700" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.730" end="01:06:47.609" style="s2">you have to buy more first heard about</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.700" end="01:06:50.220" style="s2">planned obsolescence that&#39;s yeah it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.609" end="01:06:53.130" style="s2">like it was enlightening and at the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.220" end="01:06:55.950" style="s2">time we are so much in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.130" end="01:06:57.750" style="s2">only in invent it&#39;s like planned</p>

<p begin="01:07:03.000" end="01:07:07.230" style="s2">years I mean probably even sooner than</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.560" end="01:07:09.180" style="s2">that is figure out a way to start to</p>
