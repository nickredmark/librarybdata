<p begin="00:00:05.690" end="00:00:09.750" style="s2">so what we&#39;re exploring in this film is</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.950" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">one of the different ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.750" end="00:00:14.460" style="s2">that we&#39;ve lost access to why are they</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">important and how do we bring them back</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:17.850" style="s2">into the conversation so this will</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">include clips from Ian&#39;s McGilchrist</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.850" end="00:00:22.260" style="s2">who&#39;s the author of the bestseller the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:23.670" style="s2">master his emissary and John Verve a key</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.260" end="00:00:26.099" style="s2">we&#39;ve had on the channel a few times as</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.670" end="00:00:28.260" style="s2">well and who created the awakening from</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.099" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">the meaning crisis series we have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.260" end="00:00:31.380" style="s2">brilliant systems theorist called Nora</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:34.530" style="s2">Bateson and she&#39;s actually new to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.380" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">channel and then also Greg Thomas who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.530" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">also new to the channel who runs the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">jazz leadership project and Bonita Roy</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">as well who&#39;s been on the channel a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">couple of times who&#39;s also a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">systems theorist and facilitator so</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">we&#39;re also launching this as a series</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">that I&#39;m writing on medium and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:50.550" style="s2">going to be a little bit of a different</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">format than we&#39;ve done before in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.550" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">it&#39;s a three article series and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">first article is launching at the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:57.930" style="s2">time as this film so in addition to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:00:59.370" style="s2">we&#39;ve also recorded a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.930" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">between John Bob Athey and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.370" end="00:01:03.270" style="s2">McGilchrist so then speaking for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">very first time which I actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.270" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">recorded yesterday probably put it out</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">in a week or two and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">interesting hearing them they really got</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">into a nice flow with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">felt that their ins perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.560" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">left-brain right-brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:19.860" style="s2">way of knowing and how our perception</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">itself is kind of split really mapped on</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.860" end="00:01:25.759" style="s2">to John Vevey Keys really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">pioneering work with wisdom and in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.759" end="00:01:29.670" style="s2">fourth generation cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">space there&#39;s a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.670" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">interesting parallels between them that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:35.340" style="s2">coming out even in the dialogues yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:38.189" style="s2">and the first article in this series</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.340" end="00:01:40.229" style="s2">actually includes both genre Vicki Annie</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.189" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">McGill Chris works and compares and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.229" end="00:01:44.189" style="s2">contrasts them to see how do their</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:45.689" style="s2">different models of how we perceive and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:48.869" style="s2">really the machinery of our perception</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.689" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">so are our brains and our entire bodies</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.869" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">and what is now called embodied</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">cognition how does that influence how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:57.329" style="s2">perceive and what does it matter so</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:59.790" style="s2">McGill Chris has his model of the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.329" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">bicameral mind so the way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">difference between our left and right</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">hemisphere has huge influence on how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:07.590" style="s2">see the world and even in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:08.849" style="s2">and then I had a conversation with John</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.590" end="00:02:10.050" style="s2">Verve a key because I was curious about</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.849" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">this and knew that as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">scientist he would have a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:15.420" style="s2">interesting take on it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:16.709" style="s2">unsurprisingly he had a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:18.659" style="s2">take on it and he&#39;s actually been</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.709" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">working on what he calls the four</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.659" end="00:02:22.590" style="s2">different ways of knowing so that became</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:24.209" style="s2">a really really useful frame and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.590" end="00:02:26.219" style="s2">wanted to just play a clip around that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.209" end="00:02:29.069" style="s2">so we can hear it from Dawn himself and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.219" end="00:02:31.439" style="s2">so as I&#39;ve been researching it one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.069" end="00:02:34.829" style="s2">the one of the core concepts that came</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.439" end="00:02:36.569" style="s2">up was embodied cognition I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.829" end="00:02:39.450" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely sounds like something</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.569" end="00:02:41.700" style="s2">to talk to John for Vicki about though</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.450" end="00:02:42.749" style="s2">here we are when we were setting this up</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.700" end="00:02:45.090" style="s2">you mentioned that you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.749" end="00:02:47.819" style="s2">something right now around four</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.090" end="00:02:51.449" style="s2">different ways of knowing place to start</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.819" end="00:02:53.250" style="s2">sure like you know it&#39;s in parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.449" end="00:02:56.099" style="s2">series because one of the thesis of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.250" end="00:02:58.109" style="s2">series is we&#39;ve sort of lost touch and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.099" end="00:03:00.329" style="s2">this is picked up by the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.109" end="00:03:02.669" style="s2">cognition approach we&#39;ve lost touch with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.329" end="00:03:04.680" style="s2">sort of I don&#39;t mean you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.669" end="00:03:07.019" style="s2">our sort of implicit lives but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.680" end="00:03:09.359" style="s2">lost theoretical touch an existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.019" end="00:03:11.790" style="s2">touch with procedural knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.359" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">processional and propositional so let me</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.790" end="00:03:15.900" style="s2">go through the four if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to try I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.900" end="00:03:20.189" style="s2">taxonomy Zarn true or false</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">it&#39;s how consistent they are how good</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.189" end="00:03:25.949" style="s2">they do at explication and explanation</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">and so and so forth so the one that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.949" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">we&#39;re of course most familiar with when</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:32.909" style="s2">we talk about no knowledge is knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:34.919" style="s2">propositional knowing so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.909" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">kind of knowledge that you capture in</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.919" end="00:03:41.729" style="s2">your beliefs about propositions like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">know that I know that the cat is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.729" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">mammal and so and we&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:49.949" style="s2">work on that and we have this excellent</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:51.299" style="s2">procedure for trying to improve our</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.949" end="00:03:52.889" style="s2">propositional knowing it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.299" end="00:03:56.099" style="s2">science and or if you want to make it</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.889" end="00:04:00.139" style="s2">more broadly science and history and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.099" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t have too much to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.139" end="00:04:04.079" style="s2">except that for various historical</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:05.759" style="s2">reasons which I won&#39;t review right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.079" end="00:04:08.849" style="s2">because I go over and then in detail in</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.759" end="00:04:11.489" style="s2">the series that model of knowing has</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.849" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">come to predominate and if we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.489" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">the other kinds of knowing that had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:18.329" style="s2">larger place for example in the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">and medieval worlds and in other</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.329" end="00:04:23.039" style="s2">cultures too so procedural knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:24.419" style="s2">procedural knowing I&#39;ll stick with</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.039" end="00:04:25.800" style="s2">knowing because they want to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.419" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">how much we&#39;re talking about the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.800" end="00:04:30.650" style="s2">here and not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:32.210" style="s2">okay so procedural knowing is knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.650" end="00:04:35.479" style="s2">how to do something knowing how to catch</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.210" end="00:04:38.090" style="s2">a ball knowing how to ride a bike things</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.479" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">like that and it&#39;s captured not in</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.090" end="00:04:44.660" style="s2">beliefs it&#39;s captured it in skills</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:46.520" style="s2">that&#39;s procedural knowing respect</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.660" end="00:04:47.810" style="s2">honorable knowing comes from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.520" end="00:04:49.400" style="s2">that you&#39;re not just an intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.810" end="00:04:52.729" style="s2">agent you&#39;re a conscious agent you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.400" end="00:04:54.710" style="s2">consciousness and so this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.729" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">knowing you know by basically being able</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.710" end="00:05:03.220" style="s2">to inhabit a perspective and what do I</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">mean by that well what I mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.220" end="00:05:08.210" style="s2">this is a way of knowing that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:10.820" style="s2">relative to the state of mind you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.210" end="00:05:13.100" style="s2">so you know what it&#39;s like to be drunk</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.820" end="00:05:14.600" style="s2">and how you and the world seem when</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.100" end="00:05:17.240" style="s2">you&#39;re drunk you know what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.600" end="00:05:18.919" style="s2">be sober and then we can ask more</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.240" end="00:05:21.500" style="s2">specifically well what is that knowing</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.919" end="00:05:22.789" style="s2">like and so I try to articulate that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.500" end="00:05:25.970" style="s2">what it is is a phenomenon called</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.789" end="00:05:27.830" style="s2">salience landscaping where the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.970" end="00:05:30.050" style="s2">realization machinery is coming into our</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.830" end="00:05:32.449" style="s2">online working memory and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.050" end="00:05:34.220" style="s2">getting is a dynamic pattern of salience</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.449" end="00:05:36.020" style="s2">what&#39;s standing out what&#39;s foreground</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.220" end="00:05:38.030" style="s2">and background it the salting and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.020" end="00:05:39.260" style="s2">featuring how it&#39;s all so you know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.030" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">you&#39;re paying attention to what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:46.550" style="s2">and so it gives you your your your</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.820" end="00:05:48.949" style="s2">knowing of your here nowness so it gives</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.550" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">you your situational awareness so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.949" end="00:05:54.500" style="s2">procedural skills ultimately sit in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">are nested by your prospective will</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.500" end="00:05:59.479" style="s2">salience landscaping but then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:02.389" style="s2">ask yeah but what what coordinates you</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.479" end="00:06:05.349" style="s2">as an organism in the environment such</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.389" end="00:06:07.340" style="s2">that a perspective is possible and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.349" end="00:06:08.900" style="s2">that comes in and that&#39;s where we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.340" end="00:06:11.539" style="s2">really deeply into the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.900" end="00:06:13.690" style="s2">cognition also all all three of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.539" end="00:06:16.280" style="s2">last three are deeply about embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.690" end="00:06:19.010" style="s2">this is this is a participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.280" end="00:06:21.979" style="s2">this is this is this is the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.010" end="00:06:25.810" style="s2">you identify with and inhabit your mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.979" end="00:06:28.130" style="s2">and body such that you right make</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.130" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">that are right karela v&#39;n so you become</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:38.630" style="s2">an agent in a world that is an arena to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:40.129" style="s2">you so for example your biology put</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.630" end="00:06:43.069" style="s2">significant constraints</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.129" end="00:06:45.080" style="s2">on how have you know sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.069" end="00:06:48.499" style="s2">logistics of your cognition and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.080" end="00:06:51.379" style="s2">limits how you can move around in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.499" end="00:06:53.539" style="s2">world and then that means it puts</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.379" end="00:06:55.429" style="s2">constraints on the kind of agency you</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.539" end="00:06:57.439" style="s2">can exercise and it also puts</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.439" end="00:07:00.919" style="s2">can be disclosed to you and in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.300" end="00:07:02.779" style="s2">dialogue between Ian and John they</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.919" end="00:07:05.689" style="s2">really covered new ground in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.779" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">their sort of models of the world John</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.689" end="00:07:09.860" style="s2">the vaycay talks about fourth generation</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:11.959" style="s2">cognitive science and our fourth</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.860" end="00:07:14.300" style="s2">generation cognitive science is really</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.959" end="00:07:17.330" style="s2">all about embodied cognition that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.300" end="00:07:19.550" style="s2">whole sort of descartes ian split of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.330" end="00:07:21.409" style="s2">mind and the body is gone in the latest</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.550" end="00:07:24.589" style="s2">cognitive science that&#39;s that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.409" end="00:07:26.749" style="s2">longer a workable model which really</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.589" end="00:07:29.719" style="s2">then brings it much more into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.749" end="00:07:32.329" style="s2">Ian&#39;s realm because he is very scathing</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.719" end="00:07:33.860" style="s2">about kind of how reductive we can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.329" end="00:07:35.629" style="s2">and how reductive our models of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.860" end="00:07:38.209" style="s2">cognition can be so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.629" end="00:07:40.669" style="s2">interesting seeing that John was able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.209" end="00:07:42.649" style="s2">kind of explain and lay out - in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.669" end="00:07:44.419" style="s2">of where the science is going which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.649" end="00:07:44.959" style="s2">sort of this real excitement I think the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.419" end="00:07:45.889" style="s2">both of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.959" end="00:07:48.919" style="s2">and that&#39;s something I think they both</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.889" end="00:07:51.349" style="s2">share you know John rebecky talks about</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.919" end="00:07:52.999" style="s2">that first for first of the four ways of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.349" end="00:07:55.069" style="s2">knowing is propositional knowing so</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.999" end="00:07:56.300" style="s2">that&#39;s knowing that so propositional</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.069" end="00:07:58.219" style="s2">knowing you know he describes it as</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.300" end="00:07:59.779" style="s2">that&#39;s really we&#39;re quite good at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.219" end="00:08:02.089" style="s2">that&#39;s the knowing of science and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.779" end="00:08:04.189" style="s2">history and we have methods for figuring</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.089" end="00:08:06.919" style="s2">out what something is and knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.189" end="00:08:09.110" style="s2">but we there&#39;s nothing wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.919" end="00:08:11.569" style="s2">of course but he points out that we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.110" end="00:08:13.729" style="s2">over relied on it and that when we over</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.569" end="00:08:15.110" style="s2">rely on it we start losing access to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.729" end="00:08:17.059" style="s2">these other ways of knowing which are</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.110" end="00:08:18.589" style="s2">much more about being embedded and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.059" end="00:08:20.929" style="s2">participating in the world and having</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.589" end="00:08:23.659" style="s2">sort of a deep kind of attunement with</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.929" end="00:08:25.579" style="s2">the world around us and really similarly</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.659" end="00:08:27.349" style="s2">Ian talks about how the the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.579" end="00:08:29.749" style="s2">hemisphere which has come to dominate</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.349" end="00:08:31.550" style="s2">much of our thinking is really narrowly</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.749" end="00:08:33.769" style="s2">focused and it tends to break things</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.550" end="00:08:35.659" style="s2">into their constituent parts so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.769" end="00:08:36.829" style="s2">it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t really see people as</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.659" end="00:08:39.259" style="s2">people it sees them as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.829" end="00:08:42.589" style="s2">assemblages of parts whereas the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.259" end="00:08:44.209" style="s2">is much more designed for what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.589" end="00:08:46.639" style="s2">know so approaching problems we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.209" end="00:08:49.069" style="s2">know and we talked on the channel a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.639" end="00:08:50.899" style="s2">about the importance of coming into this</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.069" end="00:08:53.500" style="s2">liminal space something Jordan holders</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.899" end="00:08:55.180" style="s2">talked about at length as well so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.500" end="00:08:57.820" style="s2">how do we come into this space where</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.180" end="00:08:59.560" style="s2">we&#39;re not sure where we don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.820" end="00:09:02.140" style="s2">we&#39;re comfortable being in there because</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:04.660" style="s2">that way of knowing and that way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.140" end="00:09:06.820" style="s2">perceiving allows us to solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.660" end="00:09:09.160" style="s2">together that we can&#39;t if we come into</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.820" end="00:09:10.900" style="s2">it thinking we know and also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.160" end="00:09:12.310" style="s2">thinking the world is like a big</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.900" end="00:09:15.520" style="s2">computer switchboard and if we just</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.310" end="00:09:17.590" style="s2">tinker this and tinker that what we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.520" end="00:09:19.030" style="s2">kind of fix it that&#39;s a very I think Ian</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.590" end="00:09:21.310" style="s2">would say that&#39;s a very left-brain way</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.030" end="00:09:22.630" style="s2">of approaching problems and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.310" end="00:09:25.450" style="s2">right-brain way of approaching problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.630" end="00:09:27.610" style="s2">or let&#39;s say John might call it more and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.450" end="00:09:29.680" style="s2">more participatory knowing since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.610" end="00:09:31.510" style="s2">sort of having a back and forth with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.680" end="00:09:33.100" style="s2">world and we&#39;re deeply engaged in it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.510" end="00:09:35.350" style="s2">we can feel everything around us and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.100" end="00:09:38.020" style="s2">we&#39;re you know aware of what&#39;s salient</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.350" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">in our environment that that is more</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.020" end="00:09:42.130" style="s2">similar to that right-brain way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:44.590" style="s2">knowing and that&#39;s that is the one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.130" end="00:09:46.300" style="s2">the main ways in which we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.590" end="00:09:48.360" style="s2">that&#39;s really missing from a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.300" end="00:09:51.280" style="s2">cultural conversation so with all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.360" end="00:09:53.470" style="s2">materialist reductionist kind of ethos</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.280" end="00:09:55.780" style="s2">we live in and it&#39;s also missing very</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.470" end="00:09:57.340" style="s2">often from systems change conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.780" end="00:09:58.990" style="s2">so through all these conversations I</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.340" end="00:10:00.850" style="s2">became aware of sort of my own cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.990" end="00:10:02.980" style="s2">bias which is that I&#39;m I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.850" end="00:10:05.140" style="s2">necessarily see things as systems I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.980" end="00:10:06.790" style="s2">very focused in on the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.140" end="00:10:08.110" style="s2">and kind of what does individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.790" end="00:10:09.940" style="s2">transformation look like or what does it</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.110" end="00:10:10.930" style="s2">look like where when we&#39;re in groups and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.940" end="00:10:12.930" style="s2">I realize there&#39;s kind of a piece</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.930" end="00:10:15.190" style="s2">missing of my own thinking which was</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.930" end="00:10:17.530" style="s2">while I&#39;m interested in systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.190" end="00:10:19.270" style="s2">how does this apply to systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.530" end="00:10:22.510" style="s2">you know how do these different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.270" end="00:10:25.840" style="s2">knowing influence how we look at very</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.510" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">very complex systems and the person I</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.840" end="00:10:30.130" style="s2">found at talk Iran that was Nora Bateson</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:32.710" style="s2">and Nora Bateson is well known this</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.130" end="00:10:35.080" style="s2">whole systems change area and she runs</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.710" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">the Bateson Institute which is an</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.080" end="00:10:40.300" style="s2">institute based in Sweden which looks to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:42.820" style="s2">expand the work of her father Gregory</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:44.500" style="s2">Bateson Gregory Bateson is really well</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.820" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">known philosopher of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.500" end="00:10:48.520" style="s2">and particularly well known for really</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:51.250" style="s2">growing that whole field of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.520" end="00:10:52.900" style="s2">and systems theory and also cybernetics</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:55.990" style="s2">you know he coined a bunch of phrases</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.900" end="00:10:57.700" style="s2">like a double bind for example so Nora&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.990" end="00:10:59.860" style="s2">been kind of carrying on that work and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.700" end="00:11:01.720" style="s2">doing a lot of research and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.860" end="00:11:04.660" style="s2">things I find really interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.720" end="00:11:07.150" style="s2">her perspective is that it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.660" end="00:11:10.300" style="s2">of a right brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.150" end="00:11:13.270" style="s2">kind of participatory take on the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.300" end="00:11:15.339" style="s2">systems work so very often in the system</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.270" end="00:11:18.220" style="s2">change space people use engineering</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.339" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">language so they kind of try and map out</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.220" end="00:11:23.529" style="s2">a mental model that captured all of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:24.910" style="s2">complexity and her take is that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.529" end="00:11:27.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work because the systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.910" end="00:11:29.560" style="s2">themselves are learning and these</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.400" end="00:11:31.240" style="s2">systems especially living systems act</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.560" end="00:11:34.450" style="s2">very differently to like a dead system</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.240" end="00:11:36.370" style="s2">so the ecology of a forests or the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.450" end="00:11:39.310" style="s2">relationship you have with your family</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.370" end="00:11:41.350" style="s2">or your workplace or whatever it might</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.310" end="00:11:44.830" style="s2">be is a completely different thing than</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.350" end="00:11:47.890" style="s2">an engine or a switchboard and yet very</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.830" end="00:11:50.170" style="s2">often people use the language of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.890" end="00:11:53.020" style="s2">engineering to try and explain those</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.170" end="00:11:54.760" style="s2">deep living systems so a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.020" end="00:11:56.589" style="s2">language is needed and that&#39;s I think a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.760" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">really key point which doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.589" end="00:12:01.450" style="s2">spoken about all that much is that our</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:03.520" style="s2">language influences our way of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.450" end="00:12:06.040" style="s2">and reinforces it so it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.520" end="00:12:07.900" style="s2">to be thinking about ways of perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.040" end="00:12:09.970" style="s2">like aesthetic knowing for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.900" end="00:12:11.740" style="s2">there&#39;s the kind of feel of quality of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.970" end="00:12:13.089" style="s2">something you know how is that quality</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.740" end="00:12:17.500" style="s2">but you can&#39;t quite put your finger on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.089" end="00:12:19.630" style="s2">describe so that really ties in as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.500" end="00:12:22.870" style="s2">to what in McGilchrist have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.630" end="00:12:25.050" style="s2">and john drove a key it&#39;s this moving</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.870" end="00:12:27.880" style="s2">beyond just that reductionist frame and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.050" end="00:12:29.620" style="s2">widening out and once we do that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.880" end="00:12:31.570" style="s2">again why I think these different ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.620" end="00:12:33.130" style="s2">of knowing or in lost ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.570" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">because we have kind of lost access to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.130" end="00:12:37.270" style="s2">lot of them are really really important</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:38.709" style="s2">so let&#39;s play a clip from Nora talking a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.270" end="00:12:41.410" style="s2">little bit about her her take on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.709" end="00:12:44.440" style="s2">kind of wider system space idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.410" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">pulling things out of context to study</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.440" end="00:12:52.060" style="s2">them measure them to find them was not</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:54.850" style="s2">going to be a very useful contribution</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.060" end="00:12:58.420" style="s2">to my understanding of how they are in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.850" end="00:13:01.089" style="s2">contexts multiple contexts across you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.420" end="00:13:05.230" style="s2">know suddenly the system&#39;s model went</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.089" end="00:13:09.640" style="s2">from being an engineering map to being a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.230" end="00:13:11.560" style="s2">3d moving thing in time there&#39;s plenty</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.640" end="00:13:15.089" style="s2">of great information you can get with</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.560" end="00:13:17.709" style="s2">reductionist process but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.089" end="00:13:20.060" style="s2">understand how the vitality of a living</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.709" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">system is actually shift</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.060" end="00:13:27.380" style="s2">and moving and if it&#39;s not shifting and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:30.140" style="s2">moving it&#39;s not alive anymore so we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.380" end="00:13:32.410" style="s2">a we have a conundrum there of how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.140" end="00:13:35.720" style="s2">going to think about what information is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.410" end="00:13:38.450" style="s2">when so much of what has been developed</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.720" end="00:13:42.010" style="s2">in terms of what we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.450" end="00:13:44.600" style="s2">authorized information aesthetic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.010" end="00:13:47.170" style="s2">what we need to understand and respond</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.600" end="00:13:50.450" style="s2">to is complex and alive</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.170" end="00:13:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing we&#39;ve got this far but</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.450" end="00:13:59.180" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s been issues so warm data</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.960" end="00:14:02.540" style="s2">is that warm data became the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.180" end="00:14:05.410" style="s2">just started to describe how things are</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.540" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">happening through and across and within</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.410" end="00:14:12.440" style="s2">multiple contexts simultaneously so Alli</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:14.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve been spending like over a month</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.440" end="00:14:17.860" style="s2">researching this interviewing people</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.440" end="00:14:20.750" style="s2">writing really long articles on medium</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.860" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">why why is this so important why do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.750" end="00:14:23.030" style="s2">think this is so important why do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:25.370" style="s2">think it&#39;s valuable to add to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.030" end="00:14:27.340" style="s2">conversation so for me it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.370" end="00:14:29.240" style="s2">important because I think it&#39;s a missing</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.340" end="00:14:30.980" style="s2">crucial missing piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.240" end="00:14:34.460" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s potentially of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.980" end="00:14:36.590" style="s2">existential importance so there are a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.460" end="00:14:37.790" style="s2">lot of tribes online right now Peter</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.590" end="00:14:40.100" style="s2">Lindbergh is called these mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.790" end="00:14:43.400" style="s2">and he&#39;s listed about 25 of them but</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.100" end="00:14:45.470" style="s2">there&#39;s who knows how many more and what</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.400" end="00:14:48.080" style="s2">I became really interested in is there</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.470" end="00:14:49.840" style="s2">are a quite a high number of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.080" end="00:14:51.260" style="s2">tribes whether we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.840" end="00:14:53.480" style="s2">queuing on</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.260" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">extinction rebellion deep adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.480" end="00:14:58.070" style="s2">game be the list goes on and on who for</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:00.530" style="s2">probably a really good reason are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.070" end="00:15:02.780" style="s2">focused on how do we save humanity in</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.530" end="00:15:04.370" style="s2">some way or another how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.780" end="00:15:07.700" style="s2">through the the crises we might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.370" end="00:15:09.190" style="s2">facing and they&#39;re often in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.700" end="00:15:11.390" style="s2">narrative warfare</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.190" end="00:15:13.880" style="s2">the reason it&#39;s frustrating is because</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.390" end="00:15:17.060" style="s2">that I feel they&#39;re also relying on one</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.880" end="00:15:18.140" style="s2">particular type of knowing and excluding</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.060" end="00:15:19.850" style="s2">different types of knowing and that type</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.140" end="00:15:21.650" style="s2">of knowing is what John Rivera calls</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.850" end="00:15:25.880" style="s2">propositional knowing so it&#39;s knowing</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.650" end="00:15:30.080" style="s2">that and we know that gold is a mineral</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.880" end="00:15:32.120" style="s2">for example and knowing that is great</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.080" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">it&#39;s important that we know that we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.120" end="00:15:35.700" style="s2">mental</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:37.860" style="s2">but when we over rely on mental Maps we</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.700" end="00:15:39.960" style="s2">create effectively ideological camps and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.860" end="00:15:42.300" style="s2">the more we rely on them and the more we</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.960" end="00:15:43.980" style="s2">try and make our maps fit into the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.300" end="00:15:45.420" style="s2">and almost kind of trying to make the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.980" end="00:15:46.980" style="s2">world order our Maps</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.420" end="00:15:48.960" style="s2">rather than the other way around the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.980" end="00:15:50.930" style="s2">more we polarized into these tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.960" end="00:15:54.960" style="s2">it just seems to me completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.930" end="00:15:57.480" style="s2">counterintuitive and ineffective so what</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.960" end="00:15:59.640" style="s2">I became really curious about was what</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.480" end="00:16:01.470" style="s2">are the other ways of knowing not what</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.640" end="00:16:03.060" style="s2">we know not what should we do or where</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.470" end="00:16:05.340" style="s2">should we go or how do we fix this</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.060" end="00:16:08.430" style="s2">problem but in what way should we start</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.340" end="00:16:10.770" style="s2">perceiving in order to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.430" end="00:16:13.350" style="s2">and as Daniels macton Berger says make</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.770" end="00:16:14.790" style="s2">sense sense make effectively so that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.350" end="00:16:16.640" style="s2">can actually move forward and so that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.790" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">can come together effectively and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.640" end="00:16:20.370" style="s2">propositional knowing alone just</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">definitely won&#39;t cut it we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.370" end="00:16:25.140" style="s2">a much more limited way of knowing we</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:26.910" style="s2">need to be able to come out a problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.140" end="00:16:29.250" style="s2">with the attitude of I don&#39;t know of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.910" end="00:16:32.100" style="s2">this uncertainty and from that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.250" end="00:16:34.980" style="s2">uncertainty also comes a certain comfort</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.100" end="00:16:36.090" style="s2">with chaos and that&#39;s something I really</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.980" end="00:16:37.830" style="s2">don&#39;t see a lot of in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.090" end="00:16:39.960" style="s2">these groups is being comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.830" end="00:16:43.020" style="s2">chaos because chaos is really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.960" end="00:16:44.130" style="s2">to describe and you have to I think and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.020" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">this is what&#39;s really come out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.130" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">talking to all these people you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:51.570" style="s2">be in some kind of space of letting go</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:54.150" style="s2">in order for that to work you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.570" end="00:16:57.210" style="s2">willing to not know and you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.150" end="00:16:59.670" style="s2">comfortable with just just how complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.210" end="00:17:01.770" style="s2">systems are just how complex people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.670" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">you can&#39;t use game theory to solve</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.770" end="00:17:05.339" style="s2">everything you know for example the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:07.170" style="s2">prisoner&#39;s dilemma breaks down pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.339" end="00:17:09.900" style="s2">rapidly if one of those prisoners is</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.170" end="00:17:12.089" style="s2">having a deep religious awakening during</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.900" end="00:17:14.550" style="s2">it you know this was part of over</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.089" end="00:17:16.290" style="s2">rationalization which also happens what</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.550" end="00:17:18.860" style="s2">in McGilchrist would refer to as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.290" end="00:17:21.329" style="s2">a left brain dominant perspective so</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.860" end="00:17:22.860" style="s2">that became a really interesting acquire</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.329" end="00:17:24.870" style="s2">II for me what what are these different</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.860" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">ways of knowing how do we access them</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.870" end="00:17:29.790" style="s2">where do they add value and crucially</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:32.190" style="s2">how do we take them without throwing</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.790" end="00:17:34.590" style="s2">away the propositional knowing so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.190" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">we are doing a yes and and we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.590" end="00:17:37.500" style="s2">bring them together in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the best way to bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.500" end="00:17:41.640" style="s2">them together so Ian McGilchrist</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:44.370" style="s2">famously wrote the book master and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.640" end="00:17:46.020" style="s2">emissary so Ian is a psychiatrist and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.370" end="00:17:49.830" style="s2">academic</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.020" end="00:17:51.720" style="s2">and has a very broad perspective so what</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.830" end="00:17:52.920" style="s2">master his emissary does is looks at</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.720" end="00:17:54.420" style="s2">kind of a structure of the brain the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.920" end="00:17:56.220" style="s2">left brain versus the right brain and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.420" end="00:17:58.260" style="s2">those sort of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.220" end="00:18:00.600" style="s2">perceiving the world and then maps it on</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.260" end="00:18:03.750" style="s2">to culture maps it on to history and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.600" end="00:18:06.050" style="s2">says that we are we have several times</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.780" end="00:18:37.470" style="s2">if you like we focus on different</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.790" end="00:18:39.750" style="s2">aspects of reality and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.470" end="00:18:43.470" style="s2">construe a world with different</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.750" end="00:18:45.920" style="s2">qualities and the first part of the book</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.470" end="00:18:47.630" style="s2">explains that in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.630" end="00:18:53.970" style="s2">philosophy and the second part of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.340" end="00:18:57.270" style="s2">book suggests that in the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.970" end="00:18:59.550" style="s2">West three times we have been in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.270" end="00:19:01.830" style="s2">position where to begin with a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.550" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">civilization flourished when it kept</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.830" end="00:19:06.630" style="s2">both these visions together that of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:08.970" style="s2">right hemisphere and that of the left</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.630" end="00:19:10.140" style="s2">but then in every case and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.970" end="00:19:15.050" style="s2">we&#39;re repeating the pattern for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.140" end="00:19:18.440" style="s2">third time as the civilization</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.050" end="00:19:21.720" style="s2">overreached itself and things</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.440" end="00:19:24.780" style="s2">deteriorated and the mindset became more</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.720" end="00:19:27.330" style="s2">rigid more bureaucratic less imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.780" end="00:19:31.040" style="s2">less flexible less in touch with reality</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.330" end="00:19:33.420" style="s2">and became locked into a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.040" end="00:19:38.430" style="s2">which is that the left hemisphere which</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.420" end="00:19:41.850" style="s2">is useful it&#39;s not a mistake that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.430" end="00:19:44.130" style="s2">have it but it cannot be our way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.850" end="00:19:47.490" style="s2">contacting reality a simple way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.130" end="00:19:50.010" style="s2">putting it is it&#39;s like mistaking the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.490" end="00:19:52.050" style="s2">map for the territory yeah there was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.010" end="00:19:53.730" style="s2">concept that John the vaycay and Ian</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.050" end="00:19:56.370" style="s2">talked about in their dialogues that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.730" end="00:19:59.340" style="s2">really struck home in this as well about</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.370" end="00:20:01.710" style="s2">how we perceive the world let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.340" end="00:20:02.790" style="s2">about reciprocal narrowing and could</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.710" end="00:20:05.190" style="s2">there be such a thing as reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.790" end="00:20:06.390" style="s2">opening and so it&#39;s kind of complex idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.190" end="00:20:12.030" style="s2">I&#39;ll play a little clip from it</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.390" end="00:20:15.990" style="s2">now I had a strong belief that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.030" end="00:20:18.330" style="s2">that reality is made up by us but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.990" end="00:20:22.800" style="s2">not that reality just independently</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.330" end="00:20:27.900" style="s2">exists from us we Midwife reality into</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.800" end="00:20:29.130" style="s2">being our consciousness which is never</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.900" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">completely separate from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.130" end="00:20:35.010" style="s2">consciousness of what we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:38.150" style="s2">brings out an aspect of something and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.010" end="00:20:41.340" style="s2">we are actually not just passive</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.150" end="00:20:43.950" style="s2">observers or recipients in the cosmos we</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.340" end="00:20:46.680" style="s2">are actors in the cosmos in bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.950" end="00:20:48.870" style="s2">cosmos into being I want to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.680" end="00:20:50.730" style="s2">that very deeply first of all I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.870" end="00:20:53.700" style="s2">think part of the straightjacket I try</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.730" end="00:20:55.830" style="s2">to get out of the series it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.700" end="00:20:56.970" style="s2">you know the Lockean empiricism that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.830" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">mind is tugging Arase</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.970" end="00:21:01.830" style="s2">and the Rousseau Ian romanticism that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:04.410" style="s2">the world is applying a blank canvas</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.830" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">upon which we paint our subjectivity I</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.410" end="00:21:09.090" style="s2">think those are both wrong and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:11.190" style="s2">why I&#39;ve coined this phrase transgenic</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.090" end="00:21:13.770" style="s2">tivity about trying to break out of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.190" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">subjectivity objectivity a polarization</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.770" end="00:21:20.820" style="s2">of our epistemology so I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:26.490" style="s2">deep mistake and so I think that noticed</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.820" end="00:21:28.800" style="s2">that that idea so this will sound like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.490" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">slight digression but one of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.800" end="00:21:33.390" style="s2">and colleagues Mark Lewis he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:35.370" style="s2">some of the premiere work on addiction</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.390" end="00:21:36.630" style="s2">right now and he&#39;s trying to replaces</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.370" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">the disease model of an addiction which</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.630" end="00:21:40.590" style="s2">does not is not well supported by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:42.540" style="s2">of data it&#39;s well funded by governments</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.590" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s not well supported by data with</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.540" end="00:21:46.980" style="s2">a learning model um and he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:48.510" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing so it goes like</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.980" end="00:21:50.850" style="s2">this let&#39;s say I get slightly drunk I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.510" end="00:21:52.890" style="s2">lose some cognitive flexibility and so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.850" end="00:21:55.230" style="s2">can&#39;t notice as many options in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.890" end="00:21:55.590" style="s2">world so the world starts to narrow a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.230" end="00:21:57.540" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.590" end="00:21:59.190" style="s2">I then internalize this which then</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.540" end="00:22:02.310" style="s2">narrows and you get this reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.190" end="00:22:04.440" style="s2">narrowing until you can&#39;t notice - any</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.310" end="00:22:06.060" style="s2">alternatives and you can&#39;t notice any</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.440" end="00:22:07.860" style="s2">way in which you could be other than you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.060" end="00:22:10.740" style="s2">are and then you&#39;re the addict you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.860" end="00:22:12.750" style="s2">trapped right and I think that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.740" end="00:22:14.580" style="s2">right um I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.750" end="00:22:16.770" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a brilliant account of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.580" end="00:22:19.080" style="s2">addiction it supports much more of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.770" end="00:22:21.330" style="s2">empirical data when I had life&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.080" end="00:22:22.590" style="s2">Mark I said to him and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.330" end="00:22:24.840" style="s2">brought in the niels photonic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.590" end="00:22:26.700" style="s2">I said but mark if there&#39;s reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.840" end="00:22:29.820" style="s2">narrowing there must be reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.700" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">opening and he went you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.820" end="00:22:34.140" style="s2">and I said that you know and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.330" style="s2">this is you know the whole idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.140" end="00:22:38.010" style="s2">Anna gaga that what we can do is we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.330" end="00:22:40.110" style="s2">put ourselves into that and you called</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.010" end="00:22:42.809" style="s2">it that openness in which right and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.110" end="00:22:44.460" style="s2">think this is part of what what I see</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.809" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">god I sent stock was circling how he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.460" end="00:22:48.090" style="s2">trying to enact hi to Gary</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:50.909" style="s2">Heidegger as Alafaya right is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.090" end="00:22:52.620" style="s2">reciprocal opening right and so it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.909" end="00:22:53.970" style="s2">and and and then work by Erin and other</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.620" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">shows that&#39;s how you fall in love with</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.970" end="00:22:58.169" style="s2">something like if you disclose something</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.600" style="s2">and then I disclose and you do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.169" end="00:23:02.490" style="s2">reciprocal opening where I open up what</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.600" end="00:23:04.200" style="s2">I can be for you and that leads you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.490" end="00:23:06.390" style="s2">open up what you can be for me and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.200" end="00:23:09.659" style="s2">we reciprocally open we fall in love</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.390" end="00:23:11.940" style="s2">with each other and so right and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.659" end="00:23:15.059" style="s2">that I think that an agar get processed</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.940" end="00:23:17.460" style="s2">right that reciprocal opening and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.059" end="00:23:20.130" style="s2">can see it in flow States and like</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.460" end="00:23:22.770" style="s2">that&#39;s that that that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.130" end="00:23:25.230" style="s2">trying to get this notion of noticing</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.770" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">and dialogue the biological relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.230" end="00:23:31.230" style="s2">into you know we can connect it with</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:32.970" style="s2">practices the ring agent that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.230" end="00:23:34.500" style="s2">interesting you know because Joan is</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.970" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">increasingly interested in practices</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.500" end="00:23:39.090" style="s2">like circling or even parkour where we</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.690" end="00:23:46.860" style="s2">practices that we can actually start</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.520" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">engaging in that create that opening as</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.860" end="00:23:50.490" style="s2">opposed to the narrowing because it</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:52.860" style="s2">almost feels like from these</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.490" end="00:23:54.390" style="s2">conversations that the narrowing is is</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.860" end="00:23:57.299" style="s2">almost our default that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.390" end="00:23:59.429" style="s2">actively work to unlock you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.299" end="00:24:01.860" style="s2">a left brain culture we have one that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.429" end="00:24:03.690" style="s2">high you know really focuses on</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.860" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">propositional knowing so to access those</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.690" end="00:24:09.539" style="s2">different areas we need to start doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:10.890" style="s2">something with it and so another person</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.539" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">I spoke to a few people around this</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.140" end="00:24:38.790" style="s2">metaphor for collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.060" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">right so if the idea is we can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.790" end="00:24:43.470" style="s2">sense of the world anymore</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:45.720" style="s2">well using the tools we used to use we</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.470" end="00:24:46.800" style="s2">have to come together in some way and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.720" end="00:24:49.140" style="s2">make sense together</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.800" end="00:24:50.550" style="s2">how does it actually look like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.140" end="00:24:52.170" style="s2">the best way for us to come into some</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.550" end="00:24:54.030" style="s2">kind of coherence where we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.170" end="00:24:55.380" style="s2">listening to each other and something</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.030" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">new is emerging between us</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.380" end="00:25:00.360" style="s2">as we talk and the metaphor they use in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">that was jazz you know and it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.360" end="00:25:03.480" style="s2">only people who&#39;ve used that metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:05.070" style="s2">and then I got really interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.480" end="00:25:07.530" style="s2">like jazz is a really excellent metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.070" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">for that and Greg Thomas has not only</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.530" end="00:25:11.900" style="s2">run the Jazz leadership project where</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:13.950" style="s2">they&#39;re actually taking people into</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.900" end="00:25:16.380" style="s2">transformation you know leadership</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.950" end="00:25:19.260" style="s2">workshops you know even corporate change</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.380" end="00:25:22.140" style="s2">workshops using jazz as a model but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.260" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">also an integral theorist and really</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.140" end="00:25:27.060" style="s2">interested in collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:28.470" style="s2">really like knows a lot about the theory</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.060" end="00:25:30.150" style="s2">of it so we had a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.470" end="00:25:32.100" style="s2">conversation with him around how this</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.150" end="00:25:34.290" style="s2">metaphor of jazz can be used to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.100" end="00:25:38.030" style="s2">understand you know different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.290" end="00:25:41.700" style="s2">knowing we have a concept called</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.030" end="00:25:44.750" style="s2">ensemble mindset that uses the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.700" end="00:25:49.560" style="s2">collective intelligence our brief</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.750" end="00:25:53.040" style="s2">elevator description of Ensemble - it</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.560" end="00:25:56.370" style="s2">would be collaborative co-creation</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.040" end="00:25:58.740" style="s2">through collective intelligence so it</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.370" end="00:26:01.650" style="s2">encompasses collaboration working</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.740" end="00:26:05.070" style="s2">together co-creation when you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.650" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">co-creation then that means that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.070" end="00:26:11.940" style="s2">more than one and there is also an idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:14.490" style="s2">that there&#39;s multiple going on but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.940" end="00:26:17.070" style="s2">doing it together and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.490" end="00:26:20.310" style="s2">intelligence I think is very closely</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.070" end="00:26:22.470" style="s2">tied to what creativity researcher and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.310" end="00:26:27.240" style="s2">jazz pianist Keith Sawyer called</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.470" end="00:26:30.060" style="s2">group genius which takes the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.240" end="00:26:32.040" style="s2">flow which his dissertation adviser</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.060" end="00:26:35.030" style="s2">Mihai Csikszentmihalyi</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.040" end="00:26:37.500" style="s2">of course famously wrote about and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.030" end="00:26:39.820" style="s2">extends it to groups working together</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.500" end="00:26:42.430" style="s2">and we see that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.820" end="00:26:44.260" style="s2">hear it and feel it in jazz all the time</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.430" end="00:26:47.230" style="s2">so what we&#39;ve been doing through the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.260" end="00:26:49.810" style="s2">jazz leadership project is applying it</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.230" end="00:26:52.180" style="s2">to personal and organizational</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.810" end="00:26:55.270" style="s2">development through workshops with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.180" end="00:26:57.460" style="s2">live jazz band if you&#39;re coming from two</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.270" end="00:27:00.760" style="s2">completely different or disparate</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.460" end="00:27:04.420" style="s2">perspectives you got to have some type</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.760" end="00:27:07.720" style="s2">of common ground from which to then have</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.420" end="00:27:09.430" style="s2">that conversation so in jazz that common</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.720" end="00:27:12.010" style="s2">ground is usually knowledge of the Blues</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.430" end="00:27:15.820" style="s2">there has to be a common ground of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.010" end="00:27:18.670" style="s2">shared values shared meaning so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.820" end="00:27:22.540" style="s2">your conversation in your interaction</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.670" end="00:27:25.000" style="s2">can then really engage in that emergent</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.540" end="00:27:26.980" style="s2">quality of something new and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.000" end="00:27:27.490" style="s2">better coming out of it if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.980" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">have it</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.490" end="00:27:32.860" style="s2">then there&#39;s got to be some grounding</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">for the conversation in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.860" end="00:27:38.530" style="s2">and of course we see this in politics</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">where the the different camps that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.530" end="00:27:44.110" style="s2">available because of the camps they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:47.370" style="s2">in often times these days they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.110" end="00:27:50.440" style="s2">even have the willingness to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.370" end="00:27:52.150" style="s2">conversation and I mean conversation not</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.440" end="00:27:53.770" style="s2">where they&#39;re just arguing back and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.150" end="00:27:55.630" style="s2">forth I mean where they&#39;re truly</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.770" end="00:27:57.610" style="s2">listening so that goes back to listening</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.630" end="00:27:59.920" style="s2">and jazz leaves your project we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.610" end="00:28:00.760" style="s2">three levels of listening that I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.920" end="00:28:05.170" style="s2">to share with you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.760" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">the first is just being attentive you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.170" end="00:28:07.900" style="s2">know really focusing on what the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.390" style="s2">person is saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.900" end="00:28:15.670" style="s2">then there&#39;s empathetic listening where</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.390" end="00:28:18.280" style="s2">you include an open heart and you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.670" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">feel or you you listen deeply to feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.280" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">where the other person is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.750" end="00:28:26.290" style="s2">and then there&#39;s generative listening</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:29.650" style="s2">which we get from auto schirmer&#39;s theory</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.290" end="00:28:33.970" style="s2">you concept where a generative listening</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.650" end="00:28:37.780" style="s2">is open heart and open will so you link</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.970" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">to one another and then you are feeling</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.780" end="00:28:44.380" style="s2">one another kind of like whole body like</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:47.530" style="s2">this cognitive heart gut the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.380" end="00:28:51.190" style="s2">and then you&#39;re working together to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.530" end="00:28:53.740" style="s2">co-create a future future possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.190" end="00:28:56.470" style="s2">are there so greg has that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.740" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">of how we come together and work</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.470" end="00:29:00.220" style="s2">together and create something new and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:01.540" style="s2">another person is doing that is Bonita</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.220" end="00:29:03.340" style="s2">Roy who we found on the channel a few</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.540" end="00:29:05.320" style="s2">times is also a systems theorist and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.340" end="00:29:07.210" style="s2">facilitator who runs what she calls</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.320" end="00:29:09.040" style="s2">collective insight practice a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.210" end="00:29:11.640" style="s2">parallels with with what happens in say</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.040" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">a jazz ensemble etc it&#39;s coming together</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.640" end="00:29:15.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit different that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:17.650" style="s2">coming together to specifically rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.490" end="00:29:20.770" style="s2">than play music come to a collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.650" end="00:29:23.110" style="s2">insight and but need to had a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.770" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">interesting kind of watch out for this</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.110" end="00:29:27.010" style="s2">space you know I&#39;m it&#39;s a cognitive trap</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:28.059" style="s2">I found myself coming into which is if</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.010" end="00:29:29.890" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.059" end="00:29:32.950" style="s2">okay there&#39;s too much propositional</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.890" end="00:29:34.090" style="s2">rigid model-making going on and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.950" end="00:29:35.590" style="s2">too many people who are using</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.090" end="00:29:38.590" style="s2">engineering language trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.590" end="00:29:40.660" style="s2">something that&#39;s very complex the swing</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.590" end="00:29:43.179" style="s2">that can happen is well that means the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.660" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">embodied really flowing intuitive people</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.179" end="00:29:47.770" style="s2">are better in some way and of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:50.110" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case it&#39;s it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.770" end="00:29:53.640" style="s2">both are needed so when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.110" end="00:29:57.370" style="s2">collective insight practice actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.640" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">people are processing something but one</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.370" end="00:30:02.200" style="s2">comes down abstract that&#39;s the social</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:03.929" style="s2">processing temperament and one comes out</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.200" end="00:30:08.740" style="s2">as narrative</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.929" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">why you always like this and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.740" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">tendency see that think that what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:15.040" style="s2">more important than the other they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:17.620" style="s2">both triggered they&#39;re both out of</p>

<p begin="00:30:17.620" end="00:30:24.460" style="s2">regulated now but we tend to think the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.670" end="00:30:27.370" style="s2">narrative mythic is somehow closer to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.460" end="00:30:32.260" style="s2">anchored and body it&#39;s just a different</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.370" end="00:30:34.840" style="s2">social processing energy you have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.260" end="00:30:36.730" style="s2">process that energy and social space is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:39.550" style="s2">going to come out whether narrative or</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.730" end="00:30:41.140" style="s2">abstract i bonita points out that when</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.550" end="00:30:43.150" style="s2">when people come together to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.140" end="00:30:45.370" style="s2">collective insight practice that is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.150" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">main fault line that cups up there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.370" end="00:30:48.190" style="s2">people who explain the world through</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:50.200" style="s2">stories and there&#39;s people who explain</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.190" end="00:30:52.090" style="s2">the world through mental models and very</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.200" end="00:30:54.490" style="s2">often they sort of clash but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.090" end="00:30:56.500" style="s2">important that we find a way to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.490" end="00:30:58.300" style="s2">side we&#39;re on understand that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.500" end="00:30:59.740" style="s2">just another way that that person has of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.300" end="00:31:01.240" style="s2">seeing the world and explaining their</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.740" end="00:31:04.809" style="s2">experience and I think there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.240" end="00:31:07.690" style="s2">parallel that I pick up a lot in some</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.809" end="00:31:10.810" style="s2">more alternative circles there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.690" end="00:31:12.520" style="s2">a version to the former like</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.810" end="00:31:14.050" style="s2">propositional ways of knowing and that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.520" end="00:31:15.460" style="s2">think if like that is really really</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.050" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">important like stories</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.460" end="00:31:19.630" style="s2">so we learnt we&#39;ve both trained as</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:21.190" style="s2">counselors and the idea in counseling is</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.630" end="00:31:23.290" style="s2">that you are you&#39;re talking your way to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.190" end="00:31:26.230" style="s2">more insight you&#39;re talking your way to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.290" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">understanding yourself better but that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.230" end="00:31:30.310" style="s2">can be like so many of those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:31.690" style="s2">therapeutic models I think both of us</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.310" end="00:31:33.850" style="s2">were to read don&#39;t actually work that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.690" end="00:31:35.230" style="s2">well if they&#39;re not including the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.850" end="00:31:36.580" style="s2">of the body if they&#39;re not including</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.230" end="00:31:38.890" style="s2">like what are you feeling in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.580" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">what and some kind of potentially</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.890" end="00:31:42.190" style="s2">emotional clearing work as well of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:44.110" style="s2">maybe sometimes you just need to go out</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.190" end="00:31:46.750" style="s2">and shout and scream and get into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.110" end="00:31:49.180" style="s2">like let that out it&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.750" end="00:31:51.400" style="s2">talking your way to a solution but on</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.180" end="00:31:53.980" style="s2">the other side you can also find in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.400" end="00:31:56.860" style="s2">more alternative world an overemphasis</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.980" end="00:31:59.590" style="s2">on the body and a complete denial of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.860" end="00:32:01.690" style="s2">need for kind of processing story and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.590" end="00:32:04.660" style="s2">think that the that for me is really</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.690" end="00:32:06.460" style="s2">interesting that and my sense is having</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.660" end="00:32:08.020" style="s2">having kind of gone into this work and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.460" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">trained in this work is that both are</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.020" end="00:32:13.180" style="s2">needed that we need to do the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:14.830" style="s2">clearing the the embodied work and kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.180" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">of be really alive to what&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.830" end="00:32:19.450" style="s2">in our bodies but also we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:21.460" style="s2">articulate it it&#39;s not one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.450" end="00:32:22.690" style="s2">and so many times like I&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.460" end="00:32:24.130" style="s2">breath workshop or I&#39;ve been in some</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.690" end="00:32:25.630" style="s2">kind of transformational workshop and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.130" end="00:32:27.700" style="s2">they&#39;re like okay let go of the story</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.630" end="00:32:29.890" style="s2">let go the story and there&#39;s no space</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.700" end="00:32:33.010" style="s2">given to talk about what might have come</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.890" end="00:32:35.770" style="s2">up and my sense is that if we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.010" end="00:32:38.770" style="s2">that then we don&#39;t articulate we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.770" end="00:32:40.870" style="s2">make real in our systems the insights</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.770" end="00:32:43.300" style="s2">that we might have experienced in a more</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.870" end="00:32:45.490" style="s2">liminal transformational space that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.300" end="00:32:47.020" style="s2">actually by articulating it like if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.490" end="00:32:49.660" style="s2">have a transformative experience or you</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.020" end="00:32:52.360" style="s2">have some kind of insight you actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.660" end="00:32:54.670" style="s2">need to talk about it you need to make</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.360" end="00:32:56.050" style="s2">it concrete by talking about you make</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.670" end="00:32:59.230" style="s2">something that&#39;s kind of half understood</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.050" end="00:33:02.470" style="s2">or half perceived real like there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.230" end="00:33:04.630" style="s2">some deep in the beginning was the word</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.470" end="00:33:06.550" style="s2">like there&#39;s a reason why that is at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.630" end="00:33:10.150" style="s2">center of so much of our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.550" end="00:33:12.250" style="s2">mythology is because by articulating by</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.150" end="00:33:14.860" style="s2">conceptualizing we do make make things</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.250" end="00:33:18.490" style="s2">more real and those two ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.860" end="00:33:20.419" style="s2">have to be yea integrated in more of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.490" end="00:33:21.409" style="s2">these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.419" end="00:33:23.330" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.409" end="00:33:24.919" style="s2">talking about that I&#39;m kind of getting</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.330" end="00:33:28.070" style="s2">an insight that I hadn&#39;t felt it before</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.919" end="00:33:30.970" style="s2">so John DeBakey when we spoke he he</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.070" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">reference at one point that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.970" end="00:33:35.059" style="s2">links the different ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:36.200" style="s2">together so it links your propositional</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.059" end="00:33:38.359" style="s2">knowing with the other types of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.200" end="00:33:40.850" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a through line that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.359" end="00:33:43.220" style="s2">connects it all together and what it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.850" end="00:33:44.359" style="s2">feels like is that it&#39;s it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.220" end="00:33:45.859" style="s2">important to acknowledge that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.359" end="00:33:47.960" style="s2">different ways of knowing are not always</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.859" end="00:33:49.639" style="s2">appropriate for every situation like you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.960" end="00:33:51.109" style="s2">can&#39;t really walk around without any</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.639" end="00:33:52.970" style="s2">narrative all the time like you might</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.109" end="00:33:55.249" style="s2">have you know like in a meditation space</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.970" end="00:33:57.049" style="s2">you you need some kind of narrative to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.249" end="00:33:59.389" style="s2">link your life together but there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.049" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">times where VirB a key points out that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.389" end="00:34:03.529" style="s2">narrative itself can become constraining</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:04.909" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s like you said the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.529" end="00:34:06.619" style="s2">narrative the story we tell about</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.909" end="00:34:08.569" style="s2">ourselves can start trapping us and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.619" end="00:34:10.700" style="s2">start blinding us to certain things so</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.569" end="00:34:12.260" style="s2">while it&#39;s important it&#39;s almost feels</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.700" end="00:34:14.210" style="s2">like it needs to be regenerated through</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.260" end="00:34:16.819" style="s2">these other ways of knowing so by going</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.210" end="00:34:18.919" style="s2">into a flow state for example the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.819" end="00:34:20.059" style="s2">reveille key points out that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.919" end="00:34:22.490" style="s2">of propositional knowing and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.059" end="00:34:24.500" style="s2">narrative ego goes into the background</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.490" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">and these other ways of knowing coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.500" end="00:34:27.169" style="s2">to the foreground it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:29.299" style="s2">deeply present with whatever is going on</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.169" end="00:34:32.149" style="s2">everything matters a lot you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.299" end="00:34:33.829" style="s2">there and that&#39;s really important it</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.149" end="00:34:35.179" style="s2">feels like it kind of regenerates and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.829" end="00:34:37.159" style="s2">gives us a little bit of space away from</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.179" end="00:34:39.619" style="s2">the story and then when we go back to it</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.159" end="00:34:41.899" style="s2">back to our ideas back to our things we</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.619" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">think we know we can kind of regenerate</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.899" end="00:34:46.760" style="s2">them from that space so so it feels</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.919" style="s2">important to kind of add that in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.760" end="00:34:50.329" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we are looking to live</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.919" end="00:34:52.520" style="s2">permanently in some different way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.329" end="00:34:54.559" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s that there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.520" end="00:34:56.270" style="s2">dance that has to take place between all</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.559" end="00:34:57.890" style="s2">of these different types and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.270" end="00:34:59.720" style="s2">use them in the right way at the right</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.890" end="00:35:01.549" style="s2">time and he was also important to talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.720" end="00:35:06.020" style="s2">about that John the Reiki in particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.549" end="00:35:08.089" style="s2">his next focus is going to be on kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.020" end="00:35:09.950" style="s2">into subjective ways of knowing like</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.089" end="00:35:11.450" style="s2">this put more participate or II way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.950" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">knowing and though he&#39;s got a series</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.450" end="00:35:17.270" style="s2">coming up about Socrates called after</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:19.849" style="s2">Socrates about the history of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.270" end="00:35:22.099" style="s2">and how we come to truth together how we</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.849" end="00:35:23.900" style="s2">come to understanding together so I know</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.099" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">that this is sort of become a real focus</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.900" end="00:35:27.410" style="s2">of his journey so it feels like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:30.319" style="s2">people are kind of aligning in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.410" end="00:35:32.510" style="s2">space and just because I know that</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.319" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">there&#39;s more articles coming up</p>

<p begin="00:36:01.870" end="00:36:05.900" style="s2">what kind of information do we then get</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.250" end="00:36:08.750" style="s2">access to and and why is that relevant</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.900" end="00:36:11.260" style="s2">to the therapy why is it relevant to the</p>
