<p begin="00:00:32.719" end="00:00:38.800" style="s2">on things are afoot so</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">i believe that we are going to uh start</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">by talking about some uh social media</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:46.480" style="s2">shenanigans uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:48.320" style="s2">to put it rather more lightly than is</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.480" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">actually the case and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.320" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">move on to talking a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">the nature of mass movements</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:54.879" style="s2">all right the nature of mass movements</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">good well i&#39;m looking forward to that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.879" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">but yes we should start</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">with what has happened in the last week</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:01.840" style="s2">it seems like a month but you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the nature of uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.840" end="00:01:06.080" style="s2">time travel at the uh the period</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:07.360" style="s2">approaching the election</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.080" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">here&#39;s what happened for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.360" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">who have not been paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">what happened was i was involved in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">private discussion in which somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">posted a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">facebook link that i was supposed to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">look at and i clicked on the link</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">and i got an amazing message is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">could you show the message oh</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">this is awkward we&#39;re waiting to show</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">you the message here&#39;s the message</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">it says your account has been disabled</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">you can&#39;t use facebook because your</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:40.159" style="s2">account or activity on it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t follow our community standards</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.159" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">we have already reviewed this decision</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">and it can&#39;t be reversed</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">etc etc so i saw this i was completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">shocked</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">now those of you who are not facebook</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">friends of mine</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">i might need to give you a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">orientation i used to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">not a heavy user of facebook but a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">regular user of facebook</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:03.680" style="s2">and then after the evergreen meltdown</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">facebook became a very toxic environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.680" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">and i effectively walked away from it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">moving most of my social media presence</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:12.160" style="s2">over to twitter where things were more</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">manageable and more hospitable believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.160" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">it or not</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">um so i barely post there and i was</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">shocked to see this</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">um this warning here that says that my</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">account has been permanently disabled</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">as far as i knew i hadn&#39;t posted</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">anything on it recently and i believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">i might have logged in logged on in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">october but</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">my last logon in which i did anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">might have been even</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">september so what the heck triggered</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">this well of course we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">they do not feel obligated to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">anything about what rules</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">uh mean how we might have violated them</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s no mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">to uh to appeal the decision so</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">uh i was suitably shocked and confused</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">posted a tweet zach could you show the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">tweet it says i have been evicted from</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">facebook no explanation no appeal</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">i have downloaded quote my information</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">end quote and see</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">nothing that explains it we are governed</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">now in private by entities that make</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">their own rules and are answerable to no</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">disaster is inevitable we are living it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">and this we&#39;re governed now in private</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">thing that you write here is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">uh reference to the same thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">i believe in our last live stream in</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">which you were talking about basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">government is that which governs yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what i&#39;m referring to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">government is that which governs and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">it is uh there is no shame to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">founders that they did not anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">social media</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">and therefore did not protect the rights</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">that they knew were necessary</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">in order for democracy to function in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">the context of social media because</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">there would have been no way</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">to write those rules so what we are now</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">they were remarkably prophetic but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">could not predict the specificity</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">of the future nor especially so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">many years out right i mean you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">rate of change is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">as it is and they couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">predicted the rate of change much less</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">as the rate of change itself accelerated</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">these people had never seen a train they</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">had never seen a chainsaw</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">um they would have uh known of at least</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">hot air balloons that&#39;s about uh the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">extent of the tech</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">is that right yeah the razzle dazzle</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">that would have been available to them</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">and imagining</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">what was needed but there would have</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">been no way to anticipate this and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:37.759" style="s2">to see the degree of the problem think</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">about if somebody had told</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.759" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">you in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">about twitter that they had told you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">there was a wildly popular service in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">which people were limited to a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">number of characters and they barked</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">into the ether</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">and others listened and rebroadcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">these things you wouldn&#39;t have known</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">what they were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">and i might have begun looking for a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">planet right um</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">yes uh elon get on it oh no no</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">no no i don&#39;t want him in charge because</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:06.639" style="s2">he&#39;ll take us to mars and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">nothing to do there right</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.639" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">right okay well i would agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">but in any case there&#39;s no way we could</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">expect them</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">to write rules that would have protected</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">us and the thing that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">problem that we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">is we are told uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">by an ever-present chorus of people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">respond when one complains about an</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">arbitrary decision</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">like this that well these are private</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">corporations and you&#39;re using their</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">service and you&#39;re getting it for free</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:12.880" style="s2">what they want</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">is the the naming that calling them</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.880" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">social media suggests that is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">media and of course freedom of the press</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">suggests exactly that something like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">new york times has editorial control and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">they can publish or refuse to publish</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">whomever they want and that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">part of what freedom of the press</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">guarantees</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">and that calling these these platforms</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">social media suggests that they are like</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">except that they effectively have</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">monopolies right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">and in fact there is a provision i&#39;m uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">is it 2 230 i&#39;ve forgotten the number</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">these platforms are publishers or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">and in effect the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">platforms are taking the position that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">they are publishers</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">where that protects them uh and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.440" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">they are not publishers with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">responsibilities so they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">gaining the better</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">yeah they get the best of both worlds</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">and it leaves us with a bad predicament</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">if i can complete the story here if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">look at this tweet if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">watching this on youtube you&#39;ll see it</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">has quite a large number</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">of likes now this is on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">on twitter yes my uh my pointing out to</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">and no opportunity for appeal</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.840" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">caught people&#39;s attention because uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">well as you can see in the replies to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">that tweet people regard me</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">as a very uh sober and responsible voice</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">and they wanted to know what i might</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">have done on facebook that could have</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">triggered this the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">nothing um and so anyway it spread</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">like let me just you it&#39;s not even that</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">everything that you would have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">doing on facebook i mean you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">said this but it&#39;s not even that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">everything that you had been doing on</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">facebook was completely defensible and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">well within</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">you know everyone&#39;s understanding even</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">of like the overton window that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">these the social media platforms are for</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">some reason patrolling the borders of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">um but you literally had said nothing</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:07.839" style="s2">right there was there was literally</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">nothing that prompted this so far as we</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.839" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">could tell because you literally aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">active on this platform and i&#39;ll say i</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">don&#39;t even have a facebook account and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">never have so i can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">view what&#39;s going on there but um like</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">literally you had done nothing</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">and usually that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">metaphorically you&#39;d done nothing here</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">just there was nothing that you had done</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">on facebook that prompted this well</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2">you know unless they decided to go back</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:35.920" style="s2">into the history there&#39;s nothing i did</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.000" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">in the period here where i got banned</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.920" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">they could possibly explain it because i</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">wasn&#39;t doing anything so</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">um i think the the you know i referred</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">in my uh tweet</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">suggesting that people come visit us on</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">i think that there is a politically</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">motivated core within facebook that has</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">the power to ban</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.079" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">people and frankly i think if i had been</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">active on facebook recently it probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">would have found something they&#39;ve set</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">you know community standards that are so</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">arbitrary and vague</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">that they can find something but in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">case it was like well i didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">anything that could justify this</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">because i wasn&#39;t active and so we&#39;ll ban</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:23.200" style="s2">him anyway and what&#39;s he going to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">about it there&#39;s not even a</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">they tell me they&#39;ve already reviewed it</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">okay now already reviewed it</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:35.839" style="s2">has a very clear connotation it suggests</p>

<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">now i find this fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.839" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">because this clearly suggests that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">was an automated phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">which then seems to call into question</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">i have a large number of facebook</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">friends they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">coherent in the sense that many of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">stem from places that they that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">geographical places</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">you know places i&#39;ve worked evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">and the like so the account does not</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">look like an imposter account nor was it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">behaving like an imposter account</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">because it was largely dormant</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.880" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">so clearly something is up</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">well how am i ever going to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">what might be the cause of this</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">there was a</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">they had changed the process and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">basically they said</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">that they were no longer verifying</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">people because it had become</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">reaches the attention of the press so</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen several other examples that</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">so here we have nick pasilio who is</p>

<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">screenshot zach</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">all right now we have uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:17.760" style="s2">can you read his name i can&#39;t see it um</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">it&#39;s carlos monreal um</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.760" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">carlos monge is uh he was</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">at twitter he has now moved on to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">biden&#39;s transition team</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">seems a little premature to me but</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">nonetheless he&#39;s moved on to biden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">transition team um so</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">in any case there are these connections</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how many of them there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know what the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">these partisan folks in</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">uh in our governmental structure and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">these private platforms is but</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:53.120" style="s2">in some sense what we have is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">new version of the revolving door</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.120" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">right so the traditional revolving door</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">as it is used to describe</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">governmental corrupt corruption involves</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">people who take a who step out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">industry</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">and into government for some number of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">years and then return to industry that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">would be the classic pattern</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">and of course it functions as some kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">of a legal bribing mechanism because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">person knowing that they&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:17.760" style="s2">from an industry knows what the industry</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">wants knowing that they will return</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.760" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">there they do the industry&#39;s bidding</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">and the point is no fingerprints another</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">way this can work</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">is industry can approach somebody in</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">persuade them hey you know when you come</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">out why don&#39;t you look us up see if</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a job</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">that we might have for you yep it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">mechanism but then this version with</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">twitter and facebook and presumably</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">google</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:43.280" style="s2">has a different spin to it right it</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">works in a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.280" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">direction that in effect instead of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">going into government to do industries</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.159" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">bidding these are people from</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">a partisan faction of government who go</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">industry right to do the parties bidding</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a different revolving door a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">fundamentally different revolving door</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">but it&#39;s no less influence pedaling well</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">that&#39;s just the thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">so if we can step back and of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">this is a heck of a week to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">discussing influence pedaling</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">um but what we&#39;ve got is um</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">a party which is not supposed to have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">right parties are supposed to represent</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">people like me</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">lifetime democrat you as well lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">democrat we are the democratic party but</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">the democratic party is</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">run by the dnc which is as i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">saying throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">period of unity and influence peddling</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">operation</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">pure and simple now that influence</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">peddling operation</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">has to acquire power for which it needs</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">votes</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">and then what it does with that power is</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">it peddles it</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">right so to the extent that voters stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">electing the democratic party it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:56.240" style="s2">nothing to monetize it can&#39;t sell its</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">influence and so it must maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.240" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">influence it must win voters</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">how do you do that well you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">control the conversation because if</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">people were to understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">actually driving policy</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:07.039" style="s2">they would throw the bums out so how do</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.039" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">well the discussion is taking place on</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">twitter on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:15.600" style="s2">on instagram who knows where else so the</p>

<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">well frankly it looks like what twitter</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">did with the hunter biden story</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.840" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">right twitter actually shut down</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">obviously the voters have a right to</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">entitled to extrapolate that that might</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">characterize a biden administration</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">too and this is of course deeply</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:18.159" style="s2">because it was um you know the ukrainian</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:40.480" style="s2">appear to be robust on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.320" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">evidence right evidence from hunter</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">makes sense to us so we are now being</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">uh we are being infantilized and lied to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">and having our right to decide actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:09.440" style="s2">i do want to discuss that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:12.159" style="s2">overridden by you know it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.440" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">nanny states the nanny corporations</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.159" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">so uh i mean the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">absolutely frightening</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">and you know i have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">point out that the motivation for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">uh unity 2020 plan</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">was that we were faced with essentially</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">an influence peddling operation on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">democratic side</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">and a different version</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">of abuse of power on the republican side</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">it was the system that caused</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">this sort of breakdown that left people</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">frozen out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">governmental power which has made them</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">frustrated and angry and is causing them</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">to lash out in the streets and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">essentially we have to confront the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:25:02.000" style="s2">mechanism that generates this failure</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">or it&#39;s going to take the republic apart</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.000" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">and you know we&#39;re seeing it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">seeing it all laid bare</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the corruption we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that it actually is you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">know it is affecting the way we are able</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:19.120" style="s2">collectively think by basically deciding</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">not to pass certain messages</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.120" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">i mean remember the unity 2020 twitter</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">was suspended for registering</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">thoughts i mean you know think about it</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">quite right because censorship you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">we do censor what</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">is that now we have corporations working</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">on behalf of particular political</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">parties</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">who want to change the motivations of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">people even when that is not in their</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">best interests and isn&#39;t only in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">interest of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:18.799" style="s2">uh in this case the dnc well i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">there there are two things there yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">it is not the people you know the nanny</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">the reference</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">nanny is about an adult who is empowered</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">to tell you no</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:29.520" style="s2">presumably to protect you from your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.919" style="s2">worst instincts as a child</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.520" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">right and so being infantilized by a</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.919" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">government that wants to protect us</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">against our own instincts</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.559" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">is bad enough when it actually happens</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">now the term nanny state is often used</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">to dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">regulation that exactly that is about</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">preventing</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">real harm that can&#39;t be prevented in</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:49.600" style="s2">other ways but</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">but it is also true that we see</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.600" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">overreach but the thing is as americans</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:57.279" style="s2">values encoded in the first amendment</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:28:59.679" style="s2">whether the first amendment should</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.279" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">in some way be extended to or something</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">else should come to protect us online i</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">mean and i would remind you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">twitter facebook google these are</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">private concerns</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:12.799" style="s2">but they are on public roads i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">started as darpanet right this was our</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">governmental structure generating a</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:21.760" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">that then created an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.760" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">these private concerns but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">simple matter of hey they&#39;re private</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">they can do what they want because</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">effectively we don&#39;t have a public</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">access to this internet that we built</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">right so it&#39;s one of these things where</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">there&#39;s at the very least a gray area as</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:38.320" style="s2">it is with research where</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">um the public funds the research and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">uh the product of it is private</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">and as it has i mean just more more a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">closer analogy would be say the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">telephone companies right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:50.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t remember the history</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">well enough to to even</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.159" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">replay it briefly but um you know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">government went in and broke up</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:30:00.320" style="s2">um um and made a bunch of baby bells</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">because there was a monopoly and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.320" end="00:30:03.679" style="s2">you know in fact the airwaves are ours</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">the airwaves are ours</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">and the you know the in the case of of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">telephone it&#39;s not airwaves but similar</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">things have happened with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">networks um yeah this is true</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">but at a deeper level i would say we</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">have almost uniquely protected speech</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">on the basis that speech itself is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">understood to be harmful right or at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">very least</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">that the harm that can come from speech</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">itself that is to say there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">bad speech but it is a symptom of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">something else that is harmful</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">but to the extent that speech might even</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">be harmful it is understood</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:47.520" style="s2">that the greater harm is done by</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">empowering something to decide what can</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">be said</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">which is exactly what is happening here</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">and so it actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">strikes me that there&#39;s an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">between this question and something that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">we discuss</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">in our book about um the fact that in</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">our ancestral environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">a bad smell was not itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">typically harmful i mean in fact almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">never right um</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">that is to say you smell something bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">like a rotting fish and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve smelled it doesn&#39;t hurt you but</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">it does tell you don&#39;t eat that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">right now in this case warning itself is</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">not dangerous it&#39;s telling you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s advising you as to how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">modify your behavior going forward</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">as opposed to right so in in this case</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:31.600" style="s2">you know you can have hilarion speech</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">right it&#39;s not the speech that hurts you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.600" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the hitlerianism that generates the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">speech so hearing the speech</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">actually allows you to deduce that</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">there&#39;s something dangerous there</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">whereas blocking the speeches if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">speech is doing the harm</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">then leaves open a it makes certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">things taboo which makes them attractive</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:50.159" style="s2">and b it means nobody&#39;s really in a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">position to know what is being</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.159" end="00:31:53.840" style="s2">thought and how commonly okay i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.840" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i love this analogy</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">because i thought what we talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">the book</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">is that modernity has brought with us</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">smells that themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">are dangerous like solvents um solvents</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">uh what toluene or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:12.880" style="s2">is toluene yeah yeah i think right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:14.240" style="s2">um this is a novel circumstance for</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.880" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">which we have no</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.240" end="00:32:19.519" style="s2">evolutionary history and in general um</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">the response to recoil in response to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.519" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">bad smell and to not go towards it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">to not eat it and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">has been sufficient up until at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">until the industrial revolution i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">more or less and it&#39;s not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">anymore and it&#39;s impossible to tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">unless you happen to be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">the particular thing that you were</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">smelling</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">based on smelling something novel and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:43.039" style="s2">reprehensible to your nose whether or</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">not the actual smelling of it is doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.039" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">you harm</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">i don&#39;t i think that some of what is</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:49.279" style="s2">going on with regard to for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.679" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">actual free speech debate</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.279" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">is that people on the authoritarian left</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:54.559" style="s2">are making exactly this claim about</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">speech</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.559" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">that now speech itself is going to harm</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">you and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">i think this is this is completely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">and therefore i don&#39;t like this analogy</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">no it is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">but this is the point is you know what</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">we need to have a discussion about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">because to the extent that speech is now</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:11.440" style="s2">being equated with violence</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">that is something that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.440" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">determine right if it is if something</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">about speech has changed we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">a discussion about what it is and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:19.200" style="s2">that means about the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">environment and assuming</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.200" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">that nothing has changed that speech is</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">then the answer is actually where is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">speech taking place</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">that&#39;s where we need to protect it</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">especially if there is no alternative</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">so this it all creates a pretty</p>

<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">puzzle and um the derangement of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">ability to think is obviously downstream</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">of these corrupt entities like the dnc</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">influencing these private concerns which</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">are beyond the reach</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">we can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s what because</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">involves you know the articles of unity</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">to somebody so you know if you think</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">about the way memory works</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">you know memory at a biological level</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">involves you</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">detecting that things have happened or</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">that you think they&#39;ve happened</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">and then when those things are</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">reinforced because you return to them</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">they become inscribed in your memory in</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">a deeper way so that they last so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">can&#39;t remember what you had for</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">breakfast last thursday because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">thought about it right so it that memory</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">has vanished other memories</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">get built in they get wired in so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">can access them for life because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">keep returning to them</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">and so in some sense you&#39;ve got the</p>

<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">there&#39;s certain thoughts that we would</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.919" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">rather you not remember there</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like proactive memory holding you</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">know what we don&#39;t really want you to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">is that hunter biden actually sold</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">access to his father</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">and you know was employed by this</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">corporation and that this was connected</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">to an impeachment</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">of a sitting president so add to this</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">the um derangement of memory that comes</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.839" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">how pretty much all of us now use the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">internet where even those who try to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">those of us who try to be scrupulous and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">clear off our virtual desktops and close</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">down our tabs and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">will will at some point usually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">reliably</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">have open a million tabs right and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">running into the same thing where you</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">like i left it open because i thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">maybe an oh right</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">and you know every time you run into</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">this it comes it jumps back into memory</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">you recall something maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">less than you did last time about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">eight connections that you thought you</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">might want to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">but it makes it less likely that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">actually put</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">together a coherent map of your universe</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">and i&#39;m reminded um</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">actually i think this also might be</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">we heard about in the book i&#39;m reminded</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">of one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">short pieces by um by borges</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">called funes the memorials in which he</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:35:59.119" style="s2">reports on someone</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">maybe at some point i&#39;ll i&#39;ll just read</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.119" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">it it&#39;s very short um</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">he reports on a character who cannot</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">forget anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">and this seems to be the way forward the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">way that you end up just becoming</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">replete with knowledge and of course of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">course no</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">because the way that we make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">our universe is to take in</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">as many things as we possibly can and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">then to do the analysis and the editing</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">and the calling and to be left with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">certain this is you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">actually how develop some of development</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">works too right let&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">apoptosis the selective this programmed</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">cell death</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">where and we start with webbing between</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">our fingers and then we you know we lose</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:36.480" style="s2">the material that we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">this and this happens with neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">growth as well as well right we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:41.599" style="s2">many more neurons and neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">connections in utero</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.599" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">and in very early childhood than than we</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:47.119" style="s2">then have as adults and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">that we&#39;re getting dumber it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.119" end="00:36:51.599" style="s2">we&#39;re getting stupid it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">you over build and then you and then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.599" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">trim</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">so memory memory works best when you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">you can fill but then you have the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">and the space</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">for the analysis for the thought for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to keep being</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">reminded of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">kind of thought you were already going</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">to get rid of or you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:13.119" style="s2">thought ah maybe maybe this maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.839" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">let me put it in some bucket and be</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.119" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">reminded of it once a month</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">as opposed to oh my god i got 80 tabs</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:20.839" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.839" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">let me see what&#39;s on them well actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.839" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">if you think back uh the movie version</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">men in black right is there a non-movie</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">version of men in black</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">uh yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a comic oh um</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.280" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">the neuralizer the device that allows</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">these uh governmental</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">ufo dudes to cause you to forget what</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve just seen because lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">movie world are seeing aliens all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">time and the government is you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">erasing these memories</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like these uh media these uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">are using a neuralizer who are they</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">using it for oh they&#39;re using it for</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:03.839" style="s2">their friends</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:05.520" style="s2">you know high up in these governmental</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.839" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">parties where you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.520" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">presumably these platforms love the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">access that they have and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:10.720" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">that the corruption of the government</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.720" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">structure is actually endangering the</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s all a frightening</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:22.000" style="s2">but yes the magic of understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">to think</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.000" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">involves editing down it&#39;s a sculpting</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">process and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">the insidious thing here is this is not</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">have to explain to you what their goal</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">was or why they thought something wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">yes you need at least two things to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">learn to to be able to think</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">uh carefully and to learn how to be in</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">possession of a mind that can do so</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">you need to be free to find whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">information you go looking for</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">and this is you know this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">that uh some people uh lament the loss</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">of actual like library stacks right that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">actually walking around</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">a physical library where things have</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.079" end="00:39:13.520" style="s2">been more or less put</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">into a spot so that you you went looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:16.240" style="s2">for one book and you end up finding 10</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">others that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.240" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">a little bit related but not quite which</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">is harder to do when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">say a google scholar search or you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">web of science search looking for</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">scientific literature for instance um</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.839" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">but then you also need</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">the the silence basically the mental</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">silence and the ability to stop at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">gates any more stuff from coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">impinging on your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">consider what all it is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">now taken in and what it means</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">and uh we we are losing we are losing</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">both of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">do you have more here or shall we well i</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">would just say in</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">closing ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">um the message that i want people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">derive</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">is that the influence peddling itself is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">destroying the republic the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">through which it functions and preserves</p>

<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">are ever-changing but i believe it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">the case that until we figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">deal with the influence peddling problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:18.240" style="s2">and the fact that it has left the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">american public</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:23.920" style="s2">as a side light to issues of policy</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">we&#39;re going to face a system that gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.920" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">worse and not better</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">and to the extent that twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">facebook and google</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">don&#39;t want us discussing the influence</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">peddling by the people that they assure</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:38.880" style="s2">us we have to vote for</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:40.319" style="s2">they are the problem and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.880" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">have to confront them</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.319" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">can&#39;t damn a river on your private</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">property um</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">meaning that private property is not the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">end-all and be-all</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">of uh of rights and i i unless</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">unless you own the the land that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">river runs through all the way out to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">in which case you might be able to but</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">so long as the river goes on to other</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">people&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to affect um that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">that which is not yours with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">damming water and we are all having deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">effects on</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">each other so these ideas of this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">mine and i can do with it what i want</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">is often not the case because right</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">there are deep implications yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">all right um so i</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:36.400" style="s2">last week we did a deep dive into rod</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">drear&#39;s new book live not by lives</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.400" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">live not by lies which is uh named for</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:43.440" style="s2">the solzhenitsyn essay which i read an</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:45.040" style="s2">excerpt from in the previous episode in</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.440" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">episode 49.</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.040" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">and um after that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">um i was thinking a bit about this book</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">which i&#39;ve had on my bed stand for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">while eric hoffer&#39;s the true believer</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">thoughts on the nature of mass movements</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">and i&#39;ve dipped into it here and there</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">um and i think it</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">really has a number of things to teach</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">us about our current moment</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">and in a way there&#39;s there&#39;s some hope</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:12.319" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">to be had from it so this book was</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.319" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">written in 1951 which means</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">it has um the issue is all</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">older tomes do as all older texts do</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">just as we were talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">regard to the constitution the framers</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:26.240" style="s2">of the constitution</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">um they could not have accurately</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.240" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">predicted what had not yet happened and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">so the examples are inherently from</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">that time uh in this book and and before</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.000" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">um and so we i think we might</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">extrapolate a little bit from</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">some of his thoughts but let me just say</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">first so basically i want to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">little bit about what enables mass</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">who participates what are the tools by</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.040" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">which they work where do the fanatics</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:51.520" style="s2">and specifically then how can creativity</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">provide resistance to their appeal and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.520" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">what do honorable leaders look like</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">like um so um</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">this eric hoffer um just reading from</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">the back</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:05.359" style="s2">um was self who lived from 1902 to 1983</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">was self-educated and lived the life of</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.359" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">a drifter through the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:10.839" style="s2">after pearl harbor he worked as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">longshoreman in san francisco for 25</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.839" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">and he was awarded the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">medal of freedom in 1983 and died later</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">that year</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">and specifically the true believer which</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">is the first of his books</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">um which i guess if it&#39;s published in</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">1951 the first of his books was</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">published when he was 49 years old</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:34.720" style="s2">um became a bestseller when president</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.720" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">earliest televised press conferences</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s what this book is i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">a current politician um reading or</p>

<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">short excerpts as we proceed here let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:53.680" style="s2">as an aid in this effort uses made of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">working hypothesis</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">they usually join of their own accord</p>

<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">without any proselytizing prompting from</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">the outside can generate most of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">peculiar characteristics of the true</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">believer</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">and two that an effective technique of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">conversion consists basically in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">inculcation</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">and fixation of proclivities and</p>

<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">so this this strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">there are a number of other places that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">we want to go here but</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">his his core hypothesis in this book is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:34.800" style="s2">actually finding a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">are frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">is is is sufficient and i think he is</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">actually arguing that it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">that is maybe not necessary but if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">have it it is sufficient so it is akin</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:49.040" style="s2">to necessary and sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">to creating a mess a mass movement if</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.040" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">you if you then know</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:54.880" style="s2">what to do with it um and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.880" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something to be teased out here</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">from the election four years ago in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">united states the 2016 election</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">there were the vast majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">on the left</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">saw trump seeming to use exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">frustration</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">of a vast majority of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">right as a unifying agent</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">that he was saying things like drain the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">swamp and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">uh make america great again and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">going gonna bring jobs back</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.280" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna stop the flow of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">who are taking your jobs and you know he</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.280" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">was finding the ways that people were</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">and um those on the left could look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">his rallies</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">and his rhetoric and the seeming</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">lockstep approval</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">by his rallying base and see in it the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">seeds of these other kinds of mass</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">movements fascism for instance and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:46.640" style="s2">was the thing that we started to hear</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:49.119" style="s2">from from the left right like he he is</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.640" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">gonna bring in fascism</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.119" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">this became in turn the and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">we have said many many times that we we</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.800" style="s2">don&#39;t see that we don&#39;t think that trump</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">was trying to be fascist nor was um nor</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.800" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">is likely to bring in fascism but he was</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">using</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">some of these kinds of of techniques</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">of um of the most effective leaders of</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">mass movements</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">specifically by cueing in on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:15.760" style="s2">frustration of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:17.440" style="s2">um of a of his base this then became in</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.760" end="00:48:19.200" style="s2">turn the rallying cry</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">of the mass movement that rose up quote</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.200" end="00:48:23.440" style="s2">in resistance right</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">um what we now see many on the left</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.440" end="00:48:25.680" style="s2">everyone from</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:27.520" style="s2">you know the woke to the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.680" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">democrats who were largely playing ftse</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.520" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">with the woke</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">are using fear-mongering</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">and hatred and mass delusion by claiming</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:41.280" style="s2">that fear-mongering and hatred and mass</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">delusion is what trump is doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.280" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">and therefore that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">people on the left must do as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.559" end="00:48:50.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s a mass movement to um the claim</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">is to defend against</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.079" end="00:48:54.000" style="s2">what seemed to be maybe a mass movement</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">and i would argue actually what was go</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.000" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">what was going on with trump was was not</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t what it appeared to amelia on</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.359" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">the left but what has a what has</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">what has risen up and what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">happened long before</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">the 2016 election actually um was they</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">were looking for an excuse they the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.480" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">the hard left the far left right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">an excuse to create a mass movement and</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">could could they find</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">huge numbers of frustrated people of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">of course they could you have something</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:29.599" style="s2">to add here well</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">i mean i i think you&#39;re pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:33.200" style="s2">interesting which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">frustration that usually causes a mass</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">has caused two mass movements yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">the reason i mean maybe that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">common than we know</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">but that essentially what you&#39;ve got is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:49.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t even want to call it an unstable</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">equilibrium because</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.119" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">i think i drew a diagram on one of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">podcasts before</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">that basically had a zone of stability a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:49:58.640" style="s2">little trough in which the ball could</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">reside but if it went</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.640" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">too far in one direction or the other it</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">went over the side</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">right yes and in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not the right model here</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:09.440" style="s2">maybe the right model here is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:11.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a trough that holds the ball</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.440" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">and then something causes it to be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.200" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">peak and it causes a slide into two</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">different things but basically what</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve got i would argue the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">bottom thing is a very novel system that</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">is making people sick</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.839" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">and a very corrupt governmental</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">structure that is freezing them out of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">the solution-making</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:29.359" style="s2">yep right so they are left outside that</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">is almost</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.359" end="00:50:33.760" style="s2">literally going to cause frustration of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">every kind the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.760" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">one cannot do enough that is right to</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:39.119" style="s2">get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">right that thing will cause people to</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.119" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">look for the explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">what it is that&#39;s blocking their</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">and that means they are susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">snake oil salesmen who want to tell them</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">that you know what is causing your</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">frustration is</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:57.599" style="s2">rampant racism right really didn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">just elect a black president twice i</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.599" end="00:50:59.839" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">you know is it rampant racism yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.839" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">rampant racism that&#39;s the reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">you know or on the other side i guess it</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s uh governmental</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">incompetence</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">and uh immigrants or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.280" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">taking the well-being that is due you</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">and driving it somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.680" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">and the point is really if we were</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">paying attention and understood deeply</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:22.160" style="s2">we would recognize that actually there</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:24.640" style="s2">is something</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">that is taking well-being and it&#39;s rent</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.640" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">seekers and they own the governmental</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">and they are dealing with us as an</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">inconvenient periodic electoral hazard</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">that has to be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">um but that you you want to jump start</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">the economy right what you need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.680" end="00:51:44.319" style="s2">get the governmental structure to stop</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">functioning in this partisan way and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.319" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">bipartisan in this case i just mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">working for people who can buy access</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">and against everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">yes and how do you how do you do it how</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:58.720" style="s2">do you bring the frustrated together</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">uh there are a number of unifying uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.720" end="00:52:03.839" style="s2">unifying techniques and by</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">unifying i don&#39;t mean anything lovely or</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.839" end="00:52:07.359" style="s2">wonderful but</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">in in hoffer&#39;s explanation um you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.359" end="00:52:09.839" style="s2">how is it that you bring the frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.839" end="00:52:16.800" style="s2">um what can unify them well hatred</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">obviously right so uh for instance</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.800" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">here from hoffer again hatred is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">most accessible and comprehensive of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">all unifying agents it pulls and whirls</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">the individual away from his own self</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">makes him oblivious of his wheel and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">future frees him of jealousies and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">self-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.640" style="s2">he becomes an anonymous particle</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">quivering with a craving to fuse</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.640" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">and coalesce with his like into one</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">flaming mass</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.359" end="00:52:41.200" style="s2">mass mass movements can rise and spread</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">without belief in a god</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.200" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">but never without belief in a devil</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">usually the strength of a mass movement</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">is proportionate to the vividness and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">tangibility of its devil</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:52.079" style="s2">when hitler was asked whether he thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.079" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">the jew must be destroyed he answered</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.079" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">no we should have then to invent him it</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">is essential to have a tangible enemy</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.240" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">not merely an abstract one</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">f a voigt tells of a japanese mission</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:04.559" style="s2">that arrived in berlin in 1932</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:06.000" style="s2">to study the national socialist movement</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.559" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">voigt asked a member of the mission what</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.000" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">he thought of the movement he replied</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">it is magnificent i wish we could have</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">something like it in japan only we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:15.760" style="s2">because we haven&#39;t got any jews</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">it is perhaps true that the insight and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.760" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">shrewdness of the men who know how to</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">set a mass movement in motion</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:22.160" style="s2">or how to keep one going manifest</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">themselves as much in knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.160" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">pick a worthy enemy</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">as in knowing what doctrine to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">and what program to adopt</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">the theoreticians of the kremlin hardly</p>

<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:36.319" style="s2">and particularly america as the chosen</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.319" end="00:53:39.440" style="s2">of goodwill or any concession from our</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">side will reduce the volume and venom of</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">one of shanghai sheck&#39;s most serious</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">shortcomings was his failure to find an</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">appropriate new devil once the japanese</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">enemy vanished from the scene at the end</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">of the war</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.400" style="s2">the ambitious but simple-minded general</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:55.520" style="s2">was perhaps too conceited to realize</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.400" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">that it was not he</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.520" end="00:53:58.559" style="s2">but the japanese devil who generated the</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.559" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">the unity and the readiness for</p>

<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">is critical i think absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:20.079" style="s2">and um you know how how many devils</p>

<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">even if they&#39;re not actually fighting</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">for anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">all right this leads to multiple things</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2">but i i</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">i think the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.000" end="00:55:16.720" style="s2">hymenopterans um these are wasps yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">bees and wasps are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.720" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">in mind in this case um have a behavior</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:27.119" style="s2">and actually um you know but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:29.119" style="s2">my graduate work in panama involved</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.119" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">dealing with the hazard of africanized</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.119" end="00:55:34.559" style="s2">bees that there were</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">bees that had um been hybridized with</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.559" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">african strains</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">that went into this very aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">stinging behavior where</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">people you could die from being stung so</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.359" end="00:55:45.040" style="s2">many times which was not</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">the ancestral state for our new world</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.040" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">version of these bees</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">so just i mean just notable there is</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">that the difference between africanized</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">honey bees</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">and non-africanized honey bees is</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">entirely one of behavior and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">difference in group behavior</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:55:59.920" style="s2">um by by the bees right right right</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.920" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">but many many many people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:04.319" style="s2">understand they you know they may think</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.319" end="00:56:07.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a different venom it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s no it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.839" end="00:56:12.960" style="s2">when stung by one of our non-africanized</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:14.839" style="s2">honeybees i think it&#39;s just i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.960" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">just apis</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.839" end="00:56:20.160" style="s2">um typically you&#39;ll get one sting</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:21.520" style="s2">and you know maybe a couple and you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.160" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">get away but um</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.520" end="00:56:24.960" style="s2">africanized honey bees chase you down</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:27.680" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.960" end="00:56:29.599" style="s2">um and you know this is a response to</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.680" end="00:56:31.520" style="s2">different hazards to the hive so that</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:33.119" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not like the africanized</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.520" end="00:56:35.280" style="s2">or the african bees are</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.119" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">being wasteful they just have hazards</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.280" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">that require a lot more stings to</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">dissuade them right um but the thing i</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">wanted to point to</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:45.680" style="s2">is that one of the things that we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">learned in the study of these animals</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.680" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">is that they mark the animal that they</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:52.319" style="s2">perceive to have been a threat to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">hive whether it was or not so if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.319" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">walk</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">too close to a hive and you get a sting</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">you are now</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:56:59.920" style="s2">carrying a chemical signature and so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.920" end="00:57:03.359" style="s2">the fact that you back away from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">hive is now not good enough because you</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">have been marked</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:10.640" style="s2">as hazard to hive and therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">run yes you run and you hope very much</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:12.960" style="s2">that you don&#39;t run into a thicket you</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">can&#39;t get through</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.960" end="00:57:16.720" style="s2">or trip or you know and there&#39;s a famous</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.720" end="00:57:20.799" style="s2">in the research circles it would now be</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">20 years ago at least</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.799" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">of a student who uh disturbed a hive in</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.680" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">a cave</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:28.720" style="s2">and tripped and died was stunned to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">death um but</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">uh but in any case the wait there was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.640" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">hive in a cave</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">somehow okay yeah seems strange but i</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">don&#39;t remember the exact story it was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">it was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:41.760" style="s2">um ots student i believe but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.760" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">the fact of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:51.040" style="s2">we&#39;re going to set a bar and if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">tread across it we&#39;re going to label you</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.040" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">with some</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">phobia or something like that which</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:57.920" style="s2">makes you devil</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">and then you know no holds barred from</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.920" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">from that moment on that is very much</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:04.480" style="s2">how this</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:07.040" style="s2">seems to work now the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.480" end="00:58:11.280" style="s2">this makes me think though</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.040" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">is i must say i have</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.280" end="00:58:18.240" style="s2">i do not resonate with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:22.160" style="s2">of hating people very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.240" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a very rare individual that i find</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.160" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">uh deserving of hate i can be very angry</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">i&#39;m very angry at the behavior for</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">example of</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:31.680" style="s2">these platforms and the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:32.319" style="s2">are attempting to control the way we</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.680" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.319" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">but as for actually hating people i</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">reserve that for</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">ultra special occasions well and i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:43.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get to you know he starts</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:44.559" style="s2">the little excerpt that i read in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.520" end="00:58:45.680" style="s2">very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.559" end="00:58:47.760" style="s2">suggests that it&#39;s really it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.680" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">particular kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.760" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">and what i&#39;d like to do is talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:57.760" style="s2">even if you do enjoy succumbing to rage</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:58:58.799" style="s2">even if you do find yourself as as</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.760" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2">someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.799" end="00:59:02.799" style="s2">who has done this and may be you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">flippable to a different ideology</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.799" end="00:59:06.079" style="s2">that appears to be exactly the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:07.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.040" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">um defects really that you are revealing</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:14.319" style="s2">how is it that you could instead become</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">someone who</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:18.799" style="s2">is not as susceptible to rage who does</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:22.000" style="s2">not find it so enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.799" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">yes and in some sense i wonder i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.000" end="00:59:25.119" style="s2">this goes</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">this is one characteristic the</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.119" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">propensity to hate</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">means that you are vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">becoming a pawn of one of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">movements and these movements are very</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.680" style="s2">often driven by people who have an</p>

<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">right um and so not being susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">hate may even be like an immune</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">response to prevent yourself from being</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:46.880" style="s2">capturable yes so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">excellent not being susceptible to hate</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.880" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">may</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">provide a kind of immune response</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">interesting</p>

<p begin="01:00:51.119" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">a description of of many of these</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:57.520" style="s2">which we don&#39;t have time to do for the</p>

<p begin="01:00:57.520" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">but i want to share a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">specifically about um</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:05.440" style="s2">board i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:08.640" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.440" end="01:01:09.119" style="s2">um from that list though you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:11.280" style="s2">poor</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.119" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">misfits minorities etc we what we see</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.280" end="01:01:15.440" style="s2">here if we</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:18.000" style="s2">can read um</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.440" end="01:01:20.160" style="s2">again i don&#39;t think that that the trump</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.000" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">phenomenon really is a mass movement the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.160" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">way the left makes it out to be although</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">it does have some elements of it but if</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">if we for the moment read these as two</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:31.440" style="s2">competing mass movements</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:31.839" style="s2">it is in effect um pitting members of</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.440" end="01:01:33.119" style="s2">each</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">of some of those groups against one</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.119" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">another right it&#39;s sort of you know it</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:37.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">the the left seems to have completely</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.680" end="01:01:40.880" style="s2">forgotten about class</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">right which when we were growing up this</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.880" end="01:01:44.559" style="s2">was the concern</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">that we understood um to be the thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.559" end="01:01:46.720" style="s2">that really continues to keep people</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.720" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">and um and and trump does speak to that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">whereas</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">um people on the left the most vocal</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:55.440" style="s2">leaders on the left come from quite a</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:01:57.440" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.440" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">of money privilege which is the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.440" end="01:02:02.880" style="s2">privilege that that speaks loudest</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:06.160" style="s2">so um let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">when people offer rights are ripe for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.160" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">mass movement they are usually ripe for</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">any effective movement</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">and not solely for one with a particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.799" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">doctrine or program</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:17.039" style="s2">and furthermore since all mass movements</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.520" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">draw their adherence from the same types</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.039" end="01:02:19.680" style="s2">of humanity and appeal to the same types</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:21.839" style="s2">of mind</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.680" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">it follows that all mass movements are</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.839" end="01:02:24.720" style="s2">competitive</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:26.640" style="s2">and the gain of one in adherence is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">loss of all the others</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.640" end="01:02:30.559" style="s2">all mass movements are interchangeable</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:31.839" style="s2">one mass movement really transforms</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.559" end="01:02:33.760" style="s2">itself into another</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.839" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">a religious movement may develop into a</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.760" end="01:02:36.160" style="s2">social revolution or a nationalist</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:37.760" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.160" end="01:02:39.680" style="s2">a social revolution into militant</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.760" end="01:02:41.280" style="s2">nationalism or religious movement</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.680" end="01:02:43.599" style="s2">a nationalist movement into a social</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.280" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">revolution or a religious movement</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.599" end="01:02:49.920" style="s2">and i would say that we saw this even</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:50.960" style="s2">i didn&#39;t pull up any clips but in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.920" end="01:02:54.000" style="s2">early days</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.960" end="01:02:56.319" style="s2">of the post-george floyd um death</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.000" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">protests that were that quickly became</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.319" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">riots</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">as well we saw some you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">clearly like good faith</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:07.119" style="s2">black lives matter people and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">know if they</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.119" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">identify as leaders or not i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">what kind of a hierarchical or</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:13.839" style="s2">non-hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.760" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">system they have in place but we saw</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.839" end="01:03:18.400" style="s2">people really appealing</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">to rioters saying you know you you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.400" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">doing damage</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">to what we are trying to accomplish here</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:24.799" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:26.559" style="s2">what what you saw were you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.799" end="01:03:27.599" style="s2">people who were disaffected who were</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.559" end="01:03:30.799" style="s2">frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.599" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">seeing this outpouring of energy and yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.799" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">rage on the streets</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">who were coming in who even if</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:41.359" style="s2">we allow that the germ of the black</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:44.640" style="s2">lives matter movement</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.359" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">had had good people in it which</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.640" end="01:03:47.440" style="s2">certainly it had good people in it</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">whether or not the original founders of</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.440" end="01:03:52.559" style="s2">it were honest honest brokers</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:53.599" style="s2">um it quickly became corrupted um by all</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.559" end="01:03:54.880" style="s2">of these other people who were just</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.599" end="01:03:56.240" style="s2">looking for a mass movement</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.880" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">and the argument here would be they</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.240" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">could have just as easily</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">you know they want to call themselves</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">communist they could have easily just</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:03.839" style="s2">easily become fascists</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:05.599" style="s2">um you know in any of these any of these</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.839" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">other ideologies that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.599" end="01:04:08.640" style="s2">the ideology isn&#39;t the driving force</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:10.319" style="s2">it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.640" end="01:04:12.079" style="s2">it&#39;s the belonging it&#39;s the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.319" end="01:04:14.240" style="s2">frustration it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.079" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">frankly it&#39;s the abolition of the past</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.240" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">which is another thing that that he</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:20.480" style="s2">talks about here</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.359" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">and in order to really dissuade one from</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.480" end="01:04:23.599" style="s2">thinking about the past one also has to</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:26.960" style="s2">make the idea of the present</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.599" end="01:04:29.680" style="s2">into a living hell and so you you</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.960" end="01:04:31.280" style="s2">you cannot imagine that today is okay or</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.680" end="01:04:32.559" style="s2">that tomorrow was okay you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.280" end="01:04:36.160" style="s2">looking forward into</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.559" end="01:04:39.359" style="s2">basically utopian future largely</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.160" end="01:04:40.079" style="s2">so um i for those of you who have not</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.359" end="01:04:42.559" style="s2">yet checked</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.079" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">out the podcast i did with douglas</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.559" end="01:04:45.280" style="s2">murray definitely</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.920" end="01:04:47.119" style="s2">worth checking out we had a great</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.280" end="01:04:50.000" style="s2">discussion one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.119" end="01:04:51.039" style="s2">that i raised there and that he and i</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.000" end="01:04:54.160" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.039" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">has to do with a the fact that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.160" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">dynamic tension between left and right</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:04:59.440" style="s2">which is where the magic of our system</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:01.039" style="s2">comes from but</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.440" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">i believe that there&#39;s an insidious</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.039" end="01:05:04.720" style="s2">downside to this</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.640" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">to the dynamic tension yes in other</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.720" end="01:05:07.359" style="s2">words if it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:09.359" style="s2">you know if liberals are the ones with</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.359" end="01:05:11.039" style="s2">the ambition to figure out how the</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.359" end="01:05:12.799" style="s2">system might be made better and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.039" end="01:05:14.240" style="s2">conservatives are the ones who keep the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.799" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">liberals from</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.240" end="01:05:19.760" style="s2">you know uh driving us into</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:21.200" style="s2">terrible unintended consequences right</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">if that tension</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.200" end="01:05:25.599" style="s2">is necessary to moving actually forward</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:26.640" style="s2">but doing so with enough discipline that</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.599" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.640" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">fall into a utopian abyss</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:33.599" style="s2">that the downside of it has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:37.280" style="s2">the fact that each</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.599" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">each side tends to overplay its hand and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.280" end="01:05:45.760" style="s2">what i think is going on is</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:48.400" style="s2">a there&#39;s because we are inherently</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.760" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">evolutionarily competitive beings right</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.400" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">and we are placed in a system that puts</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:52.960" style="s2">us in competition with each other</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:55.280" style="s2">right we are in competition in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.960" end="01:05:57.520" style="s2">marketplace one of the go-to</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.280" end="01:05:58.400" style="s2">moves that people who have done well or</p>

<p begin="01:07:35.039" end="01:07:38.400" style="s2">and i would you know i would say as i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.880" end="01:07:39.280" style="s2">said many times before here and</p>

<p begin="01:07:39.280" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">um that uh we have in fact</p>

<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">that is more widespreadly legitimately</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.880" end="01:07:52.000" style="s2">frustrated due to this sort of perfect</p>

<p begin="01:08:02.240" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">rendered them unable to uh read or</p>

<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:10.720" style="s2">ubiquitous screens that depersonalize</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.359" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">all interactions and you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.720" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">and the list goes on but those are sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">of the three big things that i always</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.079" end="01:08:16.960" style="s2">come back to</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">that you know of of course you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.960" end="01:08:20.719" style="s2">and then you add to that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">the you know the powerful who have</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.719" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">actually rendered an economy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:26.000" style="s2">almost impossible to enter huge loads of</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.679" end="01:08:28.400" style="s2">debt</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.000" end="01:08:30.080" style="s2">inability to buy real estate or get out</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.400" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">from under your educational debt which</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.080" end="01:08:33.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t really educate you anyway</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:35.440" style="s2">of course people are frustrated there</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.520" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">was no argument that we are making that</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.440" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">people should not be frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2">but how can you turn your frustration</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:44.480" style="s2">into something that might do good</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:47.600" style="s2">as opposed to joining an ideology that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.480" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">renders you more hopeless more helpless</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.600" end="01:08:51.359" style="s2">more filled with rage less capable of</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:52.159" style="s2">actually pulling yourself out of it in</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.359" end="01:08:55.359" style="s2">the future and</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.159" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">and doing some good i would just add to</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.359" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.920" end="01:09:02.719" style="s2">um so a ultimately if you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:03.759" style="s2">the attack on meritocracy to topple your</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.759" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">civilization then the answer is you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:09.359" style="s2">to arm people</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:10.880" style="s2">so that they&#39;re capable of competing in</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.359" end="01:09:12.239" style="s2">a meritocracy so</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.880" end="01:09:14.000" style="s2">i think one of the things that&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.239" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">from the discussion for me is that those</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.000" end="01:09:16.080" style="s2">of us who have succeeded in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:18.719" style="s2">meritocracy</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.080" end="01:09:20.880" style="s2">have succeeded against fewer possible</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.719" end="01:09:22.960" style="s2">challengers than we otherwise would have</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.880" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">yes and that that so we are both</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.960" end="01:09:26.719" style="s2">successful in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:27.759" style="s2">context where merit matters but had an</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.719" end="01:09:30.480" style="s2">unfair advantage</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.759" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">in the access to it and so the solution</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.480" end="01:09:34.480" style="s2">to this problem ultimately involves</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:36.319" style="s2">arming everybody to compete in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.480" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">meritocracy which</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.319" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">of course if you&#39;re really uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">ideologically</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.080" end="01:09:43.359" style="s2">true to your values makes the market</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:47.040" style="s2">work better</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.359" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">um you know yep so that is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.040" end="01:09:51.839" style="s2">solution but the what we are what we are</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.239" end="01:09:54.560" style="s2">going to see</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.839" end="01:09:55.679" style="s2">the alternative is an attack on</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.560" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">meritocracy</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.679" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">by those who see it as a place where</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:01.520" style="s2">they will lose and probably accurately</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">in most cases</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.520" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.120" end="01:10:08.159" style="s2">unfortunately i don&#39;t see a solution to</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.199" end="01:10:09.840" style="s2">that problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.159" end="01:10:11.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no rapid solution because people</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.840" end="01:10:12.320" style="s2">who are badly armed for meritocracy</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.520" end="01:10:14.239" style="s2">cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.320" end="01:10:15.679" style="s2">instantly armed so they are going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.239" end="01:10:17.199" style="s2">engage in transfer</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.679" end="01:10:20.400" style="s2">which is going to jeopardize everything</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.199" end="01:10:20.400" style="s2">that works yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:28.239" style="s2">okay uh hoffer continues unless a man</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.800" end="01:10:28.960" style="s2">has the talents to make something of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.239" end="01:10:31.760" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.960" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">freedom is an irksome burden of what a</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:34.800" style="s2">veil is freedom to choose if the self be</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">ineffectual</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:38.000" style="s2">we join a mass movement to escape</p>

<p begin="01:10:38.000" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">or in the words of the ardent young nazi</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.800" end="01:10:44.960" style="s2">quote to be free from freedom</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:46.640" style="s2">it was not sheer hypocrisy when the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.960" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">rank-and-file nazis declared themselves</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.640" end="01:10:49.040" style="s2">not guilty of all the enormities they</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">had committed</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.040" end="01:10:51.920" style="s2">they considered themselves cheated and</p>

<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:02.000" style="s2">so hold on one more directly related to</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.000" end="01:11:06.159" style="s2">um people whose lives are barren and</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.719" end="01:11:07.760" style="s2">insecure seem to show a greater</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.159" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">willingness to obey than people who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.760" end="01:11:12.560" style="s2">self-sufficient and self-confident</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:13.679" style="s2">to the frustrated freedom from</p>

<p begin="01:11:13.679" end="01:11:16.800" style="s2">is more attractive than freedom from</p>

<p begin="01:11:16.800" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">this goes back to some of what we were</p>

<p begin="01:11:57.600" end="01:12:01.199" style="s2">um so this this begins to bring together</p>

<p begin="01:12:08.800" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">since the end of may</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.080" end="01:12:13.760" style="s2">and uh what happened in most major</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">american cities and other major cities</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.760" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">throughout the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:18.960" style="s2">uh in it for a short much shorter period</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:21.280" style="s2">in the beginning of june</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.960" end="01:12:22.880" style="s2">um would have been very unlikely to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.280" end="01:12:23.840" style="s2">happened at least in the form in which</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.880" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">it did</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.840" end="01:12:29.199" style="s2">absent covet 19 absent the pandemic with</p>

<p begin="01:12:29.199" end="01:12:36.560" style="s2">that that uh that that the virus</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.400" end="01:12:39.679" style="s2">itself just and uh made it possible</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.560" end="01:12:40.400" style="s2">for people to spill out onto the streets</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.679" end="01:12:42.080" style="s2">because they were</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.400" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">more frustrated even than they ever had</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.080" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2">been before and they were either</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:48.640" style="s2">feeling that they needed to obey in</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.520" end="01:12:51.360" style="s2">order to keep themselves</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.640" end="01:12:52.480" style="s2">and their countrymen safe uh the things</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.360" end="01:12:55.199" style="s2">like lockdowns</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.480" end="01:12:55.840" style="s2">or they were being resistant to that uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.199" end="01:12:58.719" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.840" end="01:12:59.679" style="s2">uh and feeling frustrated by uh what</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.719" end="01:13:03.120" style="s2">felt to them</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.679" end="01:13:04.239" style="s2">uh like authoritarian measures yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.120" end="01:13:07.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.239" end="01:13:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because obviously</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.840" end="01:13:14.800" style="s2">there was not only the restriction on</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.360" end="01:13:17.760" style="s2">one&#39;s behavior there was the looming</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.800" end="01:13:18.480" style="s2">economic crisis which people who are</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.760" end="01:13:20.640" style="s2">vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.480" end="01:13:21.679" style="s2">can detect this is going to fall very</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.640" end="01:13:25.760" style="s2">heavily on them</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.679" end="01:13:27.920" style="s2">and the response is exactly this being</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.760" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">freed from responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.920" end="01:13:31.440" style="s2">right literally to the point of</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:34.000" style="s2">attacking</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.440" end="01:13:34.960" style="s2">buildings right like hammering on these</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.000" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">buildings</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.960" end="01:13:38.239" style="s2">to get the federal demon to come out and</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:41.440" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.239" end="01:13:42.640" style="s2">confront them right it&#39;s it&#39;s uh i mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.440" end="01:13:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a bizarre</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.640" end="01:13:46.320" style="s2">kind of theater but you know yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.880" end="01:13:47.840" style="s2">frustration is at the very root of this</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.320" end="01:13:51.120" style="s2">because of course frustration is an</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.840" end="01:13:52.960" style="s2">evolutionary adaptation designed to</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.120" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">alert you that you&#39;re in a cul-de-sac</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.960" end="01:13:56.560" style="s2">and that you need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:57.120" style="s2">somehow escape it right if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.560" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.120" end="01:14:02.159" style="s2">opportunities to better yourself with</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:03.679" style="s2">where you are then you&#39;re motivated to</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.159" end="01:14:05.199" style="s2">seek somewhere else so</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.679" end="01:14:07.840" style="s2">that results in all of this lashing</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.199" end="01:14:08.800" style="s2">about for utopian states that might just</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.840" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.800" end="01:14:14.320" style="s2">right uh but of course the what we the</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:16.400" style="s2">lashing out that we see</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.320" end="01:14:18.080" style="s2">currently on the streets of portland and</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.400" end="01:14:21.120" style="s2">still elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.080" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">is predicated on well several lies</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.120" end="01:14:24.960" style="s2">but at least one lie that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.040" end="01:14:27.120" style="s2">is the idea that they are actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.960" end="01:14:28.239" style="s2">anywhere close to being able to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.120" end="01:14:29.920" style="s2">self-sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.239" end="01:14:32.000" style="s2">and you know we saw this with with jazz</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.920" end="01:14:34.800" style="s2">chop in in seattle</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.000" end="01:14:36.560" style="s2">these these are people who are so</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.800" end="01:14:37.600" style="s2">confused as to the nature of what it</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.560" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">would mean to actually be</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.600" end="01:14:41.120" style="s2">self-sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.880" end="01:14:42.000" style="s2">that they um ended up getting</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.120" end="01:14:44.480" style="s2">porta-potties sent</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.000" end="01:14:46.159" style="s2">in by seattle um because they they</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.480" end="01:14:47.280" style="s2">hadn&#39;t even imagined that far they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.159" end="01:14:49.600" style="s2">buying food with</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.280" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">currency they&#39;re using their phones they</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.600" end="01:14:54.480" style="s2">were outraged</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:56.960" style="s2">uh when the ambulances would not enter</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.480" end="01:14:58.159" style="s2">the space where they had violence was</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.960" end="01:15:01.760" style="s2">occurring because</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.159" end="01:15:04.480" style="s2">no one was willing to give the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.760" end="01:15:06.080" style="s2">uh the medics uh the assurance that they</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.480" end="01:15:07.360" style="s2">would actually be kept safe</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.080" end="01:15:09.120" style="s2">this is this is the opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.360" end="01:15:12.400" style="s2">self-sufficiency this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.120" end="01:15:14.880" style="s2">this is children in the bodies of adults</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.400" end="01:15:16.080" style="s2">who have deep reason to be frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.880" end="01:15:17.360" style="s2">who don&#39;t have the tools that they</p>

<p begin="01:15:17.360" end="01:15:22.960" style="s2">at who are for some reason</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.040" end="01:15:24.800" style="s2">being told by most of the leaders of</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.960" end="01:15:26.880" style="s2">these cities and these states</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.800" end="01:15:28.239" style="s2">that actually this is cool keep at it</p>

<p begin="01:15:39.679" end="01:15:43.120" style="s2">as an epithet by people on the right</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.600" end="01:15:46.400" style="s2">largely um</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.120" end="01:15:49.280" style="s2">but you know everyone acknowledges</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.400" end="01:15:50.640" style="s2">that actually part of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.280" end="01:15:53.920" style="s2">uh with government</p>

<p begin="01:16:03.360" end="01:16:07.040" style="s2">wrong at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.880" end="01:16:08.560" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to take you over here</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.040" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">and do whatever we need to do with you</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.560" end="01:16:11.520" style="s2">to make sure that you stop putting other</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">people at risk</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.520" end="01:16:15.679" style="s2">that is the role of the state yes it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.840" end="01:16:17.679" style="s2">the role of the state just you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.679" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s amazing how much of this</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.679" end="01:16:23.600" style="s2">mirrors the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:25.120" style="s2">role of proper parents right the role of</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.600" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">the state is to place</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.120" end="01:16:28.640" style="s2">limits that are clearly understandable</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:31.520" style="s2">and to enforce them</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.640" end="01:16:32.960" style="s2">irrespective of who violates them and</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.520" end="01:16:35.920" style="s2">this idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.960" end="01:16:36.719" style="s2">that you know oh the child is having a</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.920" end="01:16:38.480" style="s2">tantrum</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.880" end="01:16:59.520" style="s2">it&#39;s terrible and you know in general um</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.000" end="01:17:01.360" style="s2">parents aren&#39;t experiencing empathy in</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.520" end="01:17:02.800" style="s2">that in that moment they&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.360" end="01:17:04.400" style="s2">frustration and third through its end</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.800" end="01:17:07.280" style="s2">and they just want to make it stop</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.400" end="01:17:08.960" style="s2">but of course it just moves it it moves</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.280" end="01:17:10.320" style="s2">the problem farther into the future and</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.960" end="01:17:11.920" style="s2">in this case allowing these</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.320" end="01:17:13.440" style="s2">society-level tantrums</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.920" end="01:17:15.120" style="s2">is moving the problem not just farther</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.440" end="01:17:16.719" style="s2">into the future but across a wider and</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:18.880" style="s2">wider swath of society</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.719" end="01:17:19.920" style="s2">shut the tantrum down it&#39;s externalizing</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.880" end="01:17:22.719" style="s2">it onto all of us and</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.920" end="01:17:24.320" style="s2">ultimately you can&#39;t even justify it in</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.719" end="01:17:25.600" style="s2">terms of helping people who have a right</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.320" end="01:17:28.159" style="s2">to be frustrated because</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.600" end="01:17:28.960" style="s2">they will be massively harmed by the</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.159" end="01:17:32.080" style="s2">coming apart</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.960" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">of the structure on which they are as</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.080" end="01:17:36.480" style="s2">dependent as anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:39.120" style="s2">so you know indulging their utopian</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.480" end="01:17:39.840" style="s2">fantasies is hurting them in the future</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.120" end="01:17:42.960" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.840" end="01:17:44.080" style="s2">okay so um there&#39;s three more things</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.960" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">that i really want to get through</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.080" end="01:17:47.679" style="s2">um before we before we stop even though</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:51.199" style="s2">we&#39;re well beyond</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.679" end="01:17:53.520" style="s2">our time here um</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.199" end="01:17:54.800" style="s2">hoffer argues and this is this is this</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.520" end="01:17:56.159" style="s2">is near and dear to my heart you will</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.800" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">recognize because</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.159" end="01:17:59.440" style="s2">the idea of creativity has been one that</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">i have been</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.440" end="01:18:02.480" style="s2">focused on since i was since i was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:06.000" style="s2">child really</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.480" end="01:18:08.239" style="s2">um the idea of creativity for instance</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.000" end="01:18:09.840" style="s2">in science creativity and analysis come</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.239" end="01:18:11.280" style="s2">together in the best science and many</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.840" end="01:18:12.960" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t scientists imagine</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.280" end="01:18:15.520" style="s2">that science is just about</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.960" end="01:18:16.640" style="s2">um you know just about arraying things</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.520" end="01:18:18.400" style="s2">and organizing them</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.640" end="01:18:19.840" style="s2">and then you know seeing patterns emerge</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.400" end="01:18:22.719" style="s2">something um but</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.840" end="01:18:23.520" style="s2">there is such deep creativity in many of</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.719" end="01:18:25.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.520" end="01:18:27.040" style="s2">you know more of the earlier parts of</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.440" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">the of the scientific method</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.040" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">and um it is often seemed to me that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.320" end="01:18:33.520" style="s2">creatives that that people who are</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:36.960" style="s2">deeply creative which includes</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.520" end="01:18:40.239" style="s2">many scientists and and engineers um are</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.960" end="01:18:42.880" style="s2">are more resilient are more resistant to</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.239" end="01:18:44.800" style="s2">uh the kinds of mass movements and</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.880" end="01:18:47.840" style="s2">ideologies that they are</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.800" end="01:18:51.360" style="s2">that they are advertising um and</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.840" end="01:18:53.679" style="s2">hoffer has a couple of explanations</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.360" end="01:18:55.760" style="s2">um for for why that might be the case</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.679" end="01:18:58.480" style="s2">the case uh in part it speaks he says</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.760" end="01:19:00.159" style="s2">because creativity is a cure for boredom</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.480" end="01:19:01.840" style="s2">he says when people are bored it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.159" end="01:19:03.120" style="s2">primarily with their own selves that</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.840" end="01:19:04.400" style="s2">they are bored</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.120" end="01:19:05.920" style="s2">the consciousness of a barren</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.400" end="01:19:08.159" style="s2">meaningless existence is the main</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.920" end="01:19:09.280" style="s2">fountainhead of boredom you will</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.159" end="01:19:13.920" style="s2">remember when um</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.280" end="01:19:15.679" style="s2">our children were very young um i was</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.920" end="01:19:17.920" style="s2">i i was clear with them that they would</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.679" end="01:19:19.600" style="s2">not they would not</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.920" end="01:19:21.760" style="s2">proclaim themselves bored because that</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.600" end="01:19:23.920" style="s2">was a failure on their part</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.760" end="01:19:24.800" style="s2">but that is that is an insane thing to</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.920" end="01:19:27.120" style="s2">declare yourself</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.800" end="01:19:28.159" style="s2">um that should you say that out loud</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.120" end="01:19:30.560" style="s2">that is it that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.159" end="01:19:32.159" style="s2">demonstrative of a failure um in your</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.560" end="01:19:34.000" style="s2">own in your own head and not to say</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.159" end="01:19:36.080" style="s2">again that there are some people</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.000" end="01:19:37.840" style="s2">alive who actually just do not have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.080" end="01:19:38.719" style="s2">tools with which to cure their own</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.840" end="01:19:41.600" style="s2">boredom</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.719" end="01:19:42.560" style="s2">and of course that the advertisers and</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.600" end="01:19:45.760" style="s2">the consumer</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.560" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">um the marketplace of stuff as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.760" end="01:19:50.560" style="s2">to ideas</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:52.239" style="s2">has made it really really easy to to</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.560" end="01:19:54.000" style="s2">run up against the end of your own</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.239" end="01:19:55.920" style="s2">abilities but</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.000" end="01:19:57.280" style="s2">um certainly among children there is no</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.920" end="01:19:59.600" style="s2">excuse for letting a child</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.280" end="01:20:01.840" style="s2">declare themselves bored and and to walk</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.600" end="01:20:02.800" style="s2">in and and as an adult and say i&#39;ll cure</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.840" end="01:20:05.280" style="s2">that for you no</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.800" end="01:20:06.080" style="s2">you let the kid you let the kid solve</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.280" end="01:20:09.600" style="s2">their own</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.080" end="01:20:11.280" style="s2">their own boredom um he also says</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.600" end="01:20:13.760" style="s2">poverty at which he&#39;s speaking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.280" end="01:20:15.760" style="s2">actual poverty not having enough money</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.760" end="01:20:17.679" style="s2">poverty when coupled with creativeness</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.760" end="01:20:18.960" style="s2">is usually free of frustration</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.679" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure i agree with this but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.960" end="01:20:22.800" style="s2">an interesting claim</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:25.120" style="s2">poverty when coupled with creativeness</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.800" end="01:20:26.560" style="s2">is usually free of frustration</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.120" end="01:20:28.400" style="s2">before i go on remember this is a guy</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.560" end="01:20:29.760" style="s2">who worked as a um</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.400" end="01:20:31.440" style="s2">you know railroad yards and as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:34.560" style="s2">stevedore no a longshoreman</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.440" end="01:20:36.560" style="s2">um so it&#39;s this is not he is not</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.560" end="01:20:37.840" style="s2">speaking as a man from um economic</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.560" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">prison can you say the sentence again</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.840" end="01:20:40.480" style="s2">poverty</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.480" end="01:20:41.600" style="s2">poverty when coupled with creative</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.480" end="01:20:44.400" style="s2">creativeness</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.600" end="01:20:46.159" style="s2">is usually free of frustration this is</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:47.840" style="s2">true of the poor artisan skilled in his</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.159" end="01:20:49.440" style="s2">trade and of the poor writer</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.840" end="01:20:51.520" style="s2">artist and scientist in the full</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.440" end="01:20:53.440" style="s2">possession of creative powers</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.520" end="01:20:55.280" style="s2">nothing so bolsters our self-confidence</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.440" end="01:20:57.760" style="s2">and reconciles us with ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.280" end="01:20:59.760" style="s2">as the continuous ability to create to</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:00.239" style="s2">see things grow and develop under our</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.760" end="01:21:02.800" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.239" end="01:21:04.719" style="s2">day in day out the decline of</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.800" end="01:21:06.000" style="s2">handicrafts in modern times is perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.719" end="01:21:07.120" style="s2">one of the causes for the rise of</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.000" end="01:21:09.120" style="s2">frustration and the increased</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.120" end="01:21:10.560" style="s2">susceptibility of the individual to mass</p>

<p begin="01:21:10.560" end="01:21:14.400" style="s2">so this this just dovetails beautifully</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.920" end="01:21:17.440" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.400" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">um you know with things that we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.440" end="01:21:21.199" style="s2">said from from many avenues right that</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:23.920" style="s2">those who actually can do something</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.199" end="01:21:24.320" style="s2">physical um and you know we have said it</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.920" end="01:21:26.239" style="s2">in terms</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.320" end="01:21:27.840" style="s2">of sport isn&#39;t inherently creative</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.239" end="01:21:28.159" style="s2">although there is a kind of creativity</p>

<p begin="01:21:34.880" end="01:21:38.560" style="s2">and another opponent or</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.000" end="01:21:40.320" style="s2">you know a whole team that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.560" end="01:21:44.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind of creativity</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.320" end="01:21:46.719" style="s2">than finding the form in the stone or</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.000" end="01:21:48.320" style="s2">putting the words on the page or</p>

<p begin="01:21:49.520" end="01:21:52.320" style="s2">all right these are all different kinds</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.880" end="01:21:53.040" style="s2">of creativity but what you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.320" end="01:21:56.400" style="s2">each case</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.040" end="01:21:58.960" style="s2">is um is finding meaning</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.400" end="01:22:00.560" style="s2">through creating i don&#39;t know what other</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.679" end="01:25:22.719" style="s2">succeeded in some place that allows you</p>

<p begin="01:25:35.520" end="01:25:40.080" style="s2">okay um individual creatives aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.560" end="01:25:44.320" style="s2">sufficient though so i for</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.080" end="01:25:45.600" style="s2">me i i i grok at a fairly deep level</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.320" end="01:25:47.360" style="s2">and you know this is why we were</p>

<p begin="01:25:55.120" end="01:26:02.560" style="s2">core self and to help make individuals</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.239" end="01:26:06.080" style="s2">resistant to things like mass movements</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.560" end="01:26:06.560" style="s2">but but individuals resisting isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.080" end="01:26:09.120" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.560" end="01:26:09.679" style="s2">sufficient because absent a unifying</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.120" end="01:26:11.360" style="s2">rhetoric</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.679" end="01:26:13.360" style="s2">values of democracy and decency are</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.360" end="01:26:15.040" style="s2">likely to lose out to</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.360" end="01:26:16.480" style="s2">less nuanced and less democratic</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.040" end="01:26:18.719" style="s2">movements so i have</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.480" end="01:26:18.719" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.639" end="01:26:24.159" style="s2">yeah maybe i want i won&#39;t read this this</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.639" end="01:26:27.840" style="s2">longer excerpt here</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.159" end="01:26:30.159" style="s2">um but just say um</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.840" end="01:26:31.840" style="s2">that as i said at the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.159" end="01:26:35.440" style="s2">discussion that people are</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.840" end="01:26:36.159" style="s2">often willing to flip sides um that they</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.440" end="01:26:38.480" style="s2">join one</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.159" end="01:26:39.520" style="s2">and they find the the problems in it and</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.480" end="01:26:42.639" style="s2">they become</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.520" end="01:26:43.280" style="s2">um they&#39;re not immune to mass movements</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.639" end="01:26:44.480" style="s2">right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.280" end="01:26:46.800" style="s2">they&#39;re actually particularly</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.480" end="01:26:50.080" style="s2">susceptible to mass movements and</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.800" end="01:26:52.320" style="s2">are um</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.080" end="01:26:54.560" style="s2">perhaps just can become immune to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.320" end="01:26:57.199" style="s2">particular one that they were members of</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.560" end="01:26:58.719" style="s2">rather than um immune to mass movements</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.199" end="01:27:03.440" style="s2">in general so</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.719" end="01:27:05.520" style="s2">what how do we inoculate people against</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.440" end="01:27:07.520" style="s2">that when we see people flip move</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:10.000" style="s2">directly from one side to the other</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.520" end="01:27:11.440" style="s2">um how can we get people to pause and</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.000" end="01:27:13.040" style="s2">think as they&#39;re between sides for</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.440" end="01:27:14.400" style="s2">instance as they&#39;re being rejected by</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.040" end="01:27:17.040" style="s2">the side to which they</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.400" end="01:27:18.719" style="s2">to which they once were tightly bound</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.040" end="01:27:19.679" style="s2">how can they say maybe i don&#39;t belong</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.719" end="01:27:24.080" style="s2">need to belong</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.679" end="01:27:25.920" style="s2">to any maybe i maybe it&#39;s okay for me to</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.080" end="01:27:28.800" style="s2">to think that ideology itself is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.920" end="01:27:30.480" style="s2">problem and i might do better</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.800" end="01:27:32.080" style="s2">by considering my positions and my hopes</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.480" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">for myself and my family and my</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.080" end="01:27:35.840" style="s2">community my nation all of these nested</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.840" end="01:27:38.239" style="s2">sets to which i belong</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.840" end="01:27:39.760" style="s2">um from first principles rather than</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.239" end="01:27:42.800" style="s2">from received authority</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.760" end="01:27:44.159" style="s2">right like how how can you grab a people</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.800" end="01:27:46.320" style="s2">who might be</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.159" end="01:27:48.159" style="s2">recognizing that some movement to which</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.320" end="01:27:51.600" style="s2">they are they are grabbed</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.159" end="01:27:55.440" style="s2">um and and pull them out into a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.600" end="01:27:55.440" style="s2">awareness um</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.760" end="01:28:01.760" style="s2">and to that um</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.440" end="01:28:02.960" style="s2">hoffer actually says exactly as you did</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.760" end="01:28:04.800" style="s2">at the beginning of our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.960" end="01:28:06.400" style="s2">that very often it&#39;s one mass movement</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.800" end="01:28:07.920" style="s2">that comes in to displace another and</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.400" end="01:28:09.040" style="s2">that you end up having competing mass</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.920" end="01:28:11.520" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.040" end="01:28:12.560" style="s2">but that can&#39;t be the only way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.520" end="01:28:15.760" style="s2">not going to be stable</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.560" end="01:28:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to create a democracy</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.760" end="01:28:20.320" style="s2">that&#39;s stable long term</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.440" end="01:28:21.199" style="s2">and so just just to finish a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.320" end="01:28:26.000" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.199" end="01:28:30.320" style="s2">leadership um he says</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.000" end="01:28:30.320" style="s2">see with regard to leadership</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.520" end="01:28:35.040" style="s2">the personality of the leader is</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.280" end="01:28:36.639" style="s2">probably a crucial factor in determining</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.040" end="01:28:37.600" style="s2">the nature and duration of a mass</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.639" end="01:28:39.840" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.600" end="01:28:41.840" style="s2">such rare leaders as lincoln and gandhi</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.840" end="01:28:42.960" style="s2">not only try to curb the evil inherent</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.840" end="01:28:44.320" style="s2">in a mass movement</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.960" end="01:28:46.080" style="s2">but are willing to put an end to the</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.320" end="01:28:47.600" style="s2">movement when its objective is more or</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.080" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">less realized</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.600" end="01:28:51.040" style="s2">there are there of the very few in whom</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.400" end="01:28:53.040" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.040" end="01:28:55.199" style="s2">has developed a grandeur and generosity</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.040" end="01:28:58.719" style="s2">of the soul</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.199" end="01:28:58.719" style="s2">and finally</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.400" end="01:29:03.520" style="s2">there are of course rare leaders such as</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.480" end="01:29:07.040" style="s2">again lincoln</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.520" end="01:29:08.960" style="s2">gandhi even fdr churchill and nehru</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.040" end="01:29:10.880" style="s2">they do not hesitate to harness man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.960" end="01:29:12.400" style="s2">hungers and fears to weld a following</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.880" end="01:29:14.159" style="s2">and make it zealous unto death in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.400" end="01:29:17.520" style="s2">service of a holy cause</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.159" end="01:29:18.960" style="s2">but unlike a hitler a stalin or even a</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.520" end="01:29:21.120" style="s2">luther and a calvin</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.960" end="01:29:22.880" style="s2">they are not tempted to use the slime of</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.120" end="01:29:25.040" style="s2">frustrated souls as mortar</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.880" end="01:29:26.880" style="s2">in the building of a new world the</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.040" end="01:29:27.920" style="s2">self-confidence of these rare leaders is</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.880" end="01:29:30.239" style="s2">derived from</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.920" end="01:29:31.600" style="s2">and blended with their faith in humanity</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.239" end="01:29:32.239" style="s2">for they know that no one can be</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.600" end="01:29:36.239" style="s2">honorable</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.239" end="01:29:39.360" style="s2">unless he honors mankind and that</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.239" end="01:29:42.480" style="s2">that slime of frustrated souls which is</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.360" end="01:29:43.280" style="s2">amazing um actually it turns out one of</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.480" end="01:29:46.159" style="s2">his opening</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.280" end="01:29:47.360" style="s2">um quotations in the book uh and slime</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.159" end="01:29:48.560" style="s2">had they for mortar</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.360" end="01:29:50.560" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know this but that comes from</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.560" end="01:29:52.320" style="s2">genesis that comes from the old</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.560" end="01:29:55.600" style="s2">testament i did not know that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.320" end="01:29:57.199" style="s2">i didn&#39;t remember that either yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.600" end="01:29:59.199" style="s2">unfortunately i think there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.199" end="01:30:00.560" style="s2">buried here which is that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.199" end="01:30:02.560" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.560" end="01:30:04.800" style="s2">idea of how how would we solve this</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.560" end="01:30:06.159" style="s2">problem what would we do instead</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.800" end="01:30:08.320" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a question of what do</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.159" end="01:30:12.000" style="s2">you do with the fact that you have</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.320" end="01:30:12.639" style="s2">hundreds perhaps hundreds of millions if</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.000" end="01:30:16.000" style="s2">we think</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.639" end="01:30:18.800" style="s2">uh in a larger context than just the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.000" end="01:30:20.480" style="s2">of people who have been hobbled by a</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.800" end="01:30:23.040" style="s2">system that wasn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.480" end="01:30:24.400" style="s2">interested in making them capable right</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.040" end="01:30:26.159" style="s2">right that&#39;s not a problem</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.400" end="01:30:27.679" style="s2">you can&#39;t just start doing things right</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.159" end="01:30:30.320" style="s2">and that problem goes away</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.679" end="01:30:30.960" style="s2">somehow we have to deal with the fact we</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.320" end="01:30:33.440" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.960" end="01:30:35.360" style="s2">stopped handing over the tools to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.440" end="01:30:37.920" style="s2">self-sufficient that would cause people</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.360" end="01:30:40.480" style="s2">to be less susceptible to this nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.920" end="01:30:41.679" style="s2">and that if we started doing things</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.480" end="01:30:44.080" style="s2">right today</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.679" end="01:30:45.440" style="s2">it would be more than a generation</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.080" end="01:30:48.239" style="s2">before we had gotten</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.440" end="01:30:48.800" style="s2">past the consequences of what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.239" end="01:30:51.199" style="s2">badly</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.800" end="01:30:52.719" style="s2">up to this point yeah um i mean i think</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.199" end="01:30:54.800" style="s2">this also you know this this</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.719" end="01:30:56.639" style="s2">is a much longer conversation but um</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.800" end="01:30:59.120" style="s2">this points to one of the real</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.639" end="01:31:00.159" style="s2">uh criticisms of something like ubi</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.120" end="01:31:03.840" style="s2">actually right</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.159" end="01:31:05.040" style="s2">um that solving uh the wealth inequality</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.840" end="01:31:07.280" style="s2">uh it wouldn&#39;t sell the wealth</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.040" end="01:31:08.880" style="s2">inequality addressing the</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.280" end="01:31:10.400" style="s2">vast number of people who actually</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.880" end="01:31:12.080" style="s2">struggle to know whether or not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.400" end="01:31:15.360" style="s2">going to have enough money to</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.080" end="01:31:16.719" style="s2">make their rent and buy food by simply</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.360" end="01:31:19.920" style="s2">providing money</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.719" end="01:31:22.960" style="s2">um does not provide the motivation to</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.920" end="01:31:26.480" style="s2">create inherently there are people who</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.960" end="01:31:30.080" style="s2">are active creatives or analysts</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.480" end="01:31:31.280" style="s2">of sorts who are absolutely kept from</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.080" end="01:31:33.440" style="s2">doing that work</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.280" end="01:31:34.960" style="s2">um by the fact that they actually simply</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.440" end="01:31:37.520" style="s2">just have to work two jobs</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.960" end="01:31:39.120" style="s2">and cannot find the peace of mind the</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.520" end="01:31:41.440" style="s2">space the mental space</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.120" end="01:31:42.480" style="s2">in order to do what they desperately</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.440" end="01:31:45.600" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.480" end="01:31:47.120" style="s2">but um it would it would not address um</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.600" end="01:31:50.480" style="s2">the motivational problem</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.120" end="01:31:53.679" style="s2">that the vast majority of people have um</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.480" end="01:31:55.600" style="s2">who are frustrated in part because they</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.679" end="01:31:57.679" style="s2">were not given the tools they needed and</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.600" end="01:32:00.560" style="s2">now it seems it might be too late</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.679" end="01:32:02.639" style="s2">yeah in fact it you can upgrade the</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.560" end="01:32:05.760" style="s2">tools that they&#39;ve got but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.639" end="01:32:08.960" style="s2">get people you know who you</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.760" end="01:32:11.440" style="s2">try to fix their toolkit at adulthood</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.960" end="01:32:12.480" style="s2">the opportunity has been largely lost</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.440" end="01:32:14.239" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.480" end="01:32:16.080" style="s2">well i guess i&#39;m a i&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.239" end="01:32:17.679" style="s2">surprised to hear you say that i think i</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.080" end="01:32:19.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.679" end="01:32:20.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how you do it at scale but</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.760" end="01:32:24.880" style="s2">i feel like</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.960" end="01:32:27.920" style="s2">um updating introducing</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.880" end="01:32:29.199" style="s2">and updating a toolkit like an</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.920" end="01:32:30.960" style="s2">evolutionary toolkit</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.199" end="01:32:32.480" style="s2">is exactly what we were doing in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.960" end="01:32:34.639" style="s2">classroom for</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.480" end="01:32:36.320" style="s2">15 years yeah upgrading but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.639" end="01:32:37.040" style="s2">anything like what would have been true</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.320" end="01:32:39.920" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.040" end="01:32:42.159" style="s2">those same people if they had had</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.920" end="01:32:45.520" style="s2">consistent</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.159" end="01:32:48.239" style="s2">a model for a system in which the</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.520" end="01:32:50.560" style="s2">cultivation of one&#39;s own tools results</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.239" end="01:32:53.360" style="s2">in the growth of capacities that then</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.560" end="01:32:55.440" style="s2">cause well-being to emerge from the</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.360" end="01:32:58.719" style="s2">world as a result of your own</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.440" end="01:33:02.000" style="s2">input of effort and creativity and</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.719" end="01:33:04.719" style="s2">and skill and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.000" end="01:33:07.440" style="s2">i i i&#39;m very proud of what we did but</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.719" end="01:33:10.239" style="s2">the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.440" end="01:33:11.760" style="s2">we are dealing with people who have been</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.239" end="01:33:14.080" style="s2">hobbled and you can</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.760" end="01:33:15.760" style="s2">improve i mean this is true for all of</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.080" end="01:33:19.120" style="s2">us we are all hobbled by</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.760" end="01:33:20.960" style="s2">increasingly forces that don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.120" end="01:33:22.320" style="s2">about us and want to misinform us about</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.960" end="01:33:25.040" style="s2">what&#39;s important and</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.320" end="01:33:27.360" style="s2">misdirect us into you know wasting money</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.040" end="01:33:30.639" style="s2">and time on things that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.360" end="01:33:31.280" style="s2">so anyway i&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.639" end="01:33:34.320" style="s2">people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.280" end="01:33:36.080" style="s2">lives better what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.320" end="01:33:37.840" style="s2">a how would you you know you said you</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.080" end="01:33:40.880" style="s2">can&#39;t do it at scale okay</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.840" end="01:33:42.480" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know how to do</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.880" end="01:33:43.520" style="s2">it at scale and i haven&#39;t i haven&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.480" end="01:33:45.120" style="s2">up with</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.520" end="01:33:46.800" style="s2">an answer i don&#39;t know that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.120" end="01:33:47.679" style="s2">you will do it worse at scale than you</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.800" end="01:33:50.239" style="s2">would do it</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.679" end="01:33:52.159" style="s2">uh personally the number of people who</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.239" end="01:33:54.400" style="s2">are capable of doing it personally</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.159" end="01:33:55.600" style="s2">are very few so we can&#39;t do it for that</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.400" end="01:33:58.560" style="s2">many and those</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.600" end="01:34:00.400" style="s2">for whom we do it are suffering the</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.560" end="01:34:04.400" style="s2">consequences of whatever</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.400" end="01:34:05.920" style="s2">bad educational experiences and you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.400" end="01:34:07.679" style="s2">misinformation they&#39;ve gotten from</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.920" end="01:34:08.960" style="s2">advertisers trying to frustrate them</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.679" end="01:34:12.239" style="s2">into buying stuff and who</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.960" end="01:34:14.719" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve got damaged people and</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.239" end="01:34:15.840" style="s2">um yes we can we can improve things</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.719" end="01:34:19.040" style="s2">starting tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.840" end="01:34:22.080" style="s2">if we decided to do it but the</p>

<p begin="01:34:22.080" end="01:34:25.840" style="s2">a damaged population and that that will</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.880" end="01:34:27.840" style="s2">require</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.840" end="01:34:30.000" style="s2">a generation in which we are no longer</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.840" end="01:34:32.239" style="s2">doing new damage before the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.000" end="01:34:34.880" style="s2">actually even beginning to be solved is</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.239" end="01:34:35.920" style="s2">i think a critical issue it&#39;s critical</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.880" end="01:34:38.639" style="s2">but i think this is too</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.920" end="01:34:40.400" style="s2">i think this is too hopeless i think i</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.639" end="01:34:42.639" style="s2">mean this is often the case that you</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.400" end="01:34:43.679" style="s2">you take a much more pessimistic view of</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.639" end="01:34:45.840" style="s2">things than i do</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.679" end="01:34:48.639" style="s2">um in part because i don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.840" end="01:34:50.480" style="s2">sleep uh with that degree of pessimism</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.639" end="01:34:52.400" style="s2">um so does that mean that i&#39;m engaging</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.480" end="01:34:56.159" style="s2">in delusion perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.400" end="01:34:59.360" style="s2">um in order</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.159" end="01:35:00.320" style="s2">to allay the strength of mass m a mass</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.360" end="01:35:02.239" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.320" end="01:35:04.080" style="s2">uh that is happening on the</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.239" end="01:35:05.679" style="s2">authoritarian left that is grabbing more</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.080" end="01:35:07.760" style="s2">and more people</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.679" end="01:35:10.639" style="s2">revealing to some who might be on the</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.760" end="01:35:12.639" style="s2">fence revealing to as many as possible</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.639" end="01:35:15.840" style="s2">of those who might be on the fence that</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.639" end="01:35:15.840" style="s2">they could be</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.080" end="01:35:24.400" style="s2">drawing building growing</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.320" end="01:35:26.159" style="s2">connecting healing any number of things</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.400" end="01:35:29.920" style="s2">that actually brings real meaning to</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.159" end="01:35:33.760" style="s2">human existence and that that</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.920" end="01:35:37.360" style="s2">unlike destroying yelling</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.760" end="01:35:40.719" style="s2">raging etc is more</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.360" end="01:35:42.159" style="s2">lasting and will make them both more</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.719" end="01:35:44.480" style="s2">anti-fragile in general</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.159" end="01:35:46.639" style="s2">and more resistant to the next ideology</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.480" end="01:35:48.080" style="s2">that comes along</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.639" end="01:35:50.239" style="s2">i agree i mean it&#39;s the obvious</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.080" end="01:35:50.960" style="s2">direction to go the question is just how</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.239" end="01:35:54.000" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.960" end="01:35:55.280" style="s2">does it change the hazard of mass</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.000" end="01:35:57.600" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.280" end="01:36:00.639" style="s2">and i guess we differ a little bit on</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.600" end="01:36:04.639" style="s2">that hopefully you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.639" end="01:36:07.760" style="s2">all right so um</p>
