<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:08.000" style="s2">but I want to tell you a story now and</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.440" end="00:00:12.660" style="s2">it has these characters in it and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.000" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">this is a very important story and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.660" end="00:00:17.400" style="s2">called the Enuma Elish and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:19.529" style="s2">Mesopotamian creation myth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.400" end="00:00:21.090" style="s2">important for a bunch of reasons first</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.529" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">of all it&#39;s the oldest written story we</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.090" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">know of but it&#39;s also a Middle Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">story and the whole all the Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">religions emerged out of the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a foundational story it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">story that sits at the bottom of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:46.469" style="s2">culture now it has it has similarities</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">to the creation story in Genesis whether</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.469" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">the creation story in Genesis was</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:51.750" style="s2">derived from it or whether there was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">whole variety of similar stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.750" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">floating around in the Middle East and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">at the same time that were variants of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">theme we don&#39;t really know but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">doesn&#39;t read I don&#39;t think it really</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:09.210" style="s2">matters we don&#39;t know how old the story</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:12.840" style="s2">is we know how old it is in its written</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.210" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">form it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.840" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">old in its written form maybe it&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:18.600" style="s2">thousand years old it&#39;s written form but</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">probably not it&#39;s probably more like</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.600" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">five thousand years old but the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">is that a 5,000 year old story is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:28.350" style="s2">that&#39;s written is way older than 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">years like we&#39;re used to being in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:33.509" style="s2">environment where there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">stories you know because we have books</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.509" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">and movies and all of these things but</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:39.659" style="s2">you know in its slower moving and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">archaic cultures especially ones that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.659" end="00:01:42.890" style="s2">are just just have an oral tradition</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a million stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.890" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">there&#39;s like 20 canonical stories and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">god only knows how old they are there</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">was evidence linguistic evidence I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">saw a study on this last week someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.030" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">sent it to me showing that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.829" style="s2">fairy tales that the Grimm brothers</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">gathered might be 10,000 years old and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.829" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t surprise me because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.469" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">kind of depth that&#39;s in a good fairy</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:13.900" style="s2">tale is is so the depth is so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:16.750" style="s2">profundity is so deep that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.900" end="00:02:18.760" style="s2">no way that someone could just conjured</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.750" end="00:02:20.530" style="s2">it up you know 100 years ago it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.760" end="00:02:22.930" style="s2">there&#39;s layers and layers and layers of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.530" end="00:02:25.420" style="s2">meaning and they&#39;re basically archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.930" end="00:02:26.769" style="s2">and religious in significance and Hansel</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.420" end="00:02:30.040" style="s2">and Gretel story is a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.769" end="00:02:31.480" style="s2">that and Sleeping Beauty is a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.040" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">example about - a lot of the canonical</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.480" end="00:02:35.260" style="s2">fairy tales are they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:39.640" style="s2">powerful they pack a lot of meaning into</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.260" end="00:02:45.690" style="s2">a very short into a very limited amount</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.640" end="00:02:47.739" style="s2">of time so so it was great that this was</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.690" end="00:02:49.299" style="s2">unearthed and it was only unearthed in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.739" end="00:02:52.060" style="s2">the late 1800s so we haven&#39;t known about</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.299" end="00:02:54.430" style="s2">this story you know for a long long time</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.060" end="00:02:56.019" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it was a tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.430" end="00:02:58.299" style="s2">exciting discovery on the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.019" end="00:03:05.260" style="s2">people who who dug it up so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.299" end="00:03:07.870" style="s2">tell you the story so the primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.260" end="00:03:14.290" style="s2">character in this story is a like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.870" end="00:03:16.120" style="s2">dragon mother named time at and time at</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.290" end="00:03:18.609" style="s2">you could think about her as half the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.120" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">dragon of chaos and half the destructive</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.609" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">creative feminine so she you could think</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">about her as what&#39;s sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:26.650" style="s2">border between what&#39;s a known known and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:28.530" style="s2">an unknown in unknown and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.650" end="00:03:34.599" style="s2">construed as the mother of all things</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.530" end="00:03:37.419" style="s2">now the mother of all things is like</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.599" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">what was revealed when the towers came</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.419" end="00:03:43.299" style="s2">down it&#39;s this tremendously complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:45.609" style="s2">background multi-level system of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.299" end="00:03:49.389" style="s2">operations that&#39;s always going on that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.609" end="00:03:52.840" style="s2">that identifiable singular things emerge</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.389" end="00:03:54.760" style="s2">from now the Mesopotamians wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.840" end="00:03:56.919" style="s2">said that because what they said was</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.760" end="00:03:59.139" style="s2">this story because that&#39;s the form in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.919" end="00:04:00.549" style="s2">which their knowledge had it had</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.139" end="00:04:02.409" style="s2">developed to the point where they could</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.549" end="00:04:04.359" style="s2">tell a story about instead of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.409" end="00:04:06.489" style="s2">acting it out or dreaming about it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.359" end="00:04:07.989" style="s2">some sense you know but they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.489" end="00:04:10.870" style="s2">articulate it we can barely articulate</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.989" end="00:04:13.510" style="s2">it now so there&#39;s time out she&#39;s viewed</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.870" end="00:04:16.599" style="s2">as the mother of all things and she has</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.510" end="00:04:18.669" style="s2">a husband named AB sue who&#39;s her concert</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.599" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">very little is said about AB sue in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.669" end="00:04:21.880" style="s2">particular story and I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:24.870" style="s2">for that although I&#39;m not sure of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.880" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">is that the Mesopotamian civilization</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.870" end="00:04:30.810" style="s2">was knew enough as a technological state</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say because it made cities as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.810" end="00:04:36.840" style="s2">technological state that the meant that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:40.440" style="s2">myths of humanity hadn&#39;t figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.840" end="00:04:45.990" style="s2">to encapsulate the nature of the of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.440" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">technological dominance art there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.990" end="00:04:49.949" style="s2">sense that it existed but there wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.090" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">sense of it has a care of differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.949" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">character that was capable of doing all</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:55.260" style="s2">sorts of different things I think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:57.449" style="s2">didn&#39;t emerge until Egypt although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.260" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">not certain that but that&#39;s how it looks</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.449" end="00:05:03.630" style="s2">to me so absolute is her husband now the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:05.400" style="s2">way the Mesopotamians thought of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.630" end="00:05:07.229" style="s2">world and this is the same way that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.400" end="00:05:09.000" style="s2">people who wrote Genesis thought of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.229" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">world they thought of that the world was</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.000" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">a disc you know what what the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:14.430" style="s2">like when you go outside and you stand</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">in a field it&#39;s a flat field you look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.430" end="00:05:18.210" style="s2">the world it&#39;s pretty obvious what it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:20.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a big disc of Earth and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.210" end="00:05:21.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a dome on top of it and in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.039" end="00:05:23.940" style="s2">dome art of the Sun and the moon and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.780" end="00:05:26.010" style="s2">stars and then you might ask well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.940" end="00:05:29.460" style="s2">underneath earth and the answer for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.010" end="00:05:30.930" style="s2">Mesopotamians was fresh water first and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.460" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">then salt water how did you know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.930" end="00:05:34.410" style="s2">well if you drill down then up the fresh</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">water would come so obviously there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.410" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">fresh water down there and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:40.410" style="s2">went to the edge of your territory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:44.729" style="s2">like well there&#39;s the salt water so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.410" end="00:05:48.389" style="s2">earth was you know let the earth roughly</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.729" end="00:05:50.669" style="s2">speaking was a disk of matter resting on</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.389" end="00:05:53.190" style="s2">a disk of fresh water resting on a disk</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.669" end="00:05:57.539" style="s2">of salt water an absolute time at were</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.190" end="00:06:01.820" style="s2">the fresh and saltwater respect okay and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.539" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">there now the Mesopotamians thought that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.820" end="00:06:06.810" style="s2">the way that the that absolute time that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">gave birth to everything was that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.810" end="00:06:12.030" style="s2">join together in sexual union like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">yin in the egg and it&#39;s very much like</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.030" end="00:06:17.699" style="s2">that exact and that it was out of their</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:20.070" style="s2">union that the the elemental gods</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.699" end="00:06:22.919" style="s2">emerged and I think you can think of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.070" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">elemental gods as their their their</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.919" end="00:06:29.010" style="s2">forces of nature and they&#39;re viewed</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">through their not personified because to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.010" end="00:06:32.699" style="s2">personify something means that you see</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:35.159" style="s2">it as an objective phenomena and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.699" end="00:06:36.599" style="s2">attribute human characteristics to it</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.159" end="00:06:37.729" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t how people work</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.599" end="00:06:40.249" style="s2">what happens is we</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.729" end="00:06:43.219" style="s2">perceive human characteristics and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.249" end="00:06:46.279" style="s2">only with terrible effort do we extract</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.219" end="00:06:48.979" style="s2">out the objective reality from that so</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.279" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">we D personalize things when we become</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.979" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">scientific but we just naturally see</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:55.069" style="s2">them as characters and you can see this</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">when you read books to kids you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.069" end="00:07:00.289" style="s2">like everything&#39;s a person train is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:02.689" style="s2">person and a car as a person the moon is</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.289" end="00:07:05.270" style="s2">a person and the Sun is a person and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.689" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">know you read stories to children that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.270" end="00:07:09.110" style="s2">have that as a presupposition doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:10.999" style="s2">bother you at all you know you can just</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.110" end="00:07:12.409" style="s2">fall right into it with no problem you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.999" end="00:07:14.419" style="s2">know and in the animations you see the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.409" end="00:07:16.189" style="s2">Sun in the sky smiling and bouncing</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.419" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">along and it doesn&#39;t bother you you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.189" end="00:07:20.089" style="s2">it&#39;s no problem to look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.469" style="s2">that way and there&#39;s some utility in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.089" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">looking at the world in that way as</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.469" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">we&#39;ll discover so anyways and I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:27.830" style="s2">part of the reason that we view things</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:29.330" style="s2">that way oh yeah that was the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.830" end="00:07:33.050" style="s2">thing I wanted to tell you about our</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.330" end="00:07:36.110" style="s2">perceptual systems is that we we do have</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.050" end="00:07:38.180" style="s2">a social cognitive platform intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.110" end="00:07:40.309" style="s2">platform which means that our primary</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.180" end="00:07:43.939" style="s2">categories the primary categories of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.309" end="00:07:45.860" style="s2">mind do seem to be social so you could</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.939" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">say that the reason our mind evolved or</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.860" end="00:07:50.330" style="s2">no what you could say that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:55.689" style="s2">fundamental selecting pressures on our</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.330" end="00:07:58.490" style="s2">on our mind ensured that the the primary</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.689" end="00:08:02.389" style="s2">substructure of our cognitive ability</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.490" end="00:08:05.300" style="s2">was modules that could understand social</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.389" end="00:08:07.159" style="s2">behavior men can understand women women</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.300" end="00:08:09.080" style="s2">could understand men men and women could</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.159" end="00:08:10.699" style="s2">understand children children men and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.080" end="00:08:14.709" style="s2">women could understand the social world</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.699" end="00:08:17.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.709" end="00:08:19.610" style="s2">specialized for and then it was only</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.180" end="00:08:22.370" style="s2">after those systems developed hyper</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.610" end="00:08:24.469" style="s2">developed probably under the under the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.370" end="00:08:26.659" style="s2">force of sexual selection that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.469" end="00:08:28.550" style="s2">became able to separate themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.659" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">some degree from that underlying social</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:33.919" style="s2">cognitive structure and start to see the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:36.469" style="s2">world in ways that were personified so</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.919" end="00:08:39.560" style="s2">but what that means is that our natural</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.469" end="00:08:41.479" style="s2">categories are still and anthropomorphic</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.560" end="00:08:46.430" style="s2">and dramatic it actually turns out they</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.479" end="00:08:49.069" style="s2">work so absolute time now nature and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.430" end="00:08:50.360" style="s2">culture is a perfectly reasonable way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.069" end="00:08:50.840" style="s2">thinking about them now they would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.360" end="00:08:53.060" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.840" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the interplay between nature and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.060" end="00:08:57.950" style="s2">culture that gives rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:00.140" style="s2">primordial forces of nature</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.950" end="00:09:02.270" style="s2">now those forces of nature would be to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.140" end="00:09:03.710" style="s2">some degree external like a storm or</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.270" end="00:09:06.500" style="s2">like fire but they would be sucked to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.710" end="00:09:08.990" style="s2">some degree internal - like like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.500" end="00:09:11.779" style="s2">fire of passion right and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.990" end="00:09:14.630" style="s2">storm of sorrow because those are</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.779" end="00:09:16.610" style="s2">natural forces as well and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.630" end="00:09:19.970" style="s2">things that the ancients knew was that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.610" end="00:09:21.800" style="s2">man was created to serve the gods and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.970" end="00:09:23.240" style="s2">course modern people think of that as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.800" end="00:09:24.650" style="s2">superstition but that&#39;s because they</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:26.900" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand how archaic</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.650" end="00:09:29.930" style="s2">people thought archaic people thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.900" end="00:09:32.420" style="s2">like Freud thought it&#39;s like yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.930" end="00:09:34.430" style="s2">you have an ego fine you know as long as</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.420" end="00:09:36.410" style="s2">you&#39;re in a box within a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.430" end="00:09:38.600" style="s2">boxes the eagle runs things but as soon</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.410" end="00:09:41.529" style="s2">as we put you somewhere where those</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.600" end="00:09:44.450" style="s2">boxes are gone it&#39;s the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.529" end="00:09:45.410" style="s2">forces of nature that run you hunger</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.450" end="00:09:48.589" style="s2">thirst</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.410" end="00:09:51.110" style="s2">you know aggression sexuality and all</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.589" end="00:09:52.700" style="s2">those things that are impersonal because</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.110" end="00:09:53.960" style="s2">of course you have them and you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.700" end="00:09:56.120" style="s2">them and so does everyone else so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.960" end="00:09:59.180" style="s2">they&#39;re impersonal and transcendent and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.120" end="00:10:01.220" style="s2">they&#39;re also eternal and so when the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.180" end="00:10:04.220" style="s2">archaic people said and they usually</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.220" end="00:10:06.830" style="s2">said this with sorrow that man was</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.220" end="00:10:08.960" style="s2">destined to serve the gods that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.830" end="00:10:11.480" style="s2">they meant they meant that we were the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.960" end="00:10:13.790" style="s2">playthings of these unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.480" end="00:10:16.040" style="s2">powerful primordial forces that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.790" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">manifested themselves within our lives</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.040" end="00:10:19.940" style="s2">and determined our destinies and in an</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:21.950" style="s2">in fact a Mesopotamian said that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.940" end="00:10:24.589" style="s2">specifically about the Elder Gods they</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.950" end="00:10:26.710" style="s2">said they were they were part of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.589" end="00:10:28.700" style="s2">which determined human destiny</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.710" end="00:10:30.920" style="s2">Marduk who we&#39;ll talk about in a while</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.700" end="00:10:33.260" style="s2">was given the tablet of destinies</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.920" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">because when he was when he asked to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.260" end="00:10:37.160" style="s2">become top god he said well if I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:40.339" style="s2">to be taught to determine the destinies</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.160" end="00:10:42.050" style="s2">and well we&#39;ll get to that so you kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.339" end="00:10:44.150" style="s2">of got to know what these what these</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.050" end="00:10:46.040" style="s2">archaic gods work and they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.150" end="00:10:48.980" style="s2">personalities you know when you could</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.040" end="00:10:50.870" style="s2">say well yeah yeah maybe it&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.980" end="00:10:55.130" style="s2">to attribute the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.870" end="00:10:57.190" style="s2">personality to a storm although it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.130" end="00:10:59.810" style="s2">depends on what you think a storm is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.190" end="00:11:01.700" style="s2">like a modern person would think of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.810" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">storm as an objective event that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.700" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">have subjective reactions</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:08.540" style="s2">- and our CAD person would more likely</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.220" end="00:11:11.010" style="s2">think of the storm as the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.540" end="00:11:12.330" style="s2">consequences of the storm plus the storm</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.010" end="00:11:15.570" style="s2">all at once they would make that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.330" end="00:11:17.010" style="s2">separation so it&#39;s a lot easier to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.570" end="00:11:19.110" style="s2">personify something under those</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.010" end="00:11:22.730" style="s2">conditions or to not to personify it but</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.110" end="00:11:24.300" style="s2">- but to stay within the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.730" end="00:11:27.720" style="s2">conceptualization that makes it a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.300" end="00:11:29.490" style="s2">personified force so the storm god is</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.720" end="00:11:31.350" style="s2">something that you know that can instill</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.490" end="00:11:35.730" style="s2">terror into your heart it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.350" end="00:11:38.580" style="s2">you know yeah fair enough you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.730" end="00:11:41.580" style="s2">alright so anyways absolute timeout they</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.580" end="00:11:45.480" style="s2">give rise to these primordial gods and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.580" end="00:11:47.010" style="s2">I&#39;m going to think about them as forces</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.480" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">of nature and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.010" end="00:11:53.150" style="s2">reasonable representation for a variety</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:53.150" style="s2">of reasons they&#39;re like the Titans</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.990" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">alright so they give rise to these gods</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.540" end="00:12:02.370" style="s2">and the gods are their children and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:04.290" style="s2">run about making all sorts of racket</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.370" end="00:12:05.310" style="s2">they&#39;re making rocket and they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.290" end="00:12:06.630" style="s2">this and they&#39;re doing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.310" end="00:12:08.370" style="s2">building things and they&#39;re messing</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.630" end="00:12:10.680" style="s2">about with things and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.370" end="00:12:11.700" style="s2">noisily engaged in their interactions</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.680" end="00:12:13.470" style="s2">with one another and they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.700" end="00:12:15.330" style="s2">children and they&#39;re fighting about sex</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.470" end="00:12:18.540" style="s2">and they&#39;re just making racket like mad</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.330" end="00:12:20.010" style="s2">and then they do something stupid and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.540" end="00:12:22.290" style="s2">they&#39;re annoying time out as they make</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.010" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">all this racket she&#39;s sort of slumbering</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.290" end="00:12:27.450" style="s2">down there in the depths leaving them be</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">but they make all this racket and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.450" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">annoy her it&#39;s like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:33.750" style="s2">environmentalist myth by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">exactly the same idea so you know human</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.750" end="00:12:37.800" style="s2">beings were kind of dopey we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.370" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">around gratifying our fundamental needs</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.800" end="00:12:42.300" style="s2">and making racket and destroying things</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:44.070" style="s2">and if we&#39;re not careful Mother Nature</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.300" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">will come flooding back and like wipe us</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.070" end="00:12:47.700" style="s2">out it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s happened in</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:50.040" style="s2">the past it could happen but it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:23.980" style="s2">much and now they&#39;ve gone and done in my</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.490" end="00:14:38.620" style="s2">but she is the God goddess / dragon that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:40.870" style="s2">gave them all life and the probability</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.620" end="00:14:43.029" style="s2">that they&#39;ll prevail in a battle against</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.870" end="00:14:45.540" style="s2">that which gave them form is very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.029" end="00:14:49.300" style="s2">low so they&#39;re pretty damn terrified so</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.540" end="00:14:50.850" style="s2">meanwhile time at is generating her army</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.300" end="00:14:52.750" style="s2">and she generates quite an army and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.850" end="00:14:54.970" style="s2">Mesopotamians lists out what she does</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.750" end="00:14:58.209" style="s2">she she first of all picks for her</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.970" end="00:15:01.870" style="s2">concert a new character named King mu</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.209" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">and King o is like the king of the demon</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.870" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">monsters so her old husband was absolute</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:10.089" style="s2">maybe he was order and her new husband</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:12.189" style="s2">is like he&#39;s not someone that you want</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.089" end="00:15:14.470" style="s2">to have around at all and so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.189" end="00:15:16.809" style="s2">basically put at the hand of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.470" end="00:15:18.579" style="s2">phalanx of terrible monsters and she</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.809" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">generates like scorpion monsters and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.579" end="00:15:21.850" style="s2">crocodile monsters and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:25.000" style="s2">things in her army so that she can go</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.850" end="00:15:25.930" style="s2">wipe out these these gods and so well</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.000" end="00:15:27.490" style="s2">this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.930" end="00:15:29.820" style="s2">the gods gathered themselves together</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.490" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">and they decide that they&#39;ll elected</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.820" end="00:15:33.900" style="s2">champion from within their ranks to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:35.700" style="s2">out and fight with time app and so they</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.900" end="00:15:37.170" style="s2">do that they send one God out he comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.700" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">back with his tail between his legs</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.170" end="00:15:41.190" style="s2">roughly speaking all right don&#39;t let his</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:42.990" style="s2">encounter with chaos and then they send</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.190" end="00:15:44.400" style="s2">another God out the same thing happens</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.990" end="00:15:45.870" style="s2">and they send another God out the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.400" end="00:15:47.730" style="s2">thing happens and it&#39;s getting pretty</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.870" end="00:15:49.620" style="s2">damn hopeless because they&#39;re sending</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.730" end="00:15:52.290" style="s2">out their best men against chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.620" end="00:15:56.030" style="s2">them and the mother of all things and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.290" end="00:15:58.380" style="s2">they&#39;re getting scuttled all the time</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.030" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">while this was happening they continue</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.380" end="00:16:02.790" style="s2">to produce new generations of gods and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:06.150" style="s2">at one point this new god emerges as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.790" end="00:16:07.560" style="s2">young person I presume um but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.150" end="00:16:09.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some things that are different</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.560" end="00:16:11.220" style="s2">than about him than any other thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.480" end="00:16:12.660" style="s2">that&#39;s being produced so far and one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.220" end="00:16:15.270" style="s2">the things that&#39;s different is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.660" end="00:16:17.490" style="s2">quite tall and powerful so you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.270" end="00:16:19.610" style="s2">that&#39;s not necessarily so radical but he</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.490" end="00:16:22.830" style="s2">has eyes all the way around his head and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.610" end="00:16:24.510" style="s2">when he speaks he can speak darkness</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.830" end="00:16:27.300" style="s2">into being and he can speak light into</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.510" end="00:16:29.940" style="s2">being so so things obey the commands of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.300" end="00:16:31.740" style="s2">his words so he&#39;s a master of language</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.940" end="00:16:33.990" style="s2">he can see everywhere and he&#39;s a master</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.740" end="00:16:35.070" style="s2">of language okay and so the gods are</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.990" end="00:16:37.200" style="s2">checking him out what they think well</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.070" end="00:16:39.210" style="s2">you know he&#39;s he&#39;s quite something maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.200" end="00:16:41.730" style="s2">we can get him to go after time at so</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.210" end="00:16:43.650" style="s2">they all go to him in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.730" end="00:16:46.080" style="s2">little group and they say look Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.650" end="00:16:47.900" style="s2">because that&#39;s his name um you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.080" end="00:16:50.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve been checking you out and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.900" end="00:16:51.960" style="s2">looking pretty impressive and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.040" end="00:16:55.340" style="s2">got a proposition for you how about if</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.960" end="00:16:59.160" style="s2">you go fight time out and Marduk who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.340" end="00:17:00.900" style="s2">not only all-seeing and and very capable</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.160" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">with language is no fool and he says</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.900" end="00:17:04.770" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah I get what you want but</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:08.329" style="s2">here&#39;s the deal you get everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.770" end="00:17:11.010" style="s2">together first and I&#39;ll go fight your</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.329" end="00:17:13.230" style="s2">monster but you&#39;re going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.010" end="00:17:15.170" style="s2">Congress and at that Congress you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.230" end="00:17:19.079" style="s2">going to elect me king of the gods and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.170" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">then I&#39;ll go fight time app and so of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.079" end="00:17:22.170" style="s2">course the other gods aren&#39;t very happy</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:23.699" style="s2">about this but they go off and they have</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.170" end="00:17:25.350" style="s2">a Congress and they invite mark to it</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.699" end="00:17:26.760" style="s2">and they talk about it and they realize</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.350" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">they don&#39;t really have any other choice</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.760" end="00:17:30.270" style="s2">so they decide that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:35.010" style="s2">elect Marduk to the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.270" end="00:17:38.070" style="s2">of gods now that&#39;s such a smart idea so</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.010" end="00:17:40.500" style="s2">if you think for example you can think</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.070" end="00:17:41.950" style="s2">of a hero and then you can think if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.500" end="00:17:44.560" style="s2">took ten heroes and add</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.950" end="00:17:45.430" style="s2">which them out of that you get a god</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.560" end="00:17:47.500" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.430" end="00:17:49.210" style="s2">so it&#39;d be ten heroes you get a meta</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.500" end="00:17:51.940" style="s2">here out of that and that would be a god</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.210" end="00:17:54.070" style="s2">and then maybe you do that to ten sets</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.940" end="00:17:55.990" style="s2">of ten heroes and you get ten meta</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.070" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">heroes and then you take all those meta</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.990" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">heroes and you figure out what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:01.300" style="s2">same about them and you abstract that</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.580" style="s2">out and then you get the hero of Heroes</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.300" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">of Heroes and that&#39;s the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.580" end="00:18:08.530" style="s2">that&#39;s the archetype it&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:10.780" style="s2">distillation it&#39;s like who&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.530" end="00:18:13.290" style="s2">interesting possible the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.780" end="00:18:15.730" style="s2">interesting and capable possible person</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.290" end="00:18:19.000" style="s2">well that would be this person this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.730" end="00:18:20.200" style="s2">the most memorable possible person well</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.000" end="00:18:21.610" style="s2">we don&#39;t know who that is but this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.200" end="00:18:23.110" style="s2">how we figure it out now I could say</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.610" end="00:18:25.090" style="s2">well I admire something about you and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.110" end="00:18:27.670" style="s2">admire something about you I can notice</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.090" end="00:18:29.620" style="s2">that as a phenomenological fact you seem</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.670" end="00:18:31.060" style="s2">very capable in a certain way and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.620" end="00:18:34.180" style="s2">know you have this attribute and then I</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.060" end="00:18:37.750" style="s2">might say well if I was going to sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.180" end="00:18:40.090" style="s2">out an ideal for myself to follow then I</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.750" end="00:18:41.710" style="s2">take the good parts of all of you and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.090" end="00:18:43.930" style="s2">put that into one thing and then I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.710" end="00:18:46.030" style="s2">make that my ideal well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.930" end="00:18:46.840" style="s2">origin of the idea of the savior of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.030" end="00:18:50.680" style="s2">Messiah</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.840" end="00:18:53.980" style="s2">that&#39;s an emergent idea it emerges when</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.680" end="00:18:55.630" style="s2">people notice that the hero is that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.980" end="00:18:57.550" style="s2">hero is part of the force that makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.630" end="00:18:59.830" style="s2">order out of chaos or sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.550" end="00:19:03.010" style="s2">reverse when when order has become too</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.830" end="00:19:04.600" style="s2">rigid it can also decompose order bring</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.010" end="00:19:06.670" style="s2">a little necessary chaos into it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.600" end="00:19:09.790" style="s2">rejuvenate the whole structure so</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.670" end="00:19:12.490" style="s2">anyways so Marduk he gets elected King</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.790" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">now you might think about how would this</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.490" end="00:19:17.020" style="s2">happen historically speaking well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:19.270" style="s2">an interesting way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.020" end="00:19:22.060" style="s2">so imagine a landscape that consists of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.270" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">tribes okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.060" end="00:19:27.160" style="s2">and then on top of them imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:30.220" style="s2">landscape of the imagination okay so</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.160" end="00:19:33.610" style="s2">each member of each tribal group lives</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.220" end="00:19:35.560" style="s2">in their imagined world and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.610" end="00:19:37.570" style="s2">imagined world is full of dandies and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.560" end="00:19:39.610" style="s2">natural forces of various kinds that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.570" end="00:19:41.740" style="s2">they&#39;re following but then you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.610" end="00:19:44.320" style="s2">imagine that as the tribes battle it out</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.740" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">and organize themselves the figures of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.320" end="00:19:48.790" style="s2">the imagination do exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:50.740" style="s2">thing so as the people are battling the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.790" end="00:19:53.800" style="s2">gods in heaven are battling which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.740" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">also very common mythology and as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.800" end="00:19:58.780" style="s2">human beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:20:01.480" style="s2">I beat themselves into a functional</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.780" end="00:20:03.700" style="s2">group their world conceptions do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.480" end="00:20:06.309" style="s2">same thing and so over time you move</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.700" end="00:20:10.059" style="s2">from polytheism roughly speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.309" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">monotheism as the the as all these</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.059" end="00:20:16.720" style="s2">tribes communicate with one another in</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:19.300" style="s2">language and in combat and sort out just</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.720" end="00:20:20.680" style="s2">exactly what should be sovereign what</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.300" end="00:20:22.870" style="s2">should be powerful what should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.680" end="00:20:24.580" style="s2">dominant right it&#39;s a major it&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.870" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">issue and it&#39;s partly practical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.580" end="00:20:29.470" style="s2">partly conceptual so if this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:32.140" style="s2">reflected in the Mesopotamian creation</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.470" end="00:20:34.480" style="s2">myth the gods assemble themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.140" end="00:20:37.660" style="s2">they look among them and they think okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.480" end="00:20:40.929" style="s2">well someone here is has the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.660" end="00:20:43.720" style="s2">characteristics that should should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.929" end="00:20:46.660" style="s2">the central element of the top deity</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.720" end="00:20:48.870" style="s2">which is like the ultimate value okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.660" end="00:20:53.500" style="s2">while the Mesopotamians chose wisely</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.870" end="00:20:57.040" style="s2">vision and language those are you most</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.500" end="00:21:00.160" style="s2">the most potent weapons you have against</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.040" end="00:21:02.350" style="s2">chaos because you if you pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.160" end="00:21:05.260" style="s2">you can see chaos when it first emerges</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.350" end="00:21:07.450" style="s2">and then if you are a master of language</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.260" end="00:21:09.010" style="s2">you can encapsulate it and articulate it</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.450" end="00:21:10.990" style="s2">very rapidly and you can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.010" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">that to other peoples it&#39;s like now this</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.990" end="00:21:15.820" style="s2">you you just cannot overestimate how</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:18.130" style="s2">radical an idea that is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.820" end="00:21:19.720" style="s2">staggeringly radical idea that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.130" end="00:21:21.610" style="s2">the set of attributes that should be at</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.720" end="00:21:24.700" style="s2">the top the Mesopotamians are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.610" end="00:21:27.429" style="s2">figure out what should be sovereign what</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.700" end="00:21:29.080" style="s2">should be above everything else well you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.429" end="00:21:32.290" style="s2">might say a person it&#39;s like yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.080" end="00:21:34.450" style="s2">no the person embodies sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.290" end="00:21:36.670" style="s2">sovereignty itself is something else</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.450" end="00:21:39.340" style="s2">so when Fran&#39;s de Waal for example he</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.670" end="00:21:42.070" style="s2">was watching chimpanzees hash it out for</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.340" end="00:21:44.110" style="s2">dominance in in in the zoo and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.070" end="00:21:46.030" style="s2">it&#39;s in Holland Arnhem</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.110" end="00:21:47.620" style="s2">I think anyways it&#39;s a zoo that has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.030" end="00:21:50.830" style="s2">lot of chimpanzees in it he spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.620" end="00:21:53.410" style="s2">of time watching them and you know one</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.830" end="00:21:57.040" style="s2">idea about the doorman and chimp is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.410" end="00:21:58.870" style="s2">he&#39;s just biggest meanest like most</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.040" end="00:22:02.050" style="s2">tyrannical chimp it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.870" end="00:22:04.030" style="s2">strongman theory of chimp leadership but</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.050" end="00:22:06.190" style="s2">what do all observed was that well that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.030" end="00:22:06.850" style="s2">was sort of true in that the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.190" end="00:22:08.770" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.850" end="00:22:11.320" style="s2">meanest chimpanzee could obtain</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.770" end="00:22:14.350" style="s2">dominance but the problem with him is if</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.320" end="00:22:15.700" style="s2">he was really like selfish and cruel was</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.350" end="00:22:17.680" style="s2">that he didn&#39;t have any friends</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.700" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">now chimps have friends and they spend a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.680" end="00:22:20.380" style="s2">lot of time with them and they groom</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.850" end="00:22:22.210" style="s2">each other and they protect each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.380" end="00:22:24.190" style="s2">in fights and like you can be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.210" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">ugliest meanest chimp around but if</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.190" end="00:22:27.430" style="s2">there&#39;s two chimps that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">three-quarters your strength coming out</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.430" end="00:22:31.990" style="s2">at you it&#39;s like you you lose now so</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.520" end="00:22:33.880" style="s2">that means two chimps that are capable</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.990" end="00:22:38.230" style="s2">of enough civilization to bind</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.880" end="00:22:40.840" style="s2">themselves in to a dyad that is that has</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.230" end="00:22:43.270" style="s2">mutual obligations across time is way</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.840" end="00:22:45.700" style="s2">stronger than one ship who doesn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.270" end="00:22:48.550" style="s2">so what that means is that strength and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:49.960" style="s2">viciousness you know there will be times</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.550" end="00:22:52.300" style="s2">when that can emerge as the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.960" end="00:22:54.130" style="s2">power but it&#39;s very very unstable and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.300" end="00:22:55.870" style="s2">and everyone&#39;s motivated to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.130" end="00:22:57.370" style="s2">down as fast as possible and the best</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.870" end="00:22:59.680" style="s2">way to bring it down is with a coalition</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.370" end="00:23:01.480" style="s2">and so partly what that indicates is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.680" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually the chimp who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.480" end="00:23:05.590" style="s2">best at making coalition&#39;s that&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:06.760" style="s2">likely to become sovereign so that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.590" end="00:23:09.940" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what happens with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.760" end="00:23:11.800" style="s2">chimps is that the dictator chimp is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.940" end="00:23:15.100" style="s2">very unstable in in the one story I</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.800" end="00:23:18.370" style="s2">rented of Arnhem at the armed zoo he</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.100" end="00:23:22.030" style="s2">rose to the top though you know bad bad</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.370" end="00:23:23.800" style="s2">guy that gangster guy and two chimps</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.030" end="00:23:27.610" style="s2">went after me torn to pieces they tore</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.800" end="00:23:29.230" style="s2">off his testicles yeah and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.610" end="00:23:30.760" style="s2">agitated the hell out of the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.230" end="00:23:32.650" style="s2">troop and it was looking like a bloody</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.760" end="00:23:36.280" style="s2">revolution you know it was really really</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.650" end="00:23:38.140" style="s2">stressful for the troop but but what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.280" end="00:23:41.470" style="s2">indicates and it&#39;s so interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.140" end="00:23:44.550" style="s2">that the idea that in a in a dominance</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.470" end="00:23:47.230" style="s2">hierarchy what&#39;s most dominant is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.550" end="00:23:48.820" style="s2">power that there&#39;s no evidence</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.230" end="00:23:52.210" style="s2">whatsoever that that&#39;s true and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.820" end="00:23:54.220" style="s2">I was talking to what I have a partner</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.210" end="00:23:56.050" style="s2">in a business that I have who was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.220" end="00:23:58.450" style="s2">student of mine at Harvard he is a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.050" end="00:24:00.550" style="s2">very smart person and I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.450" end="00:24:02.710" style="s2">him about dominance hierarchies and he</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.550" end="00:24:04.750" style="s2">said something very that I found very</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.710" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">upsetting on a variety of levels he said</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.750" end="00:24:08.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not a dominance herky if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">put a dog collar on the person one level</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:13.720" style="s2">below you which is pretty bloody blunt</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:15.210" style="s2">statement but when he&#39;s prone to that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.720" end="00:24:18.220" style="s2">sort of thing but what he meant is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.210" end="00:24:19.879" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.220" end="00:24:21.709" style="s2">term dominance higher</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.879" end="00:24:23.809" style="s2">is not the right term to be applying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.709" end="00:24:26.239" style="s2">these sorts of social structures because</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.809" end="00:24:29.119" style="s2">what it implies is that what keeps the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.239" end="00:24:30.229" style="s2">structure in place is power you know and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.119" end="00:24:32.299" style="s2">that&#39;s the sort of claim that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.229" end="00:24:34.309" style="s2">like Foucault make it&#39;s all about power</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.299" end="00:24:37.009" style="s2">it&#39;s like the thing is it&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.309" end="00:24:39.019" style="s2">about power it&#39;s not all about power</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.009" end="00:24:42.529" style="s2">it&#39;s not all about power among animals</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.019" end="00:24:43.909" style="s2">so with power with chimps if that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.529" end="00:24:46.369" style="s2">you&#39;ve got is power you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.909" end="00:24:48.079" style="s2">wiped out you have to so what do all</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.369" end="00:24:49.879" style="s2">found was that the chimps who were able</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.079" end="00:24:53.029" style="s2">to establish stable patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.879" end="00:24:54.979" style="s2">leadership were quite congenial they had</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.029" end="00:24:56.539" style="s2">a lot of allies so they engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.979" end="00:24:58.249" style="s2">mutual grooming and a lot of social</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.539" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">interaction and they were very</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.249" end="00:25:02.989" style="s2">positively predisposed to the females in</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:05.779" style="s2">the troop so that&#39;s pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.989" end="00:25:09.319" style="s2">you know because we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.779" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">constitutes valid sovereignty but even</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.319" end="00:25:14.419" style="s2">in animals it doesn&#39;t seem to be power</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:16.099" style="s2">so and then you know you look at wolf</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.419" end="00:25:17.599" style="s2">pack&#39;s and that sort of thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.099" end="00:25:21.259" style="s2">know if two wolves go at it for</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.599" end="00:25:23.269" style="s2">dominance one wolf for back off and roll</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.259" end="00:25:26.239" style="s2">over and show his throat and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.269" end="00:25:30.729" style="s2">like Stalin wolf would just tear out his</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.239" end="00:25:33.259" style="s2">throat but you know um</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.729" end="00:25:34.729" style="s2">Churchill wolf let&#39;s say would say well</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.259" end="00:25:36.049" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re kind of useless but we might</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.729" end="00:25:37.940" style="s2">need you around later so why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.049" end="00:25:40.069" style="s2">get up and you know we&#39;ll let bygones be</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.940" end="00:25:42.259" style="s2">bygones and that&#39;s what wolves do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.069" end="00:25:43.489" style="s2">know and and unsurprisingly because what</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.259" end="00:25:45.859" style="s2">are you going to do kill everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.489" end="00:25:47.779" style="s2">your troop well that doesn&#39;t seem like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.859" end="00:25:49.819" style="s2">very effective strategy either for</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.779" end="00:25:51.459" style="s2">mating or for survival so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.819" end="00:25:53.479" style="s2">Mesopotamians are trying to work out</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.459" end="00:25:56.419" style="s2">practically who&#39;s going to be sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.479" end="00:25:58.429" style="s2">and at the same time conceptually what</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.419" end="00:25:59.959" style="s2">is the proper basis for sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.429" end="00:26:03.769" style="s2">which is it&#39;s really the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.959" end="00:26:05.209" style="s2">question in some sense so anyway so they</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.769" end="00:26:07.339" style="s2">elect marnik and the Martok&#39;s got all</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.209" end="00:26:11.149" style="s2">these eyes and he can speak and so he</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.339" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">thinks all right it says if I win I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.149" end="00:26:15.169" style="s2">going to get the tablet of destinies and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:18.019" style="s2">then I&#39;m talking on and they say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.169" end="00:26:20.690" style="s2">yeah whatever if you win no problem so</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.019" end="00:26:23.839" style="s2">she goes out to fight timeout and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.690" end="00:26:26.690" style="s2">takes a sword and he and he takes a net</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.839" end="00:26:28.360" style="s2">and they meet on the battlefield and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.690" end="00:26:30.190" style="s2">encapsulate stye map in</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.360" end="00:26:32.740" style="s2">which i think is a brilliant brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.190" end="00:26:36.160" style="s2">metaphor again because chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.740" end="00:26:37.650" style="s2">amorphous and unformed right and if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.160" end="00:26:40.390" style="s2">want to conquer it you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.650" end="00:26:41.980" style="s2">encapsulate it within a net a network</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.390" end="00:26:43.210" style="s2">you have to you have to make it into</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.980" end="00:26:47.350" style="s2">something rather than something</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.210" end="00:26:49.480" style="s2">amorphous you know and so look maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.350" end="00:26:51.100" style="s2">client comes to me and they say oh I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.480" end="00:26:53.920" style="s2">been having these terrible symptoms on</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.100" end="00:26:55.420" style="s2">my heart races and I&#39;m my breath I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.920" end="00:26:58.360" style="s2">catch my breath and I think I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.420" end="00:26:59.860" style="s2">die and I think maybe I&#39;m having a heart</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.360" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">attack and I&#39;m always at the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.860" end="00:27:02.950" style="s2">and they tell me that there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:04.900" style="s2">wrong with me and but I have like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.950" end="00:27:07.450" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid all the time and I&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.900" end="00:27:12.429" style="s2">not to go out and I say oh you have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.450" end="00:27:14.740" style="s2">graph obeah lots of people have that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.429" end="00:27:17.620" style="s2">you&#39;re not the only person like that in</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.740" end="00:27:19.150" style="s2">the world not only that it has a name we</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.620" end="00:27:22.990" style="s2">know what to do about it and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.150" end="00:27:24.910" style="s2">treatment course and they go and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.990" end="00:27:26.950" style="s2">reason for that is that the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.910" end="00:27:28.540" style="s2">unknown has just been turned into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.950" end="00:27:32.190" style="s2">known unknown and that&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.540" end="00:27:34.780" style="s2">improvement and so the person who</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.190" end="00:27:37.299" style="s2">conceptualizes the anomalous situation</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.780" end="00:27:38.770" style="s2">fastest is in fact the leader that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.299" end="00:27:40.570" style="s2">definition of leadership it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.770" end="00:27:42.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.570" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and what and when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.730" end="00:27:48.100" style="s2">say this is what&#39;s going on you also</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:49.780" style="s2">simultaneously say here&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.100" end="00:27:52.840" style="s2">other things that could have been going</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.780" end="00:27:54.970" style="s2">on that aren&#39;t so it&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.840" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">radical simplification and it lowers the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.970" end="00:27:59.230" style="s2">stress levels immediately anyway so time</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.980" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">that goes and or martica as he gets her</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.230" end="00:28:03.220" style="s2">in a net and then he splits her in half</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:04.750" style="s2">and he makes heaven out of one half and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.220" end="00:28:10.270" style="s2">the earth other the other for the human</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.750" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">beings and and he goes back to and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.270" end="00:28:13.330" style="s2">defeats Keo and all the monsters and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:14.679" style="s2">then he goes back to tell the other gods</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.330" end="00:28:16.750" style="s2">and they&#39;re pretty happy about this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.679" end="00:28:19.150" style="s2">king who had the tablet of destinies but</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.750" end="00:28:21.460" style="s2">mardik took that from him and now he has</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.150" end="00:28:23.590" style="s2">it so he gets to determine destiny and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.460" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">he makes human beings out of Kings blood</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.590" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">which is quite an interesting little</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:31.630" style="s2">twist to the story and he makes them to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:35.650" style="s2">serve the gods and so so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.630" end="00:28:37.390" style="s2">soul so the idea is that the hero who</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.650" end="00:28:38.930" style="s2">can see and can communicate is also the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.390" end="00:28:40.910" style="s2">hero who separates out</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.930" end="00:28:43.010" style="s2">the elements of existence so that it</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.910" end="00:28:46.400" style="s2">becomes a habitable place and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.010" end="00:28:48.590" style="s2">humans should serve that serve Marduk we</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.400" end="00:28:51.170" style="s2">have to serve something well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.590" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">going to serve a natural force of some</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.170" end="00:28:54.620" style="s2">sort in the all anger you can be all</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:28:56.930" style="s2">lust it can be all love or you can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.620" end="00:29:00.530" style="s2">all hunger or you going to represent</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.930" end="00:29:04.970" style="s2">some integrated ah some some balance</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.530" end="00:29:07.220" style="s2">that integrated emergent property of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.970" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">that that&#39;s also socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.220" end="00:29:11.270" style="s2">you know so that you&#39;re a balance of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:13.460" style="s2">natural forces and you&#39;re a civilized</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.270" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">person and that&#39;s some sort of essence</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.460" end="00:29:16.700" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to strive</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">for well that&#39;s Martin so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.700" end="00:29:20.570" style="s2">supposed to be a good Marduk now</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:22.280" style="s2">Margaret is immortal now the only person</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.570" end="00:29:24.590" style="s2">who was identified with Marduk in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.280" end="00:29:27.260" style="s2">Mesopotamian realm was the Emperor now</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.590" end="00:29:27.890" style="s2">they lived in a walled city and so what</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.260" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">the Emperor</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.890" end="00:29:30.950" style="s2">the reason the Emperor was sovereign was</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:33.050" style="s2">because he was supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.950" end="00:29:35.330" style="s2">embodiment of mark on earth which meant</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.050" end="00:29:35.720" style="s2">that his job was to transform chaos into</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.330" end="00:29:37.850" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.720" end="00:29:39.620" style="s2">whenever chaos threatened he was</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.850" end="00:29:42.050" style="s2">supposed to transform it back into order</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.620" end="00:29:44.090" style="s2">so this is what the Mesopotamians did at</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.050" end="00:29:46.070" style="s2">the New Year&#39;s celebration when the Year</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.090" end="00:29:47.780" style="s2">is rejuvenated right the old year dies</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.070" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">of course we know that because we still</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.780" end="00:29:51.410" style="s2">do it and the new year is this new baby</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:53.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a time of new beginnings</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.410" end="00:29:55.910" style="s2">so the Mesopotamians would take the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.300" end="00:29:58.250" style="s2">emperor out of the city and they&#39;d strip</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.910" end="00:30:00.920" style="s2">him of all his emperor clothes and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.250" end="00:30:02.780" style="s2">they&#39;d make him recite all the ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.920" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">during the last year that he&#39;d been a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.780" end="00:30:07.790" style="s2">bad Marduk like he hadn&#39;t kept he hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:09.500" style="s2">been encountering chaos properly and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.790" end="00:30:12.410" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been keeping order properly so he</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.500" end="00:30:14.990" style="s2">had to confess all of his inadequacies</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.410" end="00:30:18.280" style="s2">then the priest would whack him with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.990" end="00:30:21.620" style="s2">glove as a you know as a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.280" end="00:30:23.540" style="s2">punishment and then they take all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.620" end="00:30:27.920" style="s2">statues out of the old gods out of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.540" end="00:30:32.000" style="s2">city and then they re read the battle</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.920" end="00:30:34.220" style="s2">between Marduk and Tiamat and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.000" end="00:30:36.470" style="s2">Emperor was Martic and he would win and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.220" end="00:30:40.040" style="s2">then he would have sex with a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.470" end="00:30:42.050" style="s2">prostitute which was that this is a much</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.040" end="00:30:44.930" style="s2">tougher concept but it&#39;s it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.050" end="00:30:47.180" style="s2">symbolizing the fact that if the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.930" end="00:30:49.280" style="s2">creative force encounters the positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.180" end="00:30:50.760" style="s2">element of the feminine it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.280" end="00:30:52.500" style="s2">prince in Sleeping Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.760" end="00:30:54.150" style="s2">getting Sleeping Beauty from the grasp</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.500" end="00:30:55.770" style="s2">of the evil queen who turns into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.150" end="00:30:57.179" style="s2">dragon it&#39;s exact because it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.770" end="00:30:59.250" style="s2">right you&#39;ve seen that and you</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.510" end="00:33:07.880" style="s2">and then that&#39;s disruptive and what do</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.059" end="00:33:10.220" style="s2">you do well you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.880" end="00:33:12.350" style="s2">voluntarily encounter this name and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.220" end="00:33:14.570" style="s2">either defeat it or make something</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.350" end="00:33:16.160" style="s2">valuable of you know you can cower and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.570" end="00:33:17.990" style="s2">hide but all that generally means the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.160" end="00:33:19.730" style="s2">state grows and grows until there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.990" end="00:33:21.320" style="s2">hardly any you in the box and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:23.870" style="s2">all snakes and that&#39;s actually the best</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.320" end="00:33:25.940" style="s2">of Damien&#39;s story it&#39;s like if the Elder</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.870" end="00:33:28.040" style="s2">Gods weren&#39;t so careless and had been</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.940" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">paying attention and hadn&#39;t killed</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.040" end="00:33:34.309" style="s2">absolute time that would have stayed</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:39.320" style="s2">asleep the whole time so mom so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.309" end="00:33:42.169" style="s2">the that&#39;s the level of isomorphism so</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.320" end="00:33:44.450" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s fascinating but I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.169" end="00:33:47.900" style="s2">inevitable is that the mythology</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.450" end="00:33:50.330" style="s2">reflects the physiology but how could it</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.900" end="00:33:52.460" style="s2">not the physiology produced the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.330" end="00:33:53.780" style="s2">mythology like of course that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.460" end="00:33:56.690" style="s2">be the case it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.780" end="00:33:58.580" style="s2">it should be it should be it should be</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.690" end="00:33:59.660" style="s2">the reverse should be a surprise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.580" end="00:34:01.490" style="s2">like there&#39;s no relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.660" end="00:34:03.110" style="s2">these these old stories in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.490" end="00:34:09.549" style="s2">human beings are structured it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.110" end="00:34:09.549" style="s2">well no no that&#39;s a dumb idea so</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.669" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">well that&#39;s the mesopotamian creation</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.579" end="00:34:22.799" style="s2">myth and it&#39;s it&#39;s a killer it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:24.659" style="s2">it&#39;s a staggering story and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.799" end="00:34:27.149" style="s2">still sits whether we know it or not</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.659" end="00:34:30.510" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s at the very base of our</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.149" end="00:34:31.379" style="s2">culture it&#39;s absolute that story and if</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.510" end="00:34:35.220" style="s2">we kill it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.379" end="00:34:38.519" style="s2">which we will or have been then then</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.220" end="00:34:42.510" style="s2">look out you know we know the story from</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.519" end="00:34:45.029" style="s2">so long ago if you let your culture die</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.510" end="00:34:51.210" style="s2">and act carelessly towards it all hell</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.029" end="00:34:58.289" style="s2">will break loose and it&#39;s no joke so so</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.210" end="00:35:00.029" style="s2">here we are trying to revivify it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.289" end="00:35:03.000" style="s2">pretty weird that these things happen to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.029" end="00:35:04.470" style="s2">be real but then if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.000" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">well how could it be otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.470" end="00:35:10.170" style="s2">you know I mean you think all these</p>
