<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:31.830" style="s2">for infrastructure so specifically we</p>

<p begin="00:00:31.830" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">have clear boundaries and don&#39;t have any</p>

<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">autonomous unit in any kind of real-time</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.450" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">capacity there might be coordination of</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">slow kind of response curve and so there</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">are dynamics of how that is a complex</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">adaptive system but it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:03.989" style="s2">have singular agency right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">defined by a lack of memory lack of</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.650" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">to the environment outside we see then</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.320" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">you know the earliest membranes are</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">prokaryotes and they have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">to navigate with agency and relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">to the environment then as we start to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">get into eukaryotes and slime molds we</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">get into something we have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:33.860" style="s2">steps of boundaries these are you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">think of these as super organisms</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.860" end="00:01:39.390" style="s2">comprised of simple organisms and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">here you have to get the agency of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">different things to participate with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">high coherence which is already</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:48.299" style="s2">happening in the forest but participate</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">with a different kind of high coherence</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.299" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">where they don&#39;t have competitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">dynamics with each other they have</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:54.450" style="s2">coherent dynamics with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">may be competitive dynamics outside of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.450" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">that boundary and then you get a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">boundary outside of it right which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">the biofilm around the slime mold and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">then that whole thing starts to operate</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">as a unified organism even though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">super organism of my growth smaller</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">organisms that&#39;s a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">kind of behavior than just the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">individual organism because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:13.350" style="s2">individual organism doesn&#39;t have to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:15.750" style="s2">agents and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.350" end="00:02:19.140" style="s2">coherence between them right whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">superorganism that like a forest that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.140" end="00:02:23.160" style="s2">not yet a secondary organism it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:24.210" style="s2">also have to create certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.160" end="00:02:26.820" style="s2">coherence it just has to create</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.210" end="00:02:29.310" style="s2">homeostasis predation cycles of balance</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.820" end="00:02:30.690" style="s2">but then the next one where you get you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.310" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">know a slime mold boundary or a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.690" end="00:02:35.400" style="s2">eukaryote that is made of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">prokaryotic like dynamics now you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.400" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">to get separate agents to cohere and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:44.850" style="s2">then become a new meta agent right then</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:47.400" style="s2">that starts to evolve in eukaryotic</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.850" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">systems to greater complexity and as</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.400" end="00:02:52.140" style="s2">soon as we had a neural net we start to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">get a different kind of way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.140" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">centralizing information across this</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">kind of complex that allows a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">adaptive capacity than the slime mold</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:04.020" style="s2">has the slime mold is only going to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:08.580" style="s2">chemical signaling which is going to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.020" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">very slowly and the you know something</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.580" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">that has a neural net it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:13.500" style="s2">able to actually eliminate either of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">lots of organisms from a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.500" end="00:03:18.090" style="s2">fashion so you can actually start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:19.320" style="s2">have a boundary anytime you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.090" end="00:03:22.020" style="s2">boundary you start to get some and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.320" end="00:03:24.090" style="s2">top-down coordination but then you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.020" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">phases of what kinds of top-down so then</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.090" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">you go from distributed neural Nets a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:29.450" style="s2">central nervous system then higher kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">of central nervous system and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.450" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">top-down organization is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:35.700" style="s2">emergent property of certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:39.000" style="s2">bottom-up organization right you get</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.700" end="00:03:43.620" style="s2">bottom-up organization of separate cells</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.000" end="00:03:46.140" style="s2">coming together to make up a human right</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.620" end="00:03:47.520" style="s2">hundred trillion autonomous agents that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.140" end="00:03:49.380" style="s2">function more coherent linked together</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.520" end="00:03:51.870" style="s2">and adaptive for them to be together</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.380" end="00:03:54.600" style="s2">then separately and each cell is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.870" end="00:03:56.730" style="s2">regulating its own function genetically</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.600" end="00:03:58.860" style="s2">and eternally in a bottom-up fashion but</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.730" end="00:04:01.440" style="s2">then the top-down neuro endocrine</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.860" end="00:04:02.880" style="s2">control of massive groups of cells where</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.440" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">the top-down system is sensing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.880" end="00:04:07.050" style="s2">entire system and then can do</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:08.970" style="s2">coordination of the whole system but</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.050" end="00:04:10.710" style="s2">sitting on top of bottom-up dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.970" end="00:04:12.060" style="s2">which is if the cells weren&#39;t still</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.710" end="00:04:14.190" style="s2">doing their own thing genetically the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.060" end="00:04:16.049" style="s2">top-down system wouldn&#39;t work at all but</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.190" end="00:04:18.090" style="s2">if the top-down system is not working</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.049" end="00:04:19.770" style="s2">well like a person&#39;s in a coma and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.090" end="00:04:21.270" style="s2">higher the highest functions are turned</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.770" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">off and only autonomic is on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.270" end="00:04:24.390" style="s2">bottom-up is working just as well but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the same capacities at all</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.390" end="00:04:26.910" style="s2">you have emergent capacities that relate</p>

<p begin="00:04:26.910" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">greed and top-down capability which of</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:35.430" style="s2">will be right is it going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.450" end="00:04:37.650" style="s2">individual humans that are just like a</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.650" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">boundary around it and we just get that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:44.100" style="s2">once through getting the right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:46.650" style="s2">predation cycles and equilibriums is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.100" end="00:04:49.380" style="s2">humans as a slime mold that are working</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.650" end="00:04:51.900" style="s2">together but without central top-down</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.939" end="00:06:52.020" style="s2">there are things that will have to be</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.840" end="00:06:59.699" style="s2">through bottom-up only dynamics so now</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.659" end="00:07:01.979" style="s2">this is the next topic which is our</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.699" end="00:07:03.810" style="s2">ability to affect things and our ability</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.409" end="00:07:17.940" style="s2">become problematic as our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.870" end="00:07:21.150" style="s2">affect things is on an exponential curve</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.940" end="00:07:23.370" style="s2">right now if our choice making capacity</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.150" end="00:07:25.889" style="s2">is not similarly on an exponential curve</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.370" end="00:07:29.009" style="s2">that is a fundamentally self terminating</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.889" end="00:07:30.979" style="s2">scenario so exponential tech this is the</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.979" end="00:07:37.259" style="s2">gives individual agents and small groups</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.259" end="00:07:40.919" style="s2">before so when you think about like you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.389" end="00:07:42.930" style="s2">think about Nash equilibriums and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.919" end="00:07:45.090" style="s2">wanting to get us out of up Nash</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.930" end="00:07:46.469" style="s2">equilibriums you don&#39;t need everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.090" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">do the right thing because individual</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.469" end="00:07:51.330" style="s2">agents all have quasi equal power and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:53.069" style="s2">the worst thing and together which will</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.330" end="00:07:54.419" style="s2">be really up everybody has a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.069" end="00:07:57.419" style="s2">certain critical mass that people have</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.419" end="00:07:59.879" style="s2">to do the wrong thing in a dynamic where</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.419" end="00:08:01.770" style="s2">you have exponential tech that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.879" end="00:08:06.060" style="s2">powerful enough to be catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.770" end="00:08:08.729" style="s2">that can be decentralized everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.060" end="00:08:09.839" style="s2">choice making matters so how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.729" end="00:08:12.779" style="s2">what that is a totally different thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.839" end="00:08:16.830" style="s2">right and so for Humanity to make it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.779" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">through us individually and in small</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.830" end="00:08:22.139" style="s2">groups scaling our actuator capacity up</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.330" end="00:08:29.879" style="s2">fasi and our feedback loops on that also</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.580" end="00:08:32.789" style="s2">have to scale up now whenever we develop</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.879" end="00:08:34.740" style="s2">new technology in the past we did heaps</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.789" end="00:08:36.360" style="s2">of destructive applications but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.740" end="00:08:37.800" style="s2">technology wasn&#39;t so bad that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:39.539" style="s2">destroyed everything we burned a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.800" end="00:08:41.010" style="s2"> down on the fire before we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.539" end="00:08:43.289" style="s2">learned how to manage fire to be more</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.010" end="00:08:44.070" style="s2">positive than negative but you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.289" end="00:08:45.630" style="s2">that with nukes</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.070" end="00:08:49.250" style="s2">right and you can&#39;t do it with CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.630" end="00:08:51.899" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the impact potential is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.250" end="00:08:53.240" style="s2">radically more than it was the fire and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.899" end="00:08:55.220" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.240" end="00:08:56.990" style="s2">how do we take our new emerging</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.220" end="00:08:58.339" style="s2">technologies and do something with them</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.990" end="00:08:59.810" style="s2">that is radically different than we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.339" end="00:09:02.089" style="s2">ever done with any technologies in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.810" end="00:09:03.589" style="s2">past which is adequate anticipatory</p>

<p begin="00:09:03.589" end="00:09:06.290" style="s2">trial and error on things that are too</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.970" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">powerful to learn from trial and error</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.290" end="00:09:11.330" style="s2">that&#39;s a totally different set of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:12.529" style="s2">scenarios that we have to address so</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.330" end="00:09:13.640" style="s2">then we get into the issue of incentive</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.529" end="00:09:16.790" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.640" end="00:09:18.350" style="s2">one of the things is that we have to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.790" end="00:09:19.250" style="s2">can&#39;t avoid a problem while you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.350" end="00:09:20.750" style="s2">incentivize it</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.250" end="00:09:22.190" style="s2">you also can&#39;t solve a problem while</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.750" end="00:09:25.100" style="s2">you&#39;re continuing to incentivize at that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.190" end="00:09:26.779" style="s2">scale one of the problems with</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.100" end="00:09:28.430" style="s2">exponential tech and why we are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.779" end="00:09:30.620" style="s2">doing a good enough job of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.430" end="00:09:32.500" style="s2">through the problems of exponential text</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.620" end="00:09:35.180" style="s2">slowly is because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.500" end="00:09:36.890" style="s2">fiscal incentive to get there first and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.180" end="00:09:38.750" style="s2">there&#39;s not that much fiscal incentive</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.890" end="00:09:40.490" style="s2">to really think through the issues you</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.750" end="00:09:43.339" style="s2">know in a long slow doing thoughtful way</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.490" end="00:09:46.670" style="s2">and so spending where you were</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.339" end="00:09:49.930" style="s2">sterilizing excellence we are to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.670" end="00:09:52.459" style="s2">really thinking about it we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.930" end="00:09:55.370" style="s2">increasing the probability of extinction</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.459" end="00:09:57.649" style="s2">for the probability of winning in the in</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.370" end="00:09:59.390" style="s2">the near term profit game that will be</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.649" end="00:10:01.459" style="s2">obsoleted in the process but each of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.390" end="00:10:03.079" style="s2">those increase in the probability of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.459" end="00:10:06.740" style="s2">extinction compound on all the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.079" end="00:10:09.350" style="s2">ones till the probability reaches one</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.740" end="00:10:11.990" style="s2">right and it&#39;s it at the current</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.350" end="00:10:13.370" style="s2">trajectory is inexorably reaching one a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.990" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">hundred percent probability of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.370" end="00:10:19.160" style="s2">extinction and so you&#39;ve changed that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">whole thing so you can&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.160" end="00:10:25.459" style="s2">economic system that incentivizes speed</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:28.940" style="s2">on things that have to go slowly right</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.459" end="00:10:31.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a just I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.940" end="00:10:32.899" style="s2">underscore that one enough but then that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.130" end="00:10:35.329" style="s2">also brings up the issue of incentive in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.899" end="00:10:39.620" style="s2">general with complex systems is how do</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.329" end="00:10:41.510" style="s2">you get a bunch of individual cells or</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.620" end="00:10:43.100" style="s2">algae or whatever to work together into</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.510" end="00:10:44.270" style="s2">a super organism rather than compete</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.100" end="00:10:46.459" style="s2">with each other well you have to change</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.270" end="00:10:48.290" style="s2">the behavioral dynamics from competitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.459" end="00:10:49.880" style="s2">to cooperative you you have to change</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.290" end="00:10:52.070" style="s2">all the things that affect behavioral in</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.880" end="00:10:53.720" style="s2">them so incentive is one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.070" end="00:10:58.970" style="s2">categories of behavior of dynamic as</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.720" end="00:11:01.459" style="s2">long as we have any systems of incentive</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.970" end="00:11:03.949" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll go larger past incentive</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.459" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">so kind of diving into systems of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.949" end="00:11:12.589" style="s2">incentive more mmm-hmm if as there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:15.740" style="s2">more humans than there have ever been</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.589" end="00:11:18.620" style="s2">and exponentially more and the impact</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.740" end="00:11:20.900" style="s2">per capita capacity of the humans is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.620" end="00:11:23.000" style="s2">also been on an exponential curve and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.900" end="00:11:26.570" style="s2">it&#39;s an exponential curve point that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.000" end="00:11:29.390" style="s2">reaching escape velocity you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.570" end="00:11:31.190" style="s2">kind of metaphorically say we are</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.820" end="00:11:42.860" style="s2">how do we deal with that youyou kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:44.930" style="s2">can&#39;t put the technological curve cat&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.860" end="00:11:48.370" style="s2">back in the back that&#39;s an impossible</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.370" end="00:11:53.750" style="s2">fail scenarios on what we call</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.070" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">civilization right now so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.750" end="00:12:01.329" style="s2">come up with adaptive capacities in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:12:06.260" style="s2">factoring for that level of technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.329" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">and so if you think about as we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.260" end="00:12:10.130" style="s2">that much capacity to affect stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.959" end="00:12:11.930" style="s2">there&#39;s that many of us affecting stuff</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.629" end="00:15:03.559" style="s2">incentives are misaligned has never and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.849" end="00:15:07.579" style="s2">will never lastingly work you can get</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.559" end="00:15:09.559" style="s2">temporary blips that&#39;s about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.579" end="00:15:11.569" style="s2">you know what that looks like is if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.559" end="00:15:14.599" style="s2">want a world without war we can&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.979" end="00:15:26.629" style="s2">obvious you can&#39;t have the largest bloc</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.310" end="00:15:36.830" style="s2">continue right so its own continuance</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.339" end="00:15:40.580" style="s2">requires a reason for its existence so</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.830" end="00:15:42.649" style="s2">any model of lasting peace and</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.260" end="00:15:55.190" style="s2">have no chance of succeeding that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.300" end="00:15:58.820" style="s2">big deal because so far everything that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.190" end="00:16:00.320" style="s2">has tried to do peace American salvation</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.820" end="00:16:01.580" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been focused on that at all which</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.320" end="00:16:05.149" style="s2">means that none of those things that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.580" end="00:16:06.620" style="s2">had any chance of succeeding now then we</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.149" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">can also look at as long as you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.620" end="00:16:14.630" style="s2">separate balance sheets that have</p>

<p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:23.870" style="s2">ownership encourages war right because</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.100" end="00:16:26.060" style="s2">it ends up being we&#39;re fighting over</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.870" end="00:16:29.060" style="s2">things and fighting always in you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.060" end="00:16:32.900" style="s2">in a force dynamic at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.060" end="00:16:36.730" style="s2">and so can you have freedom from war as</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.900" end="00:16:37.970" style="s2">long as we have zero-sum game dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.730" end="00:16:40.550" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.970" end="00:16:42.470" style="s2">so this is you know not only do you not</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.550" end="00:16:43.970" style="s2">do you have to give it up a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.470" end="00:16:46.400" style="s2">military-industrial complex you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.970" end="00:16:47.810" style="s2">get rid of zero-sum games period because</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.400" end="00:16:50.540" style="s2">as long as you have zero-sum games</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.810" end="00:16:51.950" style="s2">we&#39;re losing at the game ends up meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.540" end="00:16:54.170" style="s2">can&#39;t support the people of your country</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.950" end="00:16:56.300" style="s2">adequately means losing the adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.170" end="00:16:58.070" style="s2">competitive power means all that then it</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.300" end="00:16:59.570" style="s2">is a survival to not lose at those games</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.070" end="00:17:02.089" style="s2">and which means military is gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.570" end="00:17:06.939" style="s2">and that means that you&#39;re gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.089" end="00:17:06.939" style="s2">doing the zero sum up thing of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.750" end="00:17:11.990" style="s2">arms races right to continue to maintain</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.049" end="00:26:17.579" style="s2">kind of processing systems right in</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.489" end="00:26:20.499" style="s2">animals what do you think about it those</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.579" end="00:26:23.379" style="s2">necessarily co-evolved because there</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.499" end="00:26:25.239" style="s2">would be no evolutionary advantage and a</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.929" end="00:26:36.940" style="s2">that it happened then we would have no</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.940" end="00:26:39.700" style="s2">adaptive right so would mean we do a lot</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.700" end="00:26:46.690" style="s2">so those three co-evolve</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:48.460" style="s2">and they define the organism right what</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.690" end="00:26:50.860" style="s2">happened with humans our capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.460" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">abstraction allowed us to see what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.860" end="00:26:54.070" style="s2">were doing in all those areas and build</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.070" end="00:26:58.570" style="s2">independent of each other so we started</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.500" end="00:27:01.000" style="s2">to as our tools group break open the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.570" end="00:27:03.010" style="s2">feedback loop so we started with mostly</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.000" end="00:27:05.710" style="s2">actuator tools right we hammer would</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.010" end="00:27:07.690" style="s2">extend their fist and plow would extend</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.690" end="00:27:12.970" style="s2">now to our fist is extended through the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">entire military industrial complex right</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.970" end="00:27:16.750" style="s2">and you know continental ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:19.150" style="s2">missiles are extension of that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.750" end="00:27:21.070" style="s2">and the entire industrial supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.150" end="00:27:22.809" style="s2">is a the extension our capacity to go</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.230" end="00:27:43.390" style="s2">internet and billions of pages of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.500" end="00:27:44.679" style="s2">everything from our you know from Hubble</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.450" end="00:27:51.130" style="s2">but there&#39;s more information than we can</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.130" end="00:27:55.720" style="s2">and synthesize together to actually know</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.140" end="00:27:57.549" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on anywhere so our</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.549" end="00:28:01.299" style="s2">sense of and then to the degree that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.830" end="00:28:03.070" style="s2">can make sense of things so we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.299" end="00:28:05.080" style="s2">extended our capacity technologically</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">real we don&#39;t have act on it right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.549" end="00:28:15.280" style="s2">basically we have broken open our</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">information processing systems and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.280" end="00:28:20.620" style="s2">is core to why we&#39;re not adaptive right</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.340" end="00:28:22.360" style="s2">its core to why we are doing quarterly</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.360" end="00:28:26.890" style="s2">extinction is because we don&#39;t factor</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.120" end="00:28:27.820" style="s2">what&#39;s happening well enough put all the</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.260" end="00:28:38.770" style="s2">some agents and the well-being of other</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.390" end="00:28:40.360" style="s2">agents in the comments since they</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.110" end="00:28:49.900" style="s2">actually another key part to say is when</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.530" end="00:28:52.840" style="s2">our capacity to affect each other was</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.900" end="00:28:54.850" style="s2">not existential the idea of winning a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.840" end="00:28:56.350" style="s2">win-lose game makes sense right let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.850" end="00:28:57.660" style="s2">make sure our military is better than</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.350" end="00:28:59.830" style="s2">there so we can actually win this thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.660" end="00:29:02.830" style="s2">when we both have nukes nobody can win</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.830" end="00:29:04.870" style="s2">right and the idea of being able to just</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.830" end="00:29:06.340" style="s2">beat them economically by we can cut</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.870" end="00:29:07.660" style="s2">down trees faster than they can and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.340" end="00:29:09.850" style="s2">actually just build up more economic</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.660" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">surplus when we weren&#39;t at risk of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.850" end="00:29:13.870" style="s2">cutting down all trees right or</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:16.210" style="s2">overfishing the entire ocean that made</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.870" end="00:29:18.370" style="s2">sense when lose games at our level of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.210" end="00:29:20.980" style="s2">power are all lose-lose games</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.370" end="00:29:23.110" style="s2">so basically win-lose has become an</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.980" end="00:29:24.760" style="s2">obsolete game theoretic model now we</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.110" end="00:29:27.310" style="s2">either have win win or we have lose lose</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.760" end="00:29:29.080" style="s2">and we have no space in between that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.310" end="00:29:30.580" style="s2">big deal to get that right and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.080" end="00:29:31.630" style="s2">that they weren&#39;t true before it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.580" end="00:29:32.770" style="s2">they were true at a certain level of</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.770" end="00:29:39.940" style="s2">and so we have to figure out the win-win</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.530" end="00:29:42.040" style="s2">games where anyone&#39;s incentive and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.940" end="00:29:44.260" style="s2">advantage is tied to collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.040" end="00:29:45.700" style="s2">advantage because if I go hurt somebody</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.260" end="00:29:47.380" style="s2">and I engendered their enmity and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.700" end="00:29:50.410" style="s2">have existential tech I myself</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.380" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">right if I go increase the speed at</p>

<p begin="00:29:56.020" end="00:30:00.400" style="s2">heading towards the tipping points of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.660" end="00:30:01.870" style="s2">chemical irreversibility of those peak</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.530" end="00:30:13.060" style="s2">is full incentive alignment and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.210" end="00:30:15.430" style="s2">requires so we can say you know come</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.900" end="00:31:29.860" style="s2">any of those you succeeded because you</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.940" end="00:31:32.230" style="s2">can only succeed at any of those by all</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.860" end="00:31:34.660" style="s2">of them succeeding but it&#39;s a fairly</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.300" end="00:31:41.380" style="s2">Commons and we succeeded that way</p>

<p begin="00:31:53.350" end="00:31:56.290" style="s2">and make sure that the action is that</p>
