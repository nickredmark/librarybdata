<p begin="00:00:50.940" end="00:00:55.170" style="s2">share his latest thoughts on the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.370" end="00:00:59.040" style="s2">meaning crisis and how it relates to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.170" end="00:01:01.460" style="s2">this unfolding kovat 19 situation at</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.040" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">first I suggested to John we call this</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.460" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">meeting the the meaning opportunity than</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">the meeting Kairos mainly because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">been hearing a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">circles John and I run in saying that</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:14.040" style="s2">they have a new sense of meaning in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:16.979" style="s2">moment when I mentioned that to John</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.040" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">John crudely suggested that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.979" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">careful in conflating what feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:23.550" style="s2">meaningful to what feels urgent hence</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">hand it over to John and how this</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.909" end="00:01:32.330" style="s2">session works today after he shares his</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.650" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.330" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll ask him some questions and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">open up for the group for questions if</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">you have a question write it in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">box and I will unmute you and then just</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:48.840" style="s2">read your question to John if you prefer</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">I read your question then just indicate</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:54.690" style="s2">that when you write it in the chat box</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:57.450" style="s2">and we&#39;ll go for about 60 minutes if it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.690" end="00:02:00.030" style="s2">goes a little bit over maybe 75 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.450" end="00:02:03.510" style="s2">if that&#39;s okay with everyone so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:06.290" style="s2">being said I will hand it over to John</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.510" end="00:02:06.290" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.980" end="00:02:20.330" style="s2">let&#39;s see I might have to mute you John</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.659" end="00:02:23.510" style="s2">hold on can you meet yourself right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.330" end="00:02:26.360" style="s2">John under yourself me now yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:29.510" style="s2">hear you great great okay excellent</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.360" end="00:02:32.450" style="s2">we had me both uses so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.510" end="00:02:39.769" style="s2">inviting me Peter and I&#39;m very intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.450" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">by the question the coming up for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.769" end="00:02:50.900" style="s2">right now and so I guess what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:52.970" style="s2">do is explore what&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.900" end="00:02:56.359" style="s2">and how it might be intersecting with</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.970" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">the meeting crisis so one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.359" end="00:03:03.980" style="s2">comes to mind is that one thing we might</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">expect is that people are experiencing a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.980" end="00:03:07.879" style="s2">lot of reciprocal narrowing their lives</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">are getting narrowed their agency and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.879" end="00:03:12.920" style="s2">their flexibility is narrowing um</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:15.709" style="s2">they&#39;re experiencing kind of dama side</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.920" end="00:03:17.209" style="s2">in which a lot of places that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.709" end="00:03:20.680" style="s2">thought of as their home and where they</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.209" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">belong where they worked are getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.680" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">truncated and of course that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:28.599" style="s2">happening and I&#39;m talking to people that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:31.700" style="s2">are experiencing this rather intensely</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.599" end="00:03:34.639" style="s2">we might also see people commenting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.700" end="00:03:39.950" style="s2">experience this and a really challenging</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.639" end="00:03:46.069" style="s2">manner in that they&#39;re being sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.950" end="00:03:51.410" style="s2">thrown back onto the subjectivity in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.069" end="00:03:53.209" style="s2">way that could call the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.410" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">subjectivity from Descartes on has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.209" end="00:03:57.579" style="s2">so central to us that&#39;s had such</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:04:02.209" style="s2">normally a normative Authority for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.579" end="00:04:05.480" style="s2">and finding that the that subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.209" end="00:04:08.049" style="s2">does know I have that much resources to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.480" end="00:04:12.620" style="s2">provide them with what they need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.049" end="00:04:15.199" style="s2">confront the radical changes both the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.620" end="00:04:16.760" style="s2">immediate ones and potentially the more</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.199" end="00:04:21.340" style="s2">abstract long-term ones that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.760" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">facing so we could see that happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.340" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">we could see as Peter mentioned people</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:30.970" style="s2">all expressing a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:32.680" style="s2">meaningfulness coming out and this could</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.970" end="00:04:36.430" style="s2">be due to a couple of things this could</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.680" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">be due to just the urgency we could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.430" end="00:04:40.740" style="s2">dropping down Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:43.870" style="s2">needs and we&#39;re actually really not</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.740" end="00:04:46.360" style="s2">dealing with meaning in life issues</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.870" end="00:04:48.729" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with solving a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.360" end="00:04:50.229" style="s2">concrete problems and so our</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.729" end="00:04:52.930" style="s2">problem-solving machinery is getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.229" end="00:04:54.610" style="s2">sort of current satisfaction that could</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.930" end="00:04:57.130" style="s2">be happening and that could be part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.610" end="00:04:58.919" style="s2">what I was alluding to when I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.130" end="00:05:04.870" style="s2">to Peter we might be confusing urgency</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.919" end="00:05:06.729" style="s2">with meaning it could be that as people</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.870" end="00:05:08.800" style="s2">are being crunched downward and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.729" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">losing a lot of the things and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.800" end="00:05:13.810" style="s2">more of a crooked Guardian point it kept</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">us busy and distracted and invest in</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.810" end="00:05:18.460" style="s2">things that we thought would give us a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:20.650" style="s2">sense of meaning and happiness we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.460" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve discovered perhaps that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.650" end="00:05:27.190" style="s2">lose a lot of this and we are forced</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:29.470" style="s2">into the interpersonal relationships</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.190" end="00:05:32.229" style="s2">which is what we&#39;re doing right now as</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.470" end="00:05:33.970" style="s2">being the locus where we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.229" end="00:05:35.020" style="s2">satisfy our need for meaning we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.970" end="00:05:37.599" style="s2">finding that this is actually a better</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.020" end="00:05:39.789" style="s2">place to try and find meaning than the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.599" end="00:05:41.590" style="s2">other things we were doing before so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.789" end="00:05:43.960" style="s2">could be experiencing an increased of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.590" end="00:05:46.570" style="s2">meaning because of a recovery of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.960" end="00:05:49.930" style="s2">being mode that is actually present in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.570" end="00:05:54.220" style="s2">dialog we could be covering recovering</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.930" end="00:05:59.229" style="s2">meaning because we and I&#39;ve seen people</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.220" end="00:06:01.660" style="s2">doing this we fall into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.229" end="00:06:05.380" style="s2">nostalgia a myth or what I might call a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.660" end="00:06:09.610" style="s2">mythological nostalgia the virus is kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.380" end="00:06:11.849" style="s2">of like you know a Greek or an Old</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.610" end="00:06:15.190" style="s2">Testament deity it&#39;s this pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.849" end="00:06:17.289" style="s2">ubiquitous thing out there chaotically</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.190" end="00:06:19.240" style="s2">sort of it&#39;s like a hyper object to use</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.289" end="00:06:21.220" style="s2">Morton&#39;s term moving through the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.240" end="00:06:24.220" style="s2">and just and changing and altering</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.220" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">things but in an abstract way and behind</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.220" end="00:06:28.450" style="s2">the scenes and it seems to be demanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:30.580" style="s2">a purity code from us a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.450" end="00:06:32.890" style="s2">purity code it feels a lot like an Old</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.580" end="00:06:34.840" style="s2">Testament deity and so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.890" end="00:06:35.230" style="s2">nostalgia and let&#39;s not forget that this</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.840" end="00:06:36.580" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.230" end="00:06:38.710" style="s2">deeply woven whether or not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.580" end="00:06:40.600" style="s2">religious is deeply woven into our</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.710" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar so people</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.600" end="00:06:45.250" style="s2">might be picking up on that and finding</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:47.800" style="s2">the fact that they&#39;re in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.250" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">mythological narrative very meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.800" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">to them people might be finding it</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.460" end="00:06:57.640" style="s2">meaningful precisely because they think</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:06:59.920" style="s2">this has provided the final evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.640" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">the need for their particular pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.920" end="00:07:04.150" style="s2">religious ideological utopia which they</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:06.310" style="s2">are a certain is on the horizon there</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.150" end="00:07:09.760" style="s2">and much like the people that Frankel</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.310" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">talked about in in the camps who were</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.760" end="00:07:13.990" style="s2">certain of when they were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:16.540" style="s2">liberated and then they of course turned</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.990" end="00:07:18.340" style="s2">out to be the people once the date had</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.869" end="00:09:17.239" style="s2">because I think it is highly probable</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.529" end="00:09:40.939" style="s2">do not think it will be a merely</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.670" end="00:09:52.279" style="s2">causes sort of horrific exposure to the</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.939" end="00:10:01.879" style="s2">of thing I&#39;d like to explore if he does</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.579" end="00:10:04.009" style="s2">great so I&#39;ll warm drum up with some</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.879" end="00:10:05.509" style="s2">questions if you have questions you</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.009" end="00:10:06.860" style="s2">start writing in the chat box and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.509" end="00:10:11.899" style="s2">I&#39;ll call you up or read it on your</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.860" end="00:10:13.549" style="s2">behalf so my first question John so John</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.899" end="00:10:15.170" style="s2">and I have a regular circling practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.549" end="00:10:17.089" style="s2">and I only have spoke to you once and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.170" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">our practice kind of is on hold at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.089" end="00:10:22.459" style="s2">moment so just to get in like a really</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:23.689" style="s2">embodied state I&#39;m curious how since it</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.459" end="00:10:25.730" style="s2">started dawning on the collective</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.689" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">unconscious that this is was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.730" end="00:10:31.339" style="s2">this is a big deal how did it affect you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.980" end="00:10:35.049" style="s2">personally and in the bodied sense so</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.339" end="00:10:38.749" style="s2">that&#39;s very good very good question</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.049" end="00:10:41.569" style="s2">so part of the way that became very</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.749" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">salient to me was the extra stressor on</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.569" end="00:10:47.809" style="s2">me so one part of it is just my own sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:52.309" style="s2">of apprehension about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.809" end="00:10:53.779" style="s2">part of it was picking up on the stress</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.309" end="00:10:56.239" style="s2">it was inducing in the people that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.779" end="00:10:59.780" style="s2">care a lot about because they faced real</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.239" end="00:11:03.540" style="s2">risk in important ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.780" end="00:11:07.320" style="s2">and part of it was also an existential</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.540" end="00:11:11.640" style="s2">issue because I was struggling to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.320" end="00:11:14.010" style="s2">understand how to be rational in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.640" end="00:11:16.950" style="s2">face of so much uncertainty and so much</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.010" end="00:11:18.990" style="s2">shifting information I was keenly aware</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.950" end="00:11:21.630" style="s2">of the fact that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.990" end="00:11:24.180" style="s2">representative bias and the confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.630" end="00:11:25.980" style="s2">bias and their you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.180" end="00:11:28.710" style="s2">availability heuristic we&#39;re kicking in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.980" end="00:11:29.850" style="s2">and causing me to give wildly</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.710" end="00:11:33.630" style="s2">inappropriate judgments of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.850" end="00:11:37.800" style="s2">probability of things and I was also</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.630" end="00:11:41.910" style="s2">aware of the fact that it was difficult</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.800" end="00:11:43.650" style="s2">for me to devote the time needed in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.910" end="00:11:47.370" style="s2">order to determine the plausibility of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.650" end="00:11:49.740" style="s2">some of the information I was given and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.370" end="00:11:52.920" style="s2">I was also aware of the fact that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.740" end="00:11:55.050" style="s2">was not something for which I could</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.920" end="00:11:57.660" style="s2">merely sort of wait because of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.050" end="00:11:59.930" style="s2">urgency of the risk and my actions could</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.660" end="00:12:03.390" style="s2">definitely put other people at risk so</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.930" end="00:12:08.490" style="s2">my substantial issue will as sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.390" end="00:12:10.920" style="s2">competition with the stressors and also</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.490" end="00:12:13.020" style="s2">the concern I have for the people that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.920" end="00:12:15.980" style="s2">care about and who are in my care and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.020" end="00:12:19.410" style="s2">what that has resulted personally for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.980" end="00:12:23.670" style="s2">is an elevation of my Meniere&#39;s disease</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.410" end="00:12:27.690" style="s2">in my left ear which has been very</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.670" end="00:12:30.410" style="s2">troubling and trying for me and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.690" end="00:12:34.290" style="s2">had to do quite a bit to moderate that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.410" end="00:12:37.830" style="s2">and I&#39;ve also decided the way I can take</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.290" end="00:12:40.260" style="s2">action is to take all of the reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.830" end="00:12:42.860" style="s2">precautions that are being advised to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.260" end="00:12:44.700" style="s2">from people I respect both personally</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.860" end="00:12:46.770" style="s2">because they have the rent of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.700" end="00:12:48.780" style="s2">requisite medical and health training</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.770" end="00:12:51.960" style="s2">and from the scientific community and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.780" end="00:12:54.180" style="s2">then beyond that turn to what can I do</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.960" end="00:12:55.410" style="s2">to make a difference which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.180" end="00:12:56.760" style="s2">reasons why I&#39;m here right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.410" end="00:12:59.970" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;ve started</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.760" end="00:13:03.050" style="s2">teaching my meditation course online for</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.970" end="00:13:04.620" style="s2">free I started that on Monday and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.050" end="00:13:06.570" style="s2">phenomenologically what that has meant</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.620" end="00:13:09.270" style="s2">for me in terms of embodiment is my</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.570" end="00:13:12.150" style="s2">ability to take action in a way that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.270" end="00:13:12.590" style="s2">being told by others is mattering to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.150" end="00:13:14.510" style="s2">them and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.590" end="00:13:19.790" style="s2">making a difference has significantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.510" end="00:13:22.790" style="s2">reduced my stress so and then I came to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.790" end="00:13:24.710" style="s2">a decision point this came out in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.790" end="00:13:28.130" style="s2">discussion I had with Andrew Sweeney and</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.270" end="00:13:48.110" style="s2">place where I have to expose myself to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.810" end="00:13:50.600" style="s2">biological risk because principles that</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.930" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">exploring of course in one sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.420" end="00:14:31.970" style="s2">connected to the religion that&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.970" end="00:14:38.870" style="s2">talking about but it&#39;s also connected</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:40.850" style="s2">with giving people a formulation for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.870" end="00:14:42.830" style="s2">kind of deeper response to what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.850" end="00:14:46.580" style="s2">on here and this is an idea of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.830" end="00:14:47.870" style="s2">reformulate if I&#39;m not quite happy with</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.580" end="00:14:50.810" style="s2">the next adjective I&#39;m going to use but</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.870" end="00:14:53.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the best ones from right now try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.810" end="00:14:54.980" style="s2">reformulate a post religious sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.210" end="00:14:57.530" style="s2">faith what I call Socratic faith and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.980" end="00:15:00.350" style="s2">what does that look like and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.530" end="00:15:03.800" style="s2">much this idea of shifting faith from</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.350" end="00:15:07.990" style="s2">some sort of closure and conviction arm</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.800" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">in instead onto this idea of an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.990" end="00:15:15.980" style="s2">um continuity of contact with an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:21.530" style="s2">unfolding process within reality such</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.980" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">that one is able to sense a Kairos when</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.530" end="00:15:26.259" style="s2">it&#39;s able to sense the course of events</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:30.040" style="s2">and one develops</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.259" end="00:15:34.239" style="s2">a always emerging always evolving</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.040" end="00:15:36.429" style="s2">finesse with how to steer one&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.239" end="00:15:37.869" style="s2">through that and so we&#39;re trying to come</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.429" end="00:15:39.669" style="s2">up with because this is of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.869" end="00:15:42.850" style="s2">exemplified in the Socratic dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.669" end="00:15:46.029" style="s2">the way Socrates is always you know a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.850" end="00:15:47.829" style="s2">lover of wisdom in in on the course of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.029" end="00:15:50.589" style="s2">wisdom but he never claims any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.829" end="00:15:52.299" style="s2">completion or closure upon it and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.589" end="00:15:55.229" style="s2">can see the way think he&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.299" end="00:15:58.779" style="s2">follow the argument wherever it goes and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.229" end="00:16:01.029" style="s2">so that kind of faith I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.779" end="00:16:03.489" style="s2">kind of faith we need right now and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.029" end="00:16:05.859" style="s2">I&#39;m exploring it precisely because of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.489" end="00:16:08.829" style="s2">what we talked about already earlier I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.859" end="00:16:11.169" style="s2">concerned about the kinds of faith that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.829" end="00:16:14.109" style="s2">might be triggered right now obviously</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.169" end="00:16:17.919" style="s2">there&#39;s you know two kinds of nostalgic</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.109" end="00:16:21.239" style="s2">faith one is the faith in like I say the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.919" end="00:16:24.549" style="s2">mythological God demonic God out there</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.239" end="00:16:26.709" style="s2">another is a nostalgia for let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.549" end="00:16:28.839" style="s2">get back to normal as fast as we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.709" end="00:16:31.689" style="s2">let&#39;s just get back to normal as fast as</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.839" end="00:16:33.459" style="s2">we can and also the utopic faith the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.689" end="00:16:35.829" style="s2">person who is convinced they have</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.459" end="00:16:37.989" style="s2">closure now because they have certainty</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.829" end="00:16:40.869" style="s2">as to where the future is going and how</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.989" end="00:16:44.499" style="s2">it&#39;s going to unfold and I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.869" end="00:16:47.139" style="s2">those kinds of faiths are potentially</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.499" end="00:16:49.480" style="s2">very maladaptive and so part of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.139" end="00:16:51.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to do is stitch</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.480" end="00:16:54.279" style="s2">together my own phenomenology in the in</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.970" end="00:16:56.259" style="s2">the distress that I&#39;ve been facing with</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.279" end="00:16:58.689" style="s2">that those theoretical concerns in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.259" end="00:17:00.730" style="s2">discussions but having with Jordan yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.689" end="00:17:02.799" style="s2">that&#39;s really really good and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.730" end="00:17:04.389" style="s2">like in his liminal space and merging</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.799" end="00:17:06.370" style="s2">culture wars happening with those</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.389" end="00:17:09.220" style="s2">narratives that you just mentioned yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.370" end="00:17:10.629" style="s2">yes you can already see it happening one</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.220" end="00:17:11.799" style="s2">of the things I was worried about and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.629" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">Chris and I have spoken about this we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.799" end="00:17:16.299" style="s2">already seen the emergence of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:20.289" style="s2">theories that are starting to gain</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.299" end="00:17:22.779" style="s2">traction as a way of of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.289" end="00:17:25.959" style="s2">explain as I and I you know I personally</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.779" end="00:17:27.879" style="s2">had one thrown at me I was I did a talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.959" end="00:17:30.789" style="s2">with Greg on reeks we just posted it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.879" end="00:17:32.710" style="s2">you know one person was basically you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.789" end="00:17:34.269" style="s2">know the invective was that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.710" end="00:17:36.279" style="s2">intellectuals and the scientists and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.269" end="00:17:39.490" style="s2">theorists like me that have actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.279" end="00:17:42.280" style="s2">brought us into this situation right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.490" end="00:17:43.690" style="s2">so oh it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.280" end="00:17:48.280" style="s2">dangerous that we start getting into</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.690" end="00:17:51.460" style="s2">this kind of conspiratorial narrative so</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.280" end="00:17:53.890" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna follow people to read out</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.460" end="00:17:55.030" style="s2">their questions again we have about 60</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.890" end="00:17:57.880" style="s2">people on this chat so we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.030" end="00:17:59.290" style="s2">get to all the questions and if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.880" end="00:18:00.820" style="s2">didn&#39;t indicate that you wanted me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.290" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">read it out then just unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.820" end="00:18:07.179" style="s2">and then ask your question to John so</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:09.190" style="s2">the first question is Jordan you talked</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.179" end="00:18:10.840" style="s2">about a civil or silver lining if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.190" end="00:18:14.710" style="s2">can unmute yourself and just ask your</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.840" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">question to John sure Hey</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.710" end="00:18:18.820" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna quickly find it so my</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.140" style="s2">question is basically do you think</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.820" end="00:18:21.700" style="s2">although this is a bit of a chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.140" end="00:18:25.620" style="s2">statement but do you think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.700" end="00:18:28.600" style="s2">somewhat of a silver lining in that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.620" end="00:18:32.770" style="s2">instant immediacy of everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.600" end="00:18:34.990" style="s2">happening relative to the ordinary sorts</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.770" end="00:18:36.370" style="s2">of concerns that we&#39;re being told to to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.990" end="00:18:37.240" style="s2">be thinking about all the time for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.370" end="00:18:40.120" style="s2">media and so on</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.240" end="00:18:42.900" style="s2">maybe the silver lining is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.120" end="00:18:44.950" style="s2">somewhat of like a relief to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.900" end="00:18:46.900" style="s2">consensus addiction or certainty</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.950" end="00:18:48.490" style="s2">addiction which i think is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.900" end="00:18:50.830" style="s2">things that really drives people to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.490" end="00:18:53.080" style="s2">attached to these old like legacy</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.830" end="00:18:55.240" style="s2">sense-making or like information</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.080" end="00:18:58.120" style="s2">laundering infrastructures right right</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.240" end="00:19:04.290" style="s2">right I think I think that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.120" end="00:19:07.420" style="s2">think the capacity for this to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.290" end="00:19:09.460" style="s2">the obvious nosov common sense which how</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.420" end="00:19:14.410" style="s2">I would put what you&#39;re saying and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.460" end="00:19:19.360" style="s2">way that has been often raised to an</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.410" end="00:19:21.610" style="s2">almost sacred level in our discourse the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.360" end="00:19:26.410" style="s2">way that&#39;s invoked and it&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.610" end="00:19:29.230" style="s2">cover for as you said you know very well</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.410" end="00:19:31.420" style="s2">established ways of thinking often also</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.230" end="00:19:33.700" style="s2">cover for very bias for the operation of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.420" end="00:19:36.460" style="s2">bias and trying to protect it from any</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.700" end="00:19:41.110" style="s2">critical examination that&#39;s also at work</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.460" end="00:19:43.690" style="s2">I think the the virus has the the real I</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.110" end="00:19:45.880" style="s2">think it is doing this so it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.690" end="00:19:48.610" style="s2">the potential but it has an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.880" end="00:19:51.640" style="s2">potential that&#39;s being actualized to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.610" end="00:19:53.590" style="s2">challenge that that Authority in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.640" end="00:19:55.870" style="s2">profound way and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.590" end="00:19:57.419" style="s2">that in and of itself I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.870" end="00:19:59.620" style="s2">that in itself is a silver lining</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.419" end="00:20:01.299" style="s2">because it&#39;s like criticality in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.620" end="00:20:03.309" style="s2">system we&#39;re destabilizing the system</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.299" end="00:20:04.990" style="s2">and that of course is what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.309" end="00:20:06.850" style="s2">get out with this Kairos it opens up</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.990" end="00:20:10.510" style="s2">possibilities but it opens up multiple</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.850" end="00:20:12.190" style="s2">possibilities so when people get their</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.510" end="00:20:14.860" style="s2">worldview challenged one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.190" end="00:20:17.320" style="s2">they can do is double down even so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.860" end="00:20:19.690" style="s2">know the you know the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.320" end="00:20:21.669" style="s2">evidence of cults right so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.690" end="00:20:24.760" style="s2">cult and it will prophesy the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.669" end="00:20:26.169" style="s2">world and that that prophecy will gain a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.760" end="00:20:28.450" style="s2">certain number of adherents and then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.169" end="00:20:30.039" style="s2">prophecy fails and what you what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.450" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">might expect is well that would cause</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.039" end="00:20:34.690" style="s2">the cult to bleed away but what actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:38.230" style="s2">happens is the cult doubles down and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.690" end="00:20:40.330" style="s2">expands in size the doubling down they</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.230" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">say oh no we were wrong and it&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.330" end="00:20:46.149" style="s2">phenomenon that people you&#39;d think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:48.490" style="s2">the failure would be enough to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.149" end="00:20:51.370" style="s2">people to abandon and reject but instead</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.490" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">they double down and that doubling down</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.370" end="00:20:55.299" style="s2">gives them a kind of attractive</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:58.029" style="s2">competent confidence that sucks people</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.299" end="00:21:00.130" style="s2">in uh and so this in fact reliably</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.029" end="00:21:02.230" style="s2">happens it usually takes a third or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.130" end="00:21:03.580" style="s2">fourth failure for the for the movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.230" end="00:21:06.909" style="s2">to fall apart which is why I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.580" end="00:21:09.880" style="s2">well I think the next pandemic could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.909" end="00:21:11.950" style="s2">the really crunchy one now I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.880" end="00:21:13.929" style="s2">have any foreknowledge of this it could</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.950" end="00:21:17.110" style="s2">go the way you&#39;re suggesting it could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.929" end="00:21:19.390" style="s2">just this wakes people up and they see</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.110" end="00:21:21.850" style="s2">the silver lining but like I said</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.390" end="00:21:23.409" style="s2">there&#39;s clear evidence for and I gave</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.850" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">you some of it that people can go the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.409" end="00:21:30.390" style="s2">other way and that&#39;s a concern for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:39.789" style="s2">hmm so Alex s you had a question about</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.390" end="00:21:43.450" style="s2">death and Kairos yeah can you guys hear</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.789" end="00:21:47.610" style="s2">me yep great thanks Peter and thanks</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.450" end="00:21:49.539" style="s2">John for uh for your talk I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.610" end="00:21:52.690" style="s2">wondering if you could talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.539" end="00:21:55.799" style="s2">about the meaning of Kairos and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.690" end="00:21:58.419" style="s2">especially in the present moment and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.799" end="00:22:00.070" style="s2">especially as it relates to the notion</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.419" end="00:22:03.970" style="s2">of death so currently we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.070" end="00:22:06.970" style="s2">situation where we&#39;re facing you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.970" end="00:22:07.210" style="s2">the possibility of death is in view kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.970" end="00:22:09.730" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.210" end="00:22:11.110" style="s2">collectively also individually and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.730" end="00:22:12.610" style="s2">know the probabilities</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.110" end="00:22:15.070" style="s2">you know are different for different age</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.610" end="00:22:18.779" style="s2">groups and so on but that is kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.070" end="00:22:21.159" style="s2">the air yeah I think that in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.779" end="00:22:24.610" style="s2">existentialist tradition which are kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.159" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">of alluded to earlier that connection is</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.610" end="00:22:30.100" style="s2">drawn between you know kind of authentic</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:32.380" style="s2">existence and Heidegger essentially yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.100" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">yeah how many if you could say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.380" end="00:22:37.990" style="s2">more about that and especially as it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:40.480" style="s2">relates to you know trying to have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.990" end="00:22:43.890" style="s2">more rational wise approach to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.480" end="00:22:47.289" style="s2">situation you know rather than going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.890" end="00:22:50.020" style="s2">yeah thanks that&#39;s a great question and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.289" end="00:22:51.789" style="s2">I want to answer to that and IIIi think</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.020" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">you&#39;re one of the things that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.789" end="00:22:54.690" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:22:58.179" style="s2">mr. does this in her book beyond faked</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.690" end="00:23:01.090" style="s2">and she actually holds out stoicism in</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.179" end="00:23:04.750" style="s2">connection with this because the we we</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.090" end="00:23:07.419" style="s2">have this word fatal and we associate it</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.750" end="00:23:09.370" style="s2">with death in particular but what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.419" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">come to do is it&#39;s like the way we think</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.370" end="00:23:14.260" style="s2">of mad as being angry we&#39;re mad of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:15.309" style="s2">course means losing your sanity and one</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.260" end="00:23:19.529" style="s2">of the things that could cause you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.309" end="00:23:21.820" style="s2">lose your sanity yeah is your anger a</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.529" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">fatality originally meant the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.820" end="00:23:28.750" style="s2">reality moves of its own accord the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:30.700" style="s2">hands of fate in that sense no not in</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.750" end="00:23:32.620" style="s2">some magical sense but in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.700" end="00:23:34.450" style="s2">the universe is unfolding for things</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.620" end="00:23:36.330" style="s2">beyond our can and it will behave the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.450" end="00:23:40.899" style="s2">way it&#39;s going to behave for its own</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.330" end="00:23:45.460" style="s2">reasons right and and so death was just</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.899" end="00:23:50.890" style="s2">one very significant instance of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.460" end="00:23:52.510" style="s2">fatality of all things that and visitor</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.890" end="00:23:55.419" style="s2">talks about the fact that stoicism tried</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.510" end="00:23:57.700" style="s2">to pull apart that by making a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.419" end="00:23:59.620" style="s2">distinction between the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.700" end="00:24:01.960" style="s2">largely in the grip of nature and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.620" end="00:24:04.870" style="s2">the meaning we give them which has to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.960" end="00:24:06.309" style="s2">you know with our cognitive processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.870" end="00:24:09.669" style="s2">and our framing and pulling those apart</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.309" end="00:24:14.669" style="s2">she said was one of the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.669" end="00:24:18.279" style="s2">deepest ways of trying to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.669" end="00:24:21.250" style="s2">be able to accept the fatality of all</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.279" end="00:24:24.190" style="s2">things because the fatality actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.250" end="00:24:26.650" style="s2">points to a deep confusion between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.190" end="00:24:28.840" style="s2">meaning and the event now the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.650" end="00:24:31.150" style="s2">interesting thing about that is you see</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.840" end="00:24:34.300" style="s2">of course this being taken up by both</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.150" end="00:24:39.010" style="s2">Nietzsche and kirkegaard especially and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.300" end="00:24:41.710" style="s2">the way in which I think we can stitch</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.010" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">together this notion of fatality and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.710" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">and the themes you brought out around</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:49.060" style="s2">things like authenticity is that um</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:51.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which the fatality of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.060" end="00:24:53.650" style="s2">all things is present - with us always</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.070" end="00:24:55.450" style="s2">which is our mortality and our mortality</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.650" end="00:24:58.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean the event of our death it</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.450" end="00:25:00.700" style="s2">means that like everything else we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.060" end="00:25:02.650" style="s2">deep even our own bodies and you see</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.700" end="00:25:04.390" style="s2">this in stoicism right even our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.650" end="00:25:07.330" style="s2">bodies are subject to that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.390" end="00:25:10.180" style="s2">fatality that&#39;s what the virus can show</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.330" end="00:25:12.760" style="s2">we think we&#39;ve made health into a god</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.180" end="00:25:16.120" style="s2">and we are the masters of our health</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.760" end="00:25:18.340" style="s2">well no we&#39;re not no or not right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.120" end="00:25:20.530" style="s2">we can make we can move things around</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.340" end="00:25:22.210" style="s2">and we can share probabilities but</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.530" end="00:25:25.090" style="s2">whatever narrative we have for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.210" end="00:25:28.630" style="s2">in our bodies the the universe is going</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.090" end="00:25:31.810" style="s2">to unfold in our bodies independently of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.630" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">that narrative so the are the foot we</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.810" end="00:25:36.430" style="s2">can we can deal with the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:38.920" style="s2">first and primary ways we have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.430" end="00:25:41.140" style="s2">with the fatality of all things is we</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.920" end="00:25:44.260" style="s2">have to deal with it insofar as our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.140" end="00:25:46.510" style="s2">bodies our own Fame our own status which</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.260" end="00:25:48.520" style="s2">is our mortality which is different than</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.510" end="00:25:51.160" style="s2">just the event of our death and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.520" end="00:25:53.950" style="s2">one of the things that the virus can</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.160" end="00:25:57.040" style="s2">potentially do for us is make us step</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.950" end="00:26:00.190" style="s2">back and become mortals again which is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.040" end="00:26:02.770" style="s2">very different project than what we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.190" end="00:26:05.080" style="s2">tried to be for a long time through the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.770" end="00:26:08.590" style="s2">way we manipulate media and the image</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.080" end="00:26:09.970" style="s2">which is we we behave it act as if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.590" end="00:26:13.230" style="s2">immortal and then when it becomes clear</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.970" end="00:26:16.270" style="s2">that we are in fact mortal we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.230" end="00:26:19.180" style="s2">disenfranchised packaged away removed</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.270" end="00:26:21.970" style="s2">from media you know etc etc and I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.180" end="00:26:25.000" style="s2">instead if we could come to a place</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.970" end="00:26:27.900" style="s2">where we can reimburse our mortality I</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.000" end="00:26:30.490" style="s2">think that would be a good way for</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.900" end="00:26:33.190" style="s2">extending the notion of authenticity off</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.490" end="00:26:34.990" style="s2">of just being true to oneself which i</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.190" end="00:26:37.150" style="s2">think is a very poor</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.990" end="00:26:39.730" style="s2">framing of authenticity and get it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.150" end="00:26:42.820" style="s2">getting it back to living with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.730" end="00:26:45.370" style="s2">fatality of all things in as rational a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.820" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">manner as possible that&#39;s all I would</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.370" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">answer that question I jump in with just</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:53.950" style="s2">a quick follow-up please please so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.470" style="s2">wondering that would you would you align</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.950" end="00:26:58.600" style="s2">the existential tradition more or less</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.470" end="00:27:03.190" style="s2">with stoicism I don&#39;t need to say all</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.600" end="00:27:04.809" style="s2">stoic yeah well yes and no because you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.190" end="00:27:07.120" style="s2">know the Mutua is deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.809" end="00:27:10.660" style="s2">stoicism and you know in crooked art</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.120" end="00:27:12.730" style="s2">writes his PhD dissertation on Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.660" end="00:27:17.020" style="s2">so there&#39;s obviously at least a deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.730" end="00:27:19.000" style="s2">Socratic influence in crypto garden so</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.020" end="00:27:20.730" style="s2">both of the you know the Godfather&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.000" end="00:27:23.650" style="s2">existentialism I think are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.730" end="00:27:26.920" style="s2">influenced by this current however I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.650" end="00:27:30.270" style="s2">would not I would not identify stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.920" end="00:27:36.400" style="s2">with existentialism because</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.270" end="00:27:39.250" style="s2">existentialism I think and I sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.400" end="00:27:40.960" style="s2">mean the posts are trian sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.250" end="00:27:42.280" style="s2">existentialism not what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.960" end="00:27:43.330" style="s2">Heidegger because Heidegger is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.280" end="00:27:44.860" style="s2">different thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.330" end="00:27:46.300" style="s2">Heidi periods you know we are the beings</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.860" end="00:27:49.090" style="s2">whose being is in question that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.300" end="00:27:51.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a different thing but the the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.090" end="00:27:54.160" style="s2">the the strand that comes out later at</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.730" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">least one strand of existentialism that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.160" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">sort of became more prominent was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:04.179" style="s2">idea you know that our you know that our</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:05.620" style="s2">existence precedes our essence because</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.179" end="00:28:08.350" style="s2">we are the creatures who completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.620" end="00:28:10.570" style="s2">decided our essence so there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.350" end="00:28:12.760" style="s2">a shift from Heidegger from us being the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.570" end="00:28:16.830" style="s2">the beings whose being is in question to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.760" end="00:28:19.300" style="s2">us being the self defining beings and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.830" end="00:28:21.940" style="s2">stoicism I think is much more careful</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.300" end="00:28:25.270" style="s2">about that we&#39;re not completely self</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.140" end="00:28:40.020" style="s2">famously pointed out and so whereas</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:42.340" style="s2">self-definition gets becomes quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.020" end="00:28:44.340" style="s2">significant maybe even inflated in</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.730" end="00:29:14.140" style="s2">rationality that is the proper response</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.140" end="00:29:19.720" style="s2">that&#39;s how we pull them apart okay so</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.280" end="00:29:23.680" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna read this question on behalf</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.720" end="00:29:26.020" style="s2">of isaiah&#39;s you mentioned conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.680" end="00:29:28.750" style="s2">but I&#39;m wondering how we can as regular</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.020" end="00:29:31.270" style="s2">people relate to the elites at a moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.750" end="00:29:33.190" style="s2">like this it&#39;s it&#39;s becoming clear that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.270" end="00:29:34.630" style="s2">those more fortunate have quicker access</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.190" end="00:29:36.910" style="s2">to testing for the virus</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.630" end="00:29:42.190" style="s2">eg Prince Charles NBA players Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.910" end="00:29:45.880" style="s2">actors yep yep so this is always the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.190" end="00:29:47.230" style="s2">trick of grandness sorry I didn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.880" end="00:29:49.630" style="s2">trick in the sense of deception I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.230" end="00:29:54.400" style="s2">it in the sense of them you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.630" end="00:29:59.080" style="s2">the thing that requires finesse so how</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.400" end="00:30:04.360" style="s2">do you identify how do you distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.080" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">identifying bonafide socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.360" end="00:30:09.220" style="s2">let&#39;s use that as a broad socio</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:12.460" style="s2">political socio-economic in justices</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.220" end="00:30:16.810" style="s2">unfairness how do you distinguish them</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.460" end="00:30:22.870" style="s2">from conspiratorial thinking and and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.810" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">guess the idea well this is what I do I</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.870" end="00:30:28.900" style="s2">have a heuristic is that I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:31.690" style="s2">in in conspiracy theories until I get</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.900" end="00:30:34.360" style="s2">you know evidence of them that&#39;s as good</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.690" end="00:30:38.380" style="s2">as any scientific theory or at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.360" end="00:30:40.090" style="s2">moves in that direction so if you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.380" end="00:30:43.060" style="s2">here you know if you get undisputed</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.090" end="00:30:45.610" style="s2">evidence that people have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.060" end="00:30:47.920" style="s2">access which i think is happening no</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.610" end="00:30:49.900" style="s2">one&#39;s calling it into question there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.920" end="00:30:52.330" style="s2">no plausible alternative</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.900" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">explanation for the purported &#39;no sit</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.330" end="00:30:56.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t invoke any initially implausible</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:58.450" style="s2">entities in their own right</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.590" end="00:31:01.560" style="s2">it belongs to an already plausible</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.610" end="00:31:12.010" style="s2">then i think that&#39;s how you sort of make</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.400" end="00:31:14.230" style="s2">the decision so maybe i&#39;m what in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.010" end="00:31:16.870" style="s2">proposing is we reserve the term</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.230" end="00:31:21.910" style="s2">conspiracy theory or something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.870" end="00:31:24.670" style="s2">gains its exceptions primarily just</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.910" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">because it proposes a conspiracy that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.670" end="00:31:30.190" style="s2">makes sense of what is otherwise chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:31.960" style="s2">whereas coming to a conclusion from a</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.190" end="00:31:34.780" style="s2">lot of evidence and argumentation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.960" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">convergent are they plausible rationally</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.780" end="00:31:39.460" style="s2">excess of rationally criticized and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:41.230" style="s2">rationally accessible that certain</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.230" end="00:31:45.250" style="s2">unjustly and appropriately i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.900" end="00:31:47.890" style="s2">we should call that a conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.250" end="00:31:49.480" style="s2">at all i think we should say no we</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.890" end="00:31:51.280" style="s2">should say what it is we have good</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.480" end="00:31:53.680" style="s2">evidence that people are acting unjustly</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.280" end="00:31:55.900" style="s2">and that they should be criticized and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.680" end="00:31:58.450" style="s2">this is and and and then we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.900" end="00:32:01.050" style="s2">criticize the structures that have made</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.450" end="00:32:01.050" style="s2">it so easily</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.110" end="00:32:07.960" style="s2">doable for them to engage in such</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.740" end="00:32:10.410" style="s2">unfairness and manipulation that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.960" end="00:32:10.410" style="s2">i would say to that</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.340" end="00:32:17.570" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to read this on behalf of</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.319" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">rapture you know the moment where</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.420" end="00:35:17.300" style="s2">everything is like changing but for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:23.109" style="s2">the the Kairos is more a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.300" end="00:35:27.500" style="s2">reality where it is in a chain of of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.109" end="00:35:31.099" style="s2">salience of of meaning of synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.500" end="00:35:35.329" style="s2">where someone have it as a changing</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.099" end="00:35:38.329" style="s2">moment you follow me not completely I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.329" end="00:35:40.220" style="s2">not first of all a Kairos doesn&#39;t limit</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.329" end="00:35:43.190" style="s2">you to the apocalypse the apocalypse are</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.220" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">just a culminating Kairos it is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.190" end="00:35:49.700" style="s2">notion it comes out of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:52.190" style="s2">platonic Christian yeah it&#39;s about any</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:36:04.970" style="s2">I have the impression that at least I</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.349" end="00:36:08.510" style="s2">mean for our society it is this is if</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.510" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">said it is just abandon me we can see</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.390" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a small one there are gonna be many</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:21.290" style="s2">others but we are now in a synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:24.230" style="s2">of so many crises that we have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.290" end="00:36:27.589" style="s2">kicking the can down the road that this</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.230" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">is like the drop that is that is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.589" end="00:36:32.660" style="s2">feeling the jar you know and also I</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.660" end="00:36:40.940" style="s2">the urgency thing is that it&#39;s too fast</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:44.090" style="s2">to build to wisdom at this time for two</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.940" end="00:36:47.630" style="s2">reason first it&#39;s because we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.090" end="00:36:50.210" style="s2">it in in life like with so many</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.630" end="00:36:53.150" style="s2">information and it goes so quick so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.210" end="00:36:56.300" style="s2">have this reciprocal narrowing were you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.150" end="00:36:58.820" style="s2">just going time from time and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.300" end="00:37:04.820" style="s2">take the step back to see the big</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.820" end="00:37:08.330" style="s2">picture of the meta-crisis and also so</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.820" end="00:37:11.840" style="s2">so yeah I just leave it there and I let</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.330" end="00:37:16.190" style="s2">you comment because I see it as as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.840" end="00:37:19.460" style="s2">Kairos at least for for our time and my</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.190" end="00:37:21.350" style="s2">generation so thank you for explaining</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.460" end="00:37:24.740" style="s2">it because I have a better understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.350" end="00:37:26.840" style="s2">and yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think the I</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.740" end="00:37:31.550" style="s2">agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.840" end="00:37:33.640" style="s2">and if I presented it as otherwise I</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.550" end="00:37:36.280" style="s2">apologize because I might have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.640" end="00:37:40.060" style="s2">misleading I agree with you that I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.280" end="00:37:43.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a synchronicity to use near term</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.060" end="00:37:45.670" style="s2">between this particular biological</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.030" end="00:37:47.930" style="s2">crisis and the already existing</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.670" end="00:37:49.850" style="s2">meta-crisis I think you&#39;re right and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.930" end="00:37:51.560" style="s2">think it&#39;s in in that sense it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.850" end="00:37:53.510" style="s2">Kairos in the sense of also being a</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.560" end="00:37:55.730" style="s2">tipping point and here I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.510" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">like a dynamical systems where you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.730" end="00:38:00.140" style="s2">perturb a system for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:02.360" style="s2">and it can it can adaptively restructure</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.140" end="00:38:04.520" style="s2">but when the perturbations get too great</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.360" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">a coil is critical and it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.520" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">break and then that criticality is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:11.330" style="s2">real opportunity in a sense it because</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:14.150" style="s2">it can go one of two ways the system can</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.330" end="00:38:16.310" style="s2">collapse or that criticality actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.150" end="00:38:18.140" style="s2">breaks the structure up enough that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.310" end="00:38:21.800" style="s2">new structure can emerge out of it and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.140" end="00:38:26.090" style="s2">so it I agree that I think the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.800" end="00:38:27.830" style="s2">in that sense it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.090" end="00:38:29.570" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the you know the proverbial</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.830" end="00:38:34.700" style="s2">straw that&#39;s breaking the already</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.570" end="00:38:36.680" style="s2">overburdened camel&#39;s back the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.700" end="00:38:40.970" style="s2">about the urgency because it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.680" end="00:38:43.520" style="s2">to cultivate wisdom right now I</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.970" end="00:38:45.260" style="s2">understand yeah it&#39;s very difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.520" end="00:38:46.300" style="s2">people to engage in the practices and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.260" end="00:38:49.000" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.300" end="00:38:51.970" style="s2">giving in to kind of urgent short-term</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.000" end="00:38:54.069" style="s2">scarcity thinking is going to come very</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.970" end="00:38:55.569" style="s2">naturally and so it&#39;s I think it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.069" end="00:38:57.819" style="s2">to be a very significant challenge as</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.569" end="00:39:00.220" style="s2">you said to get people to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.819" end="00:39:03.220" style="s2">see the bigger picture like here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.220" end="00:39:04.839" style="s2">a lot of you know a lot of practices a</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.220" end="00:39:08.050" style="s2">lot of psycho technological practices</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.839" end="00:39:09.940" style="s2">are really important people a way to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.050" end="00:39:11.770" style="s2">this without having to argue at great</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.940" end="00:39:13.300" style="s2">length with people and we already have</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.770" end="00:39:15.700" style="s2">independent evidence from this control</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.300" end="00:39:17.369" style="s2">level theory is to get them practicing</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.700" end="00:39:19.990" style="s2">things like the stoic view from above</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.369" end="00:39:21.790" style="s2">that transformation of perspective all</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.990" end="00:39:24.369" style="s2">knowing really does have a huge impact</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.790" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">on people&#39;s propositional and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.369" end="00:39:29.950" style="s2">inferential thinking and it also opens</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.250" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">them up to a kind of reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.950" end="00:39:33.250" style="s2">it opens them up to a kind of wonder in</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:37.089" style="s2">which they&#39;re willing to call their</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.250" end="00:39:38.710" style="s2">worldview and their sense of identity</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.089" end="00:39:41.890" style="s2">into question precisely because of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.710" end="00:39:44.530" style="s2">way the practice alters what is normally</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.890" end="00:39:46.630" style="s2">an unchallenged salience landscape in</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.530" end="00:39:49.660" style="s2">which their own particular urgent</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.630" end="00:39:50.740" style="s2">narrative is super salient and blinding</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.660" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">them to the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.740" end="00:39:55.329" style="s2">now you understand I&#39;m not prophesying</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">that this is going to spread you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.329" end="00:39:59.020" style="s2">throughout the culture or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:40:01.270" style="s2">that but what I&#39;m saying is there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.020" end="00:40:03.550" style="s2">things we can offer people even in their</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.270" end="00:40:06.339" style="s2">urgency that are designed to work right</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.550" end="00:40:09.490" style="s2">now in the urgency and can ultimately be</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.339" end="00:40:14.290" style="s2">made conducive to and coherent with much</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.490" end="00:40:16.210" style="s2">more long-term rational processes thank</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.290" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">you thank you that was an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.210" end="00:40:20.230" style="s2">question and thank you for for</p>

<p begin="00:41:10.700" end="00:41:15.860" style="s2">now and the technology like zoom is</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.210" end="00:41:18.530" style="s2">keeping up with this pretty well and</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:32.870" style="s2">almost like a digital Church or it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:41:46.100" end="00:41:49.160" style="s2">think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.390" end="00:41:51.740" style="s2">you know and joy who&#39;s been talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.160" end="00:41:52.910" style="s2">about that Jordan Hall and he&#39;s perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.740" end="00:41:55.750" style="s2">the person to talk a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.910" end="00:41:59.540" style="s2">about he&#39;s talking about not only the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.750" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">way the virtual world can afford this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.540" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">he&#39;s also talking about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:05.330" style="s2">you know we might be able to get it to</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:07.220" style="s2">integrate with some machine learning to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.330" end="00:42:09.410" style="s2">really optimize the way in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.220" end="00:42:10.820" style="s2">connecting and the way we commit some of</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.350" end="00:42:19.070" style="s2">the technology I would like I would like</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.910" end="00:42:21.590" style="s2">to point out something it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.070" end="00:42:24.620" style="s2">connected to your question and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.590" end="00:42:26.930" style="s2">strengthens your point and this came up</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.620" end="00:42:30.110" style="s2">with somebody was talking it was just</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.930" end="00:42:32.060" style="s2">you know doing an online wisdom lecture</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.110" end="00:42:36.260" style="s2">for web of wisdom and this came up</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.060" end="00:42:38.660" style="s2">sort of this issue about that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.260" end="00:42:39.770" style="s2">technology does something there there it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.660" end="00:42:41.420" style="s2">brings with it a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.770" end="00:42:44.090" style="s2">difference that is actually really</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.420" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">important with and here&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.090" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">the phenomenological features that came</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:49.190" style="s2">up in the discussion I was having with</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:52.220" style="s2">this person notice how close your face</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.190" end="00:42:54.890" style="s2">is in terms of the size it fit it fills</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.890" end="00:42:57.230" style="s2">was that close to you and you mean you</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.300" end="00:42:59.600" style="s2">and I just met</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.230" end="00:43:01.580" style="s2">would be like oh but it&#39;s okay in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.600" end="00:43:03.320" style="s2">medium it&#39;s part of the grammar and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.580" end="00:43:06.170" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s this right there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.320" end="00:43:08.359" style="s2">kind of a phenomenological intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.170" end="00:43:11.300" style="s2">notice that also we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.359" end="00:43:12.740" style="s2">equidistant from each other because we</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.300" end="00:43:15.170" style="s2">you know because we&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.740" end="00:43:17.060" style="s2">spatially oriented we&#39;re and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.170" end="00:43:19.700" style="s2">this digital space where everybody sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.060" end="00:43:21.290" style="s2">of has equal access and that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.700" end="00:43:23.750" style="s2">really interesting phenomena because it</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.290" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">also right removes a lot of the typical</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.750" end="00:43:28.910" style="s2">ways in which people are marking</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:31.130" style="s2">identity and status by their spatial</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.910" end="00:43:33.050" style="s2">positioning that sort of removed and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.130" end="00:43:37.730" style="s2">it&#39;s put into the background in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.050" end="00:43:41.600" style="s2">way now I was talking about either way</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.730" end="00:43:42.770" style="s2">this really enhances the this technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.600" end="00:43:44.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not only what I&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.770" end="00:43:46.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not only the way the technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.840" end="00:43:49.820" style="s2">furthers the communication gives us</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.730" end="00:43:51.170" style="s2">access it&#39;s also transform it in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.820" end="00:43:54.020" style="s2">also transforming a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.170" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">experience in a profound way and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.020" end="00:43:58.850" style="s2">I suggested to her that&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:44:00.530" style="s2">suggestion I&#39;m making to you but I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.850" end="00:44:02.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.530" end="00:44:05.210" style="s2">us and people are also but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.600" end="00:44:06.680" style="s2">doing this before the crisis in our</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.210" end="00:44:08.330" style="s2">heritage is people sitting around a</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.680" end="00:44:10.940" style="s2">campfire because when people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.330" end="00:44:12.380" style="s2">circling around the campfire they sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.940" end="00:44:15.170" style="s2">of have that circular distance from each</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.380" end="00:44:17.090" style="s2">other and because of the way campfires</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.170" end="00:44:19.880" style="s2">their faces tend to be very well lit and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.090" end="00:44:21.109" style="s2">they all are oriented and Matt Rossano</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.880" end="00:44:23.030" style="s2">actually talks about that in</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.109" end="00:44:25.310" style="s2">Supernatural selection how that really</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.030" end="00:44:27.230" style="s2">probably drove our cognitive evolution</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.310" end="00:44:29.990" style="s2">in a very powerful way because we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.230" end="00:44:31.850" style="s2">fire across several species in a a drove</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.990" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">working memory it drove our orientation</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.850" end="00:44:37.190" style="s2">it probably he said we said we probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:39.050" style="s2">gained the ability to meditate from sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.190" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">of sharing the focus of the fire and</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.050" end="00:44:44.210" style="s2">then looking up in this intimate fashion</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:47.000" style="s2">to people&#39;s faces so I think we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.210" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">virtual camp firing or something like it</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.000" end="00:44:52.580" style="s2">right here right now and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:54.710" style="s2">just sort of the the the increased power</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.580" end="00:44:56.780" style="s2">of communication and connection</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.710" end="00:44:59.030" style="s2">I think the medium also has the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.780" end="00:45:02.359" style="s2">potential if properly used artistically</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.030" end="00:45:04.010" style="s2">and dialogic Lee to really tap in to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.359" end="00:45:07.030" style="s2">that phenomenological difference and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.010" end="00:45:11.270" style="s2">that primordial right association and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.030" end="00:45:13.700" style="s2">greatly empower what you&#39;re suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.270" end="00:45:14.750" style="s2">the ability for people find something</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.700" end="00:45:16.370" style="s2">more like a church because I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.750" end="00:45:18.260" style="s2">before there were ever any churches</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.370" end="00:45:21.050" style="s2">there was the religio around the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.260" end="00:45:22.750" style="s2">campfire for several species and for</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.050" end="00:45:25.430" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.750" end="00:45:27.590" style="s2">hmm thank you I just wanna add something</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.430" end="00:45:30.410" style="s2">I noticed with I have a meetup group and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.590" end="00:45:32.930" style="s2">we meet every two weeks and going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.410" end="00:45:35.000" style="s2">zoom has actually greatly improved our</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.930" end="00:45:36.080" style="s2">ability to have a meeting in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.000" end="00:45:37.700" style="s2">surprised me because I would have</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.080" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">thought you the opposite I was like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.700" end="00:45:41.840" style="s2">zooms not gonna work but everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:43.970" style="s2">seems much easier it flows this better</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.840" end="00:45:46.280" style="s2">way we&#39;re kind of jamming it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.970" end="00:45:49.220" style="s2">the way yes I think it&#39;s a campfire</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.280" end="00:45:51.320" style="s2">effect yeah I think I really do I&#39;m sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.220" end="00:45:55.340" style="s2">of trying to sort of coin that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.320" end="00:45:58.250" style="s2">virtual campfire effect and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.340" end="00:46:00.500" style="s2">interesting is the contrast to online</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.250" end="00:46:04.010" style="s2">teaching where that&#39;s normally meant</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.500" end="00:46:06.290" style="s2">like online lecturing so pretty clearly</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.010" end="00:46:08.660" style="s2">the evidence shows that if you go to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.290" end="00:46:11.000" style="s2">like an online university you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.660" end="00:46:14.090" style="s2">as good an education as if you do it in</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.000" end="00:46:16.340" style="s2">person so I don&#39;t have anything to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.090" end="00:46:18.440" style="s2">about that I just want it was a note</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.340" end="00:46:20.630" style="s2">that because I agree with you when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.440" end="00:46:24.280" style="s2">doing this dialogic thing we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.630" end="00:46:27.110" style="s2">find this this virtual stuff enhances</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.280" end="00:46:28.610" style="s2">enhances the process but when we&#39;re into</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.110" end="00:46:30.740" style="s2">sort of the dissemination the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.610" end="00:46:34.550" style="s2">traditional dissemination of information</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.740" end="00:46:37.490" style="s2">in sort of you know a propositional</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.550" end="00:46:39.130" style="s2">largely propositional format you seem to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.490" end="00:46:43.510" style="s2">you seem to find a significant</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.130" end="00:46:45.830" style="s2">degradation in what people get from it</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.510" end="00:46:48.080" style="s2">okay thank you John your hero</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.830" end="00:46:51.560" style="s2">keep it up ho thank you for your</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.080" end="00:46:57.650" style="s2">encouragement yeah so Dan Feldman you</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.560" end="00:47:01.250" style="s2">had a question yes I had a question our</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.650" end="00:47:03.740" style="s2">first first professor fare-bear by Aki</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.250" end="00:47:05.870" style="s2">there Bakke I really enjoyed your series</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.740" end="00:47:08.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of inspired me to create</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.870" end="00:47:08.900" style="s2">my own my own series that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.360" end="00:47:12.380" style="s2">about doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.900" end="00:47:16.750" style="s2">call me done please come join you John</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.380" end="00:47:19.730" style="s2">yes yeah yeah basically just transition</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.750" end="00:47:24.490" style="s2">awakening from the system from systemic</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.730" end="00:47:27.910" style="s2">inertia so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.490" end="00:47:30.249" style="s2">what I&#39;m an American so what can we do</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.910" end="00:47:32.200" style="s2">and and other people in similar</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.249" end="00:47:34.089" style="s2">situations what can we do to ensure that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.200" end="00:47:38.410" style="s2">the ideas and practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.089" end="00:47:40.990" style="s2">selected in response to this Kairos move</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.410" end="00:47:44.470" style="s2">into a wise and regenerative direction</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.990" end="00:47:46.630" style="s2">of reciprocal opening yeah and not into</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.470" end="00:47:48.549" style="s2">an ignorant and extractive direction a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.630" end="00:47:50.710" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.549" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">fact that the techno managerial elites</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.710" end="00:47:54.869" style="s2">and power are coming forward with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:59.619" style="s2">doubling down of further privatization</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.869" end="00:48:01.240" style="s2">austerity yeah and because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.619" end="00:48:03.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a bailing out they&#39;re moving to</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.240" end="00:48:08.200" style="s2">a bailing out of the corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.670" end="00:48:11.289" style="s2">not to some kind of ubi or or to helping</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.200" end="00:48:15.069" style="s2">out the spreading precariat and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.289" end="00:48:17.049" style="s2">small businesses and such yeah sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.069" end="00:48:19.749" style="s2">just I&#39;m just yeah I&#39;m just like yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.049" end="00:48:21.279" style="s2">everything you&#39;re saying and I this a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.749" end="00:48:24.279" style="s2">similar thing came up in the rebel</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.279" end="00:48:26.230" style="s2">wisdom thing it came up in a really</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.279" end="00:48:27.730" style="s2">interesting way because I was posed a</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.230" end="00:48:29.499" style="s2">question and it was an honest question</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.730" end="00:48:33.279" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t somebody being manipulative or</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.499" end="00:48:37.059" style="s2">anything and they basically said well</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.279" end="00:48:39.430" style="s2">you know who&#39;s approached you have you</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.059" end="00:48:43.809" style="s2">been approached by any of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.430" end="00:48:44.890" style="s2">the power holders about any of it you</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.809" end="00:48:48.339" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.890" end="00:48:50.499" style="s2">and I thought about it and I thought no</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.339" end="00:48:52.210" style="s2">not a single one I&#39;ve not been</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.499" end="00:48:54.430" style="s2">approached by any of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.210" end="00:48:56.230" style="s2">will power I&#39;m not saying that the Prime</p>

<p begin="00:49:01.690" end="00:49:04.749" style="s2">lots of other people approached well</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.430" end="00:49:08.200" style="s2">here we are here&#39;s your answer</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.749" end="00:49:09.910" style="s2">like I I am busier now than I was when I</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.200" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">was you know going into work at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.910" end="00:49:13.660" style="s2">University more and more people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">reaching out more more people like so</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.660" end="00:49:19.450" style="s2">the bottom up is Titanic overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:21.910" style="s2">and the fact and this is why I&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.450" end="00:49:23.589" style="s2">about the Kairos right and why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.910" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">worried about the doubling down on this</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.589" end="00:49:29.589" style="s2">pandemic the fact that the powers that</p>

<p begin="00:55:03.030" end="00:55:08.280" style="s2">like Augustine did as the Roman Empire&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.640" end="00:55:10.200" style="s2">is falling he laid the foundations not</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.200" end="00:55:15.360" style="s2">Augustine so please I&#39;m just using this</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.600" end="00:55:16.620" style="s2">as an analogy okay but what they did is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.360" end="00:55:17.910" style="s2">they laid the fact they laid the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.620" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar for an</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.910" end="00:55:22.950" style="s2">entirely different culture and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:24.180" style="s2">stole the culture bottom-up from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.950" end="00:55:25.860" style="s2">imperial system now it didn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.180" end="00:55:28.680" style="s2">imperial system at some point then</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.860" end="00:55:30.870" style="s2">clamped down again but nevertheless we</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.680" end="00:55:32.850" style="s2">shifted to the middle that we shifted</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.969" end="00:56:34.930" style="s2">think Dan was pointing out that - the</p>

<p begin="00:56:39.809" end="00:56:46.449" style="s2">so all right this is my most radical</p>

<p begin="00:56:56.289" end="00:57:00.609" style="s2">culture away from the elites it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.749" end="00:57:03.279" style="s2">now if new elites form they always will</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.609" end="00:57:07.660" style="s2">but the culture changed and it changed</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.279" end="00:57:10.089" style="s2">in an important way and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.660" end="00:57:11.829" style="s2">trying to do right now and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.089" end="00:57:17.019" style="s2">what I see myself doing with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.829" end="00:57:19.359" style="s2">these other people that&#39;s very noble and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.019" end="00:57:21.789" style="s2">you certainly have a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.359" end="00:57:23.949" style="s2">aren&#39;t in those positions I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.789" end="00:57:26.019" style="s2">you&#39;re a mind you&#39;ve sort of grown up in</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.949" end="00:57:27.339" style="s2">the world sort of looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.019" end="00:57:28.869" style="s2">running backwards so it&#39;s hard to even</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.339" end="00:57:32.589" style="s2">imagine that it&#39;s been that way for</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.869" end="00:57:34.150" style="s2">decades prior but this decade certainly</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.589" end="00:57:38.259" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s going there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.150" end="00:57:41.979" style="s2">be some collision between the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.259" end="00:57:47.759" style="s2">fresh traded emerging game be tights and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.979" end="00:57:50.289" style="s2">the sort of entrenched game a leaders</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.759" end="00:57:52.390" style="s2">the whole point about the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.289" end="00:57:55.479" style="s2">about the metaphor is we can&#39;t we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.390" end="00:57:58.689" style="s2">win by playing the game that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.479" end="00:58:00.459" style="s2">so my way of trying to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.689" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">it is to not play their game and to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.459" end="00:58:04.749" style="s2">shift over to in a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:08.170" style="s2">game to shift the culture it&#39;s to steal</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.749" end="00:58:10.269" style="s2">the culture and the way to do that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.170" end="00:58:12.099" style="s2">way we&#39;ve right the only thing I can get</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.269" end="00:58:14.259" style="s2">from history that&#39;s been able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.099" end="00:58:18.910" style="s2">are religion but for reasons that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.259" end="00:58:20.499" style="s2">articulated I don&#39;t want not personally</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.910" end="00:58:22.809" style="s2">I mean in terms of the functionality I</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.499" end="00:58:25.630" style="s2">don&#39;t think the standard model the axial</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.809" end="00:58:26.709" style="s2">age model of religion is going to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.630" end="00:58:30.420" style="s2">what we need in order to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.709" end="00:58:30.420" style="s2">culture as deeply as we need to steal it</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.910" end="00:58:33.530" style="s2">so John do you have time for one more</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.900" end="00:58:37.880" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.530" end="00:58:41.260" style="s2">yes I do Taylor hawk</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.880" end="00:58:41.260" style="s2">would you like to read your question</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.600" end="00:58:48.950" style="s2">yeah thanks I could do that yeah John I</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.790" end="00:58:51.620" style="s2">wanted to check with you I remember you</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.950" end="00:58:53.870" style="s2">talking about in some different contexts</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.620" end="00:58:56.060" style="s2">about like the urgency less sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.870" end="00:58:58.310" style="s2">coming into contact with our meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.060" end="00:59:00.800" style="s2">yep how I&#39;ve seen it is like growing up</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.310" end="00:59:07.190" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering like Gilead will see</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.800" end="00:59:09.560" style="s2">you other way and yeah given the like</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.190" end="00:59:11.180" style="s2">this situation and how quickly it sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.560" end="00:59:13.040" style="s2">of seemed to come up on us obviously</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.180" end="00:59:16.010" style="s2">lots of people were raising the flags</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.040" end="00:59:17.660" style="s2">but it came out as quickly and given</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.010" end="00:59:19.250" style="s2">your having valid suspicions that this</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.660" end="00:59:21.440" style="s2">is not the last time it&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.250" end="00:59:23.330" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.440" end="00:59:26.060" style="s2">develop or grow up even more quickly</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.330" end="00:59:28.100" style="s2">like it seems even more urgent so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.060" end="00:59:30.410" style="s2">we I don&#39;t we can mitigate this chance</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.100" end="00:59:33.110" style="s2">of descending into chaos if you know we</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.410" end="00:59:37.190" style="s2">have a second wave of this in a short</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.110" end="00:59:39.170" style="s2">term I just we we need to we need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.190" end="00:59:40.280" style="s2">well sort of it dovetails with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.170" end="00:59:43.190" style="s2">previous question we need to accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.280" end="00:59:45.320" style="s2">the all the bottom-up and top-down ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.190" end="00:59:49.580" style="s2">in which we&#39;re trying to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.320" end="00:59:52.150" style="s2">culture I mean and you know well - I</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.580" end="00:59:53.990" style="s2">mean the work you&#39;re doing both the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.150" end="00:59:57.110" style="s2">circling work you&#39;re doing and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.990" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">attempts to innovate it in ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.110" end="01:00:00.500" style="s2">know that I&#39;m deeply in concert with</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:06.760" style="s2">about trying to bring back something</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.500" end="01:00:09.800" style="s2">like deal dialectic and via logos and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.760" end="01:00:11.120" style="s2">it&#39;s sorry I I don&#39;t want to look like</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.800" end="01:00:12.920" style="s2">some sort of Marxist learn in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.120" end="01:00:14.780" style="s2">poster or something but we you just need</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.920" end="01:00:16.670" style="s2">to do more right we didn&#39;t we need we we</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.780" end="01:00:18.770" style="s2">just we got it we got to do more we got</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.670" end="01:00:20.810" style="s2">to speed up and we have the virtual</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.770" end="01:00:22.970" style="s2">campfire effect and we have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.810" end="01:00:24.500" style="s2">happening here and we have that many</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.970" end="01:00:27.590" style="s2">more people are willing to call into</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.500" end="01:00:30.650" style="s2">question the previously unquestioned</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.590" end="01:00:32.540" style="s2">authority of common sense and well</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.650" end="01:00:35.300" style="s2">that&#39;s the way we&#39;ve always done it kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.540" end="01:00:39.950" style="s2">of thing and so I mean there is a Kairos</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.300" end="01:00:43.099" style="s2">here I like I said I&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.950" end="01:00:47.269" style="s2">optimistic about it turning you</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.099" end="01:00:49.819" style="s2">now but nevertheless I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.269" end="01:00:51.469" style="s2">going to erode things things are going</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.819" end="01:00:53.539" style="s2">to be reassembled but they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.469" end="01:00:55.459" style="s2">be a much shape year round and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.539" end="01:00:57.890" style="s2">shake that that&#39;s shaking up at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.459" end="01:01:00.190" style="s2">foundations creates more interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.890" end="01:01:03.349" style="s2">more spaces through which we can weave</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.190" end="01:01:07.039" style="s2">this alternative culture that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.349" end="01:01:09.890" style="s2">do so III mean I don&#39;t want to sound</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.039" end="01:01:12.440" style="s2">like boxer an animal farm but you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.890" end="01:01:16.249" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of which we just right</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.440" end="01:01:20.719" style="s2">now we&#39;ve got to do more of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.249" end="01:01:25.969" style="s2">doing and make use of the best of the of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.719" end="01:01:27.499" style="s2">the emerging properties of of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.969" end="01:01:29.690" style="s2">psycho technologies and the cyber</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.499" end="01:01:32.690" style="s2">technologies to try and be force</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.690" end="01:01:34.039" style="s2">multipliers for this I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.690" end="01:01:35.839" style="s2">say anything too profound to your</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.039" end="01:01:38.150" style="s2">question it&#39;s a really good question but</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.839" end="01:01:42.009" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s all I can see to</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.150" end="01:01:45.259" style="s2">say right now yeah keep on truckin more</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.009" end="01:01:47.119" style="s2">accelerate I mean so I mean and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.259" end="01:01:49.579" style="s2">why Jordan John and I are talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.119" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">this sense of faith that&#39;s about leaning</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.579" end="01:01:55.699" style="s2">into the acceleration of change and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:57.199" style="s2">know surfing the wave of uncertainty to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.699" end="01:01:58.789" style="s2">use Andy Clark stern well they used it</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.199" end="01:02:01.549" style="s2">for slightly different purposes right</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.789" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">but you know I used the example from</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.549" end="01:02:08.140" style="s2">Conrad of the captain Alliston who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:11.719" style="s2">ship is been right the ship has been</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.140" end="01:02:13.190" style="s2">swamped and there all those sailors are</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.719" end="01:02:15.529" style="s2">clinging to the side of the ship and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.190" end="01:02:18.049" style="s2">Alliston stands and he watches and he</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.529" end="01:02:21.319" style="s2">waits and he&#39;s he&#39;s watching and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.049" end="01:02:23.599" style="s2">sensing the unfolding of the wind and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.319" end="01:02:25.249" style="s2">the wave and then he goes now and he</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.599" end="01:02:28.789" style="s2">gives three orders and they do this</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.249" end="01:02:30.229" style="s2">stuff and they write the ship that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.789" end="01:02:33.559" style="s2">kind of faith I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.229" end="01:02:36.799" style="s2">I feel touched hearing that thanks John</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.559" end="01:02:44.299" style="s2">thank you tiller also again really good</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.799" end="01:02:46.069" style="s2">to see you missed you so I&#39;ll close in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.299" end="01:02:46.999" style="s2">moment but John is journey closing</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.069" end="01:02:49.579" style="s2">thoughts that you would like to have for</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.999" end="01:02:51.759" style="s2">this digital campfire that we are in</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.579" end="01:02:51.759" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:03:02.320" style="s2">I hope that my pessimism is only will</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.020" end="01:03:05.590" style="s2">only conduce realism and not any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.320" end="01:03:12.550" style="s2">defeatism in people I hope that&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.590" end="01:03:17.590" style="s2">because that was my intent and I I I do</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.550" end="01:03:23.170" style="s2">think that it&#39;s important that we try as</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.590" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">much as possible to not just talk about</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.170" end="01:03:32.020" style="s2">this but exemplify a new way of being to</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:33.580" style="s2">people that these are the function of</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.020" end="01:03:35.800" style="s2">these especially because of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.580" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">virtuality of it is not just what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.800" end="01:03:42.760" style="s2">happening here now but we right and we</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:46.330" style="s2">are also exemplifying a new way of being</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.760" end="01:03:49.180" style="s2">a new kind of as I said culture a</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.330" end="01:03:51.700" style="s2">culture of Awakening and we have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.180" end="01:03:55.710" style="s2">attention to and take seriously that</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.700" end="01:03:59.020" style="s2">responsibility and rule our manner of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.710" end="01:04:00.970" style="s2">discourse is just as important as the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.020" end="01:04:02.830" style="s2">matter of our discourse that&#39;s the final</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.970" end="01:04:06.220" style="s2">thing I would want to say about them mmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.830" end="01:04:07.480" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful so in a moment I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.220" end="01:04:09.760" style="s2">make some announcements of what&#39;s coming</p>
